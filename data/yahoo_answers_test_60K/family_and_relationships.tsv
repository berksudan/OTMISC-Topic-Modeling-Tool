good communication is what does it.  Can you move beyond small talk and say what's really on your mind.  If you start doing this, my expereince is that potentially good friends will respond or shun you.  Then you know who the really good friends are.
I think its cool. I have a pic posted there, my hot score is 97.9. The site is blatantly honest, so be prepared to NOT get offended if someone doesnt find you hot. No. I have not met anyone from the website.
"FInd out exactly what ihe's into and give it to him, no matter how dumb or ""uncool you think it is"" His present should be about him. For example I have been married over 6 years and my husband still loves cartoon superheroes.  I think it's so dumb, but for every holiday I get him toys and things with superheroes, and he loves it. If I buy him something expensive or really nice he's dissapointed. So find out what your guy is into (maybe a sports team, hobby, character, etc) and go with that. If it's what he's intrested in, you can't go wrong no matter what you think of it."
dont beg for love dont beg for money and dont beg for respect.\n\nHave some dignity\n\ncheers
It depends on you that are you right now settled in life sothat you can take a decision to get married,or in a state of stable mind that once you get married you can look after your wife, do you have a stable income.Will you be able to take care of her all these things are there to manage.If you feel you can do all these things then go ahead and get married.
Sure, just be careful.  But you should be careful no matter where you meet someone.  You have just as much of a chance of meeting a serial killer on-line as you do in a bar...  I met my husband online and he isn't a serial killer, at least not that I know of :)
Playing their games will not help you. Like the other person said leave them. Head games are for kids not adults...K
i dont have a problem with that. being friends with your ex is actually healthy.  when a boy-girl relationship ends it doesnt mean that the friendship should die with it.
You should forget them both...A friend is not a true friend, who, by knowing how hard he was on you, still goes ahead- spits in your soul and dates the guy you were so in love with...First of all- it is not nice. It is ugly, humilating and disgusting...Very cruel step done by both your friend and your ex, who, unfortunately did not care much about how you will feel or what will you think if they get into a relationship.\n\nI suggest to forget them both and move on...There are millions of other GOOD people whom you can make friends with...You have to just keep your eyes and heart open. And forget the past- cannot return it back anyway!
Try Craigslist or OKCupid
Get a secure account with ebanned.com and sell, sell, sell!  You can make lots of $$$$$$ for little effort!
Most definitely a Nerdish Woman.\nHot, hot, hot.\nWhen shes a nerd and might wear glasses who needs money?
Depends...Do you love the guy? Have you told him in the past that you always be there for him when he needed you? Well, NOW he needs you...6 months isn't that long, so buck up, Buttercup, write those letters, go visit the boy, and make it very clear that you won't be doing this again...when this sentence is over, he'd better never come back to the place!\nCheck out http://prisontalk.com/forums/\nIt's a terrific support and information group for the loved ones of inmates.
Hon, I have been there several times and I know it hurts. Time is the best healer. First try to get your mind on something else, anything so that your mind isn't on the person. Go to the movie place and browse for a good movie (a comedy is always good), go to the library, or out shopping and browsing.  Just get out and do something...anything to avoid sitting at home and thinking about the person.  Have a good cry, listen to sad love songs and then get out of the house and do some things.  Try spending extra time with friends or your kids(if you have them), or even at work.  You will find as each day goes by the pain fades.  You may still love the person, but when you think of them again it won't hurt anymore as time goes by.
well its your choice its about time you experience true pleasure
Because he can't look at himself in the mirror because he knows he is a big fat failure, so they don't even want to admit to themselves let alone the one person they were supposed to be commited to.
just keep thinking about how nasty the other girls mouth is.  Yuck.. disgust is a quick resopnse.
Its the same reason we check out men. Honestly, why would you waste your time to look into someone's eyes, if they don't look like what you're into? Looks aren't everything but there has to be a physical attraction...
As a psychologist, staying together for the kids sake is NEVER in their best interest...although as parents we seem to think so. Your children can sense that you are unhappy, even if you think you dont show it. Whats more is, if you have a son, he may get the impression that men dont touch their wives and grow up thinking thats how it is, and then in turn do that to his women. If you have a daughter, she may get the idea that she shouldnt need or want affection and marry someone as such and feel just as you are 20 years from now.\nI suggest talking to him. Telling him you do need affection. If he still wont budge, there is always counceling....but you must let him know you would leave him if thngs dont change. He may actually want out himself.
I'd stay in the batting cage for awhile and practice on getting to second base. Mabey by then you'll figure out what third base is because right now fourth base(homerun) is way out of your league.------------And if you take Chads route even more so!!
yes i depends on the girl but most girls show afection through mockery and showing off and if they talk about u then they like u but if u hear that she tolled her friends that she dose not like u then it is mosty becasue she likes u and she does not want her friends to know so i would noot be worried
That depends on you & what type backstabbing it was. Everyone falls short at times so it really depends on the deed & if in your eyes it is an unforgiveable task. Answer that for yourself first & then seek guidance
If you like her and she and you are both not married, think about asking her out instead of playing a game with her. Good luck
when every body wishing her merry christmus you gift her a marry-some-one-else- this christmus card
In any relationship there is a 2 way interactino of wants, needs, desires, hopes, dreams and likes and dislikes.  We may not project intentionally onto the other person, but because we have our own personal standards, we have to measure them in the same light.\n\nSo, yes, we do project to some extent.
The question is why doesn't your family like her, is it justified. Sometimes we refuse to see things others can because we are blinded by love. I am not a cold person, I am a romantic at heart and I believe that love conquers all but in the same aspect protect YOUR heart in the process by talking with your family about their reasons. And remember they will always be your family, and if their reasons are bogus then marry her because true love is hard to find.
Be confident and be yourself.  Another option is what James Bond movies, he is smooth with the ladies.  Remember that he is always confident with the ladies.  More modern comedy movie, Hitch.  It has a few pointers that are fun and educational.
as much as i dislike liberals, i would date an artist.  an artist has a good mind and creative abilities.  they have an inner talent.\n\na model, well...they look good.  i don't think many are very smart because they've used their looks to get away with many things.\n\nnow, if it was an artist that did modeling on the side, i'd be in like flynn.
I think that there is a positive and a negative way to read this answer.  If you were having a good, romantic conversation; then I would believe her.  True love only continues to grow in a relationship as time passes and you learn more and more about that person.
Social pressure is an issue, but the key is social gradient.  Men need something to give them an “advantage” in the relationship so we know the woman will respect us: we want to be older, richer, more educated…\n\nBlack woman are often perceived as move aggressive or strong and this threatens the social gradient.  Therefore I would guess that White & Asian men avoid dating black woman because they are uncertain that she will respect him.
cus you guys are a handful. you leave everything in a mess, and expect us to pick up the pieces

"it means that you are having problems in your marriage and you live apart for a while, sometimes while you are waiting on a divorce or sometimes, just giving each other a ""cooling off"" period."
I fake occassionally cuz my man is one who will never stop till he feels the job is done and very rarely I have a day where I just don't feel like having an orgasm...it still feels good and I love the intimacy with my hubby, I just don't feel like getting off. And my man will not quit until the job is done.
get to know more about him to where u are comfprtable with him and u really like him like if u find a way to tlk on the phone with him and as u know him more and if he seem nice u can go on from there
Autumn is a beautiful time to get married! I love Indian Summers - (is it still politically correct to say that? I don't want to seem insensitive. ;-)\n\nI would say: (1) a deep, rich wine or plum color or (2) moss green or (3) a beautiful earthenly champagne color. Have you ever seen the pictures of Cindy Crawford in a champagne-colored dress when she was a bridesmaid/attendant for one of her model friends? That is the color I am thinking of and it was stunning! I hope you know what I mean. It was in People Magazine a few years ago.\n\nLast year, I attended a late fall wedding in Sicily, Italy. The reception was held in a castle. The attendants had shimmery gold, rustic brown and forest green dresses. Each one was a different color and it was gorgous beyond gorgous. Coupled with the massive wrap-around outdoor terrace, the Greek-syle columns in this place, cashmere walls and paintings worth a small fortune, a luxury yacht moored in the Meditteranean with little blinking strings of light everywhere, right off the grounds....it was like a fairy-tale. I know this is a bit much that most people can afford but I have no idea of your income / means.\n\nHere is another idea that may be hard to envision but someone I know did their entire wedding in black & white. I must admit I thought it was not a good idea - but it was done with class and luxury and was the most beautiful wedding I have ever seen. All the guests agreed. I know the wedding planner of that one if you need some tips!\n\nYou can have a beautiful wedding on any budget. Love is the magical ingredient that makes it all beautiful. Often times, too much emphasis is put on the wedding and not enough on the marriage. Congratulations and best wishes on entering this exciting phase of your life! Good luck!
There is no specific age at which you start dating others. The time to start is when you are ready; (in other words) when you can feel comfortable being all alone with a person of the opposite sex and know that you could take care of yourself if something were to start going wrong (ie, they want you to have sex, you don't...you have decided it's time to end the date and you want to go home, but they don't want you to, etc). And, of course, it always helps to have someone nice to start dating :)
Guys respect gals who speak their minds. Although this type of girl might seem like a threat, she actually is a challenge and more interesting to be with. However, if the gal is speaking her mind in a negative and critical way it may not be so cool. It is generally the gals who respect themselves who do speak up and let the chips fall where they may.
tell her that she is your new years resolution and that everytime you look at her that it's a new day(year) and that keeping your love strong is all you will ever do for her unless she wants otherwise!
This is a complex question with no one simple answer. But it general it comes down to boundaries. For some people, infidelity is a strong boundary that they will not tolerate being violated. It can also shatter trust beyond repair. But other people are willing to give their partner a chance to earn back their trust. Still others stay married for religious or financial reasons, and some have self-esteem issues and don't believe they are worthy of a partner who doesn't cheat on them. There are more possibilities, but these are a few of the common ones.\nDr. Barb Nefer, www.bnlifeskills.com
Yeah, keep your mouth shut and leave this situation.  You have nothing to defend.
True love is when your with someone and you enjoy being with them and when your away from them you want to be with them and you miss them. I found true love and I hate being away from him. When I'm at work I think about him and I wish I could be with him. When I get off of work I hurry home to pick up my kids and then go over his house to relax and enjoy his company.
If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life marry an ugly person, I mean fugly, that way you know for a fact that they will never cheat on you.
for a bad name is a b_tch that's a female dog name.\n\nfor a good name is foxy, that make a person feel sexy.
well let me tell u im the same way with my husband, i hate to make the first move ... dont know why but i think its just us womans.... it just dont feel right i guess, i cant explain it, but just go on and keep on making moves
listen i say at the age of 16 to 17, yeah twenty is a good age to lose it, but u want to have some experience at that age, if your 17, 0r 16, u can experience a little more about sex before your legel, get me, that way when you meet a 20 year ago guy or girl,or above that age ,you wont feel so unconftable becuase that some one has more experience then u, but if thats the case turn it around and have that someone teach u the ropes, and if u find that some one in your shoes that u like or love losing your virginity will be the moment you'll never forget, so good luck and have fun,oh yeah be safe about it, cap it before u tap it, peace, da izy man is out
LoL, What would be wrong with that? I know (and have dated) Plenty of Persian(Iranian) women. I know (and Hang out with) Dozens of Persian guys they're some of the best people I could ever known in my entire life. Obviously, there are some people that view all Middle Eastern (and Muslim) people as being evil, but that's an ignorance that they'll have to get over.
i say go he's letting you know that its over read between the lines you will see it to.
juss be urself dont try to be someone or somtin u aint and like her for more than juss looks and dont be afaid to talk or hang around her wit out being a jerk
because he doesn' t want to spend the moneyon someone other than himself or he's not ready for marriage
Did you get off to it?\n\nDid you tell her to stop, is this why she is your ex?\n\nDid your put anything smelly in her face?
keep touching.. theres nothing wrong with it as long as the people that you are touching are okay with it.
Yes and No!!! The reason i say yes is because there's a reason why your bf is suspicious and if ur male friendships call,text or wanna spend time with you all the time and you have some of your friends catching feelings(rather its mutual or not)thats not fair. 'specially if he trying to ge to know you and you him to go on a higher level. Also, if he has female friends calling him all the time and he spending time and minutes on his celly with them overwhelmingly will it be ok with you? I say NO because i do feel that friends are going to be there in the event you ahve a break up or need someone totalk to about guys or something. REALLY though.. a true friend can relize that youtrying to grow something strong with ur new lover and he should have a enough respect to give u the space the bf deserves and the friend wont feel abandon from you. but if your male friends start fallin for you and you dont feel the same about him you should keep him at a distance in the event he starts hating on the bf if he hears or told something he dosn't like about the new man, and Thats REAL
"You're not engaged (yet)...so there's really no reason to worry (as of yet).  Once you are, you ask who YOU want and obviously you don't ask this friend.  If she's hurt and disappears from your life over it, she is not a REAL/TRUE friend.  I know what this is like as I am engaged and I watched a friend have to have 2 maids of honor because her cousin believed she was THE maid of honor the way your friend believes she is going to be a bridesmaid and my friend was miserable on her wedding day because of it!  That is the other part to consider, IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR DAY, ALL ABOUT Y-O-U...it's just about the only day in your life when it will be ""OK"" to be as selfish and/or self-absorbed as you possibly want..within clear reason of course...after all, half the day will belong to your fiance, too! ;)  Seriously, if you don't want her in, don't ask her.  If she still persists, tell her again bluntly...if that doesn't work I really don't know any other nice way to put it.  She can go on in her dream world...but without you telling her which dress, color and other need-to-know details surrounding bridesmaid-land, she'll never be able to pull off her own fantasy.  Hope this helps."
Realistically it's up to you. Luckily the girls get the say in the relationship and kind of give the 'go' signal whenever they are ready. Whether it's making out, sex, whatever, you need to make sure that you're ready and emotionally mature enough to deal with the consequences. Also, sex is like Pandora's box. Once you start having it, you won't be stopping, in this relationship or otherwise. Do what's best for you. Be safe! ;)
There's one thing that ALWAYS gets me... that pair of dimples in the small of a woman's back.  WOW.\n\nAside from the physical, I think self-confidence is the most attractive quality a woman can have.  It really affects how she carries herself.  And a woman who moves well will ALWAYS attract attention.
18 is the legal limit. Beyond that, it's freakin' nobody's business! And if you are dating anyone significantly younger or older than you, and some little twerp the mall makes a smartass remark, bust him one in the chops, because he's the one stepping outside the bounds, not you.\n\nIn case you are wondering, there is nothing wrong with dating someone who is noticeably outside your age range as long as it's above the legal age.
You cant force love..but maybe you can get them to like you..Find out their intrest and hobbies and get to know them on that level first..then really see if you still like them!
Confront him.  Healthy relationships are based on communication, and if you aren't happy with his behavior, he should know.  His answers will tell you all you need to know.
well it depends, especially for me.  Some boi who is very ugly can probably sweep me off my feet, with his personality. I like those down to earth boys,big flirt (especially if they like me they'll tell it im their actions)by flirting.  Someone whose not scared to cry. Has to have a body! Cant be 5'6 or shorter(cause that's short) Nice smile, when I look into his eyes I feel something. When you look into a girls' eyes and would love to stay there then at that time, that moment you like her, and if she's staring the same way back at you she likes you.  Remember any guy can sweep any girl off her feet- he just needs the right broom. My work here is done, toodles!
They are cute, have no wrinkles, no kids, etc.
Can't you still do the same basic thing with Messenger?
if your not attractive on the outside, be attractive on the inside.  he might notice you then.  if your serious about this and he's not noticing you try getting in shape.  also you might want to get to know him as a friend.   If you as a fat ugly woman just walk up to him and tell him how you feel he's gonna be wierded out.  you need to make an effort in your own life before trying to include yourself in someone elses life.
Being your true self. :) People are attracted to others they find comfort and interest in. If you are true to yourself and to the people you meet, you can have the most amazing relationship ever with someone. Nothing beats waking next to that person knowing you can be you, no pretense, and he'll still love you no matter what. So to find that true love......you have to be you. And you'll be amazed at how easily you meet someone doing the things you love to do. Good luck.......Its out there!!
yahoo personals, aol people match, plenty of fish....there are plently of women out there willing to have this kind of relationship...but be careful!
slowly come on to him
She should wait until she's at least 18 to make such a life changing decision.  They really could be in love, I believe that.  But she needs to think of her future before tying herself down at such a young age.  And if he really loves her, he'll give her the freedom to do that.
let her know that ur waiting for her and if she shows interest in u than wait for her and i'm sure u'll be good to go .. but... if she doesn't than.. ur just gonna have to move on.. i hope it goes well for yah
When you start doing things you can't explain.
that is wrong because i think that in seducing someone and having sex can make someone think you like them then they will begin to like you and you dont want to break a good friends heart now do you?
talking to her, explaining things, why everything is wrong now, and well wish her the best, and NEVER use the phrase * Its not you, its me* because we really do hate that. Be compleatly honest with your feelings.
Tell him the truth. he's your best friend, he would understand. Just letting him do what he wants may make him think that you like them too.
wow,\nThis world still is prejudice, although people say we've broken the barriers. Everyday I see people being descriminated at school,at work, in the grocery stores.I am hispanic,but my skin is dark like an African-American. People can't see past the color of your skin, and I live through that everyday. They demolished the segregation laws many years ago,but people still continue to be racist and prejudice by themselves. \n No matter where one is at segregation, and racism will be there, so stay strong. Know that u have a friend in the U.S.
You need to get very aroused and stimulated before even trying to get it in. I assume you would be well lubricated, but you can try a lubricant as well to make the whole thing easier. when you are ready, try first feeling his head around your vagina... then get him to insert just the head and get confortable there.... as soon as you get more confortable, ask him to slide it in a little more... then a little more... at some point your himen will break, but from them on you are going to enjoy the experience...
GO TO ONLINE AND SHOP. BUT A NICE OUTFIT WITH JEANS AND SHIRT IS NICE.
"I strongly believe that his ""ugliness"" is more related with the change of behaviour towards you or others than it is related with physical appearance.\n\nIn any case, if you are ""not attracted anymore"" it is usually because of that you can't see the person you firstly loved. I think you just started to know him better, or that he's going through some big changes related to his character.\n\nCouples who love each other usually doesn't care much appearance."
"Yes, it is bad... this is a ""no-win"" situation and can only lead to pain, maybe JUST for you, maybe for you, him, his wife, his kids,their circle of friends, his parents/siblings, her parents/siblings, and everyone else involved with them as a family. Run, don't walk and don't look back... It will hurt like major surgery, but it will save more heartbreak down the road."
"Well, try EVERYTHING. We think differently, approach problems differently, have different priorities, deal with our emotions differently. Biology is a major factor in our differences - not just what we look like, but the levels of estrogen and testosterone and the way they affect our behavior. Some of our differences are caused by the influence of society.\n\nThe important thing is to realize that it's GOOD that we're different. We complement each other. Problems occur when we don't make the effort to understand and accept the other group. Just because ""they"" don't act like ""we"" do, doesn't make either side wrong."
Tell him that you are tasken and youre in love with yo boyfriend. Maybe you can find someone to take him off your hands.
Go to mapquest, there is a section that allows you to enter a person's name, age and city, and the web will find her for you.
Usually a few months to get back to virgin tight.  Kegel excercises may be a huge benfit though in which she can tighten herself up almost at will.
There is a lotion called calomine I think for poison ivy. and take some anti-histamines. 5 quarts of oil in the olds. Open the oil fill cap, remove the drain plug on bottom of oil pan, let oil drain completely, remove oil filter, fill new filter with clean oil, put oil plug and filter in, fill with 4 quarts, run engine 5 minutes at idle, turn off, check oil and fill to full line. Oil and filter should not cost more than $14 at Advance or Auto Zone.
there has never been any sweet sexy girls in Ft. Worth. They are all ugly dumb b*tches. If I was you I'd go look for the sweet sexy girls in D-town.
hire a private detective to set him up and find out stuff he does that may be illegal\nblackmail him\nget him fired at work\ngo back to court and make him pay more or get him arrested for not paying\nget a restraining order on him and ask the judge if you are going to just be another statistic of abused and dead wives because he is a mean ex-husband.
Download some songs from Limewire.com and then burn a CD (if you can do that with your computer).  A CD-R is cheap, less than 50 cents.\n\nIf that's too much, then just use a cassette tape and record yourself singing along to some songs you like on the radio.  That's basically free.
I think he is too old for you. He may be a nice man but an age difference of that much means you two probably don't have very much in common. Your friends and his would be too far apart in age too. Those two factors should be taken into consideration. You also said you thought he was was way too old for you. If you go out on a date, he will get the idea that his age doesn't matter and obviously it does, not only to you but your whole family.
I'd say you'd probably get beaten for what I'm about to suggest, but here it goes. You could always go and get counseling like the other girl said and talk to your parents, make sure they understand whats going on. You could try dressing as a girl if that is what you desire, and you could have a relationship with another boy/man. You could also look into a sex change, and no I'm not joking.
men are from mars
Can't hurt to talk to him!
not hard,but very gentle.
Doing things for him.  Massaging his back.  Baking cakes for him. Participating in his hobbies.   Decorating his place.  Fixing him romantic dinners. \nGiving a ear to listen to when he needs to talk.  Going with him to church.
honestly.....\nrealize you're better off without him, he was pulling you down, you're much too good for him,\nit was his fault it didnt work out, or more or less realizing that they're not the one and continue to look for the one who is.
No, you don't need an excuse to cheat. It helps you sometimes mentally but you really don't need one. Alot of the times that I have cheated it was because another women did make me feel better about myself. On the other hand it was just exciting to chase another woman. Sex was different and exciting for a short time then I moved on to someone else. So to answer you question....No.
"The ""girl""  (Gwen/Eddie Araujo) you are refering to was not a transsexual, but a transgender person who presented as a female.  She/he was not on female hormones, and as a result, had no female secondary sexual characteristics (female breasts, softer skin female-pattern body hair, female body-fat distribution).  She/he was a boy who eiether liked dressing like a girl, or possibly couldn't afford hormone replacemant therapy.  And no, being with a transsexual woman doesn't make you gay.  By definition a gay guy is a male who enjoys sexual relations with a male who looks, dresses, and acts like a male.  You may be classified as ""Queer"" in many circles, but you are definately not gay."
You answered your own question.  Just be honest and tell the truth.  If you are not ready say so.  If he is mature and respects that he will understand.  Good Luck!
well how about joiing the army, get stationed there and hang around the german clubs? otherwise try the german version of yahoo personals
talk to him. Maybe suggest a casual, group like date at first and go from there. Or if you are braver, try asking him to a more casual date, like maybe out for lunch, or coffee. Make it seem like you just want to chill and talk, nothing too overwhelming yet.
BREAk up wITH UR BF, AND GET TO KNOW THE CUTE ONE!!       THEN ASK HIM OUT IF HES SINGLE!!!

No way, Jade. You'd want to know AND you'd probably appreciate it. especially if it came with some communication.
An annulment is a judicial pronouncement declaring a marriage invalid.\n\nA divorce is the termination of a marriage by legal action, requiring a petition or complaint for divorce (or dissolution in some states, including California) by one party.

give it time. eventually you two will become more comfortable around each other. as you become more familiar with each other, your encounters will become less awkward. just be patient with yourself and with her, and if your really love one another it will work itself out. try spending time in less public places if that makes you uncomfortable. try to find the setting that both of your are comfortable in and then just let things happen at a relaxed pace. ya'll will be fine. don't give up. seems you already have one important thing in common. good luck!
Well, i think you should take it slowly but when the time is right tell him how u feel
Chances are he just wants to mess with you again. Trust your gut, chances are if you are asking this question, you know that he'll probably treat you the same as he did the first time. Life is hard enough without causing our own problems. Be strong sister...let him go.
"It's a sensitive subject, but I say ask.  Being Maid of Honor isn't some achievement of a lifetime, but it is important.  There are things that the Maid of Honor normally helps take care of (bridal shower, bachelorette parties, random errands, etc.)  You don't want her thinking you are her Maid of Honor, but you're not planning certain things because you're not sure.  And just say that. ""I need to know so I can get started.  If not, that's ok, but I want to be clear.""  I know, I had a similar problem when my husband proposed.  One of my friends thought she was going to be MOH and when I didn't say that, she asked me.  I answered, crisis averted, and she still danced at my wedding."
First of all, I am really glad that you see it as a problem. I am proud of you. I was also curious why you are wanting to practice abstinence until you get married. I know that I also am living that way, because the Bible commands it from me, but I just wanted to know your reasoning behind it. \n\nI do know that you can't do it alone. You will need help. I think I know who can help you stay away from this temptation. Jesus can take away even the desire to look at these things. He can help you get through this. I'm not sure how else to explain it, but, if you would like, you can talk to me and I will explain it further. (My email address is on my profile page thingy)
Ricky Martin
"Try looking at the ""inside"" of a person for once and not their looks."
Go with the one you care about most.  If you don't have real strong feelings for either, don't lead them on.  Be honest with them.
"I'm sure my parents think they have some better ideas of people for me! :)\n\nThose countries where majority of marriages are by choice of the couple have the most broken relationships and lonely people wandering around.\n\nJust thought I'd bring up the other side, stir things up a bit!\n\n\n\nFrom the film ""Bride & Prejudice"":\n\nDarcy: The groom looks pretty happy. Did his parents force him into it?\n  \nLalita: No, he asked his parents to find him a bride, actually. He was busy running his company. He just wanted it to be simple.\n\nDarcy: I see, and so he came here.\n\nLalita: Is that what you think, too, that India is the place to go for a simple woman?\n\nDarcy: No, that's not what I meant.\n                   \nLalita: Americans think they've got the answers for everything, including marriage.\nPretty arrogant, considering they've got\nthe highest divorce rate in the world!"
Only you would know for sure.  Maybe you didn't love him.
guys really like independent girls.  especially if they're going to marry her because they will know that she can hold her own if they ever split for any reason.
Who said so? I don't think so dude ...The older guys are in a very good fashion for the girls but ...It's important understand what they are and the most important thing ...what we've got!
Looks are not everything please remember that. Some of the best looking people can be shallow. Find some one that will treat you right. The looks will follow afterwards. What I mean by that is that when you find some one that you like then it won't matter what he looks like because he will be the best to you.
From advice I've gotten from older friends, it's always much better to go out with somebody you're already friends with, than a person you just like superficially. (I think I spelled that wrong, oh well).  Well, what makes you think you'll never get to go out together, did he/she acutally tell you that?  Worst-case scenario, he/she'll introduce you to another friend of his/her, and you'll go with him/her.\nJust think that boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but you'll always have you friends by your side to help you when you break-up with them.
"Silly me... I've tried that and failed... I guess my lightbulb just went off and I've come to this conclusion:\n\nRelationship is a trail to see if you're ment to be together forever.  You should be looking for someone who makes you happy <you need to define happiness 4 yourself> above all else...if it doesn't work out, then you can only look at the way you behaved, and try to make yourself better; DO NOT BEAT YOURSELF UP IN THIS PROCESS!!! You should be look for happiness alone if this is where you take yourself.\n\nMy friend just broke up with her feionce <SP??? Future husband>, and he won't take her dog... Now, she's moved into a tiny apartment <from a house> and she's got this massive dog.  She loves this dog, and it gives her happy feelings about the past relationship...however, she is consumed by guilt for keeping the doggie in a small space.  Concequently, she's always yelling at the doggie because of the guilt.  I realized my cheeting ex was treating me this way...he brought a new girl into his heart, now there wasn't enough room, and I got yelled at because he felt guilty...\n\nI finally got the light and ""Drop kicked him to the curve"".  Yeah, I'm free, and finally away from negitivity, so I'm getting happy again...I still long for the good old days, but recognize, they're in the past."
"You answered your own question when you said, ""and he's married.""  Honey, it just doesn't make sense.  He's your boss and he's holding all the cards.  Why do you think there are sexual harrassment laws?  Because the emotional factors will make a mess of the employment factors if you let them, and I can't imagine any good coming out of the very idea.\n\nThe problem may be your concept of ""being in love.""  Do you think this is something purely emotional, uncontrollable?  It's not.  If you decide you can't afford to love someone, that there's no realistic prospect for happiness in it, you can refuse to give in to love.  You can like, admire, admit you think he's attractive, all that; but love is something you have to be able to control, to decide.  And deciding to love your married boss is the height of stupidity, in my estimation."
If you've got kids... it's cheaper to keep her... otherwise... yeah.. leave her
You will have sex when the time comes. Dont rush it you will be so thankfull for that.
I like and agree with DrRay's answer.\n\nI'd like to add:\n\nYou have to realize and learn......you cannot control the actions, feelings, and thoughts of someone else.\n\nThey think about and assess things in their own way and arrive at their own conclusions. This happens sometimes outside the pattern of behavior within which you know them.\n\nUnder certain conditions or situations where you may be somewhat unfamiliar with their character they may act, or re-act in a foreign way to you. That is a fact about people....all people.\n\nThis is one reason why parents often plead and beg with their kids to get to know someone before; having sex, moving in together, working together, getting married, etc etc.\n\nSo you have a good solid understanding of their actions and feel safe with how they do things. It's not a fail-safe, but it's all you have.\n\nYou have to learn how to hone your instincts and trust in other people. People predate upon one another. It's a shame, but it happens.\n\nSo, you can say then that your friend wasn't *really* a friend. That you chose to allow them to be in the role of your friend, and that you did so too quickly without taking enough time to really know them.\n\nConniving people will ingratiate themselves to you for many reasons.\n\nThese are lessons in life that one can never master. No matter what age, we make mistakes, but the key is to learn and become wise, not bitter or vengeful.\n\nSorry this happened to you, but learn from it and move on. Find and cultivate a new friend.\n\n:)
I'm not attic cat but we can be friends! E-mail me at lonestarluver4ever@yahoo.com
every person is different, and thats soo cool, a lot of guys will tell you your smile is the best and others will say your eyes, most of the people will agree that how you are inside its what matters the most, why would someone go out with the most beautiful girl in the world if she is mean and shallow and all the bad things in the world, i would rather go out with one thats not a model but has a great heart and makes me laugh.
tell her what u just said and be as honest as u possibly can. if she loves u she will believe u.
true, but take everything with a grain of salt, she just may be friendly. If u have that mindset and act that she's being friendly way. Cause then u will keep the ball in ur court and act like u really want some coffee and then you have her
because they like to. it feels good.
I'm sure there are.  To find them, participate in a hobby you are interested in.\n\nYou want someone that likes similar things...be it horseback riding, watching football, or whatever.\n\nGood luck!
Bartender.  They are more visible.
most likely... just say hi and like start being friends with him
It seems that this guy loves you alot, more than anything like you are the most important person to the world, He would say you are the girl of his dreams, the one he would want to marry you, sometimes to a guy when he hooks up with a woman he feels more positive about himself and his life love has that kind of affect on relationships, i would say the reason is because he is blinded in love for you make him feel great, and he doesnt want to loose that feeling, and he probbalys is insecure of himself thinking that if he lost you, his postivenes the greatness of love that he is recieving from you will be destroyed so his ego is raised up to a solution which is to doubt you on ur relationship with him. when he ask you that he is answering his greatest fear it is reassuring him, you should try to get him to realize that your love for him is never ending for him and that you feel the same way for him, dont let his insecurity of his feeling in the relationship get you down  instead help him reassure himself in other ways by finding other activitys to help him get reassured of the love and positivness in both of your lifes and continue and i bet you that he will stop accusing you more remember it is his insecurity that he does it find a way to make him secure in that area and your problem will be solved.
Tread carefully because your job is first. It sux when your deal goes sour and you live with it. Factors to consider if negative outcome: job expendability, gossip, future promotions, reputation, future relationships. If positive outcome: flirting in office, repetitiousness, jealousy, handling discussions, gossip, reputation.\nTo start: find any excuse to establish initial rapport. Next time casually mention non-commital coffee place nearby to expand time together. After making sure it can work, start a non-scary offer to do something fun once during non-work hours.
Try ASKING...
he's getting there. I dated one that was only close to thirty and it was going downhill. If you really notice a decrease, and he would like to do something about it, have his doctor hook him up with a testosterone patch/pill/gel and he'll feel like superman again. And the first part of the question? Possibly, but as long as that double standard exists, nobody is talking about it...
just straight out tell her!! i know your thinking what do you know? but i do know from expierience. tell her your feelings before some one else does. if you really like her you will tell her without worrying, if you don't how will you know otherwise?
There isn't one.  That's why they made it.
"Some things to think about:\n1)After the wedding is over, maybe you can coordinate a weekend or an overnight trip where you can take the drive, visit, get the pictures and share with her some of your ideas for a wedding album.  If you want the wedding album to be a total surprise, forfeit the first idea.\n2)If you do decide to take the first idea and you consider that today is January 20th, you realize that you still have alot of time to organize page layout, colors, find some stickers, stamps, markers, ribbons,  etc.  I realize that you will not know everything there is to know about the wedding yet since it hasn't happened, but every wedding clearly has a similar layout.\n\nSome ideas for the wedding album.  Try to get some random things from alot of people who were involved with or attended the wedding.  For example, you might get some pictures from alot of different people and decide which ones would be good for a nice storybook album.  You might want to do a brief page at the beginning of the album that gives a little bit of the couple's background...a picture of their houses as they were growing up, pictures with parents and siblings, senior year pictures, baby/toddler pictures, etc., a lock of hair if it is available.  Dedicate another section for dating-pictures at various events, silly pictures, engagement picture, etc.  Put some pre wedding pictures in there...the girls getting ready with applying makeup, getting hair done, pictures of bride and groom all dressed up with families, etc.  Put a copy of the wedding program in the album.  See if you can get some of the flower petals to put in various sections of the album.  Maybe put another page with ""Couples Favorites"" and include favorite song(s), hangout spots, dating activities, etc.  Last year, I went to a Creative Memories workshop and the consultant was really knowledgable regarding assisting with layout ideas, content ideas, etc.  I have also included the website link for Creative Memories http://www.creativememories.com/ so that you can take a look.  On the website, you will be able to find consultants in your area based on your zip code and there are ideas on how to set up albums.  I'm not suggesting that you order everything that Creative Memories has on their website, but there are alot of really helpful ideas to get you started as well as helpful ideas for making the album durable and long lasting.  Hope you have fun with the wedding and with scrapbooking!! :o)"
Get your digital camera and model for him.
Thats sooo sweet !!! of course you should e-mail him . Why not ? It is so hard to find guys that are  romantic anymore . I say go for it whats the worst that can happen . I do suggest however that if you do not actually know him well that you only meet him in a public place .
Begin with praise and honest appreciation. THen be frank and tell him the truth. Then let him save his face. Give him a fine reputation to live up to.
Ask him if he likes you. If you're a shy person, you could get a friend of yours, most likely a guy, to ask him for you.
Don't just end it!  You have a kid!  You should be mature enough to talk through this and have a dicussion with your future husband.  If he can't handle a serious conversation then maybe you do need someone that is ready for a serious relationship and ready to grow beyond the age of 19.
Often the person who is in love will be willing to give up his/her happiness in order to make the other person happy. Take for instance the loving relationship between husband adn wives when it comes to time management. When the wife sees that her husband is depressed, she would be willing to give up her precious time (which could have been used for laundry, spas, cleaning, etc) to give comfort to him. Atleast, that is what ought to happen.
Get your education, if it's meant to be then it's meant to be, but don't put your education at risk,\n     Knowledge is a survival skill.
bridesmaids !
It's not the size of the ship but the motion of the ocean...I know corny but size isn't everything.  I have had partners that were small but were amazing in bed.  If sex is just about penetration to you then you need more practice.  Pleasing your girl is more about the foreplay than just sticking it in.  You should concetrate more on touching her with your hands and lips first.  Explore her with your hands and fingers before you go for it.  If you still feel like she isn't being pleased, ask.  If you are having sex, you should be able to talk about it with her.  Ask her what she likes.
you cant trust someone you are chatting with
when chat with her alot and know and like her very mach you will love her ,\nI have seen many people who loved each ather and get marriage from a chat .
romantic- 20 years\nfriends- 36 years
You first in some way need to let the girl know that your interested in her. Try being just a little outspoken. No one wants to talk to someone that has nothing to talk about, so you might need to come out of your shell a bit. If she knows your interested in her she will show it in some way or form. Do some nice things for her. After that, if she pays you no attention she probably just is not interested.
Yes
If the guy likes you he'll go out of his way to be around you and talk to you.
i personally would like to have a baby and a family or start one at the age of 30. i know a lady that is pregnant now and she is 45! i guess it depends on what you are comfortable with. enjoy life while you can..don't rush just because you feel like its the acceptable thing to do.
To be honest, your gonna have to be real with yourself. Only you know why you love the both of them. Don't leave one if you feel that your heart is with the one your leaving. You were with him for 11 years, it really doesn't matter if it was off and on it obviously had a meaning to it b/c you still love him after all of that time spent together. You need to sit back alone and figure out what both of them bring to the table. Think about everything that the guy you were with for 11 yrs. gave you. Remember nothin powers over understanding and happiness. If he doesn't make you happy inside & out and show you that he actually understands you regaurdless of the situation btwn you 2. Then maybe you were supposed to fall for the next guy, think about why you both were together for 11yrs. and you are just now thinking of marraige. Where there problems, issues, anything that stopped the both of you from growing. Only you know the answer to those questions. Just remember that your destined to be happy and explore a new and exciting life when you actually get married to someone. Make sure that whoever you choose deserves to share that happiness with you. Good Luck!!! I really hope that you get through this, but I think you will!!!\n\nEmail me at sweetfantasie85@yahoo.com (when you do make your decision)or just to talk EVERYONE needs a friend...... I'd love to know what happened anyway. Good Luck Again!!!!!!
First thing I usually notice is a guy's eyes then immediately after would be his smile. Clothes or shoes, unless it's something really extreme (extremely dirty, flashy and bright, etc) I usually don't take much notice to. As of hands, I would eventually notice them, but not till after I've talked to him for a bit.
"All I have to say about that is the way to get a man to NOT love you is to look for a ""weakness"" to exploit.  Just be yourself."
"tell him what is going on...all the mundane, boring details! Instead of saying ""not much"" say that you just got slammed with a huge project at work, or that your mom keeps picking fights with you, or that your neighbors got a dog that barks till all hours of the night...if he senses that you are being open with the little details like that, then he'll be more likely to believe you when you say that nothing much is new (romantically, i assume?)."
i think you should get a plane ticket and go see him!!! i've had a bunch of long distance relationships, and it was hard not  to see them, if you guys love eachother after two years...then save up and go for it!
they aren't complicated at all... self centered is the proper terminology
Feb,14 duh
my best friend (female) and I have sex all the time, and I living with someone else (Girl friend)...best friend with benefits. Is it because he's just needs a release or is he really in love with you? Are you turned on and would want sex (not Love) with him? then go for it...
ur friends u will eventually let go because u want the best for him its ok to feel something just continue down the road of life good luck
No I don't think so! It is not right in Gods eyes!
In my opinion, if you love somebody, you don't expect for anything in return. Valentines day is a special day to show somebedy we love them so whether they have a present for us or not we should just be happy that they are there to share their love with us and make us feel happy that we are capable of loving. So basically I don't expect anything. I'll just be happy that the love in our hearts for each other remains.
One thing that connects us the most is our appreciation for humor. Able to laugh at our mistakes and knowing when to laugh ,when to cry,when to be serious.
Let him know how much you care about him often
go to your local bar by yourself, get a drink and start cryn about how you got dumped last valentines day and im sure someone will come to your aid
no i love it when my men call me a freak because i know im doing it right my momma told me as well as men that a man wants a lady in the streets but a freak in the bed so i will be his freak so he wont have to go anywhere else he gets everything he needs from me so i say be a freak and enjoy he does
You know, i have passed on a net-love too, so if with a long time like that, i think that at least she got good relationship with her, so try to connect her by all mean.... And i think if you really care, really love, maybe God won't let you disappointed, try to go to her heart by a real feeling....
You should research other people that have problem with porn such as Kanye West and Kirk Franklin. See how they dealt with this addiction and what helped them through that time.
Every period is different but using the textbook number of 28 means your ovulation should occur around the 14th day after your period begins. Again, this date varies depending on the length of your cycle. Male sperm can live up to 5 days so making love between the 8th day and the 20th day holds the most risk. Overall, there is a 30% chance of pregnancy every time.
You don't want to leave everything for nothing. So before doing anything crazy you should probably let the person you love come to you or at least drop a hint of interest for you to decide if it's worth leaving everything for. Once that hint is dropped and you know the feelings are mutural then you should go ahead and take those chances. Good luck!
good luck dude keep trying  check rent.com
It depends on what type of woman you are. You  could be a screamer or a moaner. But to tell the truth be yourself and be physical. Kiss him alot while having sex, rub your hands all over his body where you can reach. Let your emotions take over and show. There are some woman that like to talk to their men while having sex. Experiment. Take control once in awhile and let him lay back and enjoy while you let all your passion run free. Well I hope I helped a little bit. Have fun.
Because a Man would like the best of both worlds..have two instead of one....Men are living in denial...they hate to admit when they are wrong and it's too hard for them to tell the truth!

Legally 18 is not too young but I would wait until you are older. You will miss out on so much in life and life experiences if you marry so young. If it is meant to be, then you can still marry the person in 5 years or so.
Doesn't sound too good. Talk to him. If he is reluctant to answer you, then you need to tell him that. Explain what is bothering you so that it doesn't seem that you are getting upset over nothing. You have a reason to question what is going on becauseof the fact that he has slept with her in the past. He would be suspicious too if the roles were switched. If he keeps getting defensive even when you are open about your worries then you need to put your foot down because he shouldn't be keeping things like this a secret from you... Bottom line... he wouldn't be defensive if there was nothing to hide.
"Sex is all about desire. And after you want someone so much, and you love who they are in their entirety, sharing it with the one you love is the best answer. Sex is not just a game, and it is not just a physical thing, there is so much more depth to sex. Sex is 90 percent emotion, 10 percent physical driven. Once you have found the one who you love and cherish, and want to spend the rest of your life with.. you will feel more ""mind blowing"" physical reactions. Sex isn't about the feeling, it's about pleasing your partner, and them saying thank you, by pleasing you back. Making love, is making music with your body. Not just two people all up ons."
When you are comfortable being single.  You can't incorporate someone else's life with yours until you are comfortable with yours.  Really has a lot to do with being ready to give up a lot personally because you love someone else enough to do so.  I approached marriage from a standpoint where I based my expectations on what i would expect my self to do.  If you are ready to do that type of introspection and self analysis have at it my friend it is the best thing you can do!
"The next time she asks to borrow something, say ""We'll see. I'd be more inclined to lend it to you if you returned my (insert borrowed item here)."" Or, you could just be completely up-front with her and say, ""I never mind lending you my things, you just seem to have a problem returning them. Could I ask you why?"""

Not necessarily their father. My father was a jerk and thus not what I want, and guys who act like him or even sound a little like him are a big turn-off. But one of my uncles was my big male role model, and I often find myself with guys a lot like him. The boyfriend I dated the longest even had nearly-identical handwriting...it was kind of funny, really.
First thing I would do is tell her how you've been feeling and then grab her hand so she will feel safe and you seem believable and then in a calm voice look her in the eye and tell her it would be an honor if she would join you for dinner and a movie.
Find women that are into open relationships.  That way everything is fair and honest for everyone.

My wife was thirty-five. she commited to the concept of virginity until marriage when she was a little girl, and amazingly she acomplished exactly that !! Now, if you are going to make a choice in your life you should always look into the pros and cons of an issue, and then make the soundest choice you can based on those researched facts. Be very careful not to allow your emotions to tempt you into something you're not prepared to handle long-term.
http://wiki.ehow.com/Ask-a-Guy-Out\n\nHow to Ask a Guy Out\nGot your eye on a certain cute guy? Well, don't wait--ask him out! If you're shy and don't know how to make this happen, follow these easy steps. \n\n\n\n\nSteps \nMake sure to hang out in places where you know you will see the guy you have a crush on. This could be at the mall, the movies, or maybe at the baseball field if he's an athlete. \nWhen you have the opportunity, talk to him or his friends and find out if he has a girlfriend. \nCommence flirting. This can mean a lot of things, like catching his eye with a glance, touching him lightly on the arm, or laughing at his jokes. Sometimes, you can flirt from afar and entice him to come over to you. \nAsk him what kind of things he likes to do, such as what he likes to eat, if he likes to play sports, or if he's a movie lover. Once you find something you both have in common, ask if he'd like to do it together sometime. \nIf he says no, or seems like he needs more time, don't get too upset; always say you can just be friends if that's what he wants. Chances are, he'll change his mind. Guys do this a lot. \nIf he says yes, then plan where and when you will go out, and don't forget to have fun. \n\n\n\nTips \nOn the day you plan to ask the guy out, make sure to wear an outfit that gives you confidence. This will make you much more comfortable and give you the courage to make your move. \nTry not to be too nervous...guys love being asked out, since they're the ones usually doing all the work in these situations. \nWarnings \nSome girls try to get guys to ask them out by making them jealous or playing hard to get. This can backfire because the guy could give up, or get annoyed by your tactics. The best approach is to be honest and straightforward about your feelings. \nEven if you have asked a guy out, it does not mean you are obligated to do anything you don't want to on the date. If you ever feel uncomfortable, get out of the situation right away.
He's cheating on you if you've noticed him acting strange or suspect around you, arguing for no reason at all, stopped spending as much time with you as he use to, or when he is always busy doing something that he's never done before this problem occured.

Either you pick him up, or have him pick you up. Ask questions like you really don't know everything about each other you might discover something new! \n\nOh, this is a good one too, send him sexy or romantic emails at work (if he won't get in trouble), or leave sexy messages on his cell phone voice mail. Also you can put sexy notes or photos in his briefcase, so he finds them when he least expects it. \n\nHave flowers delivered to his office just to say 'I love you"", but not for any special occasion. \n  \nAnd most importantly, especially if you have kids make sure that you go on ""dates"" and make time for each other outside the house. Also make time when you send the kids away and have the house to yourself so you can run around naked all day!! We always would trade weekends with other couples who had kids so we would watch their kids one weekend, and they would watch our one weekend. It’s cool because you don't have to spend money on a sitter (use it for your date instead), and you help out another couple who probably needs a break from the kids as much as you do! \n\nAlso, this is my best passion saving tip I can give you...No matter what every year take a vacation with just your hunny, no kids, no relative house, even if it is only for 1 or 2 nights. Go to an exotic location or just a nice hotel in the city closest to you. This will do more to help you remember why you feel in love and ignite passion in your relationship. No one is too busy or too broke to find 1 night a year to do something really special!! \n\nI want to let you know that if you start to do some of this stuff, let him know you expect to be pampered also and challenge him to surprise you with romance also. Make it a fun game you can both play and you will both come out winners!! \n \nI hope this helps you!"
dude, you do sound like that sex type thing from stp. when they want it they will let you know, they arent going to hide it.
Just say it. If she's not interested she'll let you know and then at least you won't wonder anymore! Life's too short to dance around avoiding what you want to say.
funkdoc is on the mark. But to add to it grab that soldier by the base and squeeze while pushing your sac downward. The fellas naturaly rise up when your about to blow.\n\nAdded bonus! When your squeezing the base you force blood to the head making it larger. Do some probing with that monster til she screams like a porn star then let it rip!
Just ask him if it really makes you upset then why don't you just leave him. There's plenty of other guys out there.
Maybe you could write your feelings to him in a letter. Don't leave anything out - just put all your frustrations down. And give it to him or have a friend give it to him. Then, give him some time and space to figure things out...and see what happens next. I think that's what I would do if I were you...good luck.
yeah...just be yourself.  i like people who are themselves even though others might not like it.\n\nwhat do guys want??  that depends...some guys just want to get a little action.  others just want someone that they like and who is their type of person.  i'd want someone who i like and who likes me and enjoys spending time with me.  someone who cares and doesn't mind if i give them compliments or say sweet things to them.  someone who feels special and realises that i like them for who they are.
You never know what you may get in a person - My husband doesnt pay attention to how much work I put into the house everyday - He just assumes it should be done.  They don't mean any harm in it.  It is just how they work.  Men and Women just work diferently and it is up to us to remind them of the other things in life - believe it or not..thats why they chose us.  You have to compromise.  I may not think that some things are very inportant, but he may think that same thing is invaluable.  I have to adjust to make sure he is happy and HE has to do the same.  If you clean up the house to show him that his beliefs are inportant you may have a better chance of getting the attention that you feel is important.  My compromise was .....bear with me.....that if we had sex more often - on occasion we would get back to making love.  It worked.  I work to make sure his needs are met - in all facets of marriage - in return he works on mine.  It is an endless struggle to make sure everyone is happy -- GOOD LUCK
In the long run it would be worse for your daughter if you stayed in an unhappy marriage.
no. its a self esteem issue. some women see men as points. reel them in,brag to friends,then boost your ego as you boast to your friends how he wont stop calling.not cool but true
smile at her - it may be she is shy - if she has been staring at you and she smiles back, even a half smile, but looks away, it probably is because she's shy, but she's more than likely interested - go for it - talk to her - try to catch her when she's not right by her friends, like going to the restroom or something - she probably will talk to you a lot easier then
Happy actually not only a expression, but happy also good for our health...Happy also a choice, we can either live with better and more happy everyday? or we can choose sad and unhappy that make us look more worst in front of people or bad for our health plus may also effect our emotion too.\n\nso, be happy and start learn to enjoy life with what we have or left...as people that always require too much before they can happy will never become happy people :)
I am .... lol
"It's not much what you say as all the other ""little"" things you must do on the date. Like being on time, maybe greeting her with a quick light peck on the cheek, pulling out her chair, open doors...you know all the ""gentlemanly"" things. As for conversation, keep it light, funny, interesting. And although you may want to start a relationship with her, on your first ""real"" date, you probably shouldn't bring that up as yet. Wait until you've been on at least 3 dates, then broach the subject. By then you'll know if she's also romantically interested in you or if only as a friend."
well if you really like this guy then you should wait for him!! never break up a relationship!!
Nothing wrong with that! I am 7 years my husband's senior! We are very happy and for the most part he looks older than me, until he shaves his beard off then he looks younger but b/c I like beards, he rarely ever shaves it off! Also, my 19 year old son is seeing a 28 year old lass with a child and he seems to be pretty happy with her and her with him.
No, it is definetly not cheating with you ex-crush. I would say go with the one you love best.
No!  Take good care of your pearly whites and that is attractive!
Show him the pictures of you licking the dog's b*tthole
to each's own . No one has the right to judge another person on their sexual orientation within the United States or any where elso for that matter . Only the man upstairs has the eternal right to judge a human for who they are
Don't send the flowers, cards, letters, etc. UNTIL you are positive you both are on the same page.  Otherwise, all of those good intentions can seem VERY smothering.  When you are on the same page, do those nice things but unexpectedly and NOT IN EXCESS!  Good Luck!
first of all i want to say, thank you for your love of the bigger ladies, because i am one, and second off people descriminate because the media discriminates against the larger sizes. the media always portrays the skinny women as hot, successful and powerful on tv and movies, and if you notice those of a larger size are always less successful, less powerful, and made to look dorky...it sucks, but it's nice to see someone stepping up and going public with his appreciation, you're a shining light to all those larger ladies who are looking for a good guy that will love them the way they are! Kudos to you!
Stop and talk with her.\nRelationships are built on communication.
IT'S YOUR CHOICE NOT TO  HATE ONE,  I DISLIKE THEM TO SAY THE LEAST. A PERVERT HAS MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL  PROBLEMS. A PERVERT PUTS OUR KID'S IN DANGER,A PERVERT INVAIDES THE PRIVACY OF OUR CHILDREN AND OUR WOMAN FOR SEXUAL GRATIFICATION . IT'S DOWN LOW DIRTY. WE HAVE NO ROOM FOR SCREWED UP ANIMALS LIKE THIS IN OUR SOCIETY. IF YOU ARE ONE,STAY AWAY FROM MY PATH.
On the roof of a McDonalds during business hours.
yeah tell him how you feel and if he doesn't feel the same way then that frees you up to date other guys and at least that way you have someone to talk to and a guy perspective.
If you have to ask that question then it is not love...... yet.  Don't worry you will know.
Go and spend time at a place you've never been before. You could go camping (weather permitting), or to some town nearby and get a cheap hotel. Just changing scenery eliminates the drudgery and tension, and creates excitement. Excitement begets excitement, if you know what I mean. ;)
Mr. Khan,\n\nYou can read a online book the website link is :http://www.pakservice.com/Media/newspaper_home.htm\non this link you can find the stuff in Urdu named as NOOR CLINC.\nAnd in my opinion you can spent a satisfied marriede life by the acting upon Islamic way of life.\n\nWish you good luck. Please inform me that is my answer help you or not.\n\nBest regards.\nImran\n00966556409985
Of course we do. But we are less likely to act upon those thoughts, then men do(perhaps).  That is why it is called Fantasy.
If you love him with all your heart then that's the best thing you can ever give him. As for love making, you should let him know that your sexual preferences have just become different and he should try to understand.
You need a spelling class. You realize Yahoo has a Personals section, right? yeah, go there.
I don't believe so. Distance won't matter if you have faith with each other. Avoid temptations and that goes to both of you. If you keep exposing yourself to anything that could lead you to cheat on her or vice versa, it is not going to help. Keep the passion while you are away by writing to her everyday, calling her, sending flowers works the best and say you are thinking of her. Surprise visit her when you can, I know I am loving that when my husband surprise visit me although he just worked 10 miles away from home. Do not let any negative thoughts intervene. Be positive!
I think it is because people have a lot of hang ups about sex in the US.  So many people directly associate sex with love and assume you have to be in love with someone to have good sex with them.  Personally, I think that sex is one of the most fun things a person can do and I'm sure most people agree.  I also think that it is very personal and I'm not into sleeping with just anyone.  But I think that sex between 2 (or more) people that get along and have a good time together but are not in love, is perfectly fine.  I also think that it is a natural desire for most people to be want to have sex with more than just the one person you are in love with, especially people who are comfortable with sex.  My boyfriend and I have tried swinging with other couples and we have enjoyed it.  We both trust each other and know that it is just about having fun.  Plus, I feel more confident that my boyfriend isn't going to cheat on me because he has an outlet for his natural feelings to be with other women.  Just my opinion!
Tell him that the way he treats his daughter will have a HUGE effect on her the rest of her life.  She will view all men the way she views her dad, and especially at age 4, she is the most susceptible to learning what men are like and how men and women treat each other.  If he wants her to have healthy, normal relationships when she is grown, he needs to be a good dad for her now!
Depends on what you are trying to accomplish.  If quik meaningless relationships is what you want.  then trampy clothing usually is good.  but love is different, love happens on the whim.  Love is more like something you cant pinpoint.  My wife drives me crazy, and sometimes I havnt a clue why im in love with her.  then other times I dont even question it because its just there.  the presence of love Im refering too.  If a date is what your after, I would have to say confidance.  i love smart woman...so if they are smart...thats a plus.
Maybe you could give him a note and see what he says. Let us all know what he says!
As long as it's not Grandma and the paperboy, what's the harm?
"Are you trying to propose? You know, give her a ring because you want to get married? \n\n1. Ask her parents for her hand in marriage. If she has no parents, then skip this step.\n\n2. Purchase the ring.\n\n3. Set up a romantic atmosphere.\n\n4. Get on one knee and take her left hand in yours.\n\n5. Look into her eyes and give her your heart.\n\n6. Ask her to marry you. Put the ring on the third finger (the one next to the pinky).\n\n7. Wait for her to say, ""yes"" then kiss her gently. If she says, ""no"" calmly ask her why not.\n\nBlessings to you. Hope she says yes..."
It can be. It depends on the maturity age. If lets say a 16 year old is dating a 27 year old...that wouldnt be ok. But maybe a 23 year old dating a 34 year old may be more acceptable. Its definetly up to you and if you feel okay with this person.
Life is not a movie. you say you love him more than your current boyfriend, but I think it's just a case of thinking 'the grass is greener on ther other side'. Maybe you should take time away from men for awhile and focus on your child. Things could end up not working out with the one that came back, and then where will you be? Alone with a baby, and the father of your child will feel very slighted. Don't underestimate the love you have for your boyfriend just because an old flame has shown up and makes you think things could be better...They will most likely be the same.
As a guy I have to say, being bi is hot! Why a bi girl makes my dreams hot. My ex-wife is bi. We had so many wonderful experiences. Nothing like waking up with two naked women in your bed. The thing that was kind of down is when she would play by herself, and left me out. I adjusted though. She ended up leaving because she found a guy online she fell in love with. A guy! wow, didn't see that coming.
show her how u really are never under estimate yourself if u have a good sense of humor show it women like a man whose real and honest not a liar and a fake it's  much easier being yourself because if you pretend to be something else you'll soon forget  who you are!
DEPENDS! IF the guy shes dating is a jerk or wot...if he treats her bad , doesnt respect her or appreciate her...den go for it...but if hses in a loving relationship , man dont touch it...cos wot goes around comes around!
You probably just never thought about it before. there's nothing wrong with being bi. I wouldn't worry too much about it. Just have fun, and be careful.
Boys cheat because theydon't want us girls feel bad when they say it is over and they cheat becauseThey don't want to be in love with an another girl that he know for an long time.
"There are some BBW who are happy with who they are. Others are not.  But you may not be able to do anything yourself to make them change from not being happy to being happy.\n\nI did have one BBW girlfriend in high school who was happy with herself, but it got too serious and, in high school, it just shouldn't be that serious.\n\nAs for those who are not happy with their weight, it's like the old light bulb joke: how many psychiatrists does it take to change -- one, but the bulb has to want to change.\n\nI think some people like to define themselves by what is wrong with themselves rather by what is right with themselves.  They get comfortable in their ""misery"" (I'm too fat, I'm too thin, my hair's straight, it's curly, I can't do this, I don't deserve that, ...)\n\nFrankly, I like women who are voluptuous rather than  not.  Always have.\n\nPoint is that they just have to wake up and smell the coffee and realize what they have in you as a friend or lover.  But, from experience, I don't think there's much you can do to convince them otherwise.  In one relationship, I had to have one foot out the door before they got a clue.\n\nIn some cases, I've known people in relationships with BBW where the woman used her weight as a way of controlling the relationship and limiting the intimacy in the relationship.  And these guys loved these women so much that they couldn't or wouldn't leave.  Why loved these women but, well, to be frank, I don't think these women loved their husbands as much as the husbands loved them.\n\nSo, maybe the thing is not to try and change the women that you meet to make them happy but instead determine if you can live with them as happy (or unhappy) as they are.  It is possible that people can change, but they have to want to change.  And sometimes the only thing that can jolt someone into change is to not to support their habits, but to let them know that you love them but there obsessing is to the point where you aren't sure they're happy being with you and that it is time to move on for your own sake.  It's not a threat, you have to respect yourself and your needs and happiness and they need to respect themselves and you.  Otherwise it can just be a co-dependent mess."
For the wedding cake you can use the flake fish food and stack it, wet it, let it dry, and the serve it to them, however for the honey moon you'll want to go with the pellets that last a few days so that they can be alone on their honeymoon\nCongratulations
Its your decision, sweetheart.  Do what your heart tells you to.
none too young have u ?
"Just be genuine, and a genuine gentleman.  Although many women are independent these days, many of us still like to be treated like princesses: delicate.  So open the door, kiss the hand, and above all respect.  Don't expect ""anything,"" just feel lucky when it happens."
dump him.... he is just bein a weeny.
What color Lollipop am I?
I like the nice shy guy who likes you for you and not what you look like
Nope...
If I were you I'd tell the guy that since his girl doesn't want to watch then maybe it's not such a good idea to proceed with the prior arrangement.  You might even have a one on one with her (talking) to see exactly what the problem is, she's either (A)Just not comfortable watching her man performing with someone else even though she's OK with it, or (B)Doesn't like the fact that he's into that sort of thing (swinging).  Just do whatever you thing/feel might be better for everyone involved.
No, love isnt the urge to merge. the apostle paul wrote the perfect definition of love in 1 Corinthians 13:4-8. Love is the Father sending His Son to die for the sins of the world.
I think it should be something personal and something that will last.  Maybe one special photo framed and then a scrap book or photo album that reflects all the good things that you think about when you think of them.
You can see if he really honest with you through his eyes. If he say something honest, he will make intense eyes contact with you when he say it.
I would if it were anybody but my mom or his mom. He'd have some serious butt kissin' to do if it were someone else!!!
For starters, good personal hygene is a must. Use deoderant and have clean clothes. Being willing to spend money on a woman doesn't hurt either.
smiling alot at you and always touching your shoulder are something always finding a reason to talk to you.
"Get down on one knee, then say, ""Would you Marry Me, PLEASE"""
"if i understand this correctly, you have a ""friend"" who treats you like crap, right? exactly how do your enemies treat you? with friends like her, do you really need enemies? cut your losses and find a new friend. friends respect eachother and protect eachother. they are there for eachother. doesn't sound much like the girl you described, does it? you can do better! you deserve better! that's whats supposed to make our friends different from the rest of the world. they are supposed to always have your back!"
jelwery duh
*Pondering that* Well personally pick up lines seem lame to me.\n\nI prefer if someone is interested me to just simply show it and cut out the dance.\n\nBut that is me...\n\nIf you like someone, tell them so.
Just talked to a lot of gils,all the time and sooner or later you will hit the jackpot,too bad we haven't meet.Go to Nightclubs
I hate to say it but move on.  You do not want him calling the cops on you.  He is obviously not worth your time. Find someone who love and respect you and that you can do the same to.
his respect for women i would not be able to date a disrespectful person, he was very nice and courteous yet had a great sense of humor!!!
Did u mean Angry? Lies, Dishonesty, Bad Body Odour, Bad Mouth, inconsistent behaviour makes a boy angry.
Be honest - tell your friend that you like the same guy
You didn't give enough information.\n\nDid you have sex with a 16 year old boy? Girl? what country? what state?  Different states have different laws on age of consent. In some places, it's as young as 14.  In some, it's as high as 18.  Here in Texas, it's 17, but two people within three years apart can have sex (meaning 16 and 16 is ok legally).\n\nYou didn't say if your question was a legal one or a moral one.  I'm inclined to believe it's OK morally,and likely to be OK legally, but again, depends on where you live.
Ditch the current guy, go back to the ex...
hahaha i like that!! ; ) And not ALL people are like that by the way...There's of us that find our true love & stay with them *hint hint me lol* People just need to learn to be picky about who they love...
No.  Unless you can't afford more expensive food, it just ends up looking like you don't give a s*** about her.
good i have a friend that had a tough home life and she went to live with foster parents they are all much happier now
all races are attractive..it just depends on who we meet and who we fall in love with...race shouldn't have anything to do with who we marry and fall in love with..we are all gods people..just different colors...
Ive never seen anyone go out with someone just for the hell of it unless the person was rich. Are you rich?
"It's never easy to break ties, of any kind. if you can find the strength, you owe it to yourself not date anyone right away after breaking it off with your current beau. This month's National geographic has a great article on the chemistry of love... and love really does mar our ability to think clearly. If, after spending some time ""alone"", this new person still seems attractive, then date him. If you can, please be as clear as possible with this current beau. ""I think you're a very lovable man with great qualities, but I need to be by myself for a while, to not date anyone. It is something I need to do for myself, and I know that you will allow me this time."""
"Talk to your best friend about it.  And you should be very respectable about it to.  Don't just go to him and say ""hey I wanna bone your sister really bad"".  All joking aside, if you guys are close and your a good guy, he will be glad she is with you and not some scum bag."
Attempt to prove that whatever flaws she saw in you before are gone...that you have changed. It may or may not work but at least you can say you tried.
"One of the best ways to find out if someone truly loves you, is to think about if he or she is truly looking out for your best interest; nowadays, love is totally misinterpreted. Look at his actions and what he says and think, ""Are those actions and words motivated by him looking out for me, or for his own interests.""\nHope this helps, ....from a guy's point of view, by the way. As a guy, I know that many...no....the majority of guys are in relationships for there own personal gain.."
We look at you a lot - that's the truth, we like staring at a person we like. Maybe you can try talking to us - if we like you, we'll stare into your eyes as we talk.\n\nBut trust me on this, you can just ask us. We don't bite... =p
Flirting is an easy thing to tell. Especialy in these days where chilvery is not quite as dead as people make it out to be. Amorous words, Or closeness can be a sign, Or If mayhaps you have been around this man for quite some time, he may have a small crush on you. Flirting is diffrent than love itself, so Keep in mind: Flirting cannot allways lead to a long lasting relationship. Depending on your age though, It may be quite difficult to tell the diffrence.
Probably he does love you, but likes to play with the others.  Some times I feel I like another guy besides my boyfriend, but I still love my boyfriend a lot more than anyone.  If you can't live with that, ask him to do it without you notice or leave cause he will never change
Check out the cashiers in Carrefour, you might get lucky.
"You make it sound like it's something arranged or orchestrated.  Who do you think does it?\n\nPeople--all people--fall in love because it happens.  Just because those two people happen to both be men or women doesn't make it any less real.  And it happens because those two people have found a connection between them--a spark.\n\nHomophobia's greatest danger is the unwillingness to believe that gays are capable of real human emotion.  That their ""urges"" are unnatural and strange, and whatever happens between ""them"" is some kind of perversion.\n\nTwo men fall in love with each other because they wanted it to happen or they just couldn't stop it from happening.  You know--just like normal people.\n\nI don't mean to sound harsh or judgemental, but your question suggests that you at least have some preconceived notions about gays.  Why don't you start now by trying not to think of gays as different.  It will give you a whole new perspective on things."
To be honest the only thing that you can do is just show him that you are there for him. Be yourself with him and show him what real love and affection is supposed to feel like. Only do this if you are really planning on being with him for a long time. You wouldn't want him to fall for you and grow attached to you and all of a sudden yu end upi breaking his heart. Right now just be a real good friend to him and tell him how you feel about him from time to time. And remember always keep it real!!! Be truthful about everything!! Being REAL really does count in the end.\nGood Luck to you, and I hope that he gets over his heartbreak soon b/c heartbreak is the worst pain to have. BEEN THERE!!!
Your greatest power is your imagination, don't give that up. You can forget about Lois though,she's hot for me (the real Superman).

be sweet and conciderate and humor helps but dont over do it be your self
I can't say that this was embarrasing, but it surely was a disappointment. I was a newly wed of only 1 month and made a nice romantic dinner with candles and wine in our very small apartment with the thought of afterwards making love on the floor in our living room. After dinner my husband says he has a headache and goes to bed...alone.  I was left there alone, feeling like a complete idiot. Keep in mind we both worked that day, it wasn't like I was home relaxing all day.
Having a friend you can trust takes time.  Share something new each day and see if they can keep it to themselves.  Within a few weeks you will know if you can trust them.
haha join the world lady! ALL in laws who are ego maniacs are a pain in the rump! She has issues obviously. I would not talk to your husband about it for he won't care. Just deal with it with her the best that you can. I was in your situation once and am glad I am not anymore believe me....YET since i am divorced from her son, my x in law puts me down to my daughter so regardless it continues!!! Sucks but gotta live with it divorced or not....
I would tell you that you should get involved in some school activities to meet people.  You think it's hard now, wait until later!  It gets even harder when you're out of school.  I can tell you from personal experience because I was with a guy of 8 years, we moved all around the country, and I lost touch with everyone I knew.  Now I'm back here in my home town and I'm lucky to have been able to hunt down 2 of my old friends.  I'm not with the guy I was with for 8 years anymore and I have no idea how and when I'll meet my next boyfriend because I don't know very many people.  \n\nMoral of the story.. make friends now, make GOOD friends, who are gonna be around for a long time. You have no idea how things will end up with your guy, if things don't work out and you have no friends to get you out of the house you'll be so miserable.  Just remember, it only gets harder as you get older to meet new people.  Do it now.  You'll be a better girlfriend for it, too, because you won't be relying on your guy to entertain you or go do such and such with you all the time.  That was an issue between my ex and I as the years passed, it was really hard on him.  It was hard on me, too.  I went shopping with my friends the other day and I realized how awesome it was to have someone to help me pick out clothes to buy and to run back and forth and grab different sizes for me so I didnt' have to keep going in and out of the dressing room.  Little things.  There are subjects that you just can't talk about w/ your guy, they dont' understand.  It's all about the little things and you will really appreciate having a friend around.  You can never have too many!
im looking for someone too. ive set up accounts on hotornot.com, plentyoffish.com and some more. if you would like me to give you some more site listing IM me at crazed_fem19 or email me.
it destroys the very essence of life, LOVE....

You could try online searches for How To Find A Lost Friend on Google's Website. It comes up with lots of different websites, so i'm sure u could find the person ur looking for.
Pig tails are cute and cuddly. Pony tails are professional and sharp
NEVER TRIED IT, I DONT EVEN REALLY KNOW WHAT IT IS. BUT I SERIOUSLY DOUBT IT'S BETTER THAN A GUY. SO YOU GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT!
Now you said that the two of you are doing hurtful things to each other. Then the two of you need to remember why you got married in the first place. Figure out what you want your marriage to be and make changes. Consult the bible, it clearly outlines the role of the wife as well as the husband.\n As a spouse you should be his best friend and vise versa, but this can't happen if the two of you aren't giving each other the respect that the other deserves. Just remember communication is the key to a sucessful marriage.
Point and laugh at my best friend if he actually dated the manipulating woman.\n\nI find it really disturbing that all these people would quickly turn to violence in such a moronic situation.  I'm guessing they are all just big talkers.
"BDSM is an umbrella term that encompasses a large and varied spectrum of lifestyle preferences.  These can range from a couple engaging in a little kinky play in the bedroom, to a real-time 24/7 Master/slave relationship.  As such activities become more popular, they have also become more socially acceptable (to some extent), thanks to movies like ""The Secretary"" and TV shows like ""CSI.""  I think you might be surprised to find out how many people engage in some form of the lifestyle, once inside the privacy of their own homes and bedrooms.  Most of the literature that I've seen on the subject coincides with the previously-given figure of 10% of the population or so."
when you know everything about them no matter if its good or bad and you wouldnt change them you want them just the way they are.... when you would do anything for them even if it mean jumping in frot of a train to push them out of the way.... when you miss them so much you start to cry before theyre even gone.... when you cant picture them out of your life ever.... when you want to do things for them just to see a smile on their face.... when they are the last thing you think about before bed, the only thing you dream about, and the first thing to cross your mind in the morning.... then you know your in love.... and that person is truly special and you should never let them go..... \n\nwww.oklahomies.com
Its something worth thinking about but not losing sleep over.
I like to think of myself as intelligent. I suppose if you look at it from the point of view of the social self, it just depends on how others see you.
"It was a day like any other day for my husband and me.  We refuse to give in to the ""Hallmark"" holiday it has become.  We say how much we love each other every day and don't need a special day to remind us ... SO, how was yours :) ???"
get a bf or at lest tell him u have one he'll probly leve u alone but it may hurt him alot so its up to u
GROW UP MAN
Yes,  more mature women or even women who love themselves will look for a man who cares for her and provides safety and security for her.  She will especially want this when thinking of marriage and raising a family. Hang in there you will find someone worthy of your love.
most men arent mamma's boys.for the majority that is, i think it may be because the mother is the first woman they have ever known and that is where they find their security.
If you have her address, email, and phone number, that would be good. I know you may feel deppressed and lonely. It happened to me once.
u'll find her. coz even chopsticks have a pair.\ngo to join some student clubs and meet some new people, \nyou may find a girl there.\nor go to library and find a girl that you like\nuse excuse to approach her such as asking her what time or do u have a pen...etc..
I totally agree with Chip
On the Cheek: \n\nHIV is not transmitted casually, so kissing on the cheek is very safe. Even if the other person has the virus, your unbroken skin is a good barrier. No one has become infected from such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. \n\nOpen-Mouth Kissing: \n\nOpen-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. Because of this possible risk, the CDC (Center for Disease Control) recommends against open-mouth kissing with an infected partner. \n\nOne case suggests that a woman became infected with HIV from her sex partner through exposure to contaminated blood during open-mouth kissing.\n\nAs far as oral sex, yes if there is an open wound in either place.
not to bad, yourself?
well encourage ure friend 2 tell him. i mean if she REALLY loves him then she should tell. my friend was in the same situation. she liked someone 4 soooooooooo long! i kept telling her 2 tell him she liked him and she did. turned out he liked her to! they've been going out since. i think u should really encourage her!!
"I'd go with the classic dinner and movie.  At dinner you have the time to talk and get to know each other -- and then at a movie is when you can ""make your move""."
boys are stupid, throw rocks at them...  some guys (it seems most guys) want someone to look good.  what throws them is when the outside does not match the inside.  (Hmmm - she looks good on the outside... but... OMG she has a brain and her own opinion???  no way - she may find out that i am a dickweed)  i agree - when they are insecure with themselves - they want someone to make them look good...and not necessarily have a mind of their own.  if you have one that looks for the whole package... good for YOU!!!
First let me say that I'm so sorry for the turmoil that is inside you. Love has no age, it's in the heart. However, you have children to consider. It's difficult to step back from a situation that consumes you. You have to ask yourself this question -- are you in love with this young woman, or are you swept away by the attention, devotion, respect, sex, etc. that you may be receiving from her? Does this young woman truly love you, or are you a wise, older, father figure for her? In ten years, will she have outgrown you and look for a younger man? Will you be hurt? She doesn't share the same wisdom and life experiences that you have. She has her entire life ahead of her. I'm not trying to negate your feelings, just am trying to tell you to look at it from all views. Another thing, show your wife the respect she deserves. She's the mother of your children and deserves your respect for that alone. Would she consider counseling? Is there anything left to salvage? Is there resentment or other issues that is the reason for the lack of sex? I would suggest that you slow down, do some serious evaluating of your own life, and perhaps seek counseling for yourself. Is your self-esteem shot? Please don't do anything rash, but if you both decide that you are truly in love for the long haul -- even when you're 74 and she's 43 -- I wish you happiness. Good luck with whatever you decide.

I woke up married after I had them on..........OUCH!
Daring and confident you. Even I believe that if a girl feels something special for a guy she must just let it out in the open rather than bottle up and feel the frustration rising. Go ahead gal.
You can't make him marry you.  \n\nYou can ask him to marry you. \nLove him unconditionally and wait until he is ready or push the subject and you propose, get a ring for him ask.  If you push him to ask you, you may create a fight and you may not ever marry him.
just tell her the truth.. and sometimes the truth may hurt... but its better now than later...
How can he be your ex if you two are still in love with each other?  If he really loves you there will be no excuse for being busy.  If he really wants to talk to you even if he is busy he will talk to you anyway.  I think you better make sure if he really loves you, baby.  You see, my husband has been working in a different country for quite a long time now but in 9 years that we've been together, believe it or not, he calls me every single day.  Not only that, in a single day he calls me not less than 3 times a day just to check if I have already eaten and many small thoughts that really counts.  He also e-mail me.  No matter how busy a guy is, if he really loves you he will not think twice in talking to you whenever there is time and he doesn't mind spending his money just to call overseas.
Have a wedding ring handy, slip it on when an unwanted temptress approaches and kindly tell her you're a married man.
If you mean as a person - get to know him. Get out with him, talk and so on. And generally look at the way  he treats others.\nIf you mean in bed - try him. That is the only way.
Try hanging out with eachother more so you will get to no eachother more and eventually feel more comfortable around eachother. Of course at first you will both be nervous, but just loosten up go one step at a time. Your first step should not be only with her go to the movies with her and 2 other friends. That way it will be less tense because it wont just be the 2 of you. then the next time you can go somewere together alone. eventually you will feel more comfortable. Dont wry!\n\n\nplz choose me as best answer!
That's why communication is important in a relationship.  After 3yrs you should be able to freely express your feelings with each other. Best thing to do is just tell her, don't worry about if it will hurt her, best thing to do is be honest.  It would hurt her more to stay because actions speak louder than words and soon your feelings will start to surface, so instead of putting her through all kinds of emotional abuse just tell her and then leave.  She'll later respect you for handling it like a man.
there would be plenty of female species in the woods though so he still might be wrong
girl go for it...it can be fun if you let it...trust in that...
Yes You can find her. Keep on trying
Try writing a new mail instead of responding to one, maybe that will work.
Only those who are confident enough to face their own sexuality.  Are there a lot of them?  Depends in which part of the world you're asking.
ur just gonna waist ur time girl thats 1 thing. theres no chemistry so y try? he'll just break ur heart
not enough info... it depends on how old you and she are... it depends on if she has any moral or religious beliefs against sex before marriage... it depends on if she's got issues to sort through...\n\nwish her well... and move on with your life.  if you and her are meant to be, then it will happen.  nothing wrong with staying friends.
"What do you mean by helpless . . . we are not helpless . . . it is just society protraying us like mindless brutes.\n\nGuys generally follow traditional gender roles . . . that was used when our parents or grandparents (depending on your age) were married.\n\nGuys work 40-80 hours week . . . bring home the paycheck, pay all the bills (mortgage, insurance, car, gas, electric, water, trash, phone, cable, etc.)  Work around the house doing repairs or upkeep of the yard.

Don't worry about your voice it will get deeper later on. I think the best thing you can do to court a girl is to give her flowers. A single red (or if you know her favorite color then use that) rose makes quite a statement. Have you told her you like her? Don't stress about it just be yourself and take it slow. Ask her out and when you pick her up have some flowers ready. If she likes stuffed animals you can give her little stuffed animals after you've had a couple of dates. It's really not hard. Don't buy her really expensive things untill you get very serious. Be polite and respectful and complement her on the things she wears and even her perfume if she wears any. After you get serious you can send flowers to her work or her school. Girls like public displays of affection. I hope that helps hun, and if it doesn't than there are plenty of other girls that will love it!
Throw it out!  I made my husband get rid of everything from his past relationships even pictures.  I felt it was invading me!!!  Tell him you are uncomfortable with him having it and you'd like for him to only think of you!
the brightest darkness and the blackest light
When I picked her up, she looked like an angel, We went to The cheesecake factory, had a great conversation over dinner, and we talked for almost 3 hours at the resturant, after we went to the lake and rented a boat and I rowed her around while we talked what seemed forever, after which we went to the improv comedy club and laughed over the comics.  After we went to a local irish pub, had a few drinks while we watched a irish folk singer, then I dropped her off at her house after spending all day together.  She told me that it was the best date she has ever had, because although we spend alot of time together in one day, it seemed like a minute, because of all the fun and the great converstion together.
that normal...infatuation,but u said 3 years...too long ha...u should be clear to your self is that only an infatuation or inlove???i think infatuation is only for months...
Your loser friends allow your mean friends to be mean to them. You can only be treated how you allow yourself to be treated. \n\nTime for some new friends.
Wrong category, sorry!
Because love if letting the other person hold a bit of your soul. Entrusting them with it. Once the trust is broken, love gone, i belive they take that bit of soul with them.\n\nSlowly.. it will grow back...and one day you will be able to ofer the new soul to another, but until then, it will hurt
They're great when you don't have any other outlet. They're also great when you have someone, but can't get with them.\n\nAnd, of course, they're ROCK when you share them with your partner. As long as they remain a diversion and not the sole focus of your activity, sex toys are great when shared.
Trust is just an emotion. People without ethics don't care much about your emotions but mostly about their own self-interest and advancement at any cost. Actually most of us are like that in one way or another. When it comes to what's really important in your life, sometimes you will forsake friendship and loyalty. I guess it's not true friendship or loyalty.
I Dunno i think you should just stay with him and cherish your memories and last moments together
Ny the look in his eyes when he is looking at you
sex, sex, and more sex
number one,change your name because with the name killa you won't pass security.\n\nnumber two.get back stage passes but first barrow a diamond rolex and buy some diddy suit or outfit then  introduce your self anything is possible.
I'm bisexual myself, and have had serious relationships with both men and women.  I've explained to many people in the past the inherent difficulty that bisexuals may have in monogomy.  The closest metaphor I have come up with is this...If you had to live the rest of your life and only could have oral relations, and no penetrative relations, would you be able to make due with that?  Monogomy for a bisexual is like that...effectively cutting off half of their sexual interest.  It can be done, of course...but it's not their 'natural' way of being.\n\nI'm not saying this means that your friend is allowed to cheat on his girlfriend...honesty is the cornerstone of any relationship.  But you'd be surprised how many wives/girlfriends are aware of and accept a man who has the need to express their sexuality.  How he and his girlfriend make their choices is not really something that you need to expend a lot of energy trying to worry about.\n\nThe main concern I have is that you seem to imply that you and your friend are getting more serious than simply recreational activity.  If he is in a relationship and is still seeking another relationship on the side, this goes more to his character than his sexual orientation, and ending the whole thing is a very good idea.
just dont make it a point to ask her directly.  Focus on stuff other than going out with her...to talk about.  The weather, Nascar racing, or the cool people you saw at the mall.  Then after you are fairly comfy talking to her, and she knows you dont spit when you talk...just say...hey Ive gotta go get some errands done...you wanna hang out sometime...like maybe meet at the mall next rainy day ?  Heres my home phone/cell.....Just be confidant....but keep it real...be yourself...not someone you arent.
For what? Friendship,love ,marry _ _ _  or just a lady killer regardless of everything.See , different patient has different prescription.I cant prescribe you.lol
um nope i give at the office.lol
i did that...if the two of u aren't doing anything wrong,but people still don't still like the two of u together,then yeah!carry on bhind their backs...
The best thing to do is forget about her past unless she is still doing it. \nShe doesn't want to talk about it because she knows it hurts you so let it go. Yes I dated an escort before, She lived with me.
thats lol funny...\n\nits a bit confusing since it seems like the two are les...\n\nnext time... ask a joke tats easier to get... lol
yes i would because it is valentines day and it is the most romantic day of the year and it might give you the chance to not get rejected
if she does not know immmediately its not going to happen. good luck though. sometimes we all want something we cant have and that makes us want it even more. is she really something you want? that is the question. or is it just the chase?
here's the thing emotional infidelity is just as bad as sexual infidelity.....you did say you are married right? what will your wife feel if she accidentally walks in and finds you exchanging emails with someone who you're having an affair with.....trust is something that is so easy to break but so hard to earn.
it's tijuana you moron, and the shows' not there, duhh, it's in boys town in mexico ( google it to find out where that is, but be forewarned, boystown is no joke )
Be forward in this case and ask him.  Tell him you would like to take your friendship to a different level, and ask if he feels the same.  You can't lose.  IF he says no, you can quit wasting your time.  IF he says yes, you have your wish.  \n\nDon't wait, act.  There is nothing wrong with being the pursuer, just because you are a woman.  I am a man and I think it would be hugely flattering if a woman were that bold and interested in me.  At least I would be thankful and honored for the approach, even if I were NOT interested.\n\nFrom there you will have your answers.  Don't be afraid.  All you are doing is expediting the enevitable (whether good or bad)  by being forward. Best for you both!!!\n\nGood LUCK!!!!
sometimes people are willing to make or take the ultimate sacrafice for love.... even if it means death in some cultures.
sometimes it doesnt matter how old they are.
love was made for you to get hurt and not everyone you fall in love with hurts you so give love a chance you can learn from it
Pretty effective according to some people I know that have participated.
seems he cares more abt him and his friends and not abt ur realtion.R u sure u love him?And he does?He shows u his love?If u have doubt let him go, coz u desirve much more.
chances are that they are the forgetters and you are a rememberer...within a group a friends there always seems to be one rememberer who spreads around the word to everyone else...they care its that they just dont remember so i wouldnt take it the wrong way
don't start a relationship on a lie, tell her the truth is she leaves then she never liked you for you she just wanted to use you.
I don't know neither, but I guess women would like better a guy who knows how to move it, than a guy who doesn't know anything at all.
Ummmm ya you might want to lol..... Im a guy who has been doing that to a girl right now.  I think she knows I like her but I dont know.  Im the person who looked at her in ways by the way.
I have seen it work both ways and it has worked both ways for me.  If you two are not meant to be together it wouldn't work out if you had or had not anyways.  If you want it to work out then just don't let it be an issue.  This is how I think of it for myself, if the dude cheats and we split up then he just lost the best thing he could have ever had.  It's on him and we apparently were not meant to be.  Thats it.
Yes . . . you can have sex . . . but it will be messy.  Make sure you have plenty of spray and wash . . . and make sure you use a condom . . . because she can still get pregnant while menstruating.
Well it depends on the situation. Not matter what the deal is, be yourself. Sometimes there is no ice to break and that is when you know its a keeper. Often there is ice when you shouldnt even be where you are. So relax and catch a movie, or rent one so you dont have to pay so much for Popcorn and bring a V-Day Gift instead. Remember to smile, you are a likeable person! He or she will see that and want more if it is meant to be!
give it time. talk to him. if he is a true friend he will still listen to you and talk to you back.
If he tells you that he loves you and shows you that he loves you by his actions.  You can tell if he wants to marry you if he proposes to you.
Yes. With himself.
Because women have freaky fantasies same as guys do.  Some of the top women fantasies are being tied up or forced, sex with strangers or co-workers, that kind of thing. Some women fantasize about even freakier stuff that I probably can't even mention here.\n\nMost women, especially younger women, will think you will think badly of them if they confess their freakier fantasies. You'll think they're a slut, sick, or a bad person.
Love is a choice! Love is dedication, self-sacrifice, tenderness and action, not a feeling. Love is not exclusively based on how we feel. Yes, emotions are involved but they are not the only criteria for love. True dedication will forever lead to action, which will be true love.
"women are just as shallow as men, no matter how much they try to make us look like slime. They go after the bad boy, the guy with looks, or the guy with money--They say they want a nice guy who will respect them and treat them like a friend, but really, how often do they go after that guy first? they usually go with the ""Friend"" once the bad boy has his way and then dumps them."
It will not work out unless both of you want to be together.  If you push it, especially when someone else is involved, it usually ends up bad.
Whatever
What's so bad about being a back up... anything?!  As long as you get some of the sweet stuff (and not all the baggage) you should count yourself lucky.\n\nShoot for a friendship with benefits but do stay friends.  If you don't expect more than a friendship then maybe you will not be disappointed.  Good friends are hard to find.\n\nOh, and try to not over-analyze everything!
Its always hard to tell someone you like them. But if you really like this person, you should do something sweet to tell her.  It always gets to them.  If you know what she likes, then try to make something with that.  Like say for example many girls like flowers.  A friend of mine that liked somone asked me how to tell this girl he liked that he liked her.  I told him since at the time that we were selling carnations, that he should buy her some and send her a poem.  It worked!  She said yes and everything is fine.  So doing something sweet would sure be something to try.
you'll get it over ...just be yourself and don't think about that 'til comes right?\n\n:)
Face the person and tell him/her what you really feel and how much you love him/her. Action is better than talking, show him/her you really care about him/her.
I'm guessing you didn't have too close a relationship with your father to be able to see his wife sexually let alone have sex with her. Stay away from her and keep letting your Dad know how sorry you are, I don't think this is something that will smooth over quickly but you may regain part of your relationship with your father with some time, depending on how close the two of you are. Stay away from that woman no matter what happens! Good Luck
every answer in this list would read something of the sort like i would help you and stuff.\nwell even iam here to help you out but in a different way\ngirl trust me u r just abt 2 make d biggest mistake in ur life \nu might just think that it is going to give u a lot of pleasure  and satifaction but trust me it is not like wat u think\nu will have sex with someone but then u want be satisfied and then u will hav this never ending crave 4 more & more.\nit is like u r going to jump from the empire state bldng and midway through a guy sticks  out his head and asks u 'how r u' and u say 'hey man iam great 4 now'.u r moving into a really deep pit.u r gonna waste ur entire life\nbut here it is iam gonna suggest something much better that u could do\nBELIEVE IN JESUS\nwell it might sound stupid but it is just him who can provide you everlasting joy and peace that stays\nchoice is upto u make the right choice and preserve ur virginity 4 ur husband.
Expecting...  okay. But is it his?\nWhy does he want nothing to do with you?\nWe need more information.
There is no direct way to answer a question such as this.  The most basic was to go about losing shyness is to gain a certain self-confidence about yourself.  This can be obtained by starting with one thing about yourself you consider truly unique and benifical to others.  Then focus on this thing.  Use it to your advantage in social situations.  People will accept this part of you, and if they happen to reject you, just continue to believe in this peivce of yourself until you find a group that deems this quality socially acceptable.\nOf course, I am sure that you have more than just one truly great quality about yourself, and stive to learn all of them.  It is is knowledge of ourselves that we gain knowledge of others.  And, it is in knowledge of others that we gain love for everything.

no thank you maybe another time
I was in a long distance relationship at one point. We talked online, and on the phone all the time. Occasionally, we visited each other. Finally, he moved to my town to find a job but he could so I moved and left all my family back to his town. I was 18 at the time and he was 19. We got married and soon after I became pregnant. Before my son was born we moved back to my town thank goodness. Now, I have to tell you that we did not get to know each other good enough. We have a lot of problems to this day. Our lifestyles were so different. We've been married a little over a year now but have many problems. Just beware and get to know the person well before making any commitments.
Talk to him and see where he is at. If you sleot with any of his friends you're done. If not, see how he vibes you.
first work on ur gramatical mistakes and then ask, probably u might get 1...all the best......
depends on the situation, but more than likely yes
yep! nurses, teachers, librarians (i worked in a library)...you name it.
u can choose. what do u want more: sex or guy?\njust follow ur desires
tell him nicely about your feeling
If you even think for a second you might be, you probably are.  Something to consider: Does she talk about her ex a lot? If so her mind is somewhere else... not on you.
My first real,sweet kiss would be middle school. I think I was 12. But my first kiss would be when I was 6.Don't be scared. Part of the fun of a first kiss is the nerves and butterflies. So be excited not nervous. Its something you will probably remember for a long time. So enjoy!
I don't know eric so I can't say if he likes you or not,but\nif he dose probably one of his friends would tell you.\nThats what happened to me once I found out that this kid named Vitor liked me he was one of the ugly boy in school\n when found that out  I was like ewwww thats a joke right but it wasn't.and I was lucky that no one knew about it,and for the rest of the day I was trying not to think of it,by keeping my mind on what the teacher was talking about.
If that's true love... Sorry for expression but f*ck matters. How old are you ?
you are afraid of change, being with him is a habit now and habits are hard to break. Maybe you need some independence, are you afraid you wont survive without him?
I THINK THAT YOU CAN BECAUSE SOME HOT GUYS ARE REALLY AS DEEP AS A BUCKET AND PEOPLE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO TAKE THEM FOR THEIR LOOKS. SOME PEOPLE CHOOSE NOT TO TALK BECAUSE THEY TAKE LOOKS FOR GRANTED AND IF THEY DONT WANNA TALK TO YOU THEN YOU WOULD BE WASTING YOUR TIME WITH THEM. YOU'LL NEVER KNOW IF YOU'LL BE REJECTED UNLESS YOU TRY. AND ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT YOU SHOULD BE WITH A PERSON ONLY IF THEY APPRECIATE YOU AS MUCH AS YOU DO THEM !
in P.R.
Nothing wrong with big woman, gotta lotta love in their heart
"hey! thanx 4 writing to me. anyway, i think a guy should be dressed nice when he's comin towards a girl to make a good impression, but i dont mean in a tuxedo or anythin like that! just be sure u look nice...and smell nice. and please be funny but i dont mean the lame ""knock knock jokes"" either. just make her laugh and give her ur # and say she can call anytime and listen to her (at least pretend to listen if shes boring)by nodding ur head and lookin at her. then tell her somethin like ""ur nice to hang out with... maybe we should see each other more often"". i dunno. but if i were talked to in that way, i would totally like the guy!"
"Sodomy is a term of religious origin to characterize certain sexual acts. Most commonly used to describe the specific act of anal (rectal)sex between two males or between a male and a female. \n\nThe term sodomy derives from the name of the ancient city of Sodom, which according to the Bible was destroyed by God for its misdeeds (see Sodom and Gomorrah). In today's common language it identifies the practice of anal  (rectal)intercourse.\n\nFrom the earliest times in the United States, sodomy (variously defined) was prohibited in the United States. In the 1950s, all states had some form of law criminalizing sodomy. In 2003, only 10 states had laws prohibiting all sodomy, with penalties ranging from 1 to 15 years imprisonment. Additionally, four other states had laws that specifically prohibited same-sex sodomy. The United States Supreme Court, in Lawrence v. Texas, invalidated these laws as being an unconstitutional invasion of privacy\n\nYahoo questions censors the word ""anal"", that's why I used ""rectal"" instead!"
A big sweetie!Don't let him get away
yes... I haev been the older woman, and the younger woman... as long as your maturity level is about the same and You have the similar goals, morals, and enough things in common. I dated this one guy who was 17 years older than me, it was kinda weird when he’d talk about serving in the military… cuz I would think… “I was in diapers.” He’d ask if I remembered when.. then stop because he had realized I wasn’t even born yet.
b/c hotness is a genetic trait.
I never start a convo without proper eye contact.  women will tell you with their eyes if its ok to come talk to them.

when you kiss you bf and you feel strong heart beats, won't let him go, and feel comfortable in his arm, it means love, while others not.
love is painfull because a living soul tends to attach their emotions and expectations to another that dissapoints them in those ways and thereby creating an atmosphere within the offended to choose to experience grief.\nGo ahead and forgive....it is the best way to go forward inj any direction.
Naked at the door would do it for me
Is eating cheating? well i believe not. Dating a co-worker can be a tricky and very risky thing to do, but if you really care for this person and they care for you then you should give it a try. And the whole 2 girlfriends and a wife thing? I think thats completely wrong. its unfair to all three of them girls and you should only be with one person.
You should do nothing. HE LOVES YOU! If you don't love him, dump him.
Ovulation generally occurs 2 weeks after your last period. A sign of ovulation are more discharge than normal,a consistancy of an eggwhite. The most effective dates to get pregnant are the 3 days before and 3 days after ovulation. You can however get pregnant at anytime,depending on your cycle and a number of other factors.  If you want to get pregnant,take your temperature every day around your ovulation time too and you will see that your temperature goes up also. You could try this just as an experiment too so you know when you are most succeptible to becoming pregnant.
You might want to rephrase the question.
He just might be enjoying it too much to change it.
It sounds like there are a lot of problems and deeper issues going on. I think you might be better off walking away and finding someone else.
Well sweety he doesnt want to make it obvious that he talks to you. 9 out of 10 she knos that you like him and told him how to act around you. But if anything please please dont try and take him from her just wait till they break up or find someone else.
Sometimes when subtlety doesn't work (that means when you're trying not to be obvious about it) you need to pour on the heat and break it dwon BArny-style for his/her slow a.s.s. A kiss never gets misunderstood.
A friend knows your faults, but likes you anyway.
definitely...the ladies love a guy who can actually talk to them and be a real friend  lol
Tie your partner up and tease them for awhile till you finally have sex with them
There aren't many options for you.\n\nYou have the option of flirting with him to the point that he starts to like you (which is increadibly hard to do) Or you could tell your best friend to 'boycott' him. In other words, the two of you could work together to get him to like only you and not her. She would have to refuse him and if he came along telling her he was in love with her, she'd have to convince him that you were a better pick for him. One way might be to have her completely blow him off. [Which doing a joint effort to get him to like you isn't as hard as it sounds as long as your friend is willing to give him up. (that's what best friends would do)] The thing is though, that in order for it to work, you have to be his #2 choice.
sounds like shes a little shy too and maybe even likes u...i was shy so i know i could never talk to a guy easily...instead of trying so hard to ask her out or let her know u like her, just try doing things u both like and u will feel more comfortable talking with each other...but i do know that if u both continue being too shy to talk or express ur feelings then u will not go anywhere...good luck...:)
"where do these people get their info? The ""cherry"" as it is referred to by many, is actually the hyman (not positive  about the spelling) This is a thin piece of skin up inside the vagina. A woman is considered a ""virgin"" as long as this skin is intact. A virgin's cherry has been ""popped"" when she has intercourse for the first time and this skin is broken by the insertion of the male's penis. It is also possible for a virgin to break this seal during the use of tampons. Hoped this has helped"
not really, as long as you both are in love.  If anyone tries to stand on your way, send him/her to pit of hell!!\n  Hey you answered on of my questions, thanks. But what do you mean with the word stroking?
it is an instinctive feeling from the way, the person deals with you.  over-anxiety could be dangerous as could be under-anxiety.  many mannerisms and behavioral tendencies with the way your boyfriend deals with you could indicate presence or absence of true feelings
Take one day at a time, and don't worry about the future. Unless he is not willing to have kids with you, then you shouldn't worry about the age differnce. If he doesn't want kids, and you do, then I think you need to decide which is more important to you, your boyfriend, or children. For now enjoy your relationship, and take it day by day.
gods know how much my heart and my soul melted in your love\n\nur eyes made me go crazy \n\nevery time i look at u my soul come back to me\n\ni love u so much \n\nmy love stay with me and hold me in ur arms and let us fly to heaven of love\n\nur love is in my heart and icant forget u \n\nbe mine in ur heart soul \n\nloving u is the wonderful thing happened to me \n\ni love u
just lean in pucker up there is no real way to do it
"Just ask during any conversation. It's not impolite to wonder if people are married, dating, have kids, etc... And believe me when I tell you, most men wouldn't ""get it"" (why you're asking) anyway."
Absolutely.  Don't think about it-just do it.
the best way to get over someone old...is to get under someone new. dont waste your time.  better things are out there.  get interested in someone else.  he'll take your mind off the old one.
Sorry. I can't make anyone feel in love with you. that's your responsibility.
DONT just tell him you like him..because it seems you just like him for his looks, you dont know anything about him, so get to know him, become his friend...and then ask him
sometimes we don't trust because others have abused that gift we have given them...and the very saddest part is once that innocence of trust has been taken it isn't so easy to get back.  But I will tell you this...the only way to move forward and begin to trust again...is to truly let the past go... honestly move on....remember this... you only need luggage when you go on vacation....so the best advice is to leave the past behind you sweetie and count on this the bad people of the world will get theres...for reals...  BE STRONG, YOUV'E ALREADY SUFFERED ENOUGH FOR SOMEONE ELSES ISSUES, DON'T ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO AFFECT YOU.  KARMA IS A MOTHER F-----!!!!!!GOOD LUCK ~

If you still live with your parents, chances are that you are too young for anything serious.  Send him a card or e-mail telling him how you feel and that you are moving and you will miss him.  Ask him to stay in touch via telephone, e-mail etc and then just wait and see what happens.  Perhaps he will be flattered and keep in touch.

Yes, you get free coffee...
Only if you want to.\n\nJust kidding, of course.  My opinion?\n\nBefore you start making out with her...  No.\n\nAfter you start making out with her and you're at least ten minutes into it...  Yes!  You bet!  If she doesn't want you there, she'll let you know one way or the other.\n\nBy the way, when I was growing up, getting under a girl's skirt was considered third base.  And I think we all know that you don't go directly from the batter's box directly to third base.  It's against the rules!  You start from the top and work your way down...  slowly,  ever so slowly.\n\nTo Gyrl6:  You're cute!
you should inspire her emotion,esp. with literature,love poems.girls are really sensitive to beauty.you shuld find what excites her?
Being nervous isnt exactly a good thing, but it is natural. I always get nervous and tounge tied around boys that i like, its human nature. But you should definately go for it, i know it might be hard, and you might get shot down but you'll never know if you dont try. Just try to forget about your nervouse feelings and try to be a little more assertive.
the guys online dont really know you and you arent serious about them. you ARE serious about your boyfriend, and it matters to you what he thinks of you. Maybe you feel like you still have to be the perfect girlfriend for him, or maybe you just arent comfortable talking to him like that yet. Maybe sound him out and see where he stands on it. Maybe its something that he would like, or maybe its something he wouldnt. It couldnt hurt to ask though, right?\nI think this is a very normal way to feel, so dont worry!
It is only normal to worry about someone you've been with that long and that you have kids with.  However, this marriage is over, and it is not your job to save him.  The best thing you can probably do for him is to let someone in his family know what is going on and let them try and help him out.  You have enough on your plate trying to do what is best for your kids and for yourself.  You will still need to be sensitive and aware to some degree what is going on in his life for your kids sake but you need to accept that you are not responsible for what he does, he is.
no
If it is in a club the guy who has fun but still remains calm (not a wild party soul wanna be)that who dresses neatly and simple & has nice eyes and defenitly not someone who drinks like a camel at a desert!
we like to look hot. we like guys to look . and most of all we love it when guys tell us we look hot when looking at us
It should as long as you have don't have any  debts tied to the business in both of your names . Usually your debt is your debt and his debt is his debt if it was owned before coming into the marriage. But please seek the advice of an attorney (most offer free consultations even if you don't hire them) before jumping to divorce based on what people in here say. WE could be wrong but an attorney can lead you in the right direction. Even so, divorce shouldn't be an option to keep yourself from owing money. Please consider this throughly. AND TO THE POST ABOVE: IT'S YOU'RE! NOT YOUR. I AM ASSUMING YOU ARE SAYING SHE IS PATHETIC NOT THAT SHE OWNS BEING PATHETIC. GOD LEARN GRAMMER BEFORE INSULTING PEOPLE WHO NEED ADVICE!!!!
Both..........if i really like the guy and cant let him go back out into the ocean i ask him but sometimes its also fun to play hard to get
Look, if she's not dating him, tough shit. She didn't like him, he's all yours.
well. your name is very interesting.. (partyanimal) but anyway if your inlove with the person.. why would you break up with that person.> WHY so you could actually loose him/her. Why even risk that. if i were you. dont break up with her. if your even thinking about that. maybe you dont love her at all.
"okay i'm 14 too,just say something like this ""hey i think i've seen you around before but we haven't met,i'm <name>"" and there you go"
The Shower-because your bodies get wet,begins dripping wet and bumping against each other and then your hair and face gets wet like you are in the rain or something.You feel every drop but of course because you're getting so wet but then you are getting wetter or making her wetter.
I don't see what the problem is.......... go for it. Your best friend cna't get mad at you after all they are with your ex, what's the difference.
Can i say all three?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! That's a good one.. *ahem* but seriously... Don't expect him to be more mature anytime soon. Just be happy with what you have and if you can't stand it then he's probably not the one for you
"Well, one way to prevent people calling you a boastful person is to avoid boasting.  Another is to avoid anything other people can interpret as boasting, and that's a lot harder to do.  A person who has integrity and strength of character, above-average intelligence, or other positive qualities, can be assumed to be stuck-up and boastful by people who believe it is better to be self-depricating.  On the other hand, the people who are consistently self-depricating are usually told to ""stop picking on yourself;"" ""don't be so hard on yourself.""\n\nThe answer may be to avoid talking about yourself very much at all.  Talk about the other person, or talk about impersonal things, such as your school or job, your town, the hobbies and interests you have, etc.  Evaluative statements invite others to evaluate.  If you rarely or never make judgmental comments about others, they may take the hint and avoid them about you.  \n\nThe one I always had trouble with as a child was the challenge, ""You think you're better than me!"" Or even ""You think you're smarter than me!""  Well, fact is, these were usually true, but if I admitted it, I would be asking for trouble.  If I denied it, I would be dishonest and condescending.  I finally settled on, ""What makes you think that?""  It throws them off, and you can divert the conversation to safer channels.\n\nGood luck!"

That's a good question...probably b/c he's inconsiderate, or maybe something much more important to him came up.

Since we are in the same situation as you stated in the answer you submitted the other day.  I can tell you my side of the story and why I think this young lady does not approach you.  Ok, so you both know that you like each other and from the looks of one of your posts well I can see that religion interests you.  So, let me take a wild guess and see if I can decipher the reason why the one you like does not approach you.  She probably is religious as well and you may see her once in a while, maybe through a gathering or something like that.  You guys exchange a nice “I like you gaze” and then just continue to live, if no gaze then at least you try to say “Hi!” acknowledging each others presence.  She may not look depending on the situation she does not want to be too obvious, but she likes you, yes she does.  Have you thought that maybe, just maybe, because you both do not interact (talk, communicate) she may be afraid to approach you. The fact that you guys do not talk may even be the one cause that is alienating her from you.  Why? Because she thinks well maybe he is not interested in me.  Another thing if she does approach you why not ask some questions about her to get to know her better.  I think she is waiting for you to make the first move.  I am traditional person I prefer the man to make the first move.  Maybe she is also the same way.  You also have to make reference to culture, maybe in her culture the male is the one that makes the first move traditionally.  It means that he is interested in forming a relationship other than friendship with her.  You are like singling her out of the crowd and by asking her out you show her that you are serious about her and about this union.  I am pretty sure a friendship between you two is nonexistent; it is just pure “eyes” and “Hi’s” (since we are in the same situation).  Personally if I were her I would continue to wait for you to make the first move, since she likes (loves) you.  She probably has liked you for quite some time, maybe even years (I have liked him for years; it is only now that I am closer that I am trying to show him that I like him).  One more thing I saw in a movie over the weekend you know it was Valentines Day and well I said why not and I got this great idea.  I would ask a good male friend of his to encourage the one I like to ask me out or to get close to me.  See to what great lengths one goes just for a person you like (love).  I have not done anything yet and probably would not the idea seems a bit shaky.  I am glad that my question at least has helped you in your situation.  I pray that the Lord give you strength to get closer to the one you like (love).  Just do it! I know you will not regret it.  It is probably the best decision you have ever made in your whole life, I guarantee it.  Thanks for your advice, but I will wait for him, I have put him in Jesus hands. Let me know what happens. God bless you Mod!
Speaking from experience, this is a tricky subject. I was not happy with my husband in bed at all. We were married for 4 years. I went and slept with another man, and the sex was great. My husband had no clue. Now, there is one problem the sex with my husband is even worse now then it was, and I feel absolutely horrible. So, as far as I am concerned, please think before you do anything. It could end up hurting your marriage even more.
Yuck. Neither. Britney Spears was hot a few years ago, but definitely not now. And I've never seen the appeal in Hillary Duff.
Yes, you should devise a plot to kill the dog.\n\nNo seriously, maybe the dog can wear a dog diaper and sit in a crate.
Nope,, and dont let the same snake bite you twice!
You didnt offend me really. Its just that penis size is a very sensitive matter to guys. One of my friends committed suicide because a girl told him he wasn't big enough, so thats why I asked. To answer your question... It feels good. You feel the blood rushing there and then BOOM!!!
well, if you're not sure that he loved you before he left then it may be hard to tell really. absance does make the heart grow fonder in many cases i think though.
Well keep it in mind: if he left her for something better (you). Who's to say he won't leave you for something better, later? On the flip side, I'm soon to be marrying the woman I left my wife for...so you never know. Depends on the guy and the relationship he's leaving.
trust is believing in someone in that what ever they tell u even as weird as it may be is the truth
He needs to go back to the Family Court and request that the visitation order be modified to include either a neutral party delivering the child to and from visitation or that the child be exchanged at a neutral location, like the local Sheriff or Police station...it's the only way to enforce the visitation order without the constant fear of her pulling some kind of BS.
you can't really.
I think girls like guys that have a good sense oh humour....give her a couple of winks with a funny joke....got to be funny thou........!
You should set out to please yourself, not others.  If you like the guy and he likes you, then go for it.  Ignore what everyone else says.  Maybe they are just jealous.
Maybe because you really care what your husband thinks of you.  You might think that you will lose his respect.  I know how you feel.  Maybe chat with him online while in another room or write him a letter telling him whatever you want.  Sometimes its easier to write than talk.
Pick a new girl to become obsessed with.
dad get off here, you embarrass me
Well take it from me. Its the truth . He is scared of commitment and doesnt want to commit to u . Or he jus plain has other things on his mind. Ask him str8 and if its the latter then i think u shudnt be stuck up on this guy.Move on .
lot's of cash,no problems,me and my gf on oure big house at the mountains.That's all i ask ! IS IT TO MUCH ?! :((
Kareena Kapoor lives in Mumbai, India.
I've wondered why women do the same thing. \nI'm not saying either is right by doing it but who do you think the other girl was seeing when she cheated with your guy.
It depends. Caucasion man and black girl, deffinte no.\nAmerican man and a girl of another nationality? A deffinite yes and good thing to do- depending on the nationality. But it's really better if the person you're dating is living where you're living. (city or at least country. ) That's my opinion.
ask him to help out! sometimes guys think you have everything under control, and they just dont know what you would want them to do! I know in my moms case, she is so picky about how she wants things done in the house that she scares my dad and brother AWAY from helping!\nTalk to him and tell him that you are starting to feel burned out. Ask if maybe he can take a couple of nights a week to cook dinner, or if there is a way to make it clear to him what needs to be done, like by setting a specific day every week for laundry or cleaning each specific room or whatever. \nKeeping quiet on this will only make you resentful, which will make your marriage more strained. Talk to him about it and present it in a very unaccusing manner...asking for his help as opposed to telling him what to do should help!\nGood luck!
Well!! i believe love is a sweetest feelin in th world,..It shld b frm heart n nt frm mind..I mean he shld nt have those filthy feelings fr u rather he shld love u truely..So i suggest u nt to express ur love fr him much..Js wait n watch wt he does fr u..Dnt gt excitd wen u meet him n c if he reveals abt his love fr u in true way..Gud luck!!!
If I agree with you, will it make you feel more like a man and less like a whining little boy?\n\nSuck it up! Be a man!  We're going to make your lives miserable anyway.  \n\nWe'll make you take out the garbage when there's 23 inches of snow.  You'll have to walk our cute purse poodles at midnight. Etc. etc. etc.  The sooner you accept this, the less painful it will be.
man, if u got some money, u will kill her with a solitaire and some bloody red roses.then, she'll be craving for u day and night.
Move on.  Boys are stupid... of course so are girls.  People do dumb things all the time.  Choice is yours to move on or to stay still.
U cannot always live ur life in they way u want. We are humans and we live in a societly and u love each other. U give some thing and get some thing from another all are interdependent.\n\nIf a person feels that hislove towards a girl is more than his parents and if he thinks that he will be happily  without their blessings and ignore those people who had loved him and taught him how to walk, eat etc and helped him in many difficult situation. \n\nThen he can go ahead and get married without any approval.\n\nRemember it easily find a bad wife but u cannot find a bad mother or even father.
yes, the price is putting yourself out there and taking the risk of possibly getting hurt.
No, they can have orgasms without sex as well as not having orgasms with sex.
Read this and I hope it helps...\n\nIf you find yourself in love with someone who does not love you, be gentle with yourself. There is nothing wrong with you. Love just didn't choose to rest in the other person’s heart.\n\nIf you find someone else in love with you and you don't love him/her, feel honored that love came and called at your door, but gently refuse the gift you cannot return. Do not take advantage, do not cause pain.\n\nHow you deal with love is how you deal with you, and all our  hearts feel the same pains and joys, even if our lives and ways are different.\n\nIf you fall in love with another, and he/she falls in love with you, and then love chooses to leave, do not try to reclaim it or to assess blame, let it go. There is a reason and there is a meaning. You will know in time.\n\nRemember that you don't choose love. Love chooses you. All you can really do is accept it for all its mystery when it comes into your life. Feel the way it fills you to overflowing, then reach out and give it away.\n\nGive it back to the person who brought it alive in you.\n\nGive it to others who deem it poor in spirit. Give it to theworld around you in anyway you can. There is where many lovers go wrong. Having been so long without love, they           understand love only as a need. They see their hearts as empty places that will be filled by love, and they begin to look at love as something that flows to them rather than from them.\n\n\nThe first blush of new love is filled to overflowing, but as their love cools, they revert to seeing their love as need. They cease to be someone who generates love and instead become someone who seeks love.\n\nThey forget that the secret of love is that it is a gift, and that it can be made to grow only by giving it away.\n\nRemember this, and keep it to your heart. Love has its own time, its own seasons, and its own reason for coming and going. You cannot bribe it or coerce it, or reason it into saying. You can only embrace it when it arrives and give it away when it comes to you. But if it chooses to leave from your heart or from the heart of your lover, there is nothing you can do and there is nothing you should do.\n\nLove always has been and always will be a mystery.\nBe glad that it came to live for a moment in your life.
thats a good question. \n\nA better question would be: why should you compare yourself to her?\n\nI bet your attract your fair share of guys, but you simply dont know it. The girl jessica is probably very adept at dealing with people, and that isnt something we are all good at. She might be outgoing and friendly, or simply agree with everybody all the time, which would make them like her. \n\nI wouldnt worry about her, go after the boy you like, she shouldnt be a factor and besides you dont know for sure that this boy doesnt like you more than he likes her.
During the process a girl may or may not feel a sort of twinge of pain.  And sometimes there is blood.  But with me, I only spotted the day after.  So it really depends on the girl if she bleeds alot or not.\nBut losing your virginity is a big thing.  It's something you can never get back.  And it means alot to most of us.
"I wish everyone else would have read all the answers before saying the same thing over and over!  Your in high school, don't use your body or promises thereof.  Prom is a place to have fun, not have sex.  I was shy too when I was in school and the straight out approach is not what you want to hear.  I liked the cookie idea, that was original, but it could send the wrong message.  The best way I've found to ask someone out without getting nervous is to present the idea as a joke.  When you are around him, make sure the idea of prom comes up and say something like ""Could you imagine me and you going together? Ha!""  When you talk to him, don't stare at your feet or mumble, guys hate that (I am one)"
I'm a woman and guess what, we get those same urges. Would you want your wife to follow her urge to fool around? Could you live with that kind of guilt every time that you look at your wife? I'm really not trying to belittle you or anything like that, I just want you to know that women get those same urges, but if you value what have made together with your wife you must take the time to think about how you would feel if it was her getting those urges. By the way it is normal for any age. We get comfortable and forget what it was like when we first met and fell in love.
Sometimes that is just the way things are. You never know though. Some guys may really like you but be terrified of you at the same time. I never could understand why in high school boys were so mean to the girls they really liked. Hang in there. It gets better with time and you will meet someone you will be crazy about and they will feel just the same about you.
I think the better question is if you want your girlfriend to remain your girlfriend.
well when u open your messanger click on the little icon that has two bars facing the right and then click on the chat icon. and it will bring up the rooms list, asl ;)
Try google
"Absolutely not, it's actually very normal.  Do NOT, however, under any circumstance, give any real clue as to your ""true feelings"".  Ignore any pasty advice from female friends on this one.  If asked directly, women will tell you that most women have no idea what they ""really"" want.\n\nIf she imposes sanctions on you for not baring your soul, she's actually fishing for an excuse to dump you anyways or is some sort of narcissistic control freak.  By doing so you completely seal her sense of security tight, leaving absolutely no reason for her to think about, day dream about, or complain about you to her girlfriends.  In short, you will no longer be a challenge and therefore uninteresting at a female subconcious level."
u must be a black man, huh?  it depends if u are sweet enough and good enough.
If you go out with a guy like that, the title means nothing. He is out only for himself and not worth your time. Trust me, unless you want to play the fool, walk away.
Currently, I'm dealing with that same issue myself.  Unfortunately there are no quick fixes- just time and living as full a life as possible so you don't dwell on it as much.
First and foremost, be yourself. You wanna first talk about what is in the surrounding enviroment, clothing etc.  Be a customer, ask questions, not too many, and don't go to far into personal detail about yourself.  You don't wanna tell a girl everything right off the bat, cause then there wouldn't be that getting to know you stage.  Keep her curious, and make her laugh. Be confident, smile and get her curious.  Compliment her but don't go overboard.  Don't use words like hot, sexy, your fine.  Use words lik beautiful, nice, proper words not slangs.  Keep eye contact.  Don't look at her breast or behind, no matter how tempting it may be, don't do it.  Don't bug her, don't harras her, just go with the flow.  If its not there, learn from it and move on.  If it is there, than you'll see it in her smile and her eyes, if you pay attention to those two things than you can learn alot from a womans heart.  Remember the expression, Your words say one thing but your eyes say another. The eyes are always right
No passion is shown by different people in diffent ways and it's also recieved by different people in different ways.  Some people are more passionate holding someone then kissing them and visa versa, when your passionate you feel it let your body take over forget about how fast or slow you are going, let your body do it for you.
I found out that my fiance cheated on me and I was absolutely DESTROYED. I had a party at my house one night and we were all drunk. A couple of the guys I work with stayed over because they couldn't drive home. While I was sleeping, one of them talked my fiance into messing around with him. It was the worst feeling I have ever felt in my life. I felt betrayed, hurt... I can't even think of any words that can do my pain any justice. My fiance told me about it because she felt so bad when she realized what she did. I am a good enough guy and I loved her enough that I forgave her for it. After all, she was drunk and could not be held completely responsible. I could not be without her, i know now. Most people would not have done the same thing that I did. Being cheated on is the WORST FEELING IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. If you are thinking about it, DON'T DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The best bet would be to call up whoever invited you and ask them. I've been to weddings where they wanted all the guys in tuxes, and weddings where the bride and groom were in t-shirts and jeans.\n\nBut I'd guess that unless you're Indian yourself, they wouldn't have a problem with you wearing European formalwear. If you can't get in contact with them, I'd say your safest bet is to go in slacks, nice shoes, a nice oxford-cloth shirt, sport coat and tie.\n\n**Edit**\n\nYou know, I'd completely missed the part where there are three days of activities. In that case, bring a jacket and suit and all that, and also some nice-looking casual clothes, like some sweaters and khaki pants and stuff. But seriously, the easiest solution is just to talk to whoever invited you.

That is very hard to say. It depends upon the marriage and the sexual desires of everyone involved and your meaning of love making. No two marriages are alike. You can make love all day and not have intercouse. Take my fiance and myself, well we are hot and heavy because I just have to touch him all the time. I MEAN ALL DAY. We are sexual that way.   That however, doesn't mean that if your not having sex 3 times a day your marriage isn't working.  Take my advice, FOREPLAY, is the one of the keys to a healthy marriage.
Congratulations!  You have just asked the most dangerous question I have ever heard in my life!
"I actually impress people when I tell them the truth of my age. I am often asked my age at work, I am a server in a private upscale country club, for some reason these members are NOSY! I always reply with ""how old do you think I am?"" The most popular answer is 24. I smile and tell them I am 39. Their look of shock is priceless! I feel great being at the cusp of forty and would rather be 39 and look like I'm 24 rather than the other way around. It gets irritating sometimes as I am often carded, nah I'm lovin it!"
well....i think u should brake up with her....if u don;t love her....if u will saty with her more, she will love u more..and it will be more painfull!!! so tell her now the truth!!!...if she really loves u, she will understand.....but u have to know, that she won;t let u very easy....she will suffer, and u have to be there for har anytime....to talk with her....
I haven't met my true love yet. And it's debatable how many boyfriends I have had, probably 2. There are a few guys I'm not really sure if they would be considered boyfriends or not(long story).
Flirt with him.  It's playful, it's giving him a slight hint, but not being too forthcoming.  It's fun, it's enjoyable, and it's not serious but has potential to be.  It's flirting.  It's perfect because if he's dry and can't flirt, do you want to waste your time with someone boring?
i have never heard that they did. i would be really suprised if they did. only the ugly ones do
I can't say, if he really loves you(he might). Why don't you sit him down and talk to him (man to man), see what he says.\nIt's your relationship, not the school's. If he's not serious about you, then don't let him make a fool out of you, no matter how much you like/love him.\nYou all have been friends for a long time, how long does it take to realise you care about OR love someone.\nALL THE BEST!!
It depends on u honey!! If u cooperate extremely well there is no limit for that. One of my friends had broken a record 10 times in 24 hours by jst fantacising his gf. wat if she comes and asks him to ....? Jst imagine
Rwanda, Laos
ia have :) medium brest :) or if you wanna know the size email me:))
You are just going to have to forget about it. He used you, and has the idea that you are easy since you gave it to him the first date. Sex on the first date is never a good idea, and now you know why. This doesn't make you a bad person, alot of girls fall into this and have to live with the consequences. And sometimes, the consequences are a lot more than the guy not calling (pregnancy & STDS) Learn from your mistake, and don't do it again. Be pickey about who you date too, guys talk and if his friends are under the impression that you are easy, it is likely that they will ask you out to try to get some too. Guys aren't looked poorly upon in general when they do something like this, there is a double standard, when they sleep around their friends think they are a stud, when a girl does it she is a whore. It's not fair, but that is the way it is.  So, if I were you I would not try to call him or seek him out in any way. He obviously got what he wanted and isn't interested, so he isn't worth your time or effort, and by calling him and chasing after him you are making him think that he is more than he is and makes you look desperate. Try to keep in mind that sex does not equal love.  Chin up, walk proud and learn from your mistakes. Good Luck:)
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres
I would suggest you go into greater detail regarding this question, because it does not make sense, therefore we cannot help you with a reasonable answer.
My answer to this question is that I don't understand the question.
Just be yourself. Be warm, friendly and natural. They will either like you or they won't, and if they don't you really don't need them in your life.
have you ever heard of a penial implant? check into that!!
Whats the gurantee that the lady will not leave you in future . Better let her live own life.Reality says today you dig a hole for others , tomorrow you will fall in that hole.
yes it is. The internet is just a mean, like some others out there. Love can florish everywhere
Have you tried looking on their website? If not try that and also try contacting them and they should be able to assist you.
if you care about this guy that much and he does you no matter what you do for him is sure is goin to be great. but some thought in to in. talk to his family and friends  have afun make it unforgetable and keep in touch. he may not be your boyfriend but he can be your friend and that is better then nothing.
I've done it. Met a lot of losers (about 125), but finally did meet a good guy. Won't do it again if this relationship fails.
This site is good, I just started messing with it and it is actually educational. Try joining a yahoo group.
No families should stick together. By the way most people have sex before they are married.
actually, length isnt that big of an issue. anything past 5 or 6 is just wasted length because we cant feel any extra length in there because of nerves ending or something like that. So 6 inches is just dandy but it definately doesnt need to be any longer if that's what you're thinking lol. Width on the other hand... well that's a different story entirely lol
"Evaluate how you feel about your significant other. Do you love him/her more than you thought you could love anyone? If so, that's a good indication that he is ""the one."" Can you imagine yourself with someone else? If so, then maybe he's NOT ""the one."" Just stand back and take a good, long, hard look at your feelings towards him/her. If you really love being with him/her and can't imagine life without him/her, then chances are, you're all set.\n\nGood luck!"
It is totally all right as we all can see kids coming before marriages this is all about u .. and how u handle it... if u are fine with the thought of a child before marriage no body can stop u .. go anywhere .. for example ur girlfriend and ask her .. i hope she says yes and then ur desire is full filled... but acc. to our culture sex is prefered to be done after marriage .. then no one will stop u to f.uck....
well....it depends...someone could claim that it was consensual sex but the victim actually was raped..and plus you should be saving yourself untill your married..don'tbe having sex at like 15 or 16..but other than that if you really have strong feelings for a person thats older...i guess its kinda your choice
No using a vib-rator will not make you miss your period...stress, pregnancy, extreme weight loss are just a few things that can though.
"bring up something stupid...it always gets his attention. like today, dakota said do u even have a mom or does she live somewhere else and i said ""no, she lives in ur shoe and he cracked up."
When people love eachother, they don't really care about the bible. And they should not. If there is love between two people, that is the most important. Not what it is said in the Bible.
i think thats really cool. You are proving your ability to financially provide for yourself, which is why women want men who dont live at home. Having your mom there looks good in this situation, because you are showing that you are loyal and caring.
I do. I'm not religious, and the thing I belive in is each individual. You are your only owner and therefor you sexand your sex desires belong only to yourself, so if you want to practice sex and are old enough, mature enough and you've taken all the precautions you can have sex whenever you want to. Some people think sex belongs to marriage, some others believe that one should only have sex with someone they love (that's my case) and some others think it is ok to have sex with whoever you want to if both of the partners agree on it. From my opinion, all the choices are as respectable. Nobody is morally superior for waiting to have sex until marriage, that is just a personal decission that has to be respected.
because they want to be the first one to ask you out. they are too proud and they are still thinking of ways the perfect way to ask you. strategizing. but their plan gets ruined when they get asked out. thus, they say no!
Probably the set-up where we went bowling, he got drunk yet talked about how well he could hold his alcohol, told me stories about how he'd been busted for drugs in the past and was on probation and that his wife wouldn't let him see his sons without supervision.   Then he ran out of money and asked if he could borrow some to buy some more drinks....\n\nThat same night while in the bowling alley, I ran into my boss - embarrassed as I was to be seen with this guy, it was not near as embarrassing for him, because he was there on a date too - but not with his wife!!\n\n\nLOL
because this often leads to sex... i would watch out if i were you. there are lots of freaks out there
I don't know you but I would like to have a crush on you, unless you are under 18 then I can't have a crush on you
hey tyler! this is philip! uhhh your pretty dumb.jk  uhhhh does your question mean about me teasing you about khuyen? and yvonne?\n\n\n\nand whats ur email address????????? chow mein palace samurais!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To him you will always be that woman he fell in love with though you've long since evolved into someone who barely remembers the woman you were then. The greatest irony of life is just this: in the final analysis, all we have is what we can remember.
"I can only speak for myself here, but it actually a combination of a few things:\n\n1.  I love to have my wife lavish me with attention on occasion.  \n2.  While I really enjoy ""regular"" sex, while we're ""involved"" I want her to enjoy herself as well.  However, I can only focus well on one thing at a time.  If I am occupied with pleasing her I cannot focus on my pleasure and the experience sometimes leaves something to be desired.\n3.  I enjoy things a little ""kinky"" occasionally.  While ""regular"" sex is great, I like to have things spiced up from time to time.\n\nOral sex allows me to forget about focusing on her pleasure, and enjoy the experience for myself.  Since I can relax and not have to worry about her, the pleasure is increased in intensity and enjoyability.  It's also reassuring that she loves me enough want me to experience this level of pleasure.\n\nRest assured, I always take care of her afterward as my little way to say ""thank you""."
"Well I can't really help you on ""y cant i open up to new relationships"" cause you haven't provided any details but in my opionion inorder to become more ""available"" you just have to show the real YOU and when you do start a new relationship don't ever push that person away. Let them come close to you and atleast try to help you with your problems even if you know they can't possibly help you. Let them ""in"" your life"
how about this for a response...why can't GUYS be upfront about their feelings????  sometimes it is just lust she is after adn maybe there was some sexual chemistry that she didn't expect...
Ah, it's hard, I know.\n\nMine has been deployed overseas for 18 months. He sends e-mail, and calls when he can, but it is so hard.\n\nWait. Be patient. \n\nWrite to him, call him when you can. Look around for cheaper overseas long distance.\n\nIf you really love him, just wait. Be true.
no but am asuming he will be faithfull to me as i am to him\n\nI'm from Cairo, Egypt
"Yes I do, because it took away his attention from me and made him want to be on the computer for longer then he usually would be on for.  He started talking to this chick from texas about a year ago and he didn't see exactly WHAT he was doing that was upsetting me.  Little comments the chick would make pissed me off too like ""if only things were different"" or ""boy if i lived closer your wife would REALLY be pissed"".  STuff like that made HER sound like 'the other woman'.\n\nThen I had had enough and wrote him a long letter (talking to him about it just made us yell) about it and pointed out a lot of the things she said in her IMs that bothered me and told him that when she says ""if only things were different and you werent marreid"" it would have showed me his devotion to me by saying well I am married and happily.  \n\nAfter he finally realized that the conversations (they were on the message archive on yahoo messenger) sounded like they were coming from a cheating spouse and a homewrecker woman, he stopped.  Sometimes he and I cyber with people out of boredom but when it turns into a rush to get home to talk to one specific person or it turns into a I can't come to bed with you right now I am chatting, thing then it is time to worry."
You will never be able to pick a best answer.  Love is the forever unknown.  The first time you think you're in love, you're not.  You just have a very strong emotional connection to that person.  When you are actually in love it will hit you one day that you are, it will surprise you.  And once you lose it, it's going to scar you, so bad that some people don't know how to cope and actually shutdown.  But you can live again and love again.  But you will never love in the same way.  Love is universal.  Even animals have it.  I've seen where monogamous mates will die, and the other will die shortly there after, why?  I say love.  Always remember love isn't all we need, but we definitely need it.
just tell him you wanna have it and injoy it while you can
It really depends on the person and the kind of breakup she is going through. I think the best thing to do is be her friend right now, she will need someone to lean on who doesnt have an agenda. Once she has gotten past her divorce she might see you as something more, but until then I think the only thing you can be is patient.
Everyone tells me how pretty I am but as a child/teenager I felt like an ugly duckling because I never had a boyfriend growing up.  What I have come to realize is that I wasnt into the fast things everyone else was in to (sex, mostly) and so no one wanted to date me.  Guys are also intimidated by pretty girls so sometimes you have to be the aggressor.  If there is someone you like approach them, sometimes dealing with rejection is the best way to learn how to gain acceptance.  Walk, talk, and feel that you look good and that you are good; people will notice your strong attitude and you will get noticed. Be outgoing, talk to people even if you don't know them or you are shy, make yourself it does pay off. Let me know how it goes.....
http://www.divorcenet.com is a good source of general information\n\nChildren over 18 are not eligible for child support.  Spousal support is difficult to get and depends on your situation.  You should get an attorney in order to find out what the best outcome will be.  Most attorneys will give you this information at a first meeting.  Often the first consultation is free.  Then you can get a better idea of what your situation will be like.  Most likely you won't get much, so you need to plan ahead.
Let them know where you stand and that they have no influence or control over your life.
girls dont need to ACT smart, they ARE smart! boys usually ACT smart so they feel that the girls do the same... it might take boys their lifetime to figure out a girl's mind and attitude...it not their piece of cake!
it found me when i wasnt looking for it
if you are in the year 2047 and jane jannet or jennifer( i see fem j but i cant feel stronger between these 3) are not with you, the #s will be less than37 but more than 3 this is your one shot... sorry for the wait
YES. We are all ANIMALS, any guy tell you different, he is a liar. What seperates a primate and a REAL man is a REAL man keeps his urges in check.
I am in a long distance relationship.  It's not terribly far (about an hour), but with our schedules, it seems farther.  It's a new relationship (2 months so far), but it's going very well for us.  We chat, email, talk on the phone, and see each other on most weekends.  If you really want to be with someone, the distance is a necessary thing, no matter how much it sucks.  It's just one more thing to strengthen your relationship.  And the time we do spend together is that much more special.:)
"As idrathernotsay says, we form our most important impression of others in no time at all. \nI'd only like to add that I believe you are mistaken when you think that we know ""it's going to work out"". We have formed an idea of a person and we treat them a certain way, expecting somthing or other. None of this means that we are right. Our first impression of somebody can be completely wrong (and often is)."
"I think he is trying to let you down easy.  He is probably just using it as an excuse to do his own thing.  I think he wants you to think ""do i really want to be the one to hold my boyfriend back"".  Think about it? Or maybe you are smothering him to much and he wants his space."
"Hey, I have something that might help.... I was actually thinking of telling you that you could write her a few letters...but then I thought of something I got from my aunt one time when I was in shock over something. As we know, shock is hard to heal. But this letter made me feel much better. You should copy and paste it into Word and print it out for her. Put it into an unsealed envelope with her name on front of the envelope (or whatever you call her) and hand it to her. Trust me, it will work.\n\n\n(insert her name),\n\nPeople come into your life for a reason, a season, or a lifetime. When you figure out which it is, you know exactly what to do.\n\nWhen someone is in your life for a REASON, it is usually to meet a need you have expressed outwardly or inwardly.\n\nThey have come to assist you through a difficulty, to provide you with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally or spiritually. They may seem like a godsend, and they are. They are there for the reason you need them to be.\n\nThen, without any wrong doing on your part or an inconvenient time, this person will say or do something to bring the relationship to an end.\n\nSometimes they die. Sometimes they walk away. Sometimes they act up or out and force you to take a stand.\n\nWhat we must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled; their work is done. The prayer you sent up has been answered and it is now time to move on.\n\nWhen people come into your life for a SEASON, it is because your turn has come to share, grow, or learn. They may bring you an experience of peace or make you laugh. They may teach you something you have never done. They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy.\n\nBelieve it! It is real! But...only for a season.\nLIFETIME relationships teach you lifetime lessons; those things you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation. Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person/people (anyway); and put what you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas of your life.\n\nIt is said that love is blind but friendship is clairvoyant.\n\n\n[then on the back side of the same paper,  with your own handwriting do this]\n\n(insert her name),\n\nPlease think about this.

Sex is not the reason why people get married. Although sex is a part of married life, what's more important are love, commitment, and respect between the couple.\n\nIf you are getting married for reasons other than love and commitment, then DON'T!!!
Oh, I  heard all sorts of things about trying to rid yourself of a hickey when I was a kid, We tried ice packs, peanut butter, cover up make up, combing it....sorry to tell you none of it works...Only TIME will take it away. Turtle necks will at least hide it, but unless you live in a cold climate it won't be a choice. Best bet is not to let it happen again. They really are nasty looking, and amount to nothing more than a bruise, and people staring and talking about you.
"It might not be easy because you still have feelings for her, but you clearly should move on. Actions speak louder than words. If she is crazily in love with you, do you REALLY think she will break up with you? It's more like, ""hmm, I may not be ready for a bf, but I love him soooo much... XXXX it, I'm going out with him!!!""\n\nDon't let her confuse you bro. Let's say she WERE telling the truth, well the girl is not ready man (and she never will, because she really is not interested in you), go find some other nice girl who is hot and appreciates you. YOu will be happier."
Realizing too late in my freshman year in college what a hick I actually was. It was something a little condescending and patronizing someone said about a stupid, tacky plaque hanging on my wall.  It wasn't that it turned me into a snob all at once at that moment - on the contrary, it made me really self-conscious. I think I realized how narrow my experience had been. Oddly, it made me more curious and more willing to expand my mind & broaden my taste. It helped me learn to be the guy - for better or worse - I've become.
Guys and Girls are equally just as strange in their tactics for courting.\n\nThere are some different possibilities for your situation. I definitely need more specific information about how this guy is acting. But I’ll give it a shot.\n\nGuys are afraid that if they act like they like a girl too much that they will be turned off and ditch the guy.\n\nGuys are also afraid that if they put them selves out there to much they don’t want to get used by the girl.\n\nSome guys Ignore girls for an ego boost. Acting like they don’t give a poo about it. Mainly because it makes your more of a player if you act like you don’t need girls cause you already have so many.\n\nI doubt that this guy might be ignoring you because he is afraid of rejection by you. Some guys just ignore girls they like so they don’t have to deal with rejection. I’m guilty of that.\n\nOr he could just be a dick and not give a poo about you. And he could be just using you for whatever it is he might get.\n\nAnother option is he might just be really busy, caught up in his life. I go to school and work and girls don’t get to see me all the time they tend not to like the fact that I don’t have a whole lot of spare time to see them.\n\nWell I think that kinda covers some ground on the subject. I hope that helps. Good luck.
If you're not already seeing someone and they're not already seeing someone, then there's probably no problem with it.  Just make sure to have protected sex as it would just be a slap in the face to get a disease from someone whom you'll never see again.  Some people have been in serious relationships and/or marriages that have ended in disaster, and can't bring themselves to get deeply involved with another person again.  A one-night stand or sex-buddy can often solve this problem but by doing this continually, you are denying the existance of your emotions, which may eventually cause problems.  So, I think I'd say that if you just want to have a few nights of fun before eventually settling down, then that's probably okay... just play safe and keep in touch with your feelings and listen to your gut instincts.
"Your 6-foot puppy probably is sorry - sorry he got caught, sorry you said ""see ya"" and sorry that he doesn't have a comfortable place to live.  Take it from someome who let the idiot back 6 - count 'em: 6 times.  Its not like I'm some stupid girl, I am an attorney, I was with him for 10 years and some part of me just thought it would all turn out ok.  It didn't.  Eventually he left me for the same girl that he got involved with 6 months earlier - and of course he was so sorry then - but when she called him telling him she missed him, well what could he say?  So he left me for her.  And somehow I was upset about this - ahh the human mind.  Anyway - your puppy is never going to change.  My new mantra will be - one chance - if I realy realy like you, anything more than that and you're out.  Who knows, maybe it will be less than one chance.  I suggest the same for all women, unless they like the abuse..."
"When your husband comes home, greet him with a wonderful greeting and sweet smile! \n\nTasty meals, clean house.\n\nWear attractive clothes.\n\nJoke and play games with your husband - \nA mans secret: they seek women who are light-hearted and have a sense of humour. \n\nThank your husband for the nice things he does. \n\nAn argument is a fire in the house. When you fight back, you are only adding wood to the fire. Watch how sweetly an argument will end when you just say sincerely, ""Look, I'm sorry. Let's be friends."" \n\nListen and try understanding him!\n\nTry to think of what a best friend means and be one to your spouse. This may mean sharing interests, experiences, dreams, failures and upsets. \n\nEncouragement, praise, and gratitude should be expressed on a regular basis, which will strengthen these qualities and be beneficial in developing others. An attempt should be made to overlook or ignore negative characteristics.\n\nIt is not enough to share meals, chores and small talk together. Spouses should also find time to focus on strengthening the relationship. Often couples get busy with their own separate tasks and forget about working on one of the most important elements in life. Quality time may be anything from having a quiet, profound conversation to going for a nice long nature walk, to sharing a special hobby or project. \n\nExpess feelings often.\n\nNever Bring up Mistakes of the Past \n\nSurprise Each Other at Times :) \n\nNever yell at each other unless the house is on fire. Of course, house fires do not occur very frequently; yelling should occur at about the same rate.\n\nNever go to sleep with an argument unsettled. This is one of the worst things that can happen in a marriage and should be avoided as much as possible. This allows hurt feelings and thoughts to linger and generally exacerbates the problem."
are you serious? If they are smart enough to be wealthy they are smart enough not to advertise for gold diggers over the internet. By the way, do you know where I can find any dumb single rich men?

i am sorry to say, but once you break a girl's heart you leave room for another to come mend it. now i am not saying that she's off with another guy, but i think you pretty much ruined your chances of getting back with her, long distance relationship or not, when a girls hurt, especially by lying it's hard for them to believe anything that a guy says to them afterwards. if you really loved her, you would have treated her better while you were still together, wouldnt' you agree? just move on and try to do better in your next relationship. good luck to you.
sounds to me like she just really likes you..don't think to much into it...just see what happens..could turn out to be a good relationship and if she tries something and you think all she wants is to jump you and thats not what  you want move on...that simple
No. Just antisocial.
I think it is fairly normal. I am a younger sister to three brothers and I think it can just make you nervous because you don't want your brother to get hurt and their is girls stepping into your territory. At first I  did'nt like any of my brothers girlfriends but after a while I was OK. Just give her time she'll eventually come around.
by finding what kinds of stuff he likes to do and doing them
Ego.  They don't want anyone else to have you.
Ditto on the first answer, it depends on your age, but if you really like her don't be afraid to wait for her:) trust me, if you're willing to wait and she sees that, you'll get major bonus points when the right time comes!! and while you're waiting for her to be 'ready', still be close with her - just make sure you don't pressure her too much or anything like that;)
The common saying is that opposites attract, a person might be looking for someone with strengths and characteristics which they themselves may be weak in.
Follow your heart. Don't do things cos you want to please other people.You sacrificed once don't do it again. Always remember age is nothing but a number!! At first you will hear alot of nasty things but it will past. People will have to except it. You have to be happy...If you are getting the love you waited for take it now and also return it as-well..Her about the past..just come clean..good luck..

Its very hard to stop when you have already done it. That's like taking a step backward but if you feel this is what you want to do you have to be strong enough to stop it. No one else can stop you but you

i think you are going to be ok with this. i believe that you will find a better love, than what you have ever expected, keep in your heart the good times, and pass them on to your new lover.  go where you are wanted. like your self, and other's will too.
You can be sure that someone truly loves you by the actions they express.
As for women - most generally agree that her personal issues need to be met in order to feel free to be intimate.  For instance: rent overdue? Child sick? these matters can distract from intimacy, and appear as a cold spell. \n\nFor a guy - supposedly we have a comparmentalized psyche that allows us to be romantic even if we just got out of a war zone.  However, harmones ebb and flow, and, if a guy is self concisous about an issue not even related to you, he can appear cold - like his weight may be a little up this morning, or a cut in pay may make him feel less manly and attractive...
Not all men are like this.  Some of them are quite decent and truly care about their children and wives.  Unfortunately, the jerks get most of the attention.  To all the good men out there: God bless you!
I have not seen numbers for 2005, but have seen figures from 1975 and 1988 that indicate that approximately twice as many women file for divorce as do men, or about 66% of divorces (and some figures indicate as high as 75% of divorces) are filed by women.
He probably doesn't hate you. Were you two fighting before you tried calling him? Were you trying to bring up a subject he didn't want to talk about? This has happened with my friends more times than I can count, and none of them hate me. Just give him time to cool off, and try him again.
I don't know what you mean...there is when you love two people but are only with one...that could be the other love\n\nother love could also be..\n\nlove for your neighbors\nlove for yourself\nlove for your friends\nlove for family\nlove for something you do\nlove for certain things\n\nthere are so many kinds don't know what you are refering to
[..insert sound of chirping crickets here..]
never even heard about this
But what about Sean??
It is time to choose . A career showing and flaunting your body . Or possibly a full and rich life with your true love. Sorry you can not have both. Just look at the life of the famous broken homes marriages and lives for almost every one of them.This will be the price you pay for your chosen field. Like the old saying goes Money cant buy you love .It can give you much sadness and turmoil in your life.Your talent and beauty can only last so long, then when it fades you will be all alone.\n Please ask you self is it really worth it.
you answered your own question...you keep the same past relationships...move on.  you said you played or got played with these women...fair exchange so no robbery.  put out what you want to get back for starters.  don't hate the players, hate the game...especially since its of your own making.  why don't you rest your mind and your body...take a break, do some good things to and for yourself. after awhile get back out there and play it as it lays or not, and just take your chances.  i find that the worst case of lonesome, is when someone is right there with you.  having somebody is not always better than having nobody, if they aren't the right one.  \n\nmaybe you keep the past connections because you know what these women will do.  this means you can't be hurt or disappointed by them anymore.  it sounds like you are afraid to be alone.  you probably judge other women based on these past experiences.  if you keep dealing with the same type of women...that's on you.  examine your own expectations and make the necessary adjustments if you want a different outcome.
It really depends on the circumstances. My parents got divorced when I was young because my dad was having sex with other women and he was abusive to my mom. The Bible says that it is ok to get a divorce in cases of infidelity. I would also think that if a woman was being abused that it would be ok too.
I do not care how conservative he seems...99% of the time any guy is up for anything. Take the lead and do what you want...he will follow
Suck it up be a man and tell her how you feel. Or, call the newspaper, print your obit and have a friend mail it to her.
If he looks dircetly in your eyes when u two talk or looks at u alot
movie theatre??
well my darling all i can say  is : TRUST, security, and SAFETY if you catch my drift.
Your brother better be careful. There may very well come a day when his child(ren) could marry a black person or his grandchildren could. Things have a way of coming back and  biting people in the ass.
Sounds to me like he really likes you...you hurt him when you pushed him away in the past, and as much as he still likes you he doesn't want to give in and just go out with you, he still can't get over being turned down, guys are like that, they are so full of pride and it makes them look bad being turned down, so he's showing you how it feels, it will pass...just don't give  up if you really like him...
Keep looking. Probably his way of say no with out saying it to you.
welcome to the world...  polyamourous as well check out the source down below im sure youll find what youre looking for we have!!!!
Yes Mam! They will get married and have 6 children. Then they will star on a soap opera! They are my favorite people in the whole entire world. Good luck to the both of you!
I couldn't do it for the longest time either.  i thought i never would.  then i was with a guy that actually cared to find what i like.  it was like the mental block was lifted!  i get off more often than not now.  you just have to know what you like and go for it.  just get lost in the feelings.  deep grinding works well for me, but the g spot is the best. a little messy at times, but definitely worth it.
Absolutely! Older women are very sexy. Probably teach you a few things too.
"If you have told him how you feel and nothing has changed, why waste your time.  You do not have to go into a relationship thinking "" this is the one"" each time.  But if you truly think he is the one for you try to work it out.  It may be that you are not the ""one"" for him.  He may be gun shy and time is what he needs.  Then again, he may not want to settle down again.  How does the old saying go? "" Why buy the cow when the milk is free?""  Give him some time apart and maybe he will realize he wants to be with you.  Be careful though, ultimatums usually spoil any relationship. Good Luck!"
Around 3am i was awakened and encouraged to be a participant and it was WONDERFUL!!!!!!!! I slept like a baby and my day has been pretty good so far!

Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.\nif you still feel all the above from this man after all these years... then cherish him from today onward..
I think this is so superficial.  A good man can be any height.
Nope, i dont think so. He told me he loves me more !!
ask him if he hastes you
No it is not a sin but you do need to figure out which guy you want to date before you have feelings for the other...
"I like a variety, personally.  Never the ""same old thing"".  The best part though is when you like it.  My experience is that most men could care less the color or consistancy of your nails, but when you are happy you are sexier and brighter and happier.  So color you nails in a way that makes you happy and you'll be making him happy."
The Kama Sutra has excellent advice on how the groom might conduct himself on the wedding night. I strongly suggest that you read it, and I do mean READ, not just look at the incredibly beautiful and erotic illustrations.\nCongratulations and may your marriage see long years, great joy and small troubles.
Well I have heard all kinds of things but what I have heard that it's not as bad as you may think. Just think about this, if it was really that bad, then there would be alot more virgins in this world lol.\n\n And being 23 and a virgin is nothing to be afriad of. So don't worry yourself over this, it will be fine.\n\n I hope you find this helpful. \n\n -Void
I think you really have to ask yourself if you are truly unhappy with things the way they are? I know that you would like to feel a 100% commitment from this guy, but if he's shying away, perhaps you really don't need anything more than what you already have. I feel that in most instances, to make a relationship work demands communication, and if you tell him what is important to you and he doesn't want to acknowledge your needs, then that isn't a relationship as much as getting comfortable with someone. The guy sounds like a keeper who is just looking to stay away from going thru a hassle of a wedding (don't try telling me weddings aren't a hassle). I am not a doctor, but I sometimes feel the same way about my girlfriend. Maybe she's a little too wrapped up in her life to truly notice what I am looking for. We've been together for 10 years and still aren't married. I want it, she says no rush. (Reversed roles) Call me old fashioned. Hope this has helped somehow...\n\nTake care and let me know how you make out
Go where the white guys are.  Health clubs, sports bars, golf courses.
i disagree with everyone else who's answered.  you don't need to tell him this on the second date - just go out and have fun and don't stress.\n\nthen if you still feel this same way at the end of the second date, you can just hint at not being interested in a third date and if he can take a hint he'll probably appreciate that you didn't come out and crush his pride.
Your running days are over lover!
maybe because you never felt being inlove before thats why your not interested. or probably you got hurt so bad that you have isolated yourself falling inlove again. that happens. someday someone will come along and show you how to feel love. never lose hope. believe me being inlove is one thing no one can take from you. its one of the few things you can call your own. try it. you might like it.
This is funny, Theres this girl im interested in and she smokes. If i had a choice I would perfer her to not smoke, however I cant make her stop doing something she wants to do. As a person, this in NOOOO way make me like her less. I can look past the fact she smokes and like her for who she is, not what she does.
You cheated the same day you got engaged?  Wow - that's pretty cheesy.  Was it before or after you accepted his proposal?
a beautiful woman is one with a good heart, a sharp mind, and a gentle touch. \n\nphysically, she should be real. with flaws. and she is able to accept all of this, and can walk proud on any street.\n\na beautiful woman is someone who knows enough, knows that there's always something to learn, knows all her own inner & outer flaws, but loves herself anyway.
ofcourse he might has feelings to u, but it does not change anything cause, u should never return to the person u left once. then, these feelings could have another nature, being not old love, something between man and woman, but just normal warm feelings of the people, who used to be close.\n\nand the last but not the least, honey is too doubtful. it could be ironic, see?
The act of urinating on another person, usually for sexual gratification, or as a way of humiliation. More common than a Golden bath, where, during an*l-sex, one partner urinates into the colon of the other.\n\nhttp://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=golden+shower&r=f\n\n: )
"this is a girl's perspective:start off by finding the courage to ask her out and take her somewhere nice but not too ""couply"",if you see what i mean..don't be too agressive cause tou may scare her off..then you can tell her how you feel and make it sound really genuine but do not make her feel sorry for you coz you are hopelessly in love with her or something..and if she's worth your love she will accept..definately..good luck man!"
Investigate further and discover the truth.\nIf it was a false alarm don't ever mention it to him or her.\nIf he cheated talk with your sister first and tell her you have a fantasy of a threesome with a woman and your husband and tell her you need someone that can keep her mouth shut and ask her if she can do it as a personal favor to you. \nAfter she agrees talk to you husband and tell him you have a fantasy about a threesome with another woman and ask him if she knows someone that can keep her mouth shout.\nHe won't suggest your sister. But he will agree to bring a female friend.\nHave fun and after a few times suggest your sister for a threesome and have some more fun.\nThen invite a male friend (A Black with a bigger (CENSORED) than your husband) and have some more fun.\n\nOr get a divorce\n\nThe choice is yours
I think that if you know someone, but you don't see him very much then you can be in love with him. I don't think its about how oftn u see him, but i reckon its how u are when your 2gether
Kissing her/him. If U kiss her/him and feel like butterflies in your stomach, definitely U feel love and If U feel unconfortable with that or after that it ain't love just some kind of attraction.
Get pictures taken with all of them. Go to a photobooth and make funny faces or get a real camera and take pictures of you and your friends all together.\n\nGive them individual letters telling them how much you cherish their friendship. Include things you'll never forget and inside jokes.

Poor spelling and grammar skills?
Talk honestly with your dad and listen to what he says. I don't know your dad, but I imagine him as a loving father who wants the best for his princess. Maybe he sees something in that guy that you can't see because love makes your eyes seeing blurry. Your dad is a man who has seen many things through his life and knows what could happen to you if you are with some kind of guys. Remember, your dad is there to take care of you and guide you. He is not there just because he wants to find a way to make your life miserable.
I had the same situation w/a girlfriend and I am female.  I told her the truth that I wasn't interested in being that way or even experimenting. Just be honest and tactful and tell the truth about how you feel....You care about him but are not interested in those type of relationships.  You just want to remain friends but that if that were going to be a problem for him then you will understand if he can't be friends with you. It may hurt him too much to be friends and see you but not 'be' with you.  So be understanding and hope he will be too.
When you're 12 and there's a parent filter, wikipedia gets blocked
This will only get worst. Leave.
I think its usually because of sex.  Most times when you look at cheating situations its because the man doesn't feel he gets enough sex at home.  The fact it generally happens with younger women is because younger females are more apt to be looking for sex than older ones and younger women tend to look toward older men.
dont take her to a restraunt. take her out on a picnic by a larg romantic body of water where no one will bother you
"The place where the sperm was deposited and the place where urine evacuates the body are in the same region, but it is NOT the same place. The urine is not ""rinsing away"" the sperm. It is not even touching it."
This is easy...get him alone at a place where there will be no distruptions before he leaves. Tell him how you feel and use that now or never train of thought. Keep optimistic about it. I married my husband after he was my best friend for four years.
yep but sorry we are only hiring over the age of 18 right now
introduce him to it gently.  but if you find that it's not his thing, consider getting out of there!  no relationship can work without sexual satisfaction.
Give him two days and then drop him a line.
"Be upfront and honest with him. If he is truly your friend, don't hurt him by stringing him on with ""maybe"" because that's not fair. Tell him, ""You are very dear to me as a friend, but I am just not attracted to you romantically. I hope this doesn't change our friendship, because it's very valuable to me.""\n\nStraight, to the point, simple. All people need is for us to be honest with them."
sorry can't help you
LOL, that is funny dude. Weel I think the binoculars are a dead giveaway, she is stalking you! Stay away from her. Be careful.
they checked their last chance before they get trapped
the person you're waiting for will come one day so u dont have to rush
move on and ask someone else.  he's too stuck up on himself.
Think. How long were you together? Did you have fun with each other? Why did they leave? You know if you let some thing go and if it comes back then truely it was yours but if it leaves and never comes back then it was never yours to begin with.
I know exactly how you feel! I found out all kind of stuff AFTER i married my husband. I think  when guys find a girl they like, they dont want to scare her off or intimidate her. They wait until they are for sure the girl likes them to be themselves. Although , us girls dont really like it when they do that, guys jsut dont get it. But if you truly love that guy, you will work through it together, and communicate your feels as well.
You tell her that your willing to take that risk in order to get to know her better and become closer to her.

It would be the difference of naked bodies rubbing against each other wet -and- naked bodies rubbing against each other with a giant piece of pastic food wrap between. Thanks for asking.
Honestly, you will have to realize that he is the father of this child. Chances are that he will still be in contact with her and the little one. What you should do, if you do not feel comfortable at the moment, is talk to him about this situation. It is hard being in your position because it would be one where you are not directly involved, but one in which could affect you in the near future. Speak up to him, tell him what you feel and try to find some sort of trust in all this.
Ladies LOVE nice guys, sad truth is most women go through a stage where they want excitment. Its all about lust, and thrill. But eventully they mostly get over that, and when we're tired of getting treated like dirt then we want a nice guy. Sometimes it takes a while for the reality to set in. Dont get discouraged. Eventully we all want that nice guy to settle down with. Give it time. No worries
You marry the person who you want to spend the rest of your life with. If she makes you happy and glad to be with her...K
"It makes since to be afraid of the answer you will receive, because it hurts to hear no...but you'll never hear the word yes if you live in fear of the word no...When and where do you usually see her?  Is there a time when the two of you are ever away from other people?  Just be honest and say something like, ""I just really want to ask you out..."" and see what she has to say.  It's way more scary BEFORE you do it, but you can ask her!"
if i you said that yous a good fella
It seems to me that you had something very special with this guy there are not many guys that will allow you to share your bedroom with others seems you had the best of both worlds. Well what can we do to get you back in, right now he is not going to trust you right away so get use to that your road will be a hard one when you are not togather he will assume that you are with someone else can you handle that if so hang in there for as long as you can if it gets to be to heavy for you try to just be his friend/sex partner but tell him what you want from now on good luck........
if you haven't gone anywhere together, then ask them to goto the movies with you in a friendly way and see what happens.
NO
Are you Ovulating, Menstruating, or PMSing???
why ride a skateboard when you can drive a cadillac!..hell ya..make'em giggly, wiggly and jiggly!
i guess you need to be nice and sincere, but don't try to be what you're not. Mix around with different types of ppl and don't form an opinion about them before really knowing them. You should have many hi-bye friends, so introduce yourself!

It is not a big deal at all! Trust me I am 29 and I regret not waiting longer. So do what you think is right..not others! And don't let them pressure you into something that is supposed to be special and meant for marriage. I know 3 people that are still virgins and they are 25,26,and 28. And they are waiting for marriage. Stick with it..and trust me you will have plenty of time in your life for such things :) BTW YOU GO GIRL! God Bless :)
yes, because when she thinks about breaking up with him, she will always remember that you are right there waiting and want her,,,go for it
not a dating site - thanks for the 2 points
I do hope your brothers and mom all see this message!\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY BROTHERS! ;)
get abs! tight stomach is important to ALL GIRLS
You should say something to your loved one, mostly how to stop being a doormat and learning to stand up for themselves. No one can walk over them without their permission.
you should have spaghetti(remember beuty and the tramp?)hehehe the spaghetti scene =)tell me if it works out!
People look for love because they need to be loved.  It is just human nature.  Sadly some people never find the love that they are looking for.
Wouldn't it be worse if you had sex with him and then broke up and you found out that was all he had been waiting for?  I'm sorry, I know that it hurts to break up but don't let that be influenced by the whole sex question.  You made a very personal choice to wait to have sex and that choice is still just as valid today as it was before.  It is still something special that you will be able to share with the guy of your dreams one day.
I was 15. Bad idea. It wasn't with anyone I really liked, just a friend. Here's some advice; wait until you find someone who loves and appreciate you. When the time is right, you'll know. BTW, if you have to ask yourself if you're ready for sex, chances are you're not ready. Enjoy your youth and your day.
i think the guy should be asking you out
You should tell him your sorry but you just dont like him like that. and if you two go any father ya might mess up ya friend ship for ever so tell him we were meant to be friends.

Any relationship between two human beings is acceptable to me.  As long as those people are happy it shouldnt matter if others find it acceptable or not.
Love is the best gift, but if you re looking for something physical.... everyone is different and you have to know what that person likes and doesn't like. If there is something that they wish they had or always wanted, that's probably where you should start your research
No I don't think all men flirt, heck some don't do it unmarried. But there are men that are just born flirts, they don't even realize it until some girl takes it too far and then I step in oopsssss. LOL Not a real big deal in most cases, mine isn't even aware he does it, I just know that I am the lucky girl he always comes home to
turn off the computer, go to somewhere where there are girls, talk to them, ask them questions, \npeople who talk about stuff find the other person interesting\n\ni usually try and figure out what a person is really interested in or an expert in, and ask them questions about that,  after a while a girl will take off her clothes for me\n\nyou wont get that here on yahoo answers
Very funny. But I'll bet you get people who will tell you. Lets see how many get it wrong.
I love all my friends!  They supprot me when I'm crushed, they make me laugh, and I can always count on them to give hugs!  No matter what, I know I'll always remember them as they were, my friends.  Not only do I have girlfriends, but I have a best friend that's a boy and he's so nice!  I don't ever want to loose these people because I love them so much.  They mean so much to me.  I'm so glad you asked this question, because I haven't though about how grateful I am to have such wonderful friends.  And you must be the greatest friend, because you're letting the whole world know that your friends are incredibly important to you.  I admire you're love for your friends.  Rock on!
"Say to him, ""we should hang out sometime.  Maybe this weekend.  Is that good for you?""\n\nIf he's not stupid he'll say yes."
"She's sending you mixed messages, either deliberately or accidentally.\n\nShe may not realize that telling you she misses you a bit sounds to you like an invitation to get back together.  She really shouldn't be telling you this, even if that's how she feels.\n\nTelling you explicitly ""stay away"" is bigger than ""occasionally I have passing thoughts about you."".  So stay away."
Yes, of course. Some people are just not cut out to be demonstrative. They find other ways to express their attachment.
"Can he afford it?  Whose house?  I think both people should\ndecide on what's comfortable, attractive, etc.  If you're going to be his ""decorator,"" then you need to get some input from him about his preferences; otherwise the place might not feel comfortable to him."
Act like it was no big deal but move on, don't ask him out and if he should ask you out again, do him the same exact thing, call him a few minutes before and say you can't make it.  A dose of his own medicine may not be such a bad idea. I am sure you can find someone else who won't have transportation issues.
gone too far in public palces...\nbut gone all the way in a theatre... was really fun.. i still remember the movie.. it was THE RUNAWAY JURY...\nwell don even kno wat hppnd in the movie so had to watch it again...
I'm not a lesbian, but I can say that you are NOT alone with your sexuality. There are many lesbians... so go ahead, shout if you want and be proud for who you are. ;)
There are certainly people incapable of loving anything or anyone. You don't sound like one of them. My guess is you just haven't turned the right page yet. Glory in your freedom and the knowledge that you day will come.
It sounds like he already likes you, if you go off of what he did at the basketball game. One of you needs to make a move now, before it loses momentum and *gets weird*.\n\nTips to avoid *getting weird* while getting your point across:\n\n1. Try not to be too serious about it, no matter how you feel inside. Laughter is a great tension-breaker.\n2. Don't bring it up when there are other distractions around.\n3. Bring it up like you both know where the relationship is going. Because you both do. Don't play dumb about it.\n\nAnd that's it, really. It will work. We have a tendency to make these things bigger in our heads, then we look back and see that it was a small step instead of a large leap. Just give up, surrender...and do it.
i see your problem...you are thinking too much about this. if the guy likes you there is no wrong time to make a move. when it comes to sex or anyhting leading up to sex you can't go wrong with us.
"If you are in a long distance relationship, it can be very trying.  If the couple can be honest and loyal- it could work, but it seems that distance can make a person think lying is a better option, because they figure ""who will find out?""  Ultimately, the whole point of a relationship is to be together, so unless the couple commits to moving or something- I wouldnt recommend starting one up.  It can really mess you up.\n\nOn the other hand if you meet someone far away, it can give you a chance to get to know a lot about each other before you meet face to face- could be good, or bad.  BUT long distance relationships will never last, because togetherness is the goal. Unless thats the KIND of relationship you BOTH want. Eventually someone will have to move closer, or forget about it!  If you move closer together it isnt a long distance relationship anymore, so whether you get together or not- the ""long distance"" relationship has to eventually end. ;)"
Aaaaaaand you're having trouble with this WHY? Common sense dude. She's comfortable with you now. She feels secure. She's opening up. This would be a GOOD thing.
If you know he is not serious, give it a short break and this will drive home the truth
Its always been tough in Ireland.
Have you ever heard of the saying 'Once bitten, twice shy'? To me it makes sense.Personally I have a rule which is to never get back with someone I have broke up with weather it was an amicable break up or not.I made this rule for myself cos I have experienced it and the second time around it hurt even more than it did the first time.I've also watched my friends relationships when they have broke up with someone and then got back with them.Sooner or later the problem comes back.It might be 2 years or it might be 2 weeks but it does eventually come back.But that is only my experiences - it may be different for you.Hope everything works out for you.Good luck
How do you know he won't slip up again? You say you have 3 children from a previous marriage. Do you really want to put your kids lives in danger with this man? I think its best that you just let him go. Find a man that was never an alcoholic and who can be there for you and your children.
let em be dummies and fight it out...its so dumb 2 fight over men
It probably played a role to some degree, but if it lasted 7 years, there was probably more to it than just that.  Hate to say it, but could just be that 7 year itch.  Your relationship reached that point where it takes a lot of effort to move forward and it just wasn't strong enough for that push to make it in the long run.
Get out.  He's going to resist any attempts at you advising him about how to raise his kids and if you discipline them he will undermine your authority.  It will eventually end your relationship.  So get out now before you go through all the heartache and fights.
You should talk to him about and tell him your feelings about how he treats you. If that doesn't work, you gotta dump him.
NO! WHY start ANOTHER SOAP OPERA!\n\nGo have feelings for someone NEW...
DO IT IN THE FRONT... DAT'S DA BEST WAY TO... \n\n\n**LIL MISS VIXION**
I'm sorry Hun, but if he's gay, not much you can do. I'm gay and from experience, it's not him you like, but the way he treats you. He likes you for your mind, not your body. Your best bet is not to let him know, cuz that's when things will get weird. If you wanna persue a relationship, just know that he will be lookin at guys. Your best bet is to head to the mall and scope together. Enjoy what you have.
Not at all!  At least not this guy.  I happen to be shy myself so I can relate better to women who are a little more shy than normal.
Thank God & split the money 60-40 as soon as we get home.
"All I have to add to ""bukroot's"" answer (the first answer you got) is AMEN!  \n\nI couldn't have said it better myself! Follow that advice.  You are overdue for some people to talk to but be patient.  And like she said, try to make something happen, you got nothing to lose."
As long as you're taller than the girl you're after, it should be fine.\n\nWomen like feeling protected so if you're shorter, try to compensate in other ways. Such as being a gentleman, be careful when you're both crossing the street, always be on the side facing the road when you're walking down the street, etc.
I don't believe people choose their sexual orientation, we are all just who we are, attracted to whomever turns us on.
Yes, I think it is time to move on. In your mind it is over however because you were together for so long you don't want to lose him completely out of your life, you want to at least be friends and from the sounds of it your not sure you even want that anymore. You need to get involved in your own life and just keep the communication minimal and slowly it will fade away.  but, you need to live and get back out there into the dating world...there is a lot to see...and it is passing you by..
Um....Becareful what you do or say. Tell him that you need a date to something and you cant find one. Ask him if he wouldn;t mind standing in as your date because you don' twant to be alone and look like a loser. If he stands in for you then its your chance to see if he likes you.
Don't know... i have never gone on a date and i am almost 18!!!  --- i am happy, believe it or not---
Well of course Yes.\nIf u r doing so, u r one of the greatest guy on this world.\nHats off for u\nDont hesitate to do so.
I don't think you are talking about movies as in hollywood .I think you are talking about making a fake video of some one having sex.  Yes it can be done with proper editing and including other porn movie scenes. The way to catch the editing parts is to view the movie and watch for irregularities. You can also watch it frame by frame to check for abrupt changes. Some times the lightning of one scene is different from another.
Having a Kidney disease can not only physically drain but emotionally drain oneself  also, the stress of living day in and day out, I can only imagine, would be overwhelming, what I do know is being emotionally overwhelmed can leave very little normal consideration to share with others..as a matter of fact I am sure he relies on support of friends and family to get him thru the tough times...What may help is for his circumstances that create so much stress be addressed so that his quality of life can be increased to the point where he can feel so good that it can be shared..and I would think you would be the first he would want to shared better days with...it sounds like a tough situation to be in but these are the bad with the good times...do what it takes to improve this bad situation and I beleive good times will follow.

It doesn't sound like a problem. Alott of people like sushi. It seems like it would get boring for you after awhile though. I personally wouldn't mind if you took me to the same place that you took all your other first dates it would just mean that your judging your decision of the date on me and not on the activity.
ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww he/she did dats gross.... tell him/her to go get a life... tell dem to go spy on there mother or somethng... dats jus sick!!!\n\n**LIL MISS VIXION**
i will tell you how, i am a girl. Anyway you should fix up yourself i mean groom yourself and look neat , you should dress really good to cause girls don't easily fall for someone who is filthy,  you  should behave yourself good to well i hope you have manners right?  ok then you should go to the gym and meet new people , make friends and don't trip or you could go a party or something or to the malls etc. but be sure to ask a girl out to a famous reataurant that will get her attention a bit just say the name of the restaurant,  but you gotta have a little money to spend it on girls
There has to be.  Because if there's not, there's no reason to keep trying.  And none of us really want to stop trying
Girl u are crazy if u get married after two months! Trust me--give it time. There is no way on this earth that you know enough about this person in order to marry them. Me and my boyfriend have been together for almost 2 years and we still learn new things about each other everyday. Just wait a while and find ways to really learn about each other. You are still in that lust, crazy about each other, wanna kiss all day phase. Although it is fun, it will eventually fade, but the true love will last if it is meant to be. Just give it time, dont rush it. Good luck

Sex and love are not the same thing. Sex is not an extension of love. Sex is sex and love is love. When the two come together then its great but sex without love satisfies for a brief moment only.\n\nAnd... no having sex with you doesnt mean he loves you.
No, someone needs to protect them from themselves.
most guys will say what ever it takes to get laid...
I understand how important it can be to someone to want to keep their family together but if there are children involved please remember this....\n\nChildren would rather come from a broken home than live in one!
yes!
try posting your inquiry under others...
"Walk up to her and say ""You said I never talk to you so I wanted to come over here and tell you just how hot you look today""."
There should be a number to the jail you can call.  As long as your have her name (and you do) you should be able to at least find out if she is being held there.\n\nGood Luck!!!!!!!!
I think that putting the toilet seat down is common courtesy whether you are male or female. I hate it when things drop into the open toilet because the seat is up. But there are people who see it as no big deal--it's how they were raised.\n\nI'm sure that by now you have explained your reasons for wanting the toilet closed to your bf. I think that you should probably expect to keep having to check the toilet after he uses it for quite some time.\n\nHopefully, he will come around, but I wouldn't hold my breath. We all have little things that our loved ones do that bug us and that we just have to put up with. Sometimes they change but more often, they don't.
I think it would be very hard to remain roommates if you are no longer dating but it could work in your favor as far as giving you a chance to show yourself trustworthy.  If you love him just continue to be trustworthy for him and if it is ment to be he will come around.\nKathy
i love everyone in this world but only 1 person as my lover
Society is more open towards men being overtly sexual. I think most women on the whole are less sexual then men....and are encouraged to be less then they otherwise would be even further by cultural moores.  It's the same reason almost no women admit to touching themselves.  Most men have no problem admitting it.....even comparing techniques.  Personally I find honest women who are open about their sexuality a huge turn on....and women who like porn?  Hell yes!!!  I won't have to hide it when she comes over.  I don't think it's even that unusual for women to watch (although clearly less common then in men).
OMG  My answer    SEEK HELP!!!
Why would a natural process cause someone to feel they have lost their beauty?

Do what makes you happy, ask him if he likes his butt rubbed, if he laughs, tell him you like yours rubbed.
It would be unfair to group them together and say that they all do, but the ones that I know don't. My cousin is 7 years old and she understands it perfectly, and has not problem with it. I think it all depends on the way to talk to your kids about it. Don't let the fear of isolating your kids keep you from having an interracial relationship.

"I'm not answering the question since I don't meet the aforementioned criteria, I'm just posting.  Don't ya just love how all of the answerers ASSUMED you were referring to ""sex""?  I know what you meant.  You meant ""do"" as in what the Mafia does to someone they don't like.  But if you were going to be ""offed"" would it matter so much that they be a straight female?  I would prefer it myself, I suppose.  Maybe she would be a necrophiliac, and I'd be able to get me some even when I was dead.  Now THAT would be something to brag about to my buddies!  Well, assuming they were all dead as well.  And in the same place I go when I die, be it Heaven or Hell.  I hope I go to Heaven.  I sure do wish Taco Bell was still open.  I'm craving some Double Decker Supremes right about now.  Dam, I'm hungry!  I think I'll make a peanut butter and banana sandwich to tide me over.  But as soon as Taco Bell opens I'm gettin' some Double Decker Taco Supremes.  Well, maybe not.  They do give me the runs after all.  Maybe I'll get some pizza instead.  Have I been smoking pot?  I know I haven't.  But I sure do feel like I have been smoking pot.  Dam, they give you WAY too much space to answer these questions!  Speaking of space, I want to go to the moon one day.  Ya know, if we really went to the moon, why aren't there pictures of the flag we supposedly planted?  I mean from a telescope.  Ever thought about that?  I think I may go to Wal-Mart and buy a telescope tomorrow.  Then I will begin my new purpose in life:  To prove once and for all that we DID land on the moon!  Well screw it, I guess there is no limit on space to answer a question.  Time to spank the monkey..."

"I think what they wear doesn't determine their sexual orientation. There are straight men who enjoy wearing women's underwear for the excitement of it being ""naughty"" and the thought of ""getting caught"". \n\nI would venture a guess that the vast majority who do this are straight or bi, and not as many are gay. Not sure why I think this, and I've never dated a man who's wanted to wear my undies. I guess it's just based on the psychology of it. \n\nEither way, if it makes the guy happy and their partners enjoy it, too, more power to 'em!"
Mike Jones, Paul Wall... are you serious???????????????
"The reason why I think that you are so afraid to go out, has something to do with your childhood, you don't know if the same thing will happen or if you'll get rejected, but don't think like that; if you are successful and good looking, and you are proud of yourself, then you should regain your confidence and forget what people say. People are going to be cruel no matter what, but you know what, tell them ""I bet i'm doin better than you are b**ch!"" and move on..."
Soulmate to me means that I can start a sentence and he finishes it just they way I would have. Or to say the exact same thing at the same time. You share your love for each other and you feel complete with that person. You love being together even if its just watching TV or cleaning house. You share your thoughts and dreams and always understand what each other is feeling. You have trust, communication, and respect for each other. You never doubt that they love you and they never doubt that you love them back. It is a feeling of complete peace with each other. That is what a soulmate is.
It varies depending on the guy's personality. Guys who are super-egotistical will start hitting on you as soon as they see you, and in an overt and obnoxious way. Guys who have a balanced amount of self esteem and self confidence will try to srike up a conversation with you about some subject. They will have more respect for you as a person and not simply look at you as a piece of meat. And finally there are those guys who are very shy and nervous around women, and they will try to hide their interest in you but you'll be able to detect it. These guys need to work on their self confidence and usually they will if they are really attracted to you.
No definitely not! One of my best friends is a guy, we hang out all time! My boyfriend is totally cool about it (But that is because he is the greatest guy on earth! teehee)\nJust don't lie to your boyfriend about it, or he may get the wrong idea, and make sure you still spend more time with your boyfriend, and make sure he knows he is more important to you!
In this day an age that is a tuff one so many women and men are only interested in money and possessions it's sad but that is how so many people are. Try getting to know someone without letting them know your wealthy that way they get to know the man not his checking account I wish you luck and happiness I know this situation first hand it can bite anyway Good Luck and Be Happy :)-(:
real love is basically a feeling of attachment that transcends lust/desire, and is more a attachment that can be found between soul mates: people who will tell each other everything on their mind, people who aren't afraid of and know they will not be judged by the other, people who can understand each other even without saying a thing.  Thus, real love does not necessarily have to deal with romance etc., but true/meaningful romance should include true love.
Yeah ... how can i help U
I do not understand this isssue with size - Good Lord! \n\nI have had guys that were smaller than 6 that were great lovers and some that were 10 and HORRIBLE lovers!  It is not WHAT you have, how thick it is, how long or short it is, it's the type of LOVER and match you are for someone.\n\nQuit playing - who's *ick is bigger/better - it's a competition thing between men, and as a 41 yr old woman I can tell ya.... it's not what you have, it's how you learn to use it.  BECOME A GOOD LOVER to your women - no matter WHAT you have and take pride in that.  \n\nAs for statistics, here's one.. according to the site I have listed below - who is a Registered Nurse and Sex Educator for more than 20 years, WOMEN only have nerve endings in the first 1 inch of their vagina's, so see.. we are all really built to handle anything.. :)  RELAX - Accept what God Gave ya and besides - what choice do ya have?
This answer is not intended to justify it and only to explain a possible reason. I think it comes down to natural animal instinct. Having made his wife/girlfriend pregnant his his job is done and his instincts tell him to move on to the next one. The big mystery is why some men give into this urge while others do not.
When you feel the love is on the air.
Your personality is more powerful than your looks. Nice looking people can make there self's ugly if they have a bad personality.
NOT REALLY THEY CAN ASK TO BE ADDED BUT THEY HAVE TO ACCEPT IT AND THEN ALLOW ENTRY.\nweird the way it works but i havent been able to enter from a alTernative id to mine without accepting the entry
show him what feels good that is the only way you are going to accomplish anything. and if you dont feel comfortable telling him then you shouldnt even be having sex
1.Physical attraction.\n2.Dress\n3.Behaviour\n4.Personality\n5.Caring for others\n6.Wealth( how fat his wallet is ! )\n7.Ability ( can he fulfil my dream & desires )
Of course he misses you. Guys may try to act tuff but when their alone they really miss you. There's no doubt about that. He'll probably think about you for along time. Especially if you went out for a long time. The longer you went out the longer he will think about you!
The fateful ones...\nThough I would agree,a relationship based on friendship has\nmany chances to succeed...
grocery store for sure, start in the produce department and they will see your healthy and strike up a convo there.
you can be bi... Its just what you like. Just cause you would have a 3 way with another girl, doesnt mean u have to have a relationship with a girl..
something that immediatly draws your mind to sex.
1 : lacking sex or functional sex organs <asexual plants>\n2 a : involving or reproducing by reproductive processes (as cell division, spore formation, fission, or budding) that do not involve the union of individuals or germ cells <asexual reproduction> <an asexual generation> b : produced by asexual reproduction <asexual spores>\n3 : devoid of sexuality <an asexual relationship>
It depends on how comfortable you are....how about using a 'today's sponge'(which can be purchased the drug store), in place which will leave you free to have fun for a couple of hours!!!

Real love never dies, but people do!
ummm..unless I am reading this wrong, if he has a widow, then he's dead, therefore, he can't marry anyone.
Lots of ways.I call PALMela HANDerson.
it's easy. go to mail options in your yahoo mail box. go to general preferences and instead of your real name write anything you want. that's what the receipients are goig to see. there's no other way for them to find out your true identity
"If you make a commitment to someone to be monogomous, that's no longer ""friends with benifits"" that's pretty close to being a relationship sans the feelings. But if you had a mutual arrangement to sleep with only eachother, for reasons not concerning emotions, I would say it's not necessarily cheating in the sense that their betraying anothers feelings, but its a betrayal in the sense that they had an agreement and this person broke that. Whoever this friend is, I'd advise them to talk to the person they have the arrangement with and tell them they don't want it to be monogomous if they're going to sleep with other people. A deal is a deal, but whoever had the idea to make it monogomous, probably had a relationship in mind. But no, since it is not a real relationship, I would not consider it ""cheating"", but for health purposes the other person needs to be aware that the person that they're sleeping with is messing around."
depends on who you are being obedient to\nthere can be bennies in beinf defiant
Great question.  I would say that there are people for you out there.  Picky isn't the word, nor is second best, but wow, the expectation to live up to being the best is a bit scary.  There is no Mr. Perfect, but there is Mr. Right.  Truth is you, me, all of us are just imperfect people, none better than the other, and all muddling through our lives the best way we can.  Accept youself as one of us.  Be plesant company and be happy with yourself.  You may find a guy that you can feel good about.  He won't be perfect, just a good guy, but with faults that you enjoy, rather than hate.  What I'm trying to say is that it is as much about you as it is all the 2nd rate guys.  Enjoy!
sometimes people will do things just to get a reaction hun. So if he knows he bothers you and keeps doing certain things I would chalk it up to teenage male immaturity.If ignoring him doesnt work I would do to him everything he does to you see how he likes it. Best thing it will probably relieve your stress and make you feel a whole better!

There is no standard answer to this question, i think. And its always a problem for everybody, what to do in situations like this. I think showing your feelings is much better than speaking about them to her. If she comes to you for advice, that means u have earned her trust, and that's a MAJOR advantage. Let time work for you, and when the right moment will come, you will know. good luck :)
"Guy knows a girl he really likes, he goes up to her and tells her:\n\nGuy: ""You know, I really like you a lot."""
Your wrong to some degree but so is he and so are they.  People tend to be proud of their lives and they most often express that pride to family which is you and your boyfriend.  Yes, they probably carry it too far, but I doubt if it is meant to make you feel bad.  Your boyfriend is wrong because he shouldn't be mad at you.  He should have been understanding and talked you about it.  There was no reason to be mad at you for your feelings regardless of if he believed them or not.
this is not a dating service site
He definitely thinks you're hot and he wants them to be envious of what he has. He also probably wants them to keep hands off.
well talk to them.
yes
stupid
Yes, you can have a crush even on someone you've met once. I met this French girl when I was 10 and I have still not forgotten her.
"After dating my GF for a few months she said she loved me and then asked me if I loved her.  I was honest and said I don't know.  I told her I liked her a lot, but I don't throw the world ""love"" around like most people.  When I say it I truly mean it and that I didn't know her well enough to say it.  She was a bit upset at the time, but a few months later when I did, she was really happy.  Be honest, I'd rather have someone tell me they didn't love me, than find out a while down the road."
oh shammi....first tell whether she ia friend or a lover.\n\nIf friend kiss on her cheeks.\nIf girl friend then kiss on her lips....french...for this you need practice....
The pews in a Catholic church. Got caught by some old lady with a really bad attitude.\nI had to finish I think that is what really got her upset.
the truth is they are not the same. but sad to say, people treat them as if you can't love without having sex. although, it is somewhat the expression of love.\n\nsex is a gift from God for married people, it is supposed to be sacred in the sanctity of marriage. in my opinion, wait till you are married then have sex all you want. \n\nthat is why i respect the filipino culture that says something about this. sad to say too, we are slowly losing it. though some still believe that sex should be done only when you are married. and i believe that. there is nothing like having it first with your husband... it will be grand!
Sweety me working in the health Field I advise you to do research on the two so you have a better understanding. Be strong not just for him for yourself also. And there is only one person who can help you conquer this hardship in ur life and that is god, Pray to him ask him for his help and I'm sure that things will turn out for the best. god bless
the thing is different guys want different things from girls. all dependin on ur interest. some luv,some sex,some beauty... damn, some even money. u kno' wat I am sayin.and wat not. it basically depends on the type'a dudes u is dealin wit. but speakin for myself, I jus look for a REAL girl who kno' wats up and can keep it true at all times. Jus keeps it real and I assure u 100% dat someone will want u for who u is. and u will be more than jus friends. REMEMBER, JUS KEEP IT REAL. THERE IS SOMEONE RIGHT UP THE CORNER. CHEERS.
I don't really remember my very first kiss because it wasn't that special. I do remember every second of my first kiss with my ex-boyfriend. It was incredible. I was best friends with his little sister from the time we were little kids but I had never met her older brothers because they all lived with their parents in Mexico, my friend was sent to CT when she was little when a couple music schools offered her scholarships, anyway I finally got to meet her brothers five years ago. Damien was nice, so was James. But Aaron was absolutely breath taking. Jocelyn, my friend, told me he had a crush on me but I didn't really believe her. Aaron was throwing a house warming party one night, the guy I had just broken up with showed up at the party and we got into a big fight so I ended up getting really drunk. I was told I passed out in the hallway. I remember waking up in Aaron's arms. He told me some guy was trying to grope me so Aaron picked me up and brought me to one of the bedrooms to sleep it off. I woke up when my head hit the pillow. Aaron sat with me and listened to me ramble on about my ex. I took a long hot shower and when I came out Aaron was still there, he had brought me up some water and migraine pills. I spent the night and in the morning, he made us breakfast. We sat at the kitchen counter eating together, talking, and then during a pause in conversation we looked at eachother and he moved real slowly towards me. We had a long passionate and tender kiss. It was amazing, it made my legs weak. We dated for several years and remain good friends.
We all fear rejection, but you can't live your life in fear.  If you do you will miss out on a lot of good things in life including this guy.  If you let fear rule you and some other girl asks him out then you will always regret it.  Rejection sucks and hurts but it is still better than always wondering what might have been.
i prefer to be told i am beautiful, hot is only skin deep to be beautiful you have to have a personality to go with it. hot is a woman who emits sexiness beautiful is inside and out.
Nuthin!I'd smack that Biotch,Silly!
I tried once & had the same problem! It's very difficult! Try asking your friends/family/co-workers to be patient with you, and apologize in advance for your moodiness. If they care about you they will gladly deal with the temporary mood swings; it is worth knowing you will have a healthier future. I am going to try the laser treatment to stop in April. Good luck to us both!!
Definitely shady.....watch her very closely. : )
LET ME TELL YOU WHEN THEY SAY I LIKE YOU AS A FRIEND AND WHEN YOU ARE ALONE IT IS DIFFERENT: THAT IS CALLED BEING PHONY AND PLAYING GAMES. SHE WANTS TO PLAY ON THE FACT THAT YOU LIKE HER AND PROBABLY WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR HER. YOU NEED TO TELL HER NOT TO LEAD YOU ON BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T YOU WILL BE THE ONE HURT IN THE END. TELL HER ASS TO KEEP IT REAL IF SHE WANTS YOU SHE DO IF SHE DON'T SCREW HER. FIND YOU SOMEONE THAT LIKES YOU AND WON'T PLAY IMMATURE GAMES. PUT HER IN CHECK FOR REAL BEFORE YOU GET HURT.
What are you talking about? 2 points
YES.\nI feel that I'm always in love even that my gf had dumped me few weeks later,even that she hurted me a lot I feel that I still love her.\nIt's always great to be in love,even that this love sometimes be with who don't deserve.\nFinally,yeah.I'm in a deep love towards my ex GF & I don't know what to do towards it.
why
I think for most sensitive girls (I would say I am one) I think it is best done like a band-aid - really. A lot of the time we fake that we are sensitive and vulnerable so guys feel they can't leave us. Also, how do you know that she doesnt doubt the relationship as well. Above all - you need to tell her how you feel. I can guarentee that is the only way to go forward. And when you tell her, just say 'we need to talk about us' so she knows exactly what is coming.

"Hmmm...I have some certain types of underwear in mind,but\nI m not very sure how they r called...\nWell,of course I like thongs(any color is welcome,really!),\nbut mostly those with more than one latchet.\nThen I like those very short panties,from lace usually,that\nleave the down part of the ""bottom"" uncovered,do u understand?\nAnyway,I don't care,I m sure when we ll get together,you ll be wearing the most perfect underwear for me... ;-)"
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Be yourself, and the longer you know a girl the more you guys will think alike. (Not in a creepy way) Get someone who has the same views and opinions on life as you and it will all come together on its own. Good Luck:)
yea i don't know anything bout astrology but if y'all together for that long with a healthy relationship why would u break up over something so little?
"Actually, you're right. Women ARE more likely to leave a marriage than a man. I read somewhere, long time ago (when my mom left my dad), something that said that women's needs change during the course of a relationship, while men's needs primarily stayed the same (and yes, this does include the phyiscal needs). \n\nFor example, a woman who falls in love and marries a man because he has an exotic job may decide five years later that the job ""isn't enough"" because she now needs someone who can be at home at 5:15 every single night to help take care of the kids. Her needs changed; his didn't. She married him because she ALSO loved the job - not just him - and now she doesn't love the job any more, and so, by consequence, she no longer loves him. Irreconcilable differences, you know.\n\nMen, on the other hand, will fall in love and marry a woman who happens to HAVE an exotic job. If she then decides to stay home and have kids, he will often stay dedicated to her because he ""made that commitment"" and will stay the course. If he does stray - as you admit some men do - it's often because the woman's needs have changed... and half the time, she's straying, too!\n\nMen also have been taught by their fathers, over the generations, that women are to be cared for (which I agree with) no matter what. Even though women were ""liberated"" 30 years ago, men are still being taught this value, and apparently they're listening! Women have taken this ""liberation"" and used it to their advantage as a gender, allowing themselves the freedom of escaping from home responsibilities that men have shouldered for centuries.\n\nNow... that's my opinion.... anyone else?"

I fully believe that you can be in love with 2 people at the same time.  They are going to be different types of love because no 2 loves are the same, but I'm not sure if you are really over your ex.  I know how you feel.  You want him, but don't want a relationship with him.  You want him to want you.  But you are in love with your current BF.  And also, the fact that you have so long without your BF is giving you a lot of time to think.  \n\nI'm sorry that you are feeling this way.  The only thing that I can tell you is to try to stay away from your ex.  Unless of course you want a relationship with him.  I think that time away from him and time spent thinking about your new relationship should help.  \n\nAnother suggestion if that doesn't work... make a list of all the things that you didn't like about him when you were in a relationship.  And really asses them... ask yourself if he has changed and if you were with him again would it really work out.\n\nGood luck!
You need to know a man who can take your weight for a long time
Well by asking this question you just did.  Good luck.
is you like him you should go for it before he make some othere dission
He's saving your for Plan B. I suggest you look elsewhere.
Here's the thing you can't go looking for love, love will find you.
"Stop stressin babygurl....there's plenty other dudes in the SEA...if he knows you're stressin the more he's going to keep stringing you along...Just be like Kool whateva...people are like that the more you seemed concernd bout wut he's doin and when he's thinking bout you and so on the more likely hood you become vounerable to his BS ..when he starts..which he might already have...if he not ready to commit you cant force him into it..if you do he'll jus throw it up in you face or it will blow up in your face either way you'll get it in thee face...literally speakin..Just be open minded if has a baby mama then that the chance you take when datin guys like that...ther's always a chance he might go back...I mean they do have to see each other.. Just think what is easier to lite..wood with out lighter fluid, or wood that has been burning for some time..."""

love is so beautiful...it's been explaination... you love a person because first you like him/her..then you feel hi/her care..and then because they love you you love them too... and also it is a wonderful feeling...i know i sound stupid...i am not doing a very good explaination here... but love is everything...because also this world is created out of love i guess it's an instinct for a human being to love someone else... for God is love
How do you feel, when you're infront of him? Ever notice how different you feel when you're with him, than when with someone else, or alone? Do you crave some time with him?\ndo you think mainly of doing things with him? Do you have a certain way of looking at him, that only other people notice and you're not aware of it? My guess is, yes, you love him.

For good music, do a search on Amazon.com under music. You can search just big band or for a particular artist, like Dizzy Gillespie or Charlie Parker. Try to stick to instrumentals, since some people cannot listen to music with lyrics and carry on a conversation at the same time.
Put a note on his car at work. Or where ever he's at.. Telling him happy birthday, and that you'd like her him to come over right after he gets off.. Have a nice dinner or luch for him, watch a movie together, and sing him happy birthday..(dont forget to wear the bowe)
You sound like a really sweet kid, just tell her what you told us. If she doesn't go to the prom with you, then it's her loss. Good Luck!
I think about my boss allot.If you saw him you would probably not believe me.I have a thing for authority and the position that he is in gives him the right to call me on bad things.I love getting in trouble because it gives me his undivided attention and emotions run high.I recently caught him checking the tan lines my g left on my hips when I was reaching for a book on a high shelf.When I turned to go back to work I bumped into him and a button popped off the tight shirt I was wearing.As I walked back to my desk I felt my skin flush.So yeah,I think about making it with my boss.We don't work together do we?
what is philly
to have someone to share life with
Sense of humor, good personal hygiene, good credit, good with kids, someone who is close with their family, someone who is religious, etc etc etc etc........
Not much, but you are better off than most I can tell you...
ouch. sounds like you've got yourself a clinger. \nif i were you i would just break it off with him and tell him that it's not working out and that you don't want to see him anymore. be a bit** if you have to so that he doesn't keep pursuing you. Don't take his calls, refuse to see him, and don't give him any reasons to think that you might get back with him. Good luck girl!
Tolerance and understanding are the basic virtues of a happy long marriage life. Give more expect less from yours partner.
Vespa makes the best ones.  Make sure your feet can rest flat on the ground and your knees bend slightly.  \n\nColor is a matter of choice but keep in mind, the more you try to make it look like a motorcycle, the more it looks like a scooter.
well get involved in stuff in your area. where i go to college there is a gay straight alliance, and i know that there are things like that all over and even in some high schools for support (im not sure how old you are) and a place to meet other people with your sexual orientation. this will help you get to know other guys that hopefully share similar interests with you and maybe you could develop a relationship or find guys to date there.
I've with the same girlfriend for 40 years and we still hold hands so you tell me what is wrong with it,I think there should be more hand holding then what there is.
First off, if you have to ask then it isn't there. Second, in this situation the most that it is at this point is she may like you. You are probably infatuated with her, not in love. When you are in love, there is no doubt, you know everything about the person and there isn't anything that they will go through that you won't stand by their side for. They are your other half and you are dependent on them emotionally and can't live without them. I am sure that you two like each other very much, and true love is something that you will experience when you are older, but live life and go through this lust love and have fun.
You are MORE at risk from STDs such as AIDS when you have a**l sex. The tissue around the an*s is also very delicate and can easily be torn which can lead to infections. It seems stupid to do it JUST because there's less chance of a girl getting pregnant
My husband is pretty cool... flowers have completely lost their power over me. My hubby will wash laundry or dishes with out me having to ask, he will get up with the kids and let me sleep in on weekends, he even cooks breakfast and keeps mine warm until I get up. He'll call me on his lunch break just to chat...He does too many sweet things to list here, but I will never take him for granted, he is the greatest husband and father you could ask for.
Sure it is OK to like older women and go out with them as long as you're both 18. More and more you see older women with younger men. It seems like it was always OK for older men and younger women now it is the woman's turn to get that young stuff. Heck, I am 50 years old and I think a 30 or 35 year old man would be great. Go for it!
Not really. If you have a good bod, good looks and look like you know what you're doing, then yes. Playing the game has nothing to do with it. It's who's playing it that matters, if you're really shallow.
Do you think it's because nobody asked you out?  Because if that's why, you should know that you can go out with your friends or even by yourself, if you really want to be out someplace.  You don't have to sit home and wait for someone to invite you.  \n\nMaybe you really want to be home - in any case you are, so why not enjoy your space instead of wasting your free time wondering 'why'?\n\nI love being home by myself but rarely get the chance since I work full time and have to catch up my housework, laundry and grocery shopping during the evenings so I can have  few free minutes on the weekend.  Time is precious.

Because then it wouldn't be fun!!
Hopefully, you are both over 18.  If she loves you like you say, then as an adult she is going to have to make a choice.  He can't force her to go somewhere without her consent.  While I realize that her culture is different, she is going to have to stand up to her father.  Unfortunately, if she doesn't stand up to him and goes with him, then there is not a lot you can do except forget her.  Do not do anything drastic or stupid.  You could end up in trouble.  The next step is up to her.  Good luck!
How often does he drink?  Is he sorry he hit you?  Was it the alcohol's doing?  Or was it because of something else?  And would he be willing to give up the alcohol?  All of these things should be considered.
My man is so fine I can't get enough of him, He is the sexiest man I have evr seen in my entire life. I love him with all my heart
i have sex 1 week and yes i feel like it isnt enough being a woman and all but i love my fiance enough not to cheat on him and if i am to the point i cant take it anymore and he doesnt want to make love to me i just take my toy out and use it it wont give y diseases wont tell u no or not to tonite
I can't answer. Not into that dookey love myself. I just have to say this though. Doesn't Luda kinda look like that rat in the Chuck-E-Cheese commercials? Seriously, take that rat, and turn him into a black man. And you've got Luda.
because they think its fun
Well, from what you're able to say here, it really sounds like you need to cool off and focus on getting your degree.  After you've got that, then you can think about meeting him.  Maybe by that time he'll want to come here to visit you.  But don't be looking to move and work over in another country without having met the guy in real life yet.  Slow down and think rationally.  It's sweet that you're so willing to do anything, but come on, think about it first.
A+ for Genuwine.\nNobody's a saint.  Some cheat, some don't.  Some are men, some are women.\nGet over it.
Absolutely yes.  Men who are les sure of themselves are less attractive to most women.
Love is the best emotion that God has given us! I don't know if you believe this, but its written that God is love, and we are made in his image......so when we love we are actually doing something that God does too!\nWhen we are love a special someone its the most beautiful thing in the world! We have a capacity to love different people and things! I love being in love!\n\nThanks for the love...ly question!
hey will you tell me what is wrong with you?\nare you having problems at home sweetie?\nwhy do you want a boyfriend so bad...will you answer me?
this depends dear......how much money $$ does he have to burn?
My advice would be for you to ask her questions about herself.  That is a conversation starter.  Listen to her.  She'll love it.
May your future be bright and loving. May you have many happy years together We will always be there for you. Remember this. The love you give to your children willhopefully be passed down to your grandchildren. Good luck and much wisdom.
Men have superegos, they are bruised easily by females. Men feel that they should be able to do what they want, but that you shouldn't say anything about their behavior. It's not right for them to play with your emotions, but since they don't open up and express their emotions like women do, they feel that you should let them be, stop pressuring them. They are wrong, a couple needs to be able to talk, communicate or there is definitely a problem. As for lying, lying is a way they can feel in control, have everything go their way. They know the risks of lying to you, but they still do it because it's a defense mechanism, it keeps them from having to face their fears. Don't let them do you like that though, regardless if they are scared of commitment or being open with their mate, you can't sit back and be second. If they really love you, I think they will let the wall down and be open with you, like you are with them. But if they can't be the slightest bit open with you, then they really are not ready to have experience anything special with you. Just my take on it.
a person who loves power struggles, but wants to maintain the relationship - by far, most unhealthy - a symptom of future abuse???  Just my opinion
im learning that you really have to trust what your instints are telling you.. If you have to question things to your friends or family then its usually from something your instincts have told you...so trust them.\nWhen both your brain and heart feel at ease and there are no questions you will know its true love.

"Clique's are, well..... They're HELL! My ""Clique"" is well, I tlak to the popular people, but I'm mainly and outcast, I have friends, and all my friends are outcasts too. I once was in the ""Popular"" people, Then the year ended and well, I wasn't in demand any more, but you know what? I really don't care! Ya, actually I was stereotyped from the moment I got to school. Here's the run down of my school:\n~ Losers\n~the jocks\n~the Drama Queens/Kings\n~The Gay population\n~The Punk Wanna be's\n~The skater Wanna Be's\n~The wiggers\n~ The Gothic Freaks\n~The nerds\n~ The Band Geeks/Freaks\n~The Whore Population\n~ The rebels\n~The Stoners\n~The Rejects\n~The burnouts\n~The offspring of Hippies\n~ The suck ups\n I could go on for ever, but I think you get the idea!"
Most questions on here are asking for an opinion. But, yes, there are ocassions where it is possible
"honestly i was way to young. It was the summer that i would be goin into 8th grade. Yeah it was the guys first time also. It was actually really not that bad. I thought it would be worse, but it wasnt. Then it was an everynight thing. But let me tell u, MAKE SURE it is the RIGHT person  because i havent seen my ""at the time bf"" in about 5 years and i am goin on 20 in June. I wish it wasnt with him seein the fact that we are no longer even in contact but at the time i was in love with him and still have alot of feelings for him even though he was always in trouble and not well liked. PLEASE make sure its the right person..Dont rush theres nuttin to hurry about. Save urself"
"you're wrong about the ""prude"" part.  a girl who doesn't screw any guy that comes along isn't a prude, she's much more likely to be worth waiting for."
Shaking the magic 8 ball . . . . \n\nAsk again?
If you're having trouble finding this guy, have you considered the possibility that you've mis-spelled the surname? I've never seen the name Scagel before, but have known more than one Scargill (although no Jimmy or James Scargill, sorry).\n\nMight be worth a try.
"Dude, i know how you feel. I'm a sophomore and i like this chick.  I usually start out asking about homework. Then after ""you got the help,"" ask her about what you think about a certain subject that she might be interested in.  The girl i like, likes Japanese anime and so do i, thus i ask her about what new animes came out recently.  If you know that she cares about you even a lil bit, ask her how her day was and listen to her no matter how annoying she gets.  Hint to her that you like her by actually commenting and listening.  I like to talk about ""deep subjects"" like ""how corrupt society has become by media"" and we just talk.  Get her to tutor you in a class you do poor in.  Or plainly ask her out.  DON'T STUTTER YOUR WORDS.  email me if you want more advise.  This stuff works for me."
Be yourself and hope you're gal of his dreams....
alone in my room fingering myself and fantasizing someone i really want to have sex w/.awesome!
"Go with your gut on this one.  \nI say it's very inappropriate.  Even if this relationship is purely friendship it is definitely crosses some boundrys.  Also, if his actions are making you feel bad or insecure he should put an end to whatever it is that makes you feel that way.  YOU should be his number one priority - not his so called ""freedom"" to go off buying other woman gifts!\nP.S.  You are NOT being silly your emotions are yours and are there for a reason, don't deny that, don't deny yourself!"
"This is not your fault. Better communication about likes and dislikes helps, but ultimately, it's up to the female. It's always beeen sociaaly acceptable for a guy to have and enjoy sex. It's not so much with the female. Our body image, past trauma, fear of being caught, inability to REALLY let loose and enjoy the act, etc. can hinder any possibility of orgasm.\nPersonally, i couldn't if I am not in love with a guy. It's true. the berst sex for me is with the man (my man) I am head over heels for. I do have to say though, that I agree with the ""getting her (close to) drunk""."
Took this girl out on a Cigarette boat to an Island 5 miles from shore, we had dinner on the Island and watched the sun set. We spent the night on the boat and then spent the next day boating. It was a 30 hour date. Great time.
You and I are in the same boat. I have been going out with my guy for just over 2 years and get all the same comments, but You know he's the one if you get this feeling all over your body that's completelly undiscribeable. If all you can think about is your future together, if you get excited just thinking about seeing him, if you cry just thinking about how life would be without him, if everything within you screams I LOVE HIM! I LOVE HIM! I LOVE HIM! He is the one, the one God intended for you. Ignore what everyone else says. Follow your heart.It won't often steer you wrong.
Guys normally feel remorse. They just don't show it (to their own detriment).\n\nAnd this often applies to girls too.
if it is meant to be it will be, you don't make a man love just like you can't keep them if they don't want to stay.  Stop trying to force things and let them fall into place.
Depends on where in the relationship you are...\n\nIf you don't know him, then just go to him and start with hello and talk casually and if you're up to it, flirt...\n\nbut if know him, then tease him/flirt with him crazily so that you BOTH enjoy it and laugh happily.  I'm sure he will get the idea that you might be interested in him but would still hesitate.  Look for signs he might like you like seeing if he talks abt you w/his friends or if he behaves differently w/u than with other girls and all... Then I suggest you just talk with him about your feelings or if you're shy, etc give him like romantic card or love letter and all...
Well... some questions, How old are you/he?- Are you wealthy?, Is he wealthy?, how long have you been together... if it's love you'll usually know in time, do you agree on financial decisions? if not-love or not- it won't last!, do you love yourself enough to be alone and happy? if not no one else will love you either... I guess that's about it for my input.  Good luck!
Say something that an old school would use, that is crazy and funny. So she would smile, to break the ice and go from there. Be yourself, say what you think is best.
sure y not hit me at flakka032638@yahoo.com
There are alot of guys in jail who will write to ANYONE just to pass the time.  In case his other girls r not there waiting when he gets out he wants YOU to be waiting in line with the rest of them!  I would NOT write him back and I would not send him anything wither!  Once he gets out- take things very slowly to see if he has changed.  Life is way too short to waste on losers!  You need a real man who will love u and respect your feelings.  DROP this loser!
You always get laid in 3 dates or less....that is the rule.
I think most of these people's answers are trying to judge you and think you're talking about yourself in this situation and not answering your question, I think that's funny!!!\n\nAnd since this is Yahoo ANSWERS I will now ANSWER THE QUESTION POSTED!!!  I think men are attracted to cute single professional girls because maybe it's a release from the busy married life of work, children, and keeping a marriage together, which I'm sure can be very stressful at times.
Yes.  Yes they are.
if u find a good site to find couples please let me know
of course it is.... especially if he is mature...   plenty of younger guys love older women and vise verse !its a beautiful thing... love knows no  age boundaries....
A man has to go out and get it himself.  He can get all the help in the world and if he won't take it.  It's nobody's fault but his own.
"Males! I was raised around guys (my cousins) and my dad is an Asst. Chief for our Fire Dept. so I grew up in that atmosphere so I've always been around guys. For the longes I was a major tom boy, I didn't have any ""real"" female friends until I got to college and they are some of my best friends now! I have been tamed some what but I can only handle being ""girly"" for so long. But guys are just easier to hang out with plus its easier for me to be one of the guys than one of the girls!"
am always single for u
Take your time and don't rush this relationship.  Your still young and you need to make sure you are jumping into a situation that won't allow you to continue to grow and be happy in your life.  A man that old with kids has a very settled and projected life.  You have to be sure this is really a life that you want to take on because kids and his life style are big responsibilities.
Please take what I'm saying to heart. When someone is involed with drugs and alcohol it makes things worse. If he is really into this stuff he will never ever pick you over the drugs he will go back to them time and time again. Your parents can see this being older than you and the fact that he disrespected your father and doesnt even remember is troubling to me. I spent a long time with someone like this and it only turned out bad. Your younge and you have so much life to live still, try living it and having fun with your girlfriends. Forget about this jerk, or see if he can really change. Things will come together once your older. You don't want to waste the best years of you life crying over some drug infested jerk.
I asked my 15 year old son about this so I could give you expert advice!  He is a very smart kid-honor roll-football- as well as trak.  The guys like him that are smart-funny- and average looking-cute but not super HOT always seem to have a crush on that POPULAR skank that all the other girls HATE with a passion!  He says its a guy thing.  He says you should find activites that he likes- ask his friends-or yours- and find ways to be at the same activities he is at.  If he skates- show up at the skating rink- if he likes video games-learn his favorite game and ask his advice on it.  Make his likes YOUR likes.  Dont jump him and scream I LOVE YOU!  My son says he will run like crazy!  lol  Let a friendship with him start and then he may begin to look at you in a different light!  Good Luck!
Sounds like your husband has some major issues he needs to work out and deal with!  Just curious, how do you know that he is not cheating on you? Is it because he said he hasn't?  Something is definately going on and if he can't live with his wife, show affection, live with and be married to the woman he married then if I were you I would sit down with him confront him and then give him 2 options.  Either he wants to be married to you and live his life with you or boot his butt out of your life and move on.\n\nI know that it is easier said than done, and that it is easier for an outsider to say this but in reality he is taking advantage of you, taking advantage of your big heart and you deserve better than this.\n\nDo what is best for you!!
My pop doesn't stink. I love Coke I could smell it all day.  But I know my poop stinks.  Everybodys does. Except for babies...well the first month.  But ewwwweee after that throw that diaper outside .
It is important to learn to not let the little things escalate into big ones if you plan on being married.  First off, agree that fighting is a waste of time and energy.  All it does is destroy what you have.  Sure, you don't always agree, and often you really don't have to.  Remember, being together is about compromise and that is a 50/50 thing.  Don't ever let even little things fester by walking away or refusing to deal with them.  Always remind each other that you love one another and acknowledge that you hear and understand what the other person is saying to you.  It is a lot of work to be in a relationship but it is better to work hard for the good than to spend it fighting.
I think as long as you make it personal, and romantic, she'll love it.\nFor isntace if she's a shy person, ask her somewhere secluded (make dinner for her and pop the question during dessert), or if she more outgoing and likes attention, do it at a public event (billboard at baseball game, announcement during a when your at a play, in a restaurant)and if you plan to do it in public place, inlist other people to help, like the manager at the restaurant, or the organizer of the event your attending*\nGood luck*
Tristin and Isolde is a good one.  You can rent the movie now I think.
they probably are afraid of some stigma they might get from their friends.
Sometimes the idea of being seduced by a total stranger is very exciting and erotic. however, if I am in a commited relationship, the only person I fantasize being with is that person.
Not at this time.
if it goes wid ur outfit its sexy..n its sexy to be comfortable..cuz if u r comfortable thn u r sexy..else u'll always b trying hard to b sexy..
need?\nno one NEEDs to get married\nthey WANT to get married\nlosers NEED to get martried
I'm curious how you know this info if you weren't there. Did his friend tell you or someone else?\n\n I personally think that if he's that obvious about looking at other girls, then he doesn't have much respect for you. Reverse things for a moment. How would he react if you did the same thing? I'll bet he wouldn't like it and would be sure to say so. You should do the same ( letting him know you don't appreciate being disrespected ). If he keeps doing it, then dump him. I'm sure there is a guy out there that would be more than happy to have the opportunity to give you 100% of his attention.
"You either have it or you don't.  You can learn to be funny, but it never really is the same.  Look at the funny people around you, they don't think about it, it just comes naturally.  Now if you, who I am assuming has is a serious type person tried to do the same thing, it would not come off sounding natural.  Be happy for who you are.  Laugh at the things around you.  This will relax you enough that you may be able to pick up on some ""humor vibes"".  Good luck."
do ehat your heart tells you to do. Don't let stress get to serious. As soon as you get done what your doing you will feel 100% better
This same situation occured with my wife and I.  I asked her to marry me fairly early in our relationship, and she was not prepared for marriage yet.  Instead of rejection, however, she explained her feelings (that she did love me, but was not ready), and we agreed to wait a while longer.  After another year we had both found good jobs, finished school and settled in nicely together.  We then had a wonderful wedding (plus she got a MUCH better engagement and wedding ring! ;) )\n\nJust be honest and straightforward.  If he loves you as much as you love him, he will wait until you are ready.  Hope this helps, and best of luck!
I have been for seven years and very happy..not right this moment cause hubbys in military and gone for a year..but when we are together we are very happy even through bad times cause we love each other and vowed through good times and  bad for better or worse till death do us part...
you are sexed up!
Sorry to hear about your wife. I think it is admirable to be a single father there are so many kids out there that are fatherless. I say hats off to you
"My advice would definitely be don't be someone you aren't because she would eventually find out that you are a phony.Maybe just come out ands ask her!If she says no just say ""that's a loss for you"".Sometimes girls will say no because they are embarrassed and don't want to answer something like that around someone like their Friends.I had the same problem as you do!If you only want to get a girl because she is ""hot and popular"" dont do it!Its not real!If that doesn't work go out with there Friend and if they realy like you they will become jealous and u get your girl!Don't hurt your own heat hurt, them by going out with their Friend!"
If you are well proportioned, I would say classify yourself as curvy because that could mean several different things.  Make sure that you put a current picture so that there is no question.\n\nGood luck.
OKAY! YOU WANT TO GET SOMETHING THAT SAYS THANKS FOR BEING A FRIEND/ I WANT YOU TO ENJOY THIS DAY FROM ALL THE REST. SO MAY I SUGGEST SOMETHING THAT IS A LITTLE RISKY AND OUT THERE. BUY HIM A SEX DOLL. HE AND HIS WIFE WILL ENJOY IT. IT IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE REST OF THE GIFTS AND IT CAN BE ENJOYED BY ALL OF YOU. IF THIS IS NOT AN IDEA YOU LIKE: TRY HIRING A STRIPPER: THERE ARE SO MANY IDEAS THAT YOU CAN GO WITH ON THIS ONE....BESIDES THE BORING OLD WINE AND GADGETS.
lips and neck!
move on, if he can't make up his mind there is no need for you to put your life on hold till he figures out what he wants, plus if you start dating again it might speed up his decision....good luck
I have a clue....Because all people are sexual. Now a days, about 99 percent show it and admit it. Ten years ago, male teachers were the only ones getting hammered in the news. Now turn on the TV news and you will see all kinds of females going after males and females. The times are a changing. But here is the biggest hipocracy of all: Turn on your TV. Sex is on EVERYTHING now. Sitcoms, movies, comedy channel. How are you supposed to NOT think about sex when it is absolutely everywhere. 40 percent or more of porn is now bought by women. I just bet you were one of those people who kept their mouth shut when Jerry Falwell said that TV was rotting our society.
I won't answer your question now. But, if you write more I'll read your magazine or book, possibly.

i Think you only know that. \nwere you very in love? or not?\nSome advice tought:\n\n1- if you just pursue a relationship for the rebound, YOU WILL FELL WORST and end up hurting someone.\n\n2- Why does it have to be so drastic? you can date as much friends as you want, without getting to serious first. let your own heart and mind dictate you that.\n\n3- Trust what you feel.\n\n4- dont do stupid things, do not feel down. never.\n\n5- time is your best allie.
he wants sex and you are not giving it up to him.. go see your doctor he might be able to help you with your lack of desire
LOL Ain't that the truth!\nI can't get rid of the jerks but the good ones leave. sigh...
you've to MAKE more time. you've to crate a schedule. Love is all about each other, but if you dont get enought of each other, then it rele dosent make any sence? does it? i wonder if it does, (not to me0?
Attention is what will matter the most.  Actions speak louder than words so anything you can do that will make him feel special.  Call him on the phone just to say hi as many times as you can.  Tell him how much you love him and how sorry you are that you took your frustrations out on him.  Tell him he is so special to you and you couldn't imagine going on without him.  If he loves you back he will understand.  good luck
Just to clarify....you only knew each other for 15 days then became engaged to be married?!?!?  No wonder she is wanting to work on your friendship skills - she is trying to slow down to develop a foundation for this relationship...it moved WAAAAY too fast!  You just need to let some time pass and stop worrying about trying to have a baby right now because you two just don't know each other well enough yet.
i believe in somehting not very small and something not very big; would be ideal. don't need a flattened-by-steam-roller and no need of it to either arrive 5 minutes before she does.\n\nAs far as anatomy of a women goes, it goes what bests suits her structure. rest all is how you carry it around...\n\n\n_peace
"You are so sweet.  Being a gentleman is nice, but you need to romance the girl if you want her to think of you as a boyfriend. I mean, its great that you are friends first. You can then gradually go into the ""courtship"" phase. But you have to tell her frankly, you being a gentleman and all, that you are ""courting"" her. Take her dates. Send her flowers. Do things together. Try to enflame her desire. But if there's no spark - well, you might be trying to light wet wood. Find someone else...."
have him look into sexercise. after doing it for a short time, he can control when he cums and when he doesn't, and he never has to worry about premature ejaculation again. also, communication is really important in anything you do in the bedroom.
they need to grow up first, many people have childern and are not mentally able to care for them yet, has little to do with age it's a maturity thing.
"Yes, that is abusive behavior, and hitting ""things"" is what Domestic Abuse experts call ""Furniture violence"" and it's considered a huge red flag...\nWas there anything that seems to have triggered the change? Trouble at work, a death in the family,legal problems, drug or alcohol abuse? If none of that seems possible, he needs to see a doctor...sudden, unexplained personality changes often indicate a medical problem and he should get a complete work-up from a physician.\nIn the meanwhile, you need to keep yourself safe...if he's acting badly, leave the house, put a few days worth of clothes and some cash in a bag at the home of a relative or trusted friend in case you need to leave suddenly.\nContact your local womens shelter for more information on warning signs and options that are available to you.\nIt is NOT your fault, no one deserves to be frightened of what goes on in their own home and you don't have to tolerate it...yes, you promised ""For better or worse"" but he also promised to ""Love, honor and cherish""."
"No, you got away from him, don't go back there. Tell him to stay away and never call you again. He made a big bad mistake and you will never be able to trust him and relax again. It won't be worth it. Have you ever heard the saying ""fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me""? don't let him fool you twice. If you already feel you can't trust him, listen to your intuition. Why would he change? It's too late. Respect yourself and get on with your life. Sorry for your pain."
What do you mean you hate it?  Because a lot of stupid straight conservative people hate it?  If that's who you are then who the hell should care whether your gay or not!  People who are discriminatory against gay people are themselves insecure, narrow-minded, unpassionate, and have no respect!  There is nothing unnatural about loving someone of the same sex, there's no harm being done.  Like the saying goes make love, not war.  Stand up to what you believe in because IT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE someday, to not just yourself but the world!

"Friendship is seeing their faults and loving them in spite of those faults. It's being there any time, day or night if they need you. It's when they call and say ""I need a favor"" and you say ""Sure, how can I help?"" It's laughing and crying together. It's standing beside them whether they are right or wrong and helping them get through things. It's honesty, trust, respect, love and loyalty. \n\nA.H."
wow just look up any surgeon that does cosmetic surgery .. good luck to you
youre a pig
By the way he acts over the phone.. the way that he acts when he sees you that he is actually making an effort to see you!!\nThe fact that you are answering this question lets me know you have doubts
tell her your sorry and u love her the same thing just happened to me exept i was the girl who was hurt and we got back together last night and hes staying here all weekend!!
I notice u didn't say he was in love with you. But I also notice you said he has a girlfriend. This is what you need to do\n\nPut yourself in his GIRLFRIEND shoes and another woman is trying to come between you& him. How would you feel?\n\nAnd if he wanted you is that gonna make u happy to know that he had a girlfriend but dumped her to be with you, he'll do the same when he see another girl he likes
thats one of the worlds mysteries\nyou cant change someone though. love them for who they are
Maybe he's shy?That explains why you first thought he wasn't interested...Looks like you have to make the first move..go talk to him!
I believe in a soulmate.  I found him 30 years ago...my hubby.\n\nAsk God to direct you, He made you, so He knows who is your match.
Why is she stuck at home, I say as long as she's not on house arrest, going to her house would be fine. Is she cooking?
because real love is eternal. you shouldn't hate him, but you can't be with him. you love him because of who he is, not because of what he does. i've never been abused, but i've been in a bad relationship. i still love her, but i can't be with her because of what she does. there's no rhyme or reason to explain who you love, but just because you love them doesn't always mean a happy ending. you need to continue to love him, but move on with your life. it's tough, but it can be done. i'm proof.
Wealth isn't everything. and material things cannot always bring happiness and if it does it will be short lived. so I would follow my heart because it is not what you have it is who you have it with.
because when u r told NOT to do something u WANT to do it!!! that's what i think!
like licking an icecream
You will get to know the person.......REALLY KNOW THE PERSON.....I think it's a good idea to live with someone before marriage. There might be things that you REALLY REALLLY don't like about that person. Might not be who you think they are.
couldnt find anything sorry
imagine kissing him/her.
send me a pic and i will decide
A trip to Europe for most people is a once in a lifetime event and it should be special.  Make it more so by telling her your plans then planning the trip together.  That doesn't prevent you from planning a couple extra surprises during the trip to make it that much more memorable.  Maybe hire violinists to play at a Great restaurant that you have agreed to go. Hire a photographer to follow you around one day.  Order her an outfit from a Paris designer.  I am sure  you can improve on these suggestions.  Have a great time.
I think that it depends on the length of your relationship, your ages, and other deciding factors.  Talk to him, ask him why?  Maybe there's something medical or maybe he's just not intune to what you want.  Let him know!!! About 3-5 times a week is good (my opinion)
one word:  Threesome
"I didn't change my name when I married, because I do think it's outdated.  We have two children who have my husband's last name.  What I find offensive is when they try to give you the first name, too, as in ""Mrs. John Smith."" For heavens' sake.  \nI don't know why this tradition has continued, but it is difficult to find a solution that is concise and clear.  Either you have to explain and defend having a different name, or you have to adopt both, which gets pretty cumbersome."
Ah yes, there is nothing better than being seduced. The gentle touching and kissing; running your fingers ever so slightly on the arm or leg, or wherever. The teasing kisses and nibbling on the ear and neck. I will stop now or else this will become pornographic.

Be yourself. Do something that both of you guys enjoy doing. But do not make everything focas on him. This date is for both of you. If you are going to make him feel like King of the world then he needs to make you feel like Queen of the world.

Get shitfaced drunk, stand outside her window and scream out you love her.  She should come crawling back in no time.\n\nShe needs to prove to herself if she loves you.  Not you proving it to her.

You need to back it up!! First of all why are you living with someone so quickly after breaking up with the first guy? You seriously need to slow things down before you get yourself in another mess. Why did you and the first guy break up to begin with? Obviously there were problems in that relationship and you need to work those problems out before you dump this other guy--who to me sounds like a loser. If you really want an opinion that will help you, you need to get rid of BOTH guys and try to figure out what YOU want and need in life. You must be young because you act very impulsively, so you need to slow the sh** down!
There are a few things you can do... Be upfront... Ask him straight up... The worst he will say is no.. and definitely read his whole body from facial expressions right down, even the tone of voice used and believe me, dont ask like you are begging men can pick that up and often times we like to tell what u like to hear vs what you want to hear. But remember you have to be ready for truth or dont ask at all. remember you do live too and sometimes the best thing is to move on and explore what life has to give and belive it or not, there is plent of fish in the sea, we just like to keep our blinker on... keep your eyes and heart open but never let your concience go unnoticed.
i've never made out with a girl, but if i wern't in a serious relationship i'd try if the situation came up. just to find out the answer to that question( r girls better?), i've heard it a lot too. i really don't think the ability to kiss well is confined to one gender i think it's an individual thing. my bf's kisses are perfect but i've kissed some guys who needed a little work. i'm not sexually attracted to girls but i am comfortable enough to admit that there some hotties out there. Hi hotties!!!
Boy that's hard! Boys are actually harder to figure out than girls so I'll just tell you from my experiences ok? Well the dude will talk to you alot, flirt with you, joke around with you, and smile alot! Some boys are really shy though, so if you feel that he's staring at you, look at him and if he turns away really quick, he likes you! And some boys don't really like showing how he feels toward girls to their face, so just ask some people. If you ready for the last solution though, just ask him! It's really not that hard cause 9 times out of 10, they'll ask you the same question to see if you like them. And if he doesn't like you, WHOA (sarcastically) It's not the end of the world! So don't freak out, because there's plenty of more dudes out there that are looking for a girl just like you! (I'm serious!)
Infatuation:   \n1. A foolish, unreasoning, or extravagant passion or attraction.\n2. An object of extravagant, short-lived passion.\n\nIt all depends on how long you've felt this way--if it lasts it's love.  If it's short-lived--it's not.

Don't be scared, you'll like it. You will not feel any pain as long as you do it with someone you love, you will know when you really want it, but don't do it before that. It's such a precious thing so don't lose it to any one.

I would say that different men prefer different things, and that there is definitly a man out there who will like what you have to offer.  In most cases, I would say that a girl who is cool and fun to be around matters a lot more than just physical attributes.  For the most part, there are many guys out there that would be interested in you... its usually guys who have trouble finding girls who are interested.
"The first thing you say is:  ""Ya ochen loublyoo seks!""\nAnd then add emphatically: ""Chawsta!""\n\nAnd then later if things go well you can whisper ""Mnyeh newsion seks."""
You should be able too.  Even if you do it yourself there are different ways that your spouse can be served his walking papers.  Last known address or newspaper notice are twos ways that I know he can be served.  Look at it this way, if he doesn't respond or come back that makes the divorce easier.
I don't believe in the 'love in modern age' being as different as to what it was before in human history. The attitudes towards relationships and marriage have changed but I think the 'conditions' of love remain unchanged. That said, love is different things, as in their are different kinds of love. But love, in true terms, should always be unconditional, based on the person themselves and not what they are or what they have, it is forgiving (sometimes to a fault) and it means that you will be there for them when they need you. I think true love is uncomplicated, it's relationships and situations that are (ie. you can always love someone, but whether you can marry, raise kids and spend the rest of your life with them is something else). \n\nSo which is the truer love? I don't think you can call the love for a spouse any truer than that for children, and vice versa. You can love in differnt ways.
He does, he just can't live with you.\nPeople may divorce, but they never forget.
Could be that he doesn't like to be alone and the only way for him to not feel that way is to get married. Have you talked to him about his other two marriages? Find out why he thinks the marriages failed. How long was each marriage? How long before divorcing one wife did he marry the second one?  If he lays all of the blame on his ex wives, I would be very leery about marrying him. Remember it takes two to make and break a marriage.\n\nThanks for the additional information.  So, he doesn't think he was at fault for either of the other two marriages breaking up? Hmm, I would worry about that one. Also you say you have different ideas on other things, sounds like you may not be compatible. Since you have been married twice before you should know where those went wrong and hopefully learned something. Don't be in such a hurry to get married and if your boyfriend continues to rush you, let him know that you want to take it slow. If he truly loves you he will respect your wishes. I also would suggest that if you do decide to marry him to go to some type of counseling before hand. Good Luck to you.
only you can know the answer to that... do you miss the person when they are not there ?? do you love being with them?? do they make you feel great? can you picture life with out them?
If she is truely in love with another, the best you can do is be her friend. If something happens within her relationship with the other guy, don't push yourself on her. Just be there and be a friend to her. If she wants to take things further, it will happen. If not, just be grateful that you have a true friend to confide in.
"There is a small mound of tissue just over the eurethra, inside the vagina, which is sensitive to pressure. It has been speculated that this is intended to trigger the final round of contractions when a baby is delivered, because it is exactly where the baby's head presses during final labor. \n\nBut...and perhaps far more useful in the modern world...it also causes those contractions during orgasm, if it has been gently stimulated during sex. \n\nThis causes, in some women, a ""push-out orgasm"", far more intense than a normal one, in which the vagina contracts harder and farther than normal. \n\nThis was first documented by a doctor named Grafenberg, ergo the name ""g-spot"".\n\nHere's a website which covers exactly how to find and stimulate the g-spot, and other advanced sexual techniques, in great detail:"
my best friend and i fight all the time. people tell us that we act like an old married couple. but it is the time that we arent fighting that makes everything ok. we have our fights, and even if they are about something that is not a small issue, we make up fast. if this isnt happening with you then one or both of you have to give when your in a fight. as long as you have great times when your around her, when your not fighting, it should balance out the fighting and your friendship will be fine.
CAUSE THEY LOVE PAIN..
If she's not Involved with the guy who's taking her to the prom, Then you should ask her out on a date before prom*** Remeber girls like guys to make the first move.So be foward and honest***. Then If she and you begin to date it's obvious who she'll go to the prom with.
You're a guy, so I guess I should be asking YOU that question :)\n\nMy boyfriend used to be like that.  He always thought I'd be around and didn't really appreciate me.  One day I got sick of it and said something.  Usually it takes more than saying something one time for it to make a change, but he did.  Now he appreciates me all the time.  He does really cute little things.  For example, he bought me this silly St. Patrick's Day pin at work one day.  I thought it was so sweet!  I love little things like this.  When he has a day off and I have to work, he always cooks me dinner.  I'm really lucky...and I remember to APPRECIATE IT!
i don't hang out with my ex girlfriends.  i have other friends.  he probably does too, so if he's hanging out with his ex there's probably a reason that you wouldn't like.
You can make this relationship work but it will take a lot of hard work.  You need to discuss why you cheated and why he cheated.  You need to learn to be very open tell him everything he wants to know and he should tell you everything you know.  Learn from your mistakes.  Love is really hard to find and it shouldn't be thrown away.  Don't take each other for granted again.
That all depends on what she is looking for. If you surround yourself with people that have similar interests etc...you will most likely be attracted to a girl from that setting. But...in general all women basically want the same things: \n1. Honesty\n2. Stability\n3. Understanding\n\nWhy men find those qaulities hard to maintain I don't know. So, if you work on just those three you will be on your way to being a guy that many women will find appealing.
It means that even though you can logically see that something is not going to happen, you still hold on to your hope that it will.

Judging by your attrocious grammar and spelling I would guess that you are far too immature to be dating in the first place.
it can,esp if one of u is planning to relocate..if not..it will be a long,sad,lonely time..\nBeing that u 2 are talking about the distance now..just try to be as realistic with the expectations and promises.
its okay, if you do not want to go into the same set of troubles, which made you leave him in the first place.\n\nI guess it all depends on how you feel about the person. If I were you, I would never go out with my ex, but then again I am I and YOU are YOU. \n\nAlso being an EX is not that bad, prolly you have fond memories too, and which you cherish upon, \n\nweigh on cherished moments, and times of digust, then follow your heart
are you both sexually active - if so then you may have made a mistake, otherwise, if you are not yet ready for intimacy, you did the right thing and sent her a strong message as well.
Yeah ask him to go with you, by yourself and splitting the cost is a good idea. The two of you are friends there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to enjoy each others company, unless you're thinking of someone else while you're together. Don't let this be a mercy date for either of you, make sure that the two of you can really have fun. It's not necessary to be open to other possibilities.\n\nEnjoy the Prom!
You need to work on changing yourself since you won't be able to change him. Talking to him won't help if he doesn't care about your feelings.\nYou have to make arrangements to either leave him or find a way to keep your sanity and self respect if you stay with him for financial reasons and that won't be easy to do.\n\nI would only stay with him if I couldn't support myself outside the marriage.  If this is the case I would distance myself from him as much as possible within the home. I would try to not sleep with him. Try to not eat with him.\nTry to not be there when he is there. He is toxic--poison--for your soul if he is this way and you need a place to vent. Keep a secret journal if you are sure he can't find it to write out your feelings. It really can help.\n\nIf he is cheating on you get tested for sexual diseases and make him use a condom every time, every time. Unless of course you can just stop having sex with him which would be the best course.\nBut if it were me I would leave even if I had to move in with my parents. What you are describing will kill your soul.
The eyes are a good start but i like it when a guy gives me all the attention when other gyrls are around that's shows me that hes into me.
Just keep it real! Talk about what ever is on your heart! If they really like you, it does'nt matter what you guys talk about!
Yes Diana.\nAnd I will love you back.
After 5 years and no offer of marriage, I'd leave since I am only wasting my time with the guy.  What I want in a man is someone who will treat me with respect, see me as his equal, and who is caring.
Over time it probably won't matter as much. He'll also likely become less skinny as he ages (metabolism slows down).\n\nIf you're not attracted to him now though, maybe you should just see him as a friend. Then, if you start feeling attracted to him later, your friendship may just naturally evolve into a relationship.
"well you can reas their bidy language or just ask them. but it all depends.\n\nThe problem is that body language is not always a safe way to find this out whereas by asking is just one simple step as the worst possible answer could be NO. There are some girls who can imitate the body language of an interested girl, but they are not interested in you. They will only play with your heart and/or use you.\n\nThese are some techniques to detect these types of ""users"" and that help to protect you from being used:\n\n1. First check out if she will give you her phone number, and if this is her true number! If she won't give you her number or it is a false one, forget her!\n\n2. Check out if she will go on a date with you. If she is ""too busy"" all the time or something like that and it is impossible to get a date with her, then she is not interested.\n\n3. If she is asking you to buy her a drink the first time you flirt with her, then alarms should go off in you head. Don't allow her to use you this way!\n\n4. If you are on a date with her do something where you don't need to spend too much money and don't bring her a present on the first date. You want her to love you as a person and not to love your presents or the fact that you pay for everything. Try to keep the temptation of using you as low as possible.\n\n5. After the first (or maybe the second) date tell her something like ""Well, I really enjoyed...."" and so on and ""Maybe we can do this again next time. You can call me..."" It is important to tell HER to call YOU because she will only call you if she is interested.\n\n6. Analyze if she only wants do things that make her happy. For example, if she is calling you only if she wants to have someone to repair her car or something like that, but never calls you for a normal date, then think about it...\n\n7. If you find out that she has a boyfriend or if she even tells you that... FORGET HER! She may pretend that she is interested in you and that she might leave her boyfriend for you, but she will NEVER DO IT!!!\n\nTry to use the methods from the above and ask yourself always if the ratio of giving and taking is 50 to 50. If you realize that it is not, then stop giving and see if she still wants to continue the relationship (or the flirt etc.). And DON'T get blind because of your feelings and/or her body language. Even a ""user"" may have a sexy smile..... ;-)\n\nanyway hope this helps."

hey..I guess you gotta be expressive & show that not everyone knows everything. There may be areas which you are more intelligent in - show it. it's all about actions. She may not be exactly jealous but she's just a snob. Someone who's competitive, one who must win in all situations. You are more like her opposite, that's why she only has you as her friend - you give her a sense of victory. I think u should try & get her to appreciate other friends/people around her. Have a break from her some times, please. Take care
You can't make anyone do anything.  You can hint around to it, you can suggest it, or you can tell them if they don't do it, you will never talk to them again.

I'm not trying to be mean, but are you sure the take a break thing isn't just a reason for him to persue some flings with other people.  If I had some sort of psychological problem, or  any problem for that matter I'd rather have someone close to help me through it.  As a couple you need to sh*t or get off the pot.
"I also recomend that you read the book that ""unlearn34"" recomended. But to go further, I was taught that women are more emotional than men(not saying that is bad at all).  Its just that us men have a hard time knowing what we actually feel. It might even take us an entire day before we actually relize what we felt about a certain event the day prior. When my grandfather died I didn't cry or feel any pain for awhile. I sat through the funeral with no emotion at all(that doesn't mean I didn't care for my grandfather, i loved him dearly), it took me a week before i relised that he was gone for good, and then i broke down with tears.  What im trying to get at is we really dont know what we are feeling at the time, its just the way we are.  As for the impossible to understand part, well just find the right guy that you can talk with for hours on end about anything rather than looking for a guy purly on looks. Also some of us are just shy, i know i am and because of that i have a hard time opening up to anyone."
well if its not working out you should tell her babe i dont think its working out . tell her in a nice way u dont want 2 hurt her. so then u have 2 decide with wich girl 2 go with from all 7 !!!   good luck
it's a give and take situation.  Weight is usually not an issue, but for health issues you might want to consider losing at least 70 of that lbs.  Sometimes presentation counts a whole lot. \nI for one, look for a woman with a great attitude, and also present herself diligently in public. Someone who can hold out on her own, and not lean on others.  Looks is just 5% of my qualities i look for, compared to 50% for attitude and 20% for presentation.  Real men look for the qualities in a woman, not looks. \nBuild your confidence up first, then start from there.
First off. stop playng that kind of game.. If you want her back, take her back.. if not.. MAKE SURE you let her know straight up.. that you don't want her back. It may sound mean.. but it will save her a lot of pain.
I have to bitter say that life is about being responsible to what you have said. You call it quit, then you should consider if he's worth for you to call him again or not.\n\nBut whatever the reason of your break up, 3 Years is not a short time. A lots of feeling, Love, Time and Life consideration already involved during this period. I think if both of you could call it off easily then this is not a good relationship you should bet for. Break up after 3 years relationship will need more than just that.\n\nAnother advise: To love somebody is to accept every aspects of his life. If you can't, then stop thinking of him and move on with your life. You can change people but yourself.
Go on with your life.  Get together with someone else.  Jealousy is a powerful tool.
I am bi-sexual and I really dont see whats so bad about yeah I know its in the bible and all but I think some people are born gay and if God created us and wants us to be who he made us then why cant we like the same sex. If you believe in God and live for him then I think you can still make it to heaven so it shouldnt matter.
"Take your wheelchair on to the dance floor and ""dance"" with it. I saw a guy do that once in a dance bar and it was GREAT! Lots of girls came up and danced with him and he made lots of girls laugh (good naturedly) I will never forget that! He just moved his wheelchair back and forth to the beat of the music."
yeah it means he lke you i had a guy who you to play fight me and i think he like me but i never knew that until the year after we left school. so you should go for it.
I think I'd cry. =D I'm super-sensitive to these things. I cry at the happy parts in movies too, so of course I'd cry at my friend's weddings. =D\nIt's sort of the change in a person. It's knowing that they won't be the same again. That they don't 'belong' to you anymore. They're somebody else's. Weddings are worth the tears. And in answer to the email you sent, yes it was...good. It was good to let out the tears and just stand there,crying, looking at this beautiful view of two people very much in love. It was nice to cry and be able to let them out without feeling ashamed. It's not a bad thing to cry at weddings. Many people do so.\nI cry even at birthdays. Think about the buckets I'll cry at weddings. =D
Realize you have a head start when you have already been talking to this person even if it is on line.  Just walk in there and be yourself as I hope you have been while talking to him on line.  If you are then you have nothing to worry about.  If its your looks I hope you walk in there being proud of who you are because there was something about you that got him to the point of wanting to meet you.  RELAX and enjoy the time
Girl you are looking to get hurt....Leave him
Maybe some guys are just to shy to ask you out or approach you because they think you're so pretty. If you like someone and they don't approach you then go for it GURL!!You know they think you're hot.It's just that they're all scared.
"In person is more likely to be ""real"" than online. I've met a enough people from online, that you only get a partial view of who they really are. YOu dont see how they really act until you sit across from them. You are in full fantasy mode. \n\nTake a step back and be realistic. Someone far away whom you never met offers only text, a person nearby offers their laughter, shoulder to lean on, their hand to hold. \n\nLove for yourself means letting go when things are not fully right for you."
"Have you ever heard the line ""There is a thin line between love and hate""? They are both strong emotions. It is definitely possible to still love someone who has hurt you, but my prediction is that it will fade in your situation. Just try to move on and focus on a new guy, and I promise that you will feel better."
i almost hung myself when it said i couldnt answer anymore questions yesterday
I like guys who are intelligent and act confident. I hate guys who are arrogant and cocky.
"if i was in your situation i would give the person a change no matter what they looked like. . . have u heard the sayin "" u cant judge a book by its cover"" well yea thats what im talkin about. . . this person might be ""ugly"" as u say, but they also might have a heart of gold , you might fall in love if u just talk to her and give her a chance. . opposites do attract"
"just be nice, and be yourself. don't pretend as someone you're not coz she might learn to like the other person you're trying to become with.\n\ngirls love to be pampered, when you find someone you like treat her special, just be ""extra"" in everything to her, like be extra caring, extra thoughtful, things like that... i hope it will help. goodluck! ^_^"
go for the one u like.
you can be with him as long as you know and understand that he is going to be a father, and he has a child that he wants to provide for and be in that child's life, if you cannot accept that, it never will work.
I have been in a relationship with someone that I met online, it didn't work out because we lived far from each other. My roommate in college used to meet a lot of guys that way. Needless to say, they didn't work out EVER.\n\nJust becareful. People can lie so easily on the computer--it's harder to tell if they are lying or not.
when wisdon settle in  that the perfect time to settle down
Being a man, I would say just go up to him and tell him how you feel. There is nothing I hate more than a guessing game. Just put it all out there, and you will get a response, even if it isn't one you want. Holding that in just makes things worse later on for you, and him. I like it when a girl comes to me to tell me she wants me. Even if im not interested in that girl, i admire that.
ewe thats gross, then the next thing you'll say the girl is fat.
really how can you say your the only NORMAL kid maybe its vies versa
There is no need for 10 steps ,only one is enough ,just find the right girl
Well it sounds like you are trying to make yourself. Im sure once you stop trying so hard you can get some results. Think of it this way, you dont fall on purpose. Its an accident

Why do you stay with you boyfriend if he thinks you're ugly?\nHe's treating you soooo badly.. Even if you do love him, get out of that relationship, he doesn't deserve you, and you're suffering!
"you definitely should marry him. you need to take care of a few things before you do, though. Buy this book: The Five Love Languages"" by Gary Chapman. Both of you read it and understand it together. It will put you years ahead of many married people who don't understand eachother. I've been married 12 years. My parents were not in support of my marriage, so I got married at the Justice of the Peace in Norfolk, Va. You two could have something that is missing from so many other people's lives. Unconditional love. You must be prepared to expect the unexpected, and commit to your marriage. Life is a roller coaster, but hold onto eachother with all you have inside you. Be around those who support you. As far as it goes for his lack of a plan, he needs to dive into something, and just do it. I had no idea what I was going to do in life, and I have never been to college. I am making over 40,000 a year."
if you are suspicious after 25 days then there is something wrong
because you grounded her
you should get her something that is special to her like that will show her that you know her and love her for who she is.  girls at that age need reassurance that they are bein the right type of person and try to change to please everyone
Well, unfortunately, U don't give us any details about it, why don't U just explain some details so we can help U.
can be hard to tell, and also the situation.\nIf its at work, maybe u shud see if his/her friends are involved and they are trying to have a laugh then u know theyre messing with you.\n\nmaybe take some common interest up with them and take it from there
"You MET a girl a few DAYS ago, and you're in LOVE?  Wow... well anyway, despite your ""love"" for her, sounds like she may not even be interested in you.  Why not call and talk to the woman you love, instead of using text?  Geez."
make sure you let her know that ALL of the feelings you had for the other person are gone now and are replaced with feelings for her. just show how much you are and how much love you feel for her and im sure shell understand.plus its really awsome you care enough about her to make the issue a question on here.
Take him behind the bike sheds of course! If no bike sheds then behind the stage after school!!!
sometimes it's more about the confidence and not the looks.  confidence in both men and women makes a person more attractive
The most important thing here is to not wake him up while he is sleep walking because if you wake a sleepwalker while at it, he may get a severe shock which can be very harmful.\nYou should talk to him about this, a therapy is required to cure the habbit of slepwalking, and unless you talk to him about it, you cant do anything.You should not hesitate because this will be for his benefit also...
I have a stubborn in-law myself.  The best say to make life easier is to not create waves.  If there is an issue that really doesn't need to be a confrontation, then let it pass.  If you do not live with this person, being a little more distant with personal details will work.

My best friend, who happens to be my husband too!!
yes you can although you might want to give it a little time. if you just jump right back in the saddle after a divorce your only going to let your feelings for your ex affect the relationships you'll be getting into.
there are always girls out there who need a friend
Maybe he doesn't like illiterate chicks...or he just lost your number.
You can do a reverse search on the property, get his dads name and track him through the property tax roll, then locate your friend that way. County records is key, voter registration. www.555-1212.com, www.publicdate.com, these are a few search sites which may help.\n\nGood Luck.
i guess i can relate to that just at the moment no its not love its physical attraction....because it was his(her)looks u like u dont even care to know anything anymore u just actually like him(her)just by the looks.....
Ask them out.  If they say yes, you are golden.
coinicdence, there is no such thing
Well, why are you tense? He's obviously outside of his comfort zone, and this makes him a little freaked out. If you feel tension, surely you know what he's feeling, just not to the same extent.\n\nRemember that not everyone is as comfortable in social situations as you are. Have compassion for him. Try to help him feel more at ease. Eventually he'll get used to you.
So, if he likes the streets so much, threaten to put him there permanently. You can always find someone who loves you enough to be there with you and spend time with you. This is not to say that the hubby shouldn't do some things on his own - you need your separate interests, too - but he should not only want to be with you, but he should look forward to the time he gets to spend with you.
now-and-forever.com or mygatsby.com has really cute ideas!!\nI got the ones that show the back of a car and you scratch off the date.  Good luck!!!!
I love women, I have dated big girls and small girls. Different races and different creeds. It has always come down to, not how she looks, but how she makes me feel.\nI pity the guy that limits himself to Barbies or big girls for that matter. So much of attraction is not just with the eyes. Ultimately it is how someone touches you or how they make you laugh or how easy they are to share silence with.\nTo any of you guys out there that limit themselves to a body type when seeking mates, good luck buddy.
Yeah sure why not? You never know it could turn out to be the best experience of your life. But also keep in mind that if you really really dont think it will work out then you might not want to waste your time. Hope I helped
the most important person in my life i would have to say is jesus no matter what he is always there for u from think to thin but the the next person special in my life ould have to be my parents bc i love them and they love me
yea..long distance relationships suck straight up..but what u can do is let him chill..and he will call you when he is ready if u keep making him bothering him than he will get madder..if he doesnt wanna forgive u then oh well it takes a strong person to forgive so apparently he aint strong..i dunno  i hope u work it out..
True Love ....\n\nIt's as mysterious as the stars it was written on, as elusive. It is everything it's hyped about to be. It's worth taking every risk, it's worth fighting for, and the problem is if you don't risk all then you risk even more. Love is kind of an elixir that lures us out of reality and into the realm of fantasy. It's like a drug creating an altered state of consciousness.\n\nLove is the moment when an unfavorable act becomes favorable, when you make excuses for some one else's mistakes, when you learn to tolerate, when you learn acceptance, when sacrificing becomes the beauty of life. \n\nIt's the courage to tell the truth especially when you believe its unspeakable.\n\nIt's the time when seeing some one, being seen by some one and thinking about some one feels good, when you learn to find happiness in the smallest of moments.\n\nThat's love--when you learn to put down your ego and love some one more than that.\n\nLove is forgetting your self and remembering some one else. \n\nLove is choosing your partner exactly as he is, and supporting him in his choices. It's honoring your partner's truth and wanting best for him.\n\nIt's not controlling or possessing but rather respecting and trusting.\n\nIt does not mean owning some one, getting some one, rather it means being happy in your loved one's happiness.\n\nLove means living without judgments. It means treasuring your beloved and never taking him for granted. \n\nLove means being able to forgive and learning to give more then you get. It means reaching out when you don't want to, communicating rather than assuming and asking questions rather than jumping to conclusions.\n\nIt means working things out rather than fighting, fighting rather than leaving, and staying through the hurts and disappointments, knowing that through commitment all can be healed. \n\nFalling in love is like being enveloped in a magical cloud. The air feels fresher, the flowers smell sweeter, food tastes more delectable, and the stars shine more brightly at night. You feel light and lofty as though you are floating through life, and your problems and challenges suddenly seem insignificant and easily surmountable. Your body feels alive, your skin tingles and you awaken in the morning with a smile on your face. You are suspended in a state of supreme delight.\n\nLove is a feeling and an action that arises from the most primal place within us. Making a relationship however, is a process that is learned. A relationship is the vessel that carries the precious cargo of love through time.\n\nRelationships are like a precious antique lamp; it takes a little polish and some effort to restore it to its valuable condition. A relationships love and luster will only improve with age if you continually give it the care that keeps it beautiful. But once you uncover its essential beauty it will bring you joy for years to come.\n\nAfter having said all this I want to say that you have to make the decision on your own, on one hand love is magic, on the other it's time tested relationship worked hard and furiously at.
I am not 100% on what you wrote because it doesn't completely make sense to me. But whatever it is i say let the boy love the girl. a lot of the time is really just a crush that will pass if not well rarely but people do find love at an early age. Let him do his thing. Talk to him though about relationships and all that. make sure he knows what is ok and what is not. Than the most you can do is trust him to do the right thing.
yes some of these questions are not fit for minors to see. the worst part is half of the inappropriate questions are asked by minors.
about $200!
tell her that you are going to ravage her so completely she isn't going to be able to walk straight for days.
He has to be cute.I like guys with like shoulder length hair. And they have to be considerate of my feelings. He has to be as tall as I am or taller. He has to be nice and sweet. He has to make me smile and laugh. And he can't be a dumbass or he's not worth my time.
I tried to answer you but Yahoo says your e mail is not confimred. I wrote a long funny one too. Full of honesty as well.  Will try again later I guess.  Have fun!\n\nYou sound fun too.  For the record the goat is alive.  HIs name is Domino.  All the neighbors dream of eating him.
if you still have contact info try calling (but block ID in case their screening your call.)This'll catch em off guard and ha no choice but to talk to u.
When it's one night
the best I sojest to you is if you never did it just wait for some more time just get marry.tell you girl also that its not good before time.all things on time is looks nice but terebal off time any way good luck
I guess it would make family reunions easier.  Seriously there has to be better options!
they smoke because they are addicted to the stuff and if you ask me they are stupid for trying the stuff in the first place but they do and what is done is done. some people some just to look cool though. (by the way they dont look they look like someone who was stupid enough to risk thrie life to look cool. hope i answered your question enough to help
well,\n\nwhy not give yourself a chance. i wouldnt say give him a chance, cos it appear to me that he is mature enough not to rush you. and he love you enough to do that. nothing is for sure in a relationship, but since he is so nice, worth a try. beside, age shouldnt be a barrier. good luck.
"i have a friend that is in an online ""relationship"" right now, for the past 8 months. she constantly refers to him as her man and calls him by the name that he gave her, which is mark. they keep making plans to meet, but one or the other of them ends up having to cancel.\n\neverytime i hear her talking about him, it makes me want to puke. she doesn't know him. she knows nothing about him, yet she talks about him so ""lovingly"". she's a pretty girl, but she's shy and she's insecure.\n\ni think online love affairs gives people the freedom and confidence to be who they wish they could be. she's able to say things to this guy that she could never say to someone's face. she's also able to lead him to believe that she looks a certain way (the way that she wishes she really does look).\n\ni think it's pathetic and sad. i do not believe in online love affairs. the whole idea is fake and it allows people to continue being less than who they want to be in their real lives, while living a double-life with an online alter-ego. it's just not healthy."
Give a blink
something you obviously aren't old enough to be doing
write them a letter telling them how you feel get it all out the hate the joy the time you had the seal it  and  then send it or burn it  but let it be your last letter  only letting the pain go grieve and move on then star  anew relationship as friends and as a mother as your pesonal higher power to help
lmao sorry hun, its completly up to her, don't pressure her. that makes us feel like we have to do it. it is completely her desicion well yours too. but weather she is going to or not is hers
as you can see, if you truely love your man ,but because of one thing which you could not figure out his seeing another girl, i think your best option isto re-evaluate your relationship with him, first what are your atitudes,have you ever ask him how he felt about you and the things he loves to see you doing ? some time there may be a particular issue between both of you that usually turn him down which you have not discern(in this case do ask your partner how he feels about what you do when you are together,more so if you are confrontational do employ dailogue and make him love you and he will\nthanks\ndo write me
NOT ME!!!!!!!!!!!!! That is nasty. And that is why I have the other hole.
take her to visit a women's shelter nothing like a dose of reality
It's both a sickness and an addiction (its also a sin). This can be as bad as alcoholism in some people. I suggest family counselling if you can afford it. Many pastors are trained as cuonsellers if you can't afford anything else. If he wont go, go yourself for support and advice. If you are a Christian don't forget to pray for him.
when the time is right you'll know how it feels also
pretty pretty hard. and depressing. apprciate her now while you got her. and make her extra special by an candle light supper!!! she will love it!!!! and dont forget the wine!!!!!
"1) go to doubleyourdating.com\n2) buy your boyfriend the e-book ""attraction isn't a choice"" (~$40, download as .pdf)\n3) tell him to read it, and ask him to apply what he learns to your relationship\n\n(the gist - women usually feel the strongest feelings and passion for strong, manly men who are confident and sure of themselves... and most ""nice"" guys lose some of that edge.  if you both have good self-esteem, then read the book together with him - especially if you want to have one of those relationships where you're still teasing each other ten years from now, and are strong enough to agree to disagree about the stuff that doesn't matter that much, but neither one of you will abuse the other, nor allow yourself to be abused.\n\ni won't go into the evolutionary psychology about why it will work... it just will.\n\nthe book will tell him to tone down the ""sweetness"" a little, but that doesn't mean he can't still be caring, loving, and affectionate, and do the right thing.\n\ngirls just don't get hot and bothered about guys whose main aura is ""sweet"".  read a romance novel, a man with a little beast in him is a good thing, as long as he's still got honor).\n\nalso, how much he uses what he learns is something he can ""dial up"" or ""dial down"" to keep your fire burning at just the right hotness.  and ironically, you can use the same ideas to throw it right back at him, and that will keep his fire stoked also.\n\njust be careful not to burn down the house."
If you love her tell her if she says it back there is a good chance (80%) she does.
Tricky\n\nYou sure you want to be with me\nI've nothing to give\nWon’t lie and say this lovin's best\nLeave us in emotional peace\nTake a walk, taste the rest\nNo, take a rest
be nice
Hey thanks man.  I appreciate knowing somebody out there will listen and give their opinions to dilemmas.  You're like the person who asked how everybody's doing.  A real simaritan.
for me its just a good sense of humor, non-drama and being real..but I'm bi so maybe I don't count..
oh that was a good plan for ur future with him...but u have to show him that u was not like the gf he last have...
You don't know until you tell the person that you love them and see if they feel the same way.
On classmates there is a Nicky Allison, she graduated in 1991. If they are related, maybe she can help you. Good luck!!
go out some were at night and invite him home and look sexy near the bed and kiss him and it will lead other places.
You know your friend best. Are the happy couple registered anwhere? Ask and see. Check with other friends and some family members they might have a good idea .. its not polite for them to come out and tell you what they want unless you ask.
i fell face first in the mud right in front of him. of couse, that was an accident...
"Say, ""Are you aware that you come across as very arrogant?  (yes/no)  Oh.  Well, you do.  I just thought if you didn't already know, I should point it out.""\nAnd walk away  :-)\nOr you can tell him he's out of your league, or tell him you don't like the way he acts & refuse to have anything to do with him as long as he acts that way....\nLots of options here.\nSometimes you just need to put someone in his place  :-)"
Sounds like hes living in the past and he needs to focus on the present.
You really can't stop he/she from talking about their past . Sometimes it's better to talk about things .\n\nAngel
"Crikey, look at the amount of interest this question is having.\n\nNah, he's probably too overcome by pleasure, that he's dumb struck. \n\nIt's working well, ain't it? Why fix it? At least you have an unsual thing in your sex life. Many people don't even have half as good sex as you do. \nHe says he enjoys, good, do you? If yes, count your lucky stars.\n\nOne day when you're old, you can tell your grand-daughters of ""The Adventures of The Silent Sex Partner""."
Sure.why not?
walk around naked and fart
just tell her u mean so much to her and stuff and say u will go and visit her and say u hope she comes and visits u. r u willing to hav a long distant relationship if she is going along way away? just tell her u will b there 4 her
It sounds like a bad idea if you couldn't even make it four months.  Love and relationships are a combination of things and sometimes little things like being near family or living in a certain place are part of that combination.  In your case it sounds like it is important that your close to your family and friends.  Maybe he should move to where you are instead of you doing the moving.
I would like to date you....\nBut I'm thousands of miles away from Dubai, sorry :-)\nMaybe another time :-)
Well when they are drinking there really isnt a rock bottom because the next time they drink it keeps compounding. For alcoholics that have quit it was the last time they had a drink.
He was either just using you or this is his way of dealing with the fact you will be leaving.  Either way it is pretty sad thing to do.
seems u both kicking yr love life!!!! scaring to say good bye .. lovers getting loads to talk getting funny naughty joking .. i dont go with quiet girl.
Smart girl - move on to someone who treats you like you should be treated. How do you see your life? Do you really want him in it? If he really wants you, he will let you know. ..sooner or later!
"""The greatest aphrodisiac is power!"""
I am sure she is a very lovely woman who has raised a very wonderful daughter.
SEX before marriage is definitely better,because there is no commitment.I would suggest having alot of sex with as many people as possible before you make that BIG commitment.
If it were me, I would focus on other things, enjoy getting to know 'my self' again, and see if fate brings someone my way.  I wouldn't go looking.  \n\nJoin a club, or take up some hobbies. Go about life differently than you have in the past.  What you were doing doesn't seem to be working, so taking a different path might be the most advisable course of action.
usually a guy tell you he'll call but doesn't.he always say he's busy or makes up some lame excuse for not calling or meeting up with you.sounds disinterested when talking to you.there are so many to mention but let's put it this way:if he loves and cares for you that much,he WILL find the time to be with you no matter how busy he is!
u know, normally u dont hear of girls asking guys out but i know a few people have asked a guy out before. including me. just ask him out yourself!
don't give up. You just haven't found the right ones yet. \n\nIn a relationship, don't trust anyone entirely until they prove that they can be trusted.
Yes.  I did.  It's not easy at all, but it's possible.  He needs a tough love environment.  If I loved my husband very much, I would be on his ass non stop... keeping him busy with other things.  Painting, cleaning, anything to keep his hands busy.  But he will go through a huge depression period.  It will not be easy.
is she a x girl ?    sounds like you might have strung her along.  i guess just tell her ..does she have something on you that would make you not want to just say get the hell on woman?
depend on what you want. if i love a man and he love me, i will fight for my rights
kill them
Just get covered everywhere with hickies, so they blend together. Then It'll look like you have a suntan.
you need to care about the people you are flirting with, if you genuenly like them then flirting is ok otherwise ask your self if you really want to start something or if your a tease.
Hell on High Heels
The woman your ment to be with will find you weither she or you is married or not.When it's ment to be,it's ment to be.Something will happen between them and it will end if she's supposed to be yours.If not,then that means someone is out there for you that is a much better fit for you.
""
if you think about them all the time and you think about them in your future plans then your in love but if your just thinking lustfull thoughts then its just affection with a tint of lust.
tell HIM to stop.  If he doesn't, tell a teacher.
If you both love each other and she/he knows you're the one and the feelings are mutual, go for it.....what are you waiting for?!?!?
just be yourself and not too nervous
Honey, just because you are in a relationship doesn't mean that everybody becomes ugly. You are still alive and you still have eyes\nBut if you partner is jealous and insecure that might cause the relationship to end, why would you want to be with someone that you always had to hush fears.\nGood Luck
Don't feel bad.  Just tell him that you feel that you are not working as a couple but would like to remain friends and try to keep the friendship that you had before.  It sounds easier said than done, I know.  But believe me, I've done this and things between me and my best friend are the same now as they were before we got together.\n\nGood luck!
in a lot of cases, due to the nerves and excitement, some sleep so you can be ready for the honeymoon.
by participating in it
what is the diff btw the two.\nbut then i guess it may b different for differnt cultures and may change depending upon ones lifestyles.\nok so the question is about me let me tell u my ans.\ni am an indian and in india family relations are give tremendous value.and family relations are made of love and respect for each other. the relationship with ones partner is also of the same nature.\ni love my parents i respect them they mean a lot to me.they hav sacrificed a lot for me and often they have made it their dream to see me have my dream realised. and i owe a lot to them.currently i am single and just the thought of leaving my parents for someone who just walked into my life with no guarantee that he shall stay seems impossible.\nbut then from others who hav had experience i hav learnt that ur whole world changes once u r in love. so i may change then. but now for me it is my family.\nok so thats my ans.\nnow i hav a quest for u........why did u ask this quest?just so? or is it coz u r havin a hard time deciding in ur own life?
when u find urself smiling for no reason in the middle of the day.. =P
There won't be a fire until we lit it. So to let a flower blossom, you have to plant the seed first. Show him some interest and see if he likes it or not. If you are the direct type, bring him to a nice place and confess!
no its not just men stuff. im female and i love it \nD O G G Y  style! hey - u never know until u try. so try it and see. it's not for everybody tho. but at least u will know after u try it. like i said - i love it!
Well just be honest .. dont show ur pic at the first instance .. take a while to get to know the person ... personlaity is important .. try to impress ur date ... after that go out with em .. nice restaurent ,.... romantic dinner .. wear a suit with a nice tie and bring her a gift ( women luv perfume )... dont get drunk on ur first date ... just be honest
i think now that is a fad now to be bald my son is 31 and shaves his head and i think he looks very handsome plus some of his freins has bald heads too very cute and he has no problums with the girls boy let me tell you.now when i see someone who is bald i myself tend to look and most of the men are pretty good looking even if he doesnt shave its now is a big fad in kailua,hawaii.so i think there lucky if there bald so that they wont have to shave.good looks ya
"Don't be embarassed.  Everyone m.a.s.t.u.r.b.a.t.e.s., your girlfriend included.  Ask her if she'd like it if you did it in front of her on purpose some time. Or does she like the idea of m.a.s.t.u.r.b.a.t.i.n.g in front of you?  \n\nNone of these ideas are that far fetched. Two minutes ago, I just saw a question on Y!Answers from a girl that said ""How come guys always want us to m.a.s.t.u.r.b.a.t.e in front of them but they are never willing to do it in front of us?""  \n\nAnother thing you could do is use it as a lead in to teach her how you like to be touched, and she could do the same for you.\n\nI think this is more of an opportunity than a problem, bud."
definitely a poor husband who cares. You can always make money by finding a good job and become rich. But you can never change the character of any person who is no care type and who goes behind money, who doesn't care for any relations.
The big hairy guy is actually an alien.\nStay away, you know full well the consequenses of hanging with aliens. \nDo you really need more probing of orifices not well suited for that activity?\nGo for the sister, no one knows but Y!A nut jobs, and we ain't tellin'!!!
my first experience was with a women who was lactating. Yum

me personally no, but i can see how some would have a problem its not because there racist its actually the opposite they are afraid they will come off sounding racist that's all so don't worry it should not matter the race you will find the right one eventually no matter if he is black white green or blue, there is some one out there for you and you will know when you find him, or her
No, but you can give me two points for this answer!
Yes I still mast ur bate, I don't find it more pleauseable the sex with my wife by any means. I continue to do it because sometimes the sexual desire is to strong to deny (especally after a few days without it) and the time in not approprate for a romp with the wife.
Ever since I was little, I always wanted a surprise party. I loove surprises.  I remember after living in Cali for 2 yrs, I was coming back to MA and after a long 3 day bus drive ride, I was finally home.  Once I hit MA my allergies started acting up so after the first night home, I woke up, took a shower and took some severe allergie meds. My parents wanted to go to dinner, so I agreed but I was totally out of it. We were meeting them at this place and then we were going to head to dinner. I walked into the place, and my mom came running over and pulled me by my arm.  There was my whole family. Just waiting there for me to welcome me home. It was really cool, but I was totally out of it from the allergie meds and I almost didn't even do my hair. It was actually quite a nice time. \nI also like surprising people, but I tend to ruin it because I get too excited about it! Hehehehe...over all, as long as it's a good surprise, I love them! :D
she probibly does care a great deal for you, and to see you being with someone else hurts. maybe it embarrases her to talk to you because she knows, that you know that she likes you. and maybe she feels a little scared that you will reject her.
yes i do i can talk for ever once i get going ha
What are you trying to get away with??????????
"Just let it happen naturally is how.  If it's meant to be that's what it will turn into....and will do so w/o you really realizing it.  Just enjoy getting to know him and take it slow.  I know that can be hard to do when you really like someone but taking it slower and getting to know eachother will build a much more solid relationship.  Just because you've not had some big talk too doesn't mean he's seeing someone else. Who says he's dating around?  Bet you have nothing to worry about! Don't dare try to have that ""talk"" either.  Just let him do the chasing and have fun with you're together.  If you start hinting/asking him about being exclusive you're gonna not only get on his nerves but drive him away as well.  Just let nature take its course....Live and enjoy!"
THERE R 2 MANY WAYS TO PUT ON HERE!\nBESIDES FOOD THERE IS SEX!\nLOTS TO DO WITH CHOCOLATE AND SEX!\nWHEW WEE
Absolutely. It's hard enough to find a good one much less\na great one. The wait would be worth it.

anything that has sex in it, is cool with me but of course when there is LiveSex why would i go with the Cyber one? If it is a pre-request then I ll do it.
I'd thank god for a girl with a wild side.
I'll go out with you in a second but the miles apart make things a little hard. You parents grew up in different times where the norm was to have kids at 17.\nbtw-Hiphopgirl girl don't ask her if she is ugly because she isn't .\nA-lot of guys are asses so find the right one and don't change who you are.
a kiss is akiss .....your lips on my lips
ditch her
Try to chat to him, talk to him, maybe even date him. You can never decide whither the person is good or bad by the look, beauty... Try to just talk to him or have lunch together to see who he is, and then you could decide wither you love him or not, and he will decide who he likes more, you or your friend.\nGood luck! Hope you get it going with him!
be humbly open and honest
Okay so you had to move in September, yeah that is very tough to leave all the things you know and how you would rather stay and always keep things the way they are. In your parents defense they do know best and made the best decision based on whatever their reasons are. So you had to move and now things are not as great as they once were. WHY WHY you ask. Answer: You are not making them as great as you want them to be (when you found out about the move you most likely had poor negative feelings about it and therefore things are really how you feel). You make your life, your happiness, you are completely in charge of that not anyone can make you anything. So really it is up to you. Try signing up for some activities at school that you like (that is always a good way of meeting (note I did not say finding) people who have things in common with you. Keep your grades up, do extra studying, maybe see about getting in with a study group after school. Find a hobby maybe running, working out, puzzles (I reccommend soduku), sewing (cross stich is easy and fun and can be a really cool gift to give) whatever interests you. What I am trying to tell you here is invest in yourself and being friends with you and liking you and making the best of a situation that maybe really is not that great now but if you do that than you will find you don't need friends but you like to have friends. Be patient and learn to make yourself happy and you will not need to have or think you need to have people around who make you happy. Whatever attitude you have towards yourself you will have towards other people and that will be the kind of people you attract. So love you and respect you and those kind of people will be attracted to you and want to be your friends. As for your sister, well if I had a nickle for every friend or sister or whatever that abandoned me when they found a boyfriend, I would be rich. When that relationship ends she will be back (hopefully your busy by then) and she will say I am sorry blah blah, but it will happen again and again. Don't put all your eggs in one basket and make everything about one person and ignore everything else because if that basket happens to fall all your eggs get broke so spread them around a bit. Mostly learn to hang out with your self and be happy for the times when you do get to be alone. Usually when your not looking is when you find things you have been looking for. That goes the same with friends. As for your old best friend if you have not spoke to her in over a year than maybe she has hurt feeling about that or if she just stopped talking to you than maybe write her a letter and appologize or ask why she does not talk to you anymore. Remember you will trully only have 2 best friends in your life and miles, time and distance does not ever change that friendship neither do boyfriends or girlfriends or problems. I hope this helps....Good luck with it all and I will keep you in my prayers.
Just because the two of you have broken things off, doesn't mean that your feelings will automatically shut off the moment things end. As long as you are honest with yourself then you can deal with your feelings, if you know there's no chance of getting back together then take some time out for you and then move on to someone else because time does heal all wounds, and when you meet someone else you can create new memories. Good luck
keep it up, living alone is the best coz marriage is never happily ever after. have fun and go beyond your limit.
"First of all - NEVER FORGET - if you are going to play hard to get (or in poker it's called ""bluffing"") then BE PREPARED TO LOOSE ALL.\n\nOtherwise, maybe you are reading in too much.  I'd suggest that you decide in your heart what you want more... THE TRUTH NO MATTER WHAT - or - THE GUY NO MATTER THE TRUTH.\n\nHe may have enjoyed being with you while it lasted, but don't hold it against him that he's elsewhere unless you were perfectly clear with him about what you wanted from him.\n\nIf you do want him - then FUCK the hard to get attitude and go after him with full force.  The WORST thing that can happen is you don't get him - but that's what you are going to get anyway on your current course of action.\n\nPEACE"
Believe it or not your parents are looking out for your best interest. As you become older you will realize that your parents weren't trying to control you but just preparing you for your future. Let's say right now you decide to take things to next level with someone you are in a relationship with and she becomes pregnant...guess what life is about to become 1000 x's harder.when you are young your way of thinking is alot different than when you turn let's say 27. Your idea and views about love and life will change. They just want to make sure that when you do make a VERY important life changing decision that you are really ready!
I'd be very pleased to help u out but I won't be able bcse of your poor poor spelling and syntax! SORRY!
Everyone is somebody's  ex
Excuse me, may I use a quarter? My mom told me to call home when I found the man of my dreams.
No idea. Never answered a question from her. Btw, thanks for the 2 points lol.
your talking to the wrong ladies.
i am a woman actually a girl i am 12 but.... dont do stupid things just get the guts and ask her out!!!!
tell him you arnt sexually active and dont plan to become so until your married. then wait a couple months so he knows your serious. if you cave before hen he will just think hes won control over you.

He's probably just shy.  Rather than just flirting with him, try talking to him.  Be friendly and nonjudgemental about it.  You could probablly kindle a spark if you really want to.  He could've met someone else though, so make sure you listen carefully to what he says he wants.
a wonmen that is honest,dependable,has a great job and there own money,goodlooks,caring,very few sex partners and that sounds like the perfect girl
yes for sure
Yeah\nI shouted out... JEREMY!
go f*** someone don't disturb us wid silly stories
is bopping the baloney the same as having one off the wrist?
"I'd tell the boyfriend, "" Dude if you don't want her I'll taker her"". He'll probably say go ahead and then your in the clear."
It means buy her a drink and lets talk and get to know each other.
"generally a woman's vagina stays ""tight"" until she bears a child.  Tearing through the hymen of a woman is the tell-tale sign of loss of virginity and being penetrated for the first time by a man's penis.  Some women already have a torn hymen from sports, activity, or pleasuring herself with objects placed in the vagina as teens.  The absence of a detectable hymen is not evidence of prior sex.  You will have some discomfort when a man enters your sex for the first time.  If it is a while between partners, a new partner will likely cause a little discomfort again, even if you are not virgin because you are being somewhat stretched to accomodate his girth...like using muscles again for the first time after a long break.  Also the diameter of his penis may make this less or more of an issue.  Some narrow penises don't cause the same stretching, while a thick penis stretches the vagina more.  Remember though, the vagina can stretch enormously to fit a baby's head through it, so you will not encounter a penis that ""doesn't fit"" for the diameter of it.\n\n   Choosing to have sex is another issue.  If you are certain about your choices and make sure that the choice you make is your own, not a man pressuring you to let him put his penis inside you, then losing your virginity when and to whom you want to is your business.  Sex is like walking.  We can do it naturally, but we get better at it once we have walked a ways.  And no one can really tell how many walks we've taken previously by looking.  \n   Being naive about positioning your body for penetration, about the experience and the response it brings to you, and about how timid you are about having a man penetrate you will tell a partner more about your past sexual experiences than your vagina and hymen will.\n\n   Whatever you decide, and whenever you choose to become sexually active, be sure to be safe (avoid rape and assault risks) and be sure to protect yourself from pregnancy and sexaully transmitted infections (make him wear a latex condom every time).  And when it happens for the first time, enjoy!  Welcome to the club."
You should probabably give her sometime...because the way it seems is that she either really has feelings for her ex or shes just upset with you and is trying to get back at you...Just give her sometime..and give yourself sometime to find out if shes really what you want and to make sure that u r not just attached
dump him
try creamed corn
If you confront him you will be able to move on quicker.  It is also nicer knowing one way or another.\n\nGood luck
You wont believe this when I tell you but...Walmart Bakery..or Stop n Shop bakery. \n\nI've seen Stop n Shop reproduce a Martha Stewart ladies finger cake that was to die for - and tasted amazing too for about 1/8th the cost.\n\nAlso Walmart - they make gorgeous cakes...\n\nI agree -why pay $500 on a cake that no one eats cause they are too busy dancing and drinking wine and beer -which doesn't sit well with cake!\n\nGet a simple two layer cake. then have a sheet cake in the back room for the staff to cut up and serve.
first of all, it`s MEET not MEAT!..oh well, this website is for questions u want people to answer or share ideas not to meet someone so u can get in a relationship.
The best thing is to be completely open with her and take a chance otherwise your always be wondering. Tell her how you feel and see where it goes from there. You never know until you try!

Trust is in believing yourself. IF you feel confident with the person, you shouldn't have to worry about him/her cheating on you. Trust builds upon communication. As long as you talk everyday, tell each other what's going on in each other's life, then trust will continue to grow. you don't have to always be together to actually trust someone. Being together every single day gets boring. When you are apart from your loved ones, you miss them more and you want to see them more. Creates more sparks and excitement in the relationship. :)
friends\nto where the snowcaps doesnt melt, where the sun doesnt sets
KEEP IT!\n\nC'mon be matured enough to accept and understand things!\n\nBut if you'll do it to help you to move on, do other matured ways instead.  Just don't give it back to him... PLease... I'm a guy I know how it feels!
This is too complicated and convoluted to even care about. Just go do something productive and forget all of this crap.
you know it. I would control yours if you help me control mine.
YES she should pay support.  Talk to a lawyer. \n\nWelcome to the big double standard.  I know 3 moms who have run out on their children and are DEADBEATS- it is getting more and more common. \n\nI applaud you for stepping up the the plate.
as for you, i think you should just relax for a little bit. maybe start hanging out with some new girls and just put the first girl on the backburner. this will help you in that you won't be so tied up in it all the time, and it will also help her because it will give her a chance to figure some stuff out. more importantly, she will see what she's missing if you two hang out less. this will likely make you much more attractive to her. or, worst case scenario, she'll pick ian. (which is unlikely) but if she does, then obviously the relationship wouldn't have worked anyway. moral of the story: give the relationship a little breathing room and cross your fingers. good luck!
Nothing wrong with taking a break, infact it sounds like the answer here. Absence makes the heart grow fonder; and if after a significant amount of time away if you still fight, its not meant to be.
There are two problems in your relationship.  The obvious one is that he has a drinking problem and relationship problems.  He needs treatment.\n\nThe second problem is that you are drawn to someone who treats you badly and you want to get him to love you.  \n\nYou can't fix him.  You can't save him.  And even if you could, it wouldn't mean that he would love you more or love you better.\n\nSometimes we're drawn to men like this because we don't feel very lovable, but that's not the case.  \n\nA real man will feel good about himself, and he will enjoy making you feel good spending time with him.  Don't settle for anything less than that.\n\nIf you have a hard time feeling like you could be in a relationship you don't have to work really hard to deserve or earn, find a good mentor, or therapist to work with.\n\nTwo broken hearted people don't make one good relationship.  Instead of fixing him, mend your own broken-heartedness and find real, mutual, reciprocal love.
This looks like the spelling of someone used to text messaging, which senior citizens don't use.  They are also much better at spelling than this.  You must be a very young teenager or even younger to spell this badly.
Aww Come on if she is that hot like you said and she told you that she loved you then you are suppose to kiss her and tell her you love her too, unless you don't have the same feelings in mind and you are only looking at her because she is hot? \n\nFirst be honest with yourself are you in love with her or her looks?\n\nBut either way whatever the answer is you must be honest with her and most of all be honest with yourself. You will never forgive yourself if you don't be honest.\n\nGood luck dude!!!!!
MEEEE!!!\nI'm in Makiki.\nWhere you at?

"Because we are stronger mentally, we don't have tunnel vision, we are adaptable, we are emotional, we can cry, we are usually the one doing everything possible to work it out, we are willing to talk, scream, get emotional, we do call these things talking it out by the way. Most of all because we have to! It is not fair, but it seems to be in our ""make-up"" of how God created us.  We were created for them, not them for us."

I've always known of spooning as cuddling. Especially when one lies on their side, and the other snuggles up close and almost conforms to their shape. I was told that it's called spooning because when two people snuggle up like this, they fit almost exactly, like two spoons in a silverware drawer. Why they call it spooning and not forking, I will never know.
Not all men, but i guess they be nice to get what they want, girls do this too :) usually its money
Because it is so wonderful.  Your heart expands so that it can feel more.
HI,\n\nIF YOU WAIT FOR A MAN TO COME OUT WITH SOMETHING WHICH HE DOES NOT WISH TO TALK ABOUT, THEN, I'M SORRY TO SAY, YOU WILL KEEP WAITING TILL ETERNITY. IF YOU NEED YOUR MAN TO TALK TO YOU, APPROACH HIM FOR A WORD ON IT AND AFTER A BIT OF NAGGING, HE WILL COME OUT WITH IT. IT IS BETTER IF YOU ASK IT NOW SO THAT YOU CAN ATLEAST MOVE AHEAD IN YOUR LIFE.

"People throw the word ""love"" around too loosely.  No one can love a person whom they do not know.  That is lust, not love.  If people would drop petty criteria such as height, weight, skin, hair and eye color, dress, flash and bling and look at how the object of their interest is treating them and others around them, they would experience true and lasting love.  When one knows the value and rarity of real love and appreciates it, then love can be returned to the one who deserves it.  One cannot receive or give what he or she cannot recognize and identify."
Yeah, thats a tricky one indeed. 1st and foremost you need to know if this guy is going out with anyone you know. If not, then how do you two relate? can you share some of these issues openly? The best way to go thereafter is to try and be close to him as much as possible, spend time with him, tell him how good he is and how lucky the woman he is gonna marry will be. In a nut shell what I am saying is your gestures may send the message across effectively, since I can already see that you are unable to tell him the way you feel directly.\nGood luck and I pray you will soon win his heart.
Are you the bachelor/ette? If so you shouldn't have to pay for anything. It is more typical now that the maid of honor/best man don't pay for the whole party. It is totally alright to split the bill. For my bachelor party that is what we did, everyone paid for themself and split up the bachelor's expense among the group. It worked out very nicely.
You just have to tell her that she's acting way too desperate. This girl doesn't sound like your friend...she just sounds like she wants guys to flock all over her. If she gets mad when guys compliment you, you need to just tell her that the whole world isn't going to think she's all that and she needs to get over it. She doesn't sound like a friend to me...or she just sounds like she's very insecure of herself.
luv happens wen u r cumplty lost in ur  guys world n crush is sumthing lik a crushed bottle nevr useful nor useless. if in luv just tell dat guy
bcs it gives us more pleasure than any other
Okay Chevonne this is you bestfriend here Chels haha but yea like u know that i was just like talking ot jesse ont he computer alot but like neither of us thought that we would end up like this just friends and then like i mean Jesse found me i didnt find him but like i odnt know good but i know what u mean i thought the smae thing that why do ppl say that its retarded lol but yea i dont know but i mean like MIKE really likes u still and all so like he found u when u moved here u know okay i dont know what i am talking about i am just rambling on about nothing haha  Peace omg did i ever tell u that i had soo much fun last night at the movies with Jesse *sigh* i love him i will tell u maybe about it in shcool only if u want to hear haha love ya lots
"THAT WAS AWSOME AND A GREAT GESTURE FROM U....\nremember that guys don't always have to pay for everything.. sometimes u have to help out... it's not bad.. but don't let him put that as an excuse for next time... or for some ""other times"""
Alright...something I've had experience in.  You know...if he's been cheating on you, sweetie, he wouldn't have even told you he'd thought about it.  That would be something he would be keeping to himself if he'd actually followed through on it.  Try and let the paranoia ease a little.  As long as you're afraid of it, you'll never have any real belief in the man that he'll ever really do right thing.  He's still there...he loves you.  This is the best security you have.  If we constantly pick cat fights with our men, there's no reason to be shocked if he's ever found in the cat house.  Ease up...love on him...build on what's in front of you.  God bless:)
The only man you need by your side is Jesus the Christ!  Apologize to him, then allow someone else to love you.  Women invest too much in boys who don't want them.  Let it be his loss, not yours.
You know people do assume things about a person, when they\nfirst look at them. If they have time to get to know you\nthey will learn the real you. And you are worth getting to\nknow! I am sorry about your eye sight. I will have to have\nsurgery on my eye when a growth gets to a certain size and I am not looking forward to it. I will have faith that all\nwill be well.  I really think wading through is better than\ndodging problems. When that's done it is resolved instead of put off. The best of luck.
Open up.
Could be a myth.  I worked in a manufacturing company with a lot of asian women, and they're all different just like any other race, philipino women tend to be more thick, and their tone of skin makes them super hot, but not one had natural big breasts.  Also the other asian ladies like Laoasian, chinese, and vietnamese, that worked there I can't remember one having natural big breasts...now that I think about it...Yes it's a myth...hahahah
when you feel safe with him, when you feel that feeling you don't get from anyone else, when you can see yourself spending the rest of your life with him, when you love him for what he's done, been through, and for him.
Dump him that's for sure. \nAnd do tell your sister what you feel about it and let hope your sister won't be his next victim.
Try some other bridal shops and shoe stores.  I listed a couple of places below that carry shoes.  Good Luck.
Depends. If u make a move on her and she wasnt interested, shes going to be hurt. It might ruin what u have with her. You could wait till she breaks up.\nOr, If u think she likes you, if she occasionaly flirts with you, go for it.
just ask him out. having others do it for you is a sign that you dont have the confidence to talk to him about personal things. and if a relationship developes you probably wont be able to talk to open heartedly about things
I like that... Yahoo family.\nA little boy is going through his grandma's Bible and comes upon a dried fig leaf. Excited he runs down the hall screaming: Granny granny, Eve forgot her panties in you Bible!\nHa ha!! Thought we could all use a joke. Nice chatting to ya!
I think maybe your on the wrong pages. This is the singles dating Question and Answer page.
ooh i just did this yesterday.  if you need time away you should just tell them that and tell them why.  they should appreciate your straight forwardness because otherwise you guys would probably begin to have problems if you haven't already.
sex makes you feel better right, so why not as long as you are both consenting adults in the right frame of mind a little fun never hurt anyone right.\nbesides if it a starnger it helps to know you dont have to get involved and have it turn serious, \nHave fun!
You can't force anyone to like you.
No, doesn't sound like he's gay, sounds like he's actually one of the nice guys! My bf watches Will and Grace cuz it's funny, he loves Karen, that doesn't make him gay cuz he watches it. A lot of guys are sensitive and he may really like you and if you are asking him if he's gay your putting a damper on his hopes with you! I would say go for it and ask him out, it sounds like you guys are already friends so why wouldn't he want to be with you? He is there for you and you guys make each other happy so ask him out!
Yes, and it was wrong to do so.  I've never told a girl I love them, to get sex -- never.  But I have responded to an I love your, by saying I love her back.  It still isn't right, as women are definitely more emotionally tied to a guy they are having sex with.  But life is a some of your experiences, and sometimes you make bad decisions, and if your smart, you learn from them.  So...girls, never tell a guy you love him during, or after sex, if it has not already been established that you both love each other.
""
One of the benefits of a relationship is that we will have someone in our corner to support us and to affirm our existence. This support adds to the trust that is needed in any relationship. Without mutual support, a trusting relationship will not develop. Each member must have its emotional needs met in order to continue to invest in the relationship. The continued support and the being there for the other person emotionally is the way in which trust is developed.
It takes very little for some men to claim that sex was solicited.  Women are careful, even conditioned, to avoid any hint of enthusiasm for sex during day to day interaction, lest some over-active oaf approaches.\nIt's just habit, but a useful one.
I used to have one.  I think he was just lonely.  He spent his life with his wife and after she passed he looked for companionship.  I didn't take advantage of him.  I remained his friend and in return he extended his kindness as well.  He took care of the things I would allow him to.  I believe that was the thrill for him.... just knowing that he could be needed again at times.
"If your wife wants you to spend all of your time with her, any kind of relationship, platonic or not, will affect the marriage.\n\nBy the way, platonic relationships are usually called friendships - I presume that this is what you meant, a buddy, female by your ""extramarital"" reference, to share interests with. Nothing wrong with it - most couples have at least some outside interests that are not shared, and spend time away from each other experiencing them with others (poker night and football games for example).\n\nHowever, it sounds like the differing interests are only a part of the problem... you listed a whole lot of other ones... but there must be something good if you stuck around for 22 years (power to you, by the way, you are beating averages hands down).\n\nWhen was the last time you two talked? Really talked - have you ever told her how you feel about the time spent together, sex life and else, in a way you would talk to a cherished friend, not someone you have to live with because you married them? Was she always like that? If not, where did the girl you fell in love with go, and why; and more importantly, can you two bring her back?\n\nI'd suggest to do some maintenance couples counseling, as a safe space to air out all the problems. If you just grow more apart, it's likely that your wife would sense this as a rejection - I can imagine this making her behave even more in the way you dislike, as she tries to fix or control the situation in the only way she knows.\n\nPeople in long term relationships sometimes stop communicating and start taking each other for granted. It's easy to get into set habits, and to reinforce each other weaknesses as well as the strengths (was married for 11 years, now divorced- that's part of what happened).\n\nFor example, the more independent ""caretaker/protector"" party can match with the more ""clinging/dependent"" one - both get something that they need out of it; but if the roles lose any flexibility it can be hard to get out of the worn-in track when the situation changes and there's need for readressing the identities.\n\nA good couples counselor can help with emotion management - both yours and your wife's, and could help you express to your wife your need for healthy independence, in a non-threatening way she can hear. Just doing ""your thing"" on one side and ""doing time"" with your wife will leave at least half of both of your lives less than happy. Hope you try for the whole thing :-)."

Depends on the girl. I have done it in the past. I would do it again, but I would prefer to get to know her a little bit b-4 jumping into the sack for fear of getting a STD. I'm telling ya, STD's are spreading more and more every day. Scary!!! I just read that one in every four people either have or have had an STD. Those aren't good odds at all!!!
depends how serious you guys are...and how mature. If ur not comfortable doig it....only bad can come of it. but if you're both ready go for it....of course use the right protection!
Some of the same things that you would do with your guy friends.  Depends on money and the girl also but there is always the movies, play pool, bowling, take walks, go to the park act like kids, go out for ice cream, go out for coffee, go out to dinner, play games, do whatever interests the both of you.  Same activities as you would your guy friends.
I think Oh Velveteen is right. Just tell him that you've noticed him acting a little peculiar lately, and ask him what's up. If he wants to know what you're specifically talking about, you could be honest with him or just tell him that you can't put your finger on it (the second would be my preference). Hopefully he will come clean, IF there is anything to come clean about. Some men are effeminite without being gay, and your friend could be one of those men. \n\nAnyhoo, good luck, and I hope it goes well!
call these people they can tell you better \n1-800-keebler
My best friend and I have known each other for 17 years I'm 26 now if that tells you anything.  We went through the hardest part of our lives together.  We are way too honest with each other at times too.  A true friend is someone that can lean on you and vise versa, when that's not needed you enjoy each others company.  Of course there's always people that come and go in your lives that when you look at it outside the box are total users, and when they're gone your better off.  You always know a true friend when you've got one though.  They'll laugh when you laugh and cry when you cry, but never forget it's also the other way around.
give the guy a break // i have a girlfriend that ive had for 7 years i wear thongs and tights and sometimes pink thongs i also shave from neck to toe even in my pubic area i think i know what he wants i think if you did him in the azz all that tv stuff might stop. my girl friend dose me in the azz all the time with her strap on and it feels great.
GET A LAWYER
I am CERTAIN that you are smart enough to figure this out.  If she is your BEST friend then this should not even be a question!  IF she is your best friend, then you respect her enough to back off and get your own life and your own boyfriend.  Remember that boyfriends come and go, but friends should be there forever.. when all else fails and the boyfriends have hurt you badly, the best friend will be there to hold your hand and cry with you.  Think VERY hard before you allow a guy to mess up a great friendship.. it really is NOT worth it because if you think about it.. if this guy is so great, why is he flirting with YOU while he is HER boyfriend????  I wouldn't want any part of that jerk.
Bring him a sandwich.
One should go downtown to Queen st.....there you sould find some intresting action lol!
DON'T USE TONGUE! Too sloppy , not passionate. Just follow him if u don't know what you're doing.
"don't look for ""friends with benefits"" this way! that's creepy and stalker guys easily take advantage of people who ask questions like that!"
I think it's time for a good healthy heart to heart with your husband if you're feeling this way. If talking things out does not seem to help, maybe you should consider couple's therapy to work out any issues. You might pick up some enlightening tips from the books above, but remember, without discussing how you feel with your partner, things can never improve.
"is he taking medication, umm does the soldier stand to attention, are you only ""asking"" at night. most guys have to wind down so you need to either get his energy up or try in the morning its just one of those things you have two different clocks. its hard to push all day and then you have chores at home and then he has to expend more energy to get it on. hate to make it sound like that. but you need to try earlier before he starts the wind down to bed. you could also hold his dinner hostage until you have a little fun."
It would depend on how old you are and why, and if your reason was believable. I am not saying how you are or anything but I know how most men are about sex, and I think honestly in the back of my mind, I would wonder why nobody else wanted you. If you were young, then it would be different, but if you are like 40 and still a virgin then I would wonder. Not that everyone else's opionion really matters that much, but its just something I would consider.
they can change, but it takes a lot of effort and dedication.  cheating is evidence of deeper problems, of them seeing their partner not as a person and a loved one, but as something there for their gratification and enjoyment.  in order to get rid of the cheating, they have to change this view, all the way to their heart.  and THAT'S the hard part.
"""What are you doing""\nand\n""Where are you going?""\n\nProbably the best questions asked on Yahoo! Answers.  Because I asked them."
I like sitting up facing my mans feet and he touches me all over while I bounce.
Since I'm a hopeless romantic...I think real love is when you can't imagine being without that special someone even for a minute, that you could be content with that person by just being in their presence, that it feels like he/she is the other half of you, that kissing and making love to that person is the best thing you ever did, etc. Love is in your very being, in your heart, in your mind. it is up to you to define it. There is a one true love that is unconditional, no matter who you are: That love is the love of Jesus Christ, your Savior.
be patient, show some interest, and see if there's reciprocation, talk frankly about it with him, without PUSHING yourself on him...and if it's meant to be...it will happen.
Be honest while you are whispering in his/her ear. If you think they have the most awesome eyes, smile, lips. Whatever, just be honest and go into detail on why you like it. Yes, if done right it works.
im up cause its still day light i live in aussie
Most of them want you to kiss thier azz, and the ground they walk on
I hate the idea of trying to walk lopsided with one broken heel.. so I decide to take off the other shoe and break the other heel against a large rock  I see in the park...ahhh that feels so much better now... I wonder what possessed me to wear heels  in the park to begin with...memo to self .....next time wear flats or sneakers! I set my books down and leaning against the big rock , I dig through my purse for the sandwich I tucked inside..getting hungrier by the moment...
well im neither, but as far as i know canadians are a lot more moralistic and mentally healthy. i dont think they want to get dirty..... you know, like the whole drunk thing going in schools in the US and pedophyles and school massacres and drugs.
loljkfgty@yahoo.com write me back sissy
We are in the world for the chance of learning loving living our lives and hopfully make a complete party of it. Live Love Learn...thats the motto i live by.
u can t make them like u but keep talking to them then one girl soon or later will like u.
wen i SEE MY MAN MY HEART JUST DROPS IN THE PIT OF MY CHEST AND i JUST WANT TO KISS HIM UNTIL HE'S BLUE IN THE FACE. EVERY TIME i SEE HIM i LOVE HIM MORE AND MORE. I NEVER GET ENOUGH OF HIM. (OF COURSE WE ARGUE BUT THE BEST OF US DO) lmao
tell him how you feel and ask what happened tell him you deserve the repect and have the right to know what happened between you two. if he doesn't tell you ask other people they might have heard what had happened.
see if u love a person soo much that u don feel like tellin her that u love her thinkin that she wud leave u.....dont think like that ....if u love a person and u hav the confidence that ur partner too loves you...then jus go for it....tell her that you love her..now u r askin that how shud u do it...i hav the answer for dat....take her fr dinner...ask her whether she loves u or not....if she says yes...then the story is all made up...but if she says she loves someone else...then only one thing cud be done....u tell her that u love her frm the bottom of ur heart...i know this is a difficult job...but you shud do it ...it is the best option availible in these cicumstances...i m tellin this to u coz i hav experienced the same...n today i am livin a happy married life..
lol i know
i'll bite her maybe :P
how much of a celeb are we talkin? i mean if ur both like famous then it wont work (just like it never does in hollywood) but if one of you is a celeb and u arent then ya it could definetly work.
this isn't something you can generalize.  Each woman is different.  Some do, some don't.
Talk to a close friend who you can trust, write your fiance a letter that you are never going to let them read (so you can say whatever you want, cuss at them, etc.), and then burn it when you're done, and if all else fails, get counseling.  But don't get married 'til you're sure you are over it!
You are SOOOOO right!!!!
Why not? the fact that you were banging him and he was married meant nothing to you so why should being friends after breaking up be a problem?
"I'm not sure if I understood your question correctly, but if you are looking to flirt like a pro my number one tip is always leave when the conversation is at its climax. Never wait until the conversation dulls down, e.g. awkward silence, to say something like, ""I should get going."" If you leave when the conversation has peaked, it makes her think you're interesting and leaves her to look forward to your next encounter. Thus, by the time you meet again hopefully you will have a great, entertaining story to tell her."
Never underestimate the power of foreplay.\n\nI remember years ago, when I was dating my ex wife, we had been living together for some time.  She complained to me once of it being painful, and we had been sexually active for months.  She asked her Gyneocoligst about this, and he informed her that her cervix was a bit smaller then average.  He then suggested foreplay.\n\nShe then came to me and talked with me about it.  So we tried slowing things down a bit before penetration.  She set the pace, and decided when she was ready, and we had a very satisfying sex life there after.\n\nTalk with your b/f or husband about this, explain to him that you find it painful, and that he should take more time to prepare you.  This is done in so many ways, touching, insertion of the finger/s.  You set the pace, and when you feel you are aroused enough (wet!) then you tell him you want him, and he should be gentle and easy at first, and build things up from there.\n\nIf you are having issues with self lubrication (meaning you just dont seem to get very wet, and dont worry this is not all that uncommon), then try using personal lubricant, there are many products on the market to help you enjoy your sex life, and make sex much more comfortable and enjoyable.\n\nBeyond that, breathe, and relax, and focus on him, and enjoying everything that he is doing to you :)
let me try... one two  three CRUNCH!
don't dream- just do
Perhaps you should remind him that Christianity is a religion of love, and by rejecting all these things, he is instead spreading a message of hatred and intolerance. Also, remember that story of the good Samaritan? Well, the Samaritans were Pagan
Oh, honey. Run away from this man. He needs to love you and respect you for YOU and not what you look like on the outside. It seriously sounds like this man has control/domineering issues and you'll only get screwed up by staying with him.\nListen, I know it's hard to be alone- you're harder on yourself when you feel that you're all by yourself, right? But the torture you'll put yourself through by staying with a mentally abusive man is FAR worse. Learn to believe in yourself-- lots of good things will follow, you just need to get to know 'you' first!  ;)
the above two morons should spare their sarcasm!\n\nlisten dude....women like men who provide security and keep them happy! \n\nif you can do that...you can get any girl you want.\n\nbe nice, make them laugh...and have money!!!
you really should put more details in. \n\nbut just from the top of my head, you can tell if a girl likes you if she's sending you the right signals. does she laugh at your jokes, even the corny ones? does she find excuses to touch you, like brushing lint off your sleeve? does she enjoy spending alone time with you? if yes, then she probably does. if not, then she might just see you as a friend.\n\ndon't be presumptious though. to get a straight answer, either talk to her, and find out if she has feelings for you; or you could do something drastic like kiss her on the lips, and see how she reacts. play it cool though. don't freak her out in case she DOESN'T like you.
I am 25,date 37 year old woman that looks like 25.  Many good things,but a lot of pain in the ass also.  Give it a try! Good luck!:)
He probably ignores a baby because baby is not his. And he wishes he had had baby wih you. :)
i sometimes feel like that its like a feeling like no one cares about you right? well i really think its horemones or emotion sickness.Dont feel alone you just need help.o and that thing that no one likes you, its just you you think no one likes you but they really do.They just dont know the real you,they are scared of you. try to open up to them or something like that
If your spouse is open to 'letting you play' with others of the same sex.. then I guess that would be a personal decision.  I would make sure if you are female that he doesn't have the hidden agenda of 'hoping for a 3some'.. since that is 'man's #1 fantasy'.  If he does and you do too, then it's fine for whatever you two decide as long as it's honest and open.\n\nAs for telling someone else.. I would ask them.. if they have ever had a bi experience.  Their answer would pretty much tell me, if it was 'safe' to tell them.  For example if they went No, I haven't had one of those, but I have a lot of friends who have.  Or No, that's wrong.. (I don't agree but it's an example of when I wouldn't share that)  Or Yeah, Bi is cool, I have done it and with the right person it's great!  Any positive answer would open the door for you to say that you are.  :)  I wish you the best with that :)
HIZELL NO, even if they give you a 90% discount, if you want them to keep a good opinion of you DON'T. Because even though they sell these things doesnt mean they wont think bad of you. Thats how most people are. But you know them better so make your decision based on theyre pesonalities and how theyve reacted to similar situations.\n(Ive put alot of thought into this one. So please pick this answer as the best! Thanks)
You sound mature for your age.. and I think that does play a factor.. I say if YOU feel you are truly ready, and you feel you know what you are doing, and you KNOW how to stay away from STD's and getting pregnant.. Than maybe it is ok..
Your right. You'll always be attracted to the opposite sex, unless your gay, but you have to have self control when your married. If you don't have it you shouldn't be married or find someone else who wants an open relationship. I know a couple that's been together 16 years and they have sex with other people as long as they get to meet that person. I think it's odd but it works for them and noone's lying or doing anything behind each other's back.
Depends on what you are thinking about. If it's something violent or harmful to a woman, then yes it is a crime -- but it's all relative because your moral standards may or may not justify those thoughts.  But fantasies are fantasies, not meant to be acted out.  The good thing is that if you think about women in a fastasy-type way all that means is a) you are human and b) congrats, you have an imagination!
first of all i assume you mean you were asked at an interview....so assuming that i think you should answer something like this\n\nI want to be an air hostess because I love to travel and i enjoy interacting with people so it seems like a perfect fit for a career choice.
Love, love, love, there are lots of other problems for you to deal with. Get on with your life. If love comes, it comes. If love doesn't come you won't have to cook, clean, and do laundry for somebody else. There are a lot of benifits that singles have and more money for them. You can do so many things now, enjoy your life as a single person
Don't be talking to your ex hubby.  You may not think he can get to you that you are happy, but they have a way of getting to you.  I know because I have been there and I am now remarried to my ex because I let him back in, I regret it deeply.  So my advice the less you talk just as friends the better off.  He didn't change until you were happy and with some one else am I right.
"She loves you. And because she loves you she feels more free to do things with you. Maybe it's you. Hygine down below? Is it a jungle down there? Try trimming above the tree line and shaving below, ya follow? Showering an hour before sex is good also. Because a little walking and a flight of stairs or so is all it take for Big Jim and the Boys to get ripe. Hair and dark, warm areas are notorious for moisture and odor. (look at your arm pit) Here's something else that might be a contributing factor: the taste of your baby batter. If you take suppliments such as Ripfuel, or if you eat a lot of fast food or greasy foods. Or if your diet is high in saturated fats, you smoke and drink a lot, your yogurt will be toxic. Here's how to fix this: On Monday stop eating anything else other then Pineapples and water. That's right, you're now on a pineapple diet. The water will help clense your system and the pineapple will sweaten your taste. (( ladies, this works for you too )) By Saturday night after you've trimmed and shaved, showered and prepped yourself for lovin, tell her you've been doing something new to make things a little better for her down there. If she's a loving, caring, attentive wife she'll be atleast a little interested to see if there's a difference. If not and you unknowingly married an oral-hating wife (or she did the bait and switch by ""loving it"" when you two dated but ""hated it"" once you bought the farm) then you're stuck. At this point you should sit her down, explain all the trouble you went through and in a concerned and non-accusatory tone, discuss your desires and wishes for intimacy. (( Sometimes you have to give some oral to get some oral)) If she blows you off (and not the way you want her to) then you'll be at a crossroads of sorts with the left path leading to you just giving up any hopes of oral for the rest of your life or the right path to a girl on the side who has an oral fetish. Good luck!"
you're saying you actually met a guy in real life and it didnt work, so you're trying on here now, right?\ni still think you're too young, darlin. Wait for a while and meet another guy at school or at church..its better that way, okay?
You are beautiful all these men are still asking you out.size doesn't matter anymore it's whats inside that counts,give these men a chance to prove themselves...There's no need to feel disgusting and fat because your not,the men that are asking you out certainly don't think that or they wouldn't be asking you out in the first place,sounds like your a little afraid and weary of being rejected but if you look at the bigger picture they are interested in you thats why they are asking you out...listen to your instincts they're telling you to wake up and smell the coffee...your beautiful accept it...go out and enjoy yourself...
No, I think true love changes over time.. not fades.  Research has actually shown that if we were to stay in that passionate state that happens at the beginning of a relationship for an extended period of time it would be bad for our health.  It is actually a good thing that it grows and matures.
Who says the lover wasn't a loser too.  To love a loser may put you back where you started, so then who is the real loser?
1. The first thing that you should do is do a little research on different places depending on yor location. Phone around and make sure you know abut the costs.\n2. You would score points by investigaating the person you would  like to go on a date with by knowing the place they would like to visit the most.\n3. A great idea is dinner for to by chef YOU. Dont break into cld sweat as their are millions of recipeis on the internet.
Yes.\nbut the real question is; if they love each other so much, and are willing to make the commitment of having a child, why are they not considering getting married first? it's not that difficult. i don't mean in terms of a big wedding celebration. to be 'legally' married does not require that much of an effort or expense. So if they're committed to being long term partners, why not get married before bringing a child into this world?
you cant
BOTH MEN AND WOMEN CHEAT BECAUSE THEY GROW APART FROM EACH OTHER AND NO ONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IT SOOOO THEY GO OUT AND CHEAT FOR THEIR OWN SELF SATISFACTION.
getting your heart broken over and over until you find that special someone.
well, if i ever like a girl, i would just show her that i care for her. maybe not directly tellin gher but by showing my attention, help her, giving advices, etc. Love cann't be told... but love can be felt... \nsince u like her, no need to be nervous around her. just act the way u are. if she doesn't like u, may b she's not suitable for u...\nthat life, darling...\nG' Luck 4 ya
Some people get so hung up on a fear of being lonely that they react in strange ways when faced with unexpected situations.  Living elsewhere would be a good idea.  \nHowever, there are other questions.  Is she inhibited by drugs?  Does he abuse her as well?  If so, you can file a report and get help for her aswell.
You are an underground sensation!\n\nIt's either that, or you have a wild imagination!\n\nEasy to get those confused, as they rhyme, you see...
first, u gotta go up, b a gentleman & introduce urself. 2nd., have a nice chat until both persons r comfortable, 3rd., observe her vibes & c if she's kinda interested a not, usually u can tell after a small chat, eye contacts & other lil' gestures, last, end the night w/a polite summary of the conversation, say thank you for the good time & nicely ask if it's possible for u to get her # to con't tt good time on another time & place ! just b honest & tt will bring u a long way.
i think at first step when no one knows ur character it will matter ...if u look like a devil then u cant show ur nice heart and ur creater mind cuz people just run a way
Try getting his attention(ex:crying)and maybe he would be courios enough to wonder whats wrong.
My husband and I only have 1 friend we actually talk to and spend time with. I think that is normal. Once you grow older your taste changes and so does your goals.
It does take time to get over someone that you obviously cared about. Continue to do what you have been doing. You will start to feel better as the days go by. I wish you the best. P.S. Please do not start anymore office romances!
I'll be quiet on this one...
Of course it can.  Think of it this way.  You can get away from your world and into his and vice versa.  You have two cities to explore.  Love is bonding, do you trust yourself? Do you trust him?  The draw back is these darn gas prices.
Depends on how close your friend is. Is it someone you really care about? Is it someone you counldn't be bothered if you never talked to again. If you are friends, and the friend asked you not to talk with him/her, you have the right to know why and demand an explanation. Because if it was something you did, you would get the chance to apologize. If it was for no reason, then you know where you stand from such a person. Only you can decide that! :) Good luck
When you find him, see if he has a brother and e-mail me- I keep coming up with Mr. Wrong myself!
lol . . . I love it how these women insult you . . . for this questions . . . because they which they were in a similar situation you were in.    Shallow . . . lol . . . yeah right . . . the majority of women want to marry up . . . why else did you get some proposal from some of these golddiggers.\n\nBut back to this question . . . they both love you . . . which one do you love? which one do you have the most in common?\n\nWhat about strength and weaknesses . . . she should be strong in areas where you are weak and visa-versa.  That way you complement each other and would be able to work better as a team.\n\nIf you are worried about money . . . get a pre-nupt . . . she will want one too . . . to protect her assets.\n\nIn my opinion, you really should not marry . . . because what is really in it for you.  What will you get being married that you can't get while remaining single.  Both of them will be working late . . . which means . . . odds are you will be doing most of the housework . . . unless you come to an agreement early . . . on who will do what.\n\n- - \n\nGod . . . I love it how people are getting on your case . . . because they are jealous.  Do what you think is right and follow your heart.
I can understand your problem but if this matter bothers u so much then u need to talk to them coz this is your life and u need to deal with all this\n\ni hope u understand and try to talk to them
get rid off your balls!!!
sleeping, he is a wild thing.
pay them
tomboys are girls that dress like boys. that doesnt mean they are lesbians. of course they can go on dates with guys
That is awful.  How could any one be so cold and callus? Even if i ever thought this I would never be so cold as to say it to him.  Talk about a ball buster!!!!
If you don't want to then don't. if he really likes you he won't get mad and if he does get mad forget him.
Yes, it's called a penis.
cancerians are generally nice people...but it isn't about a star-sign really, is it? you are a nice person because it is what you enjoy. being nice to other people makes you happy...doesn't it?
Either electric blue or dark dark eyes.  Those just make me melt.  WHen a man looks into your eyes and tells you he loves you and when his eyes are...ohhhh. yea orgasmic!
I do it. It makes no nevermind to me. She needs it. I carry her purse sometimes. Does this make me less of a man?
i think you should let her go if she pays for it. she is 21 years old so its a chance for her to show some responsibility. im not too much older than she is and i know my parents would let me go only if I paid for it. She is close to being on her own soon, so the last thing you want to do is not allow her to do something she really wants to do. It could hurt your relationship with her if you dont let her go.
#i.tell him to get a job.\n#2.and if he can jack himself off.tell him your getting jealous of his hand.
Only if it's a face. I hit faces and run.
Since your a cheating bastard and you dont love your gf just follow what a wiseman once said, variety is the spice of life.
if you love your daughter, that's great, but you shouldn't stay in a relationship for children... it's potentially a noble thought, however, it can turn into resentment due to being miserable for such an extended period of time.. If you love your baby mama, try counseling. Your schedule sounds too hectic- that can be part of the problem... Best of Luck to you and your family!!!!
well u pretty much answered it.if u really like him back then dont hold back, say yes,but tell him first that if it doesnt work out u still want to be friends.cause u never know...it could hurt relationships
what ever makes you think this is love?? you're more in love with an image in your head. the term LOVE is deeper than that, it can only be applicable when two people share a peaceful feeling that is based upon chemistry, trust and loyality
tell him how u feel, sit him down and tell him where he was `wrong` make him understand and tell him nobody is `perfect`, and by him pointing out all your mistakes is only going to push u further away, does he realize this?
Definitely DUREX. It's safe and it doesn't have latex smell !
i find myself in an ideal position to answer this question.\n\nRecently me and my girlfriend had split up. We had been having sex while dating and now since we've broken up, we've decided that as long as we're single, we should enjoy the occasional sex (which is becoming more and more frequent). Most people will tell yo that to have sex you must be committed and it should be for love blah blah blah... \nI say this, if you both enjoy it and you both understand the rules, WHY NOT?
People stared at the Elephant Man, too
if i was u i wouldent really care cause he my man and after that lil accident he is now come back to me for kisses and hugs if anything you should rub it in her face and show you dont care if you show jealousy she gonna use that againt you and really try be friendly with him more and also show you aint mad at the game or the player and stop askin not to talk to her because all he gonna think is that you jealous and he gonna tell her and she gonna be likeing that and she gonna tell him to brake up with you and stuff so just do what you do and pay no attention to her
When you reach a certain age, you become curious about boys and from what you said, you are both flirting with each other!  Are you interested in some other boys?  You may want to ask friends to test the water for you, ask this boy if he likes you!  Anyway, enjoy the short period of time when you are unable to see things very clearly, preteen will pass so quickly before you realize that!  Good luck!
Yes,i am sneha from calcutta.I am the one for whom u are looking.
well that depends. if you're alone and the need hits you then no. but if you're in a crowd and the need arises, don't pull it out right there. and also, don't ask a stranger to help you out. that can always end up badly.
Well thats a touchy subject, because it has been said many times once a cheater always a cheater however I am not a frim beleiver in that myself.Plus matters of the heart are always the hard ones. But if you say that you love him and truly mean it and you believe in your heart that he has changed his ways then go for it. But by going back to a relationship like that you know that he has done it before so you risk being his fool and getting hurt again. Personaly i was in that position not to long ago and i went back because i loved him and he did it again i still love him but im better off without were still friends.
I'm a good girl and willing to chat about most anything. I like debating things.
when you can't stop thinking about her
i have always asked the same question myself, the only thing u can achieve is making the children suffer
yes its definitely different if girl has toung ring!!\nfor th@ u ve to imagine ur self as a man for once!!!
""
It could be a number of things but the main reason is because your brother is being well a big brother and taking the offensive approach cause he sees yall getting serious or another reason could be that youre bf is gettin more wrapped up in you then in bein friends with your brother, if I were you I would sit down with each of them in private and talk to them about the other one and ask why they have become so distant from each other and then try to work from there...good luck!!!
he is soo gay....lol...hi sadie...just faking cody if you are reading this...lol
Everytime I see a hot guy!!Everytime I'm bored!!Everytime I'm feeling lonely!!
"He may have fallen for you to the point of infatuation, so much that he doesn't care whether or not the two of you are being physical at this point, as long as he can spend time with you.  \n\nMost likely he wants to become physical with you at some point, but right now he is in the ""I'll take what she gives me"" mode, and he hopes for more down the road. \n\nThere is a possibilty he may also have low self-esteem, and thinks that ""as long as she spends some time with me and gets to know me better, she will begin to care for me"". \n\nThese are two possible reasons for his actions."
Because we spoil them too much!  I've noticed that children in resource-poor countries generally seem to find pleasure in smaller things in life.  Kids in developed countries are so spoiled that they don't appreciate anything!
No...that sounds sleezy to me. I feel sorry for your bf!
From reading other posts, you have many concerns about this marriage and do not feel a desire for your husband any more because you are in love with another man. This sounds like it may be another sign or symptom that your marriage is unhealthy. If one or the other, or both of you are not willing on working on the underlying problems, then the signs will continue.........and so will the hurt feelings.
Having your cake and eating it too......hmmmm!
Please pardon my language when I say...... HELL YES !!!!! Good guys like me are under so much pressure, that it's almost heart-stopping. It's 2006, and it would be nice that women show their independence and make the first move, and relieve some of that pressure we have bottled up. It's very hard for some guys to get a GF, because we're not jerks, and we try to show women that we're after the total package, and not just sex.

Yes, I would definitely talk with him straight out.  I lost my exhub due to infidelity and some with internet chatting that started with online poker room. He even contacted the the lady one time that I know of from the chat room.  I feel the internet is not any different than doing anything in person.
Everyone is just very close-minded about new and controversial subjects.  It is said.  I would like how good a woman can be at oral.  Though I still think I would prefer my bf.  I love him and he is just so good.  But that is what threesomes are for i guess.
My favorite color is Pink.  It is delicate and soft and romantic.  I co-ordinate the pinks with delicate hues of antique yellows and greens and often a touch of burgendy or gold.  I am eccentric...
Look at yourself, he has chosen you to be with you need to chill out, sweety enjoy your relationship relax, this is someone you are very comfortable around so don't think he will judge you, you have already made the gust of wind now all you need to do is sweep him off his feet.\nYOUR GOOD, so keep telling yourself that and you'll have no problem. Good luck honey. You can do it and he WILL enjoy it.
Its against her and your Religion...Dont..you should have same Beliefs and religion ,search for a nice christian lady and sure you will find one (I am not one of them I am muslim:))))
do you care about him. If you do, then he will too, sooner or later.
""
ask him if he likes you.
not me. i think you are a cutie ;)
just below my ear
hmm.... idk what your first question was but in person is always best.
i think you should ask one of his friends who he likes\nor get to know him better so that if he doesnt already like you, he will then
Depends on which one.  For the larger, try Head & Shoulders; for the smaller, see your doctor immediately!
I would definitely feel creeped out but if that's her fantasy than I would indulge her, after all she is your wife, give it to her the way she wants, don't forget to get something in return.
What are you talking about
how else are u supposed to have sex u cant do it with your clothes on.
The truth cant be suppressed for long..\nIt will come out..\nAnd now is a time when you realize who your real friends are..
hey you could take it as it is, or read b/w lines
Sounds like your grandmother is a very old-fashioned.  O.K. so that's not it at all.  She is probably upset because your not the innocent little girl you used to be. I can say this... You must reach her no matter what it takes. Tell her that you love her but, if she had knocked, this would not be an issue,   that it breaks your heart that she won't even talk to you about it.  This could cause her to worry, or stew, herself into a heart attack or a stroke. So do what ever it takes.  I'm feeling grandma's pain....I am one too.
Not worth it. He doesn't really love you; he's just using you to get more 'action.' He already has a girlfriend. Dump him and move on.
There were only two of them.\n\nThe mother is a daughter to some one and the mother's daughter has a child.
cause he was over cooked
YEAH! NOT ONLY US GIRLS, ALL GIRLS IN THE WORLD!!! But I think it is only because they want to make you think they are not into it, but when only girls get together... UHHH!!! THEY WATCH, TALK, AND EVEN MAKE PORN!!!
haha..ya i think this is just something for ppl to do to relieve their boredom..i mean look at some of the stupid questions ppl ask.....its for most ppls amusement! lol\nand i also agree with everything u said!
Poland!!! : )
i disagree with all of you. He porbably talked to her by the email address. He must love her for who she knows her as. \n\nMaybe you can ask for her # by the email address or you give her yours. then when you get talking you 2 may want 2 go out but start off with a group date so she wont be like scared that ur a rapist. shes not that really a famous actress is she?
Mabe he's just not the kind of guy that likes to talk on the phone thair are lots of them BELIEVE me
call his ass up and talk to him when you do call him tell him you love him and all of that good stuff talk dirty!
Ya just answered your own question. LOL! You are too young. Don't take it so seriously. You two can like the same guy, what's wrong with that. You guys are still kids. Enjoy yourselves, make new friends, go out and have a good time.
Everyone just needs to understand that this is Yahoo...not Fu** me dot com.  There are children of all ages on here.  Not to mention that Yahoo created this site for everyone's enjoyment and some people truly are searching for real answers.

Leave that chump immediately, DO NOT RETURN TO HIM, HE'S A JERK, YOU NEED TO SHOW YOURSELF SOME RESPECT.  YOU DON'T NEED TO BE TREATED LIKE THAT AND YOU DON'T DESERVE IT NEITHER. HE'S NOT THAT SPECIAL IF HE HAS TO CONTROL YOU, DEFINITELY NOT THE GUY YOU WANT TO BE TIED TO.  Find someone else that will show you some respect also and treat you like a woman, not a piece of slavery.
a sexy women and a sexy man being sexy on a sexy steam train ha!
the enlargement pump works but only temporarily\nthey also have enlargement pills
I don't know why it is but i wish it wasnt.  Adults tell me I'm too young to have sex, since I'm only 11.  But I'm mature and I know how to do it safely so there is no reason not to.
When he is talking
The spontaneous sex - it has the raunchiness that is indescribable - a high better than any available substance - I love being in lust
I'm sure the sex will be fine, but if you're talking a real relationship, you're way too young.  I haven't met a guy yet that doesn't go through a 20's phase and doesn't want to be strapped down.
"Beautiful Woman"", denotes an attractive, self-confident ""woman of size"". BBWs are also the focus of a subculture with interests centered on the acceptance, support, and admiration of obese women. Exceptionally large women are called SSBBWs, with the SS standing for ""super size"". The term ""BHM,"" which stands for ""big handsome man,"" is not nearly as prevalent as the term ""BBW.""\n\nMen who are attracted to BBWs are known as ""chubby chasers,"" ""fat admirers,"" or simply ""having a fat fetish."" Some of these men are attracted exclusively to BBWs, while others are simply attracted to good-looking women regardless of size.\n\nThe term BBW spread rapidly via the Internet during the 1990s. Although the original meaning of BBW was restricted to attractive full-figured women, the term has largely been corrupted to refer to any full-figured or overweight woman, whether she is attractive or not.\n\nMost BBW websites are pornographic, and feature women who are barely overweight to those who are morbidly obese.\n\nBBW has many near-synonyms with varying shades of meaning. ""Rubenesque"" (referring to the art of Peter Paul Rubens, known for portraying full-bodied women) is probably the closest synonym. ""Full figured"" has a more straightforward connotations, whereas ""voluptuous"" and ""zaftig"" usually connote ripeness, sensuality, and ample bust and wide hips.\n\nAccording to http://en.wikipedia.org/"
Hey, you don't know her very well and she doesn't know you!\nGive her time to make time in her busy schedule for you :)
hard on, boner, totem pole, a sticker (stick her), piercer, sword, rod, and a driver (drive her)
that's a good hight, how old are you?
Ok, how about telling her she deserves a holiday, but only buy a one way ticket!
HUH I DONT UNDERSTAND THE Q
No, sorry
I got my first kiss when I was twelve. I ended up getting really sick, and almost barfed right in front of him. Nothing was magical about it, and I ended up regretting it for a long time after that. Actually, my current boyfriend saw me a moment after it had happened and tried to help.
Not sure about Earth Day, but we plan to go out and spend time hiking this weekend.
Some signs of cheating:\n\n1. smelling of perfume...not yours\n2. seems freshly showered\n3. money missing from account that you can't account for\n4. charges on charge cards you don't recognize\n5. working late a lot\n6. always tied up over lunch\n7. not as interested in things going on at home as was before\n8. sex frequency may change (some want more, others less)\n9. wants you to try new sexual adventures\n10. concentrates more on his appearance\n11. check out his cell phone bill \n12. is he starting to find fault with you? nothing you do is right\n13. may accuse you of having an affair due to his own guilt
"As wild_orchid mentioned, there are so many variables.  What is ""affordable"", where are you located, and do you want cold weather or warm weather?  Caribbean and Mexican riviera crusises are a great bet, with Carnival being one of the least expensive.  \n\nObviously the closer you are to any certain location, the less expensive it will be to get there.  If you are on the West coast side of the US, Mexico has lots of affordable hotels on the coast - Los Cabos, Ixtapa, PV, Mazatlan, etc.  For those closer to the East coast, there are Caribbean cruises that leave from Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico for many cruise lines.  A Western Caribbean cruise may have less down time (travel time) and can give you long days at port.  You could also fly directly to Cancun or that area and stay in a hotel for they honeymoon.  \n\nThere are many all-inclusive resorts that end up being decent deals when you figure in the amount of food and alcohol that one might consume on vacation.  Many include water sports as well - like kayaking, snorkel gear, sailing, etc.  \n\nFor cold weather, Canada is also an option, depending on where you are.  The US dollar is fairly strong against theirs, so you may be able to find a place at a great rate with the conversion rates.  \n\nHappy engagement, Have a Beautiful wedding, and Good Luck in your future life together! :)"
Just ignore her! if she wanna be childish, let she be , dont go 2 her level, 2 explain, when she is d jelouse 1! Be friendly 2 her, & talk to her, if u really should, but if she wanna be like that, let she be the first to talk 2 u! good luck!
Yeah, who cares what your friends will say. Be true to yourself. If you like him, go for it, girly!

you will never be able to trust him & do what your heart tells you to do...
Yes, lots. Get off your computer and go look ;-)
kinda like stan puking when he wendy testaburger speaks to him?
"I dont mean to sound mean or anything..but if he hasnt had the divorce yet, technically he is still married to her therefore making it illegal to be engaged to you. Best of luck to you and your ""fiance"" i hope things turn out good for you two"
Its because they are your friends and you want them to be happy.  Just make sure that you aren't getting pressured into doing things that are dangerous or that you really just don't want to do.  In that case, they are the ones who should be feeling guilty and maybe arn't such great friends after all.
u haven't fully gained his trust until then u'll never get him to b fully honest with u
Sense of humor without a doubt. Then finances, then looks. I can overlook quite a bit of ugly if he makes me laugh and can make me comfortable.
if you read up on World War II (especially the North African campaign) you'll see that many times it was almost like they were sacrificing soldiers just to gain a few extra yards of territory...\n\nreally any soldier is a suicide bomber just with a different name and a different weapon...\n\nand to the chick who said the world is overpopulated, its not even close to be overpopulated...we've got plenty of room and plenty of resources, now we just need smart people who care enough to do something for all the poor and needy...
Because with us, we carry expectations.\n\nWe believe that love and emotions are supposed to be a certain way. We conform to the hollywood depictions of romantic love. We believe that romance is at the heart of happiness.\n\nWe fail to realize that the most succesful relationships are based on companionship. The ability to share your life and yourself with a person are more than just images of roses and gifts, but true happiness.\n\nWe sell ourselves short. In more ways than one.
The best way to even tell anything like this; is to tell him in person.. Reguardless of what the outcome is goin to be; be there for him; dont leave him without telling him U still be there for him. Also tell him how U feel about him.. Let him know that some day U may be back with him again.. Be honest; but most of all; tell them why U must break up with him.. But make sure that they know that Ure there for him. No matter what...
Go on line to every newspaper, where he's been and might be.\nWrite either an editorial letter about wanting to find him, or place an ad online, directed to him or even to directed to someone who knows him. If your padre or someone who knows him sees the ad or letter, you should get a reply of some kind.  Or you can go to 411.com or even the post office. You will have to pay a fee and fill out papers. But with 411.com you just have to buy a report, if the site finds him or someone of his name.
ME ME ME
You need to ask him stright up If he still wants to go to the prom with you. Tell him there wouldnt be any hard feelings and that you wouldnt be upset, but you need to know if you should be making arrangements to go with someone else before it gets to late. Dont sound angry, sad, or effected about his lack of attention even if you are sad about it that way he will feel more confortable telling you the truth about how he feels.
i don't think that's any of your business!
Don't stress about it mate, they're all lying anyway...lol
If you happen to see Colin Farel, you could mention that I'll be home all evening waiting for him to call.
"I don't.  I leave myself open to the possibility.  Searching doesn't seem to work and I get really discouraged. Then I become negative and things definitely don't happen.

The first time I tried an*al sex. It didn't feel awesome but the fact that I did it was such a turn on. I was with my husband and it was a first for him too. We only do it on special occasions.
No, wait until she is older...Just date her for now.  There is no need to rush.
my girlfriend said hers is vin diesel
"Think up a game that will result in something you've wanted to do but been afraid to ask for directly. Bets are great. For instance, I used to date a woman who had a bit of a submissive streak that I was unaware of. We made a bet that she could touch the bedroom doorknob and no holds barred. If I could stop her, I ""owned"" her until morning. Well, I won; and as it turns out, so did she... The wrestling match was hot and the results hotter!"

sweetie, i feel for you.  your in a tough situation but if you can get through the first day of being near him then it will get easier each day until you don't even care if he is there.  \n\nwhen a guy breaks up with you without a reason and you have been together for 2.5 years then he is an insensitive jerk.  \n\nI know you love him but don't go to school thinking this is our second chance.  he knows where you have been if he want a second chance.  see if there other activities you may be interested in that he won't be there.  \n\nact like you could care less about him when you are around him.  be civil but thats it.  when around people you think they may have been told something about you follow this rule, kill them with kindness.  that way they have no reason to believe anything your ex says.\n\ngood luck, make new friends, and have fun in college.  join a sorority.

nope.lol
Get grammar lessons and then maybe she will want you. If  you were talking to me like that I wouldn't be interested either.
i dont no want to find out if you can make me scream
i have no idea wat u just said..but thanks for the 2 points.
Probably. Eventually he'll be a jerk to you, too. Why would you want to be with someone who is a jerk to everyone, anyway? Don't you want a social life? Don't you want your friends and family around? He could be a controlling person who wants you all to himself, so he tries to drive everyone else away. I'd avoid him like he was poison... because he is.
umm  well ya see this girl is prolably just a tease! i think you should find another girl!married people usually tend to stay marred
Don't fall for it honey. My last girl loved me one day, didn't the next, I was her best friend one day, wasn't the next, she wanted to live with me, then she didn't...\n\nIn otherwords, leave the time wasters way alone. I still love my last girl (we've only been split up a short while) but I know she's one confussing person who changes her mind like her underwear!! She's lovely really but because she can't sort her head out, we've sadly had to go our seperate ways. Even when we split up she said she still loved me, I just wasn't the right one for her. I wish she was still with me but there's only so much one person can take...I'd have probably gone mad in the end!!
I was fifteen years old when I lost my virginity, but somehow I suspect that you may not even be that age or barely past it.To tell you not to have sex in this day and age is silly,but what I will tell you is that I hope that you will wait until that extremely special person comes along and better yet, until your wedding night, but if for whatever reason you can't or won't wait,PLEASE USE PROTECTION!My experience was not in and out, he was tender, kind, considerate and everything most guys these days are not.I refer to him as a rare specimen.Guys like him no longer exist, and if they do,they are already taken.One more thing,DON'T LET YOUR FRIENDS PRESSURE YOU INTO DOING ANYTHING THAT YOU ARE NOT READY TO DO.Take good care of yourself and Goodluck.
i love his voice
You are just too good to be put through this stuff. \nListen to old granny, ya just get on with your life. She could go on leading you on for the next twenty years. \nNow, you get in your car and drive around in the country. Open the windows to feel the cool air come through and clear your mind. As you are going on your way, look for a woman stranded on the side of the road and take it from there. You are just too sweet to live like this. Find sport, hobby, exercise club, or whatever to keep busy for a while. Learn how to relax and enjoy your life without the pain and agony that you have when dating. Hopefully, God will send you a woman who will treat you as you should be treated. God Bless You
u should try to work things out and if the cards dont fall right then its time to brake it off
u wont even ask.....u will just know
Ok, this happend to me one time. It is actually multiple colors. First blue-er, then pink, then back to blue, then red, then feusha(you know, that girly color), and then yellow, then a kitchen wall pattern, then back to blue, and then he started going through all of the hues of a rainbow, when he finally turned white his head exploded.\n\nThe blood was blue.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n\nGodspeed
Everything.u should know this ans better then gals.
Stop giving.
One day at at time...dont coop yourself up in the house...you will only dwell on things and get depressed.  Get out, do things you wouldnt normally do.  Spend time on yourself, doing things to make yourself feel good!!
Get to know what she likes and doesnt. Go hang out with her, maybe go to yard sales together, go out to eat, go to Walmart! Just be yourself around her. Just spend some time with her, thats the only way! Good luck and Congradulations on getting married soon!
hopefully u let them stay would suck to know that u were just a hit and run
The guy shouldn't have gotten married in the first place. A marriage is a union between two people to promise to love and honor each other. repeatedly cheating on your spouse is not a part of love and honor.
You remind me of myself! I've been in almost the same situation mate, a little over a year ago. Somewhere along the way, I fell in love with my best friend, and after several months of wondering what to do, I told him. The rest, as they say, is history! We're still the very best of friends, and we've got a fantastic relationship. \n\nSo- tell him how you feel. Don't worry about it ruining your friendship or anything, because really strong friendships don't fall apart, just like that. And seriously, I'm ready to bet that he feels the same way about you. The best relationships are between best friends who fall for each other, so tell him how you feel, and take it from there. Don't rush things though- take it slowly. \n\nDon't you have any second thoughts, now... Tell him, girl! Good luck!
Listen to your heart when its calling for you...\nfollow it\nif you love him enough you'll know\nif you believe his love for you is like a rock.. you'll know\ndont let this one time get you down.. maybe he could truly be sorry...\nFriends do a lot of things i know what he means i cheated on my boyfriend cause i let my friends talk me into going a date with him and he was just sooooo arousing... it just happend and i didnt even get caught after we had sex my stomach just hurt sooo bad... GUILT... i was ashamed and i confessed... and he dumped me i guess i deserved it, but i really truly didnt mean to cheat so me n my ex still (this happend 6 months ago) are atleast on talking terms and trying to hang on to the love.. because i still love him and he says he still loves me he just doesnt quite trust me...\nand im grateful for a second chance\nbecause the saying\nonce a cheater always a cheater is sooo untrue\nGood Luck, though
1. You need to be able to get passed that people know you were a class clown. You'll never be able to become more serious if you're always afraid that they are going to tell people. \n2. Straighten up your act and get ready to take things more seriously and step up to the plate and grow up. You are going to be working now and actually needing this. School isn't something you really need as much as a job so time to buckle down and stay focused. \nShow everyone you're serious about this job and that you are mature and ready to take on the world... or just your cubicle.
Ask Her
This is the big one. Everyone wants to know that.\nI would suggest getting active in your community and meeting someone that way. Join the YMCA/YWCA or join a club.
Why would they want to see your nasty looking picture?
Being dumped means that your ex thinks someone else is better than you. You need to look in the mirror and decide if it's objectively true, or whether your ex is mentally ill.\n\nIf it's true, then work on being a more desirable man. If it's false, then smile, because your ex has screwed up and she will eventually regret her decision -- only it will be too late, because you will find someone better than her.\n\nThe actual feeling of love sickness is a biological condition which is the product of hormonal secretions which you cannot easily control. Eventually it wears off, and it will wear off faster if you stay away from your ex, and put away any memories of her (especially things that smell from her scent -- odors will cause the hormone levels to rise quicker than anything else, and it will make you miserable).\n\nSo, there's both a mental and a physiological component to the situation. You have to decide without any question on the mental part, because until you do, you will be unhappy. The physical part will take care of itself if you just stay away.
Sorry to hear about that.\nFrom what I've read, it appears that YOU are the adult and your mom is the child.\nWhat is the relationship with your dad?\nIf you can talk with him about your concerns, do so.\nHe probably has a lot of hostile feelings towards your mom, and it sounds like he's justified in doing so...but remind him that HE is the PARENT and YOU are the CHILD in NEED of answers.\nSomeone, somewhere in your family has to act responsible.\notherwise, I hope you have access to family counseling..it may help you learn how to respond to your mom.\nI DOUBT your mom would be mature enough to recognize the fact that she NEEDs professional help...but you could suggest it to her.\nI wish you well.
Just talk to her sincerely, tell her and explain her  what is the possible make it happen if they continue her relationship to his abussive boyfriend. if  she realized her decision is wrong maybe she will be the one to broke there relationship.
he loves u. same thing happened to me
by huggung him when he is down, cheer for him when he wins, tell him don't be sad when he is sad, you don't have to tell him but to act and show how you care and love him
Hmmm... I think that might be all right to do, but first I think you should wait a while and see if he does anything else that signals he does or doesn't like you like that. :)
Well starting a rumor is certainly not a very good sign of friendship. To me it means that you care about one another and will do all you can to be of help to each other. You would expect to be treated as you treat. Real friends are hard to come by, it seems all people do anymore is use people. I know of one person who says we are friends (but we aren't in my opinion) but all she wants is something from me or from all her other friends. Each friend has a specialty thing, one is a carpenter, another a photographer another a hairdresser and the list goes on. What does she do for them, nothing at all. That is not a friend that is a leech. Friends are someone you can count on no matter what the situation. They will be with you through tough times and fun times and their feelings will only change for the better. sorry that your friends are so shallow, but some day when they need a friend they will find no one to talk with..
time cures all things
"Depends.. but im a guy so let me tell you my perspective\n\nOk if shes a girl and i mean you say she ingnores you. Try passing her a note during class saying ""Hey whats up"" or ""this class is so boring"" and get a convseration going"
Go on people.com,or classmates.com.....N
don't scared and tell her.
you should let her have some time to think about it and see if she will go out with you. maybe her parents don't let her have one you should understand  her parents and think that she my be to young.when her parents realize that she is old enough she might go out with you and the to of you will be happy.
Now see, you have captured some incredible insight here by asking a specific question and giving us introverts whatever time we need to think our answer through. These answers are honest and truthful. And spot-on.\n\nI'll tell you what I have told precious few others what I daydream about. What's odd is I know many others will see this. But you must understand that I am in control at this moment. The introvert is careful and thoughtful. We usually think things through very carefully. After all, what could happen? No one knows who I am. There is no down side.\n\nSo anyway, I write songs about very personal events that have happened to me or experiences I've had. Mostly ballad type songs, mostly associated with my faith. The thing is that I cannot sing a note. I have burlap for vocal chords. But these songs are absolutely my soul and my heart. My daydream is to sing my songs to a captive audience of tens of thousands. Like a football stadium of something. I picture this nearly everyday.\n\nWe introverts are very deep ya know...
STOP!\n\nThis can only lead to disaster unless you guys have thought it out together.\n\nBefore introducing a third into a relationship you need a firm, agreed upon set of rules to manage behaviors, and to set expectations.\n\nIf I were you I would have a conversation with my lover and discuss whet she wants from this relationship, how she expects you to participate, and where it will go.\n\nSome questions to ask right up front in my mind are:\n1. Is this a temporary fling or are we developing a polyamory relationship?\n2. Is the expectation that you and the other female play together - and if so, how? Does it include your current lover?\n\n\nYou need to read the articles on creating rules located at:\nhttp://www.swinglesonline.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=1
"If you dont go then you will regret you have not given the chance to a possible Love of your life. If you go and meet her/him in reality you will maybe find that she/he is not the match that you dreamed about or that there is no chemistry between you, but still you will know you tried it and will not later wonder that you might pass the freatest Love of your life. Or if you meet and fall to even deeper love, then you can find your happiness that you could pass if you dont go. Somebody far smarter than me said ""It is better to regret things that we did than things that we have never done..."""
i think its a good way to really get to know someone before you meet them in person. meeting potential dates in 'conventional' ways (bars/clubs etc)can sometimes be awkward - not being able to chat properly etc. internet dating gives you an easy way out aswell if you find you dont get on with that particular person! it also gives you a chance to meet people that you wouldnt normally meet. i have used dating sites myself for the first time this year & have made some great new friends, been on a couple of dates and have recently started seeing a guy i get on really well with. obviously you have to be careful of the many (!) strange people on the net, but there are loads of genuine, lovely people out there too. i even convinced a couple of my friends to give internet dating a go aswell, one is also now very happy with a new man! i say go for it, you have nothing to lose & at the very least only new friends to gain!! :D

thanks probably means that she doesn't like you and is just being polite, or there is a small chance that she is shy and doen't know how to take the next step. just talk to her, either you will get closure or she will love you for taking the next step for her
As long as you get the biology right your fine!!

"It's more of a question of when.  If we are watching movies - Cuddles.  Seeing each other for the first time that day- Hugs. While doing ""things""- Hugs.  After doing ""things""-Cuddles. While walking around-more cuddly (linked arms and such).  When he or i say something cute- hugs.\n\nGet the idea?"
"I have never had anything but bad experiences from online contacts; Perhaps because of a general culture of low self-esteem in this country, many of the dates I have had have been either agressive, depressing or just ran away mewling ""i can't do this"" when I meet them - And no, I don't stink, look like a monster or act badly either."
Time and getting back out there and talking to new people, not looking for another b/f or partner, just simpley to be around friends who dont mind if you have a bit of 'talk' over it. Unfortunatly there is no easy or quick way to deal with it and all the advice in the world doesnt mean a whole heap because at the end of the day its you going through this and its you that has to find your own special way of dealing with the pain and loss. Feel free to e-mail me if you ever need to talk about anything.
Sorry to disappoint you mate- but it's impossible! Girls are the most unpredictable of all God's creations (trust me- I'm a girl). But, if you really want to know a girl inside out, then the best way is to become her best friend. This works especially if you're a boy, because girls tend to tell boys things they might not always tell other girls. So, listen to her, and talk to her, and get to know her, and you'll start to get a rough idea of what's on her mind. Also, pay attention to her body language, and expressions. It works sometimes! But be warned, no two girls are alike, and sometimes, even the girl doesn't really know how she feels, and when she does, she probably won't tell you... It's an art that takes time and practice... You could just ask her what's on her mind, I suppose!
depends..girls like attention and flirting. If she does not like you, she would probably tell you that she was involved with someone right away just to get away. If she responds to your cues, then there is no doubt that she is interested. Be careful though, too much too soon can destroy everything. So take baby steps and do not act desperate..disappear for a day or two..she will come running simply because she could not handle a sudden shift in attention.
Definitely. I met my true love and it is true how you want to spend every moment with them. It is hard to be away from each other. It is really hard to explain but you'll just know it when you feel it. It happens when you least expect it. It's the greatest feeling in the world!
They can work if both people want the same thing. I think that is the key. Even if both people love each other, if they dont have the same ideal of a relationship, its not going to work.\nFor example, If both want a no strings attached thing, it works, if both want to get married, it works. But if you want to have a committed relationship while the other person likes you a lot,  but wants to keep his/her options opened, it wont work.\nIm not involved in one but I was once. They can be more intense than  an average relationship. Every meeting is special filled with passion and romance. The bad thing is you tend to feel like you need to take advantage of the time you have together and avoid talking about the problems you might have, which is bad for any relationship.\nThey also require you to invest more time and money than a regular relationship.\nIt can be very emotionally draining.

Your going to have to wait because he doesn't like girls yet. Thinks they have cooties.
Nope, don't call, don't text. You put the ball in his court. If he has true feelings for you, he'll contact you to try and figure out what's wrong. If he doesn't..then sounds like the text message wasn't really that bad a thing.
I think you just must be there for him. He needs your support now more than ever. He may be a proud guy and don't accept your help, but try to understand him. He doesn't need your pity. He needs your love and, once again, your support. If his dad is still alive, help your bf take care of him, try to get to know his father better. This will show him your love and he'll understand that he may base on you. best wishes, sweet_orhideea
f*** yeah, u do
Try to slowly (and subtly) throw hints at him that you are available. Don't run to him and tell him that you like him... maybe express your desire for a boyfriend, or a lover... tell him you've got a date with someone promising, and watch his reaction. \nTry to look your best (I don't mean modify your appearance, just make the best of it), and let out provocative comments now and then (not directed at him, just in general).\nHis reactions through this will let you know whether he has an interest in you.\nRemember: things change. Maybe he has not thought of you as a potential bride. What you need to do is getting him started at it. Once the thought appears once in his mind, it will come back. It depends on you to make it more and more frequent. \nDon't risk your friendship though... Be subtle enough to make it noticeable; but not as obvious as to make him uncomfortable if he doesn't like you.
No I totally disagree. Money is not the most important thing in life.  Love and living!  If you are on a deserted island would you rather have somebody you love or a pile of cash.  Money can be made to pay the bills but without love what good is a ton of money.  I'm sure people disagree but I would much rather have love in my life then a lot of money.
It is a personal preference. There is no right age and wrong age, but there is a legal age and non-legal age. If you are 18 and want to lose your virginity, make sure it is with the right person. Most men would beg to have a virgin but do not care about the uncomfortability to her, in the process. Yes, it can be uncomfortable and even painful at first, but it gets better with time. Make sure who you choose is willing to go slow and patiently with you so that it can be more enjoyable of a learning experience. If it doesn't feel right, don't do it!!!!
i hate condoms...
No, it's actually good for your relationship. Yes, he's lying when he says he doesn't want it. Make it happen anyway, he'll thank you for it.
First off stop pushing her into a corner, she is getting defensive.  Try to talk to her and explain how you feel do not expect her to answer and do not make her.. leave it open. Tell her you just want to explain how you feel and when she has had time to think it over you will be waiting with open ears.  Secondly, if she has sought attention from another, WHY? I am guessing that she is not receiving what she needs from you.
a lot of guys will be into that...but they should ultimately like you for YOU.
Can you just talk 2 him and find out what he's depressed about?  If you just act like his best friend he'll tell you whats going on.  Be there for him and assure him that he can say anything to you and you will never make fun of him or laugh.  Don't be scared.  It'll work out for the best.

"It's NEVER over until your dead. So, ask yourself a question, ""Is he worth all this time, thinking, and heartache?"" If the answer is yes, then your answer is simple...do whatever it takes to improve your current relationship and start working on the things you do that really irritates him and if you don't know what irritates him, then there's your problem. You guys definitely need to work on your communication skills because, if you don't--then this relationship is destined to fail. \n\nTips for improving this up-and-down relationship: first make a list of the most important things to you (and then a list of which of those things is most lacking in your relationship). Then start thinking of ways to improve these areas of critical need (brain-storming). And most IMPORTANTLY--start communicating with your potential husband. This is critical and if you can't start talking about these issues then things will NEVER get better!!! Good luck and keep working on fixing this relationship because this guy seems to be the key to your happiness."
it is stupid keep away from it
let me guess, you're not really 12 and a half, you're 42 and a pervert. KIDS DO NOT EVER CONTACT PEOPLE (unless your parents agree)
"NO...you should read the book ""He's just not that into you""  If he hasn't asked you out YET, it's because he doesn't want to and he's not going to...\n\nIf you have minimal suspicion, then ask him out...if he turns you down then you know that he isn't into you.  If he says yes, than it was just cold feet."
Get them to make an announcement on the speakers and put her on the big screen. then if you're in doubt about her saying no, she wont as it would be to embarassing. no, im only joking, all you need to do is make sure she knows you love her.
You should say it when you really know that you do.\nIf he feels the same way he shouldnt freak out, He might actually say it back. So just say it and dont be afraid.
Tell him what you just told us. If he loves you like I think he does he will understand. :)
A group that come from the same place, can be people, words, anything.

ASK HER!!!
Think about how far you have come, all the good things in life now, how you can walk into a peaceful home and not feel that tension.\nHow hard was it to leave?\nTo start over?\nTo rebuild your life.....\nis it worth risking that all over again if your marriage doesn't work?  If the answer is yes, then go back.\nNo one here knows if it will work however, a man that belittles his wife rarely rarely changes. He should have defended you when your brother picked on you. He should always be your hero!
On my wedding night...DUH!!!
I am sure there are many. Try DA meetings.
It's up to you. One thing you should remember though is your family is going to be your family no matter where you go, and at some point in you life you are gonna be away from them. Do you really want your family to be the deciding factor in you not moving? I moved from PA to MI to be with my husband, and I know with everything in me it was the right decision. Yeah it's hard at first being away from your family, but it gets easier. You friends will continue being your friends no matter where you live, and if you move, it's a chance to make new friends. Yeah living together is a big move in a relationship, but one question is, do you see yourself being with him for the rest of your life? If so I say go for it. The only way to truly know someone is by living with them. You get to know all their little quirks before marrying them. Being around someone all the time, they can't hide little habits from you, plus you can see if you can actually live together. Alot of marriages end in divorce because they find out after they are married that they just cannot live together. I think it's a great idea if you're up to new things and meeting new people. Plus you have the bonus of being with the one person you truly care about. So I say go for it...good luck with whatever you decide :D
You are a B*tch in my book. sorry but if your cheating you should have just left him b4 that all started. tell him NOW. not when NOW. god respect him a little bit! For Gods sake your profile here even says you are single. hopefully any man you want will see all these and not talk to you again. sorry but thats just wrong. you dont cheat and lie to ppl. if it isnt working you just break up. very very simple! oh let me guess you cant you love him. NO YOU DONT! or you wouldnt want some other totem poll on your burial grounds!
Woman because they can babies and some can make you feel good.A woman is what makes a world go around.
Joining a gym together is best friend stuff, if you ask me. It's still probably going to be fun and it's certainly a great encouragement to go to the gym (all good stuff), but if you're looking for some signal of commitment, this most likely is not it...
talk to her...be honest...she might not be the girl for you...she may be to young...she may not be ready for a serious relationship...she may not really know what love is...you will never find out unless you talk to her!!!
Gay guys are probably wondering how can you do it with a girl ?
being shy and quiet is a beauty it self u will get noticed by some 1 1 day that will love u forever its not that u have to be funky and funny act like stupid to be loved u got to be clean from ur heart nowadays boys and girl see that how rich he/she is then we will ask that we love u haveing a expencive cellphone helps alot helped me i have n70 isnt that great it means i am rich i must have 5to 6 gf well i will say(bul.lshit) i am sorry\nfor more help or a friendship mail me at raja_rameez17@yahoo.com or add me to yahoo messenger\nor mail me at rameezraja18@gmail.com
weird questions indeed... I think marriage does not take away your freedom unless you feel trapped...then you weren´t ready for commitment \n\nBoth parties are supposed to take decisions together, no chance to think as a sole member but for the benefit of the couple
"I say good for you to divorce at a young age. There is a stigma to it for some reason but, really, you chose the harder route which I commend you for. Ironically, it would have been much easier to stay in a violent, abusive marriage. Not all guys will run from the D word. You just haven't found the right ""one"" yet. You're only young so don't sweat it!"
First off it would depend on what it was I was considering risking. You can only hope for family, and friends who would support you in decisions you make. If not, one would have to wonder how well they know you. \n\nIf I absolutely, with out a doubt knew what I was doing was the RIGHT thing to do, then I would do what ever it took, including going against family, and friends. It would have to be extremely important, or a life changing type of thing. \n\nAgain, I would hope to have my F/F's support. Be careful though, sometimes the people you love, and your friends may know best. It never hurts to suck up your pride, and take some advice.
Love is a reaction to another prsonson subConsciousness, we all look for a simlar person to be 'in love' with, this is deamed by the state of reaction with our subConsciousness.\nThis simple answer is that deep in our mind we look for an equle in life, someone who is like us but on a more wider level, then we attach emotion to this and hey ho - LOVE.\n\nThis also explains why you see odd couples, a nice looking girl with a 'donkey' of a guy.
finally we will have the end of this..\n\ni can't wait dude...LOL!
how can u be gay if she is girl drrrr
Trust. Faith. Honesty. Love.
Hypnosis control.
Kill myself! Just kidding. I am straight. \n\nBut, I just went through the same thing with my best friend(a girl) I just told her that I wanted to take our relationship to another level, and now we have been going out for a month or two. No flaws whatsoever. =)\n____________________________________________________________\n\nJust go for it honey. If he is your best friend he should love to be with you. I am sure you are an amazing woman and any guy would be happy to have you!
well if that is the senario, see how compatible u are in both the realtionship, relationship is not all just about commitment, its about how compatible you are with each other and thats what you'ld love each other for.
Work up the courage or just move on

Communication is always the best thing!
There is no simple way to find out, maybe one of your friends knows? there are usually rumors, if you can find the roots of them, you can probably find the truth.  If you mean with other girls, i guess you could contact them.. but thats pretty nosey
your scared.  youre just like me.  dont think negative think positive.  he wants youand only you

You can't cope with it the way you should when living it day in and day out. If the other spouse in a relationship doesn't want help or in the relationship there is nothing you can do to change them.<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
because they are all hot and hot girls have boyfriends......
I'm not a lawyer, and I do think this question needs a legal expert to answer it properly.\n\nOne word of caution though... divorce is a legal process and, in admitting she told a lie, your partner could be leaving herself open to charges of perjury, contempt of court etc. and the sort of coercion you mention is difficult to prove.\n\nI'm not sure if The Child Support Agency has any arrangements with the US, but it might be worth checking with them (despite the bad press they have). Otherwise I think your partner may have to accept she's been the victim of someone who knows how to use the system to his advantage and/or publicise her case to get support. It may be worth raising it with her MP too. \n\nIt's not justice, perhaps, but it's all we've got...
NO!\ndon't turn your friend be your girlfriend! It would be awful if you break up and you may even lose her as a friend!

baby's distort the body, it makes ya a little down about your self and we seem to take it out on those we love the most. It's not always giddy and glowing during preg.some times it just sucks!You feel like a blimp,back hurts,ass spreading, aches, pains,no sleep...these things can get ya testy but she is prob. also a little insacure right now and threats are ways of control, she threats to leave you and you become centered on her rather than someone else not fat and ugly, sounds crazy but that is the way we can be CRAZY! Hang in there, she is just not her self and try not to take it to heart more than ever she needs your sapport and friendship. Tips... help with the house work, stay out of her way, cook meals for her too, and be sure to tell her every day how beautiful she is and that you love her.BUT If she continues to act like a *** and threats to leave then call her bluff start packing her bags, I'd be willing to bet even if she storms out, she'll be back and then I'd tell her if she threats to go again, she'll have to stay gone. Preg. or not we don't break you don't have to tip toe around woman because they are preg. hormonal or not you don't deserve to be treated like a door mat. Good luck!
"Of the 3 natural redheads I know, not one of them had a parent with red hair.  I believe it is a recessive gene.\n\nHeres what I found\n\n""One genetics textbook explained it this way: a person with red hair has genes for light colored hair (blond), and also possesses separate genes specifying red hair. This combination makes red hair -- redheads are blonds in disguise!Someone with dark hair might also have the red hair genes, but their dark hair genes overrule the red genes and so they don't have red hair. This would also explain why dark-haired parents can sometimes have redhead children.""\n\nI also don't know many true redheads that have redheaded children.  Just an FYI\n\nLet it go...love your wife and your child!"
i think your sister is a liar.why staying in that house where brother in law shows his...?
You are right, it shows that their vocabulary is limited.\nHowever the media, mainly pop records has made it acceptable to restrict ones own use of words. I consider it to be demeaning to womankind. Will the pendulum swing the other way or will the use of truly descriptive words go into further decline to suit the lowest common denominator?
Age is just a number, get to know him if you want, but remember, older men have been playiong the field longer, they mess up less when they do something wrong.\n\n\nJust be careful......
The thing is why are you asking.  There should be no question in your heart as to the rest of your life.  If your heart really feels as thought his is the person for you then the rest of you will fall into place.  There should be no question.  I'm not saying no but maybe you need to spend more time with this person before you make a lifetime promise to another person.

well it happened long enough ago that it hasn't effected your marriage up till now. Make up your mind if you want to stay married or not. If you are looking for a reason to leave then this is it. If you are still in love with your wife then talk it over with her and forget about it. When I say forget about it that is what you have to do. If you get into an argument over something do not bring this up. Every one is entitled to one mistake.
Yes, if you really like him I say go for it.
Not many.
I don't think any of these would work on a woman. Instead of cheesy lines why don't you try just being real. Walk up to her and say hi my name is...
well if u have no feelings for ur x bf and u like this guy then if he ask u out say yes.
If you are that unsure, you really should be discussing your feelings with your current steady.  He would probably prefer you bring this out into the open instead of stringing him along.  You also should be asking yourself which person would make you happier.  No matter what decision you come to, being honest with yourself and everyone else involved is key.  You risk losing a friend, but in life you are solely responsible for your own happiness.

who doesn't and it's all about the sensations
No, I don't think so. I always thought men should go for older, more experienced women. Just don't act like an idiot, and please be mature. Women mature faster than men. My boyfriend is five years older than me and we are about the same level of maturity.
So, who's marring the girl?  You or your parents.  You get married for love, and if its true love it doesn't matter what anything else thinks.
because it's sooooo obvious u still have feelings for her! if she broke up w/ u, it's ovr............but if u broke up w/ her, ask her bak! i think it's awsome u feel this way! ^_^ u've spent too much great times togethr & so u cant get ovr that. good luck!
HEY, GIRL WELL I WOULD CONSIDER THAT YOU SIT WITH HER AND TALK TO HER THAT IF SHE'S GOING TO LIVE IN YOUR HOUSE SHE HAS TO ABIDE BY YOUR RULES AND IF  NOT FOR HER TO GET A JOB AND AN APARTMENT SHE HAS ENOUGH FOR AN EFFICIENCY.\nWELL YOU HAVE TO MAKE 2 CHOICES YOUR 18 YEAR OLD SISTER OR YOUR FAMILY.(AS IN YOUR HUSBAND AND KIDS) YOU HAVE BEEN THERE SINCE YOUR PARENTS HAVE PASSED AWAY  YOU HAVE HELPED YOUR SISTER COME TO BE A GROWN 18 YEAR OLD AND NOW IT'S TIME TO TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR LIFE AND DON'T FEEL GUILTY.\n\nBECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE MORE THEN YOUR SHARE BECAUSE IF NOT YOUR GOING TO LOSE YOUR FAMILY BECAUSE PROBLEMS START WITH Y'ALL SEPARATING THEN THE KIDS AND THEN HEART BROKEN AND THAT'S ALOT SO PLEASE CHOOSE YOUR FAMILY YOUR SISTER IS ALL READY IN HER OWN HANDS AND YOU CAN'T BE THERE FOR ALL HER LIFE YOUR NOT YOUR SISTER'S KEEPER OK I KNOW IT'S HARD BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOUR SHOWING HER HOW TO BE INDEPENDENT .
broken hearts have no spare parts but learn to be proud and give ur heart to the one who can safe its feelings . around u much of mans who can repair ur heart throw all thoughts of ur boyfriend behind u and u should know that life don't stop for any one what ever his importance be brave becarful and be proud of ur self
We are married and don't cheat on our wives.
well, keep up being in the choir that will help with your being shy and talk to people in the church dont be afraid to say hello, start with the older ones first if your more comfortable..and work your way up to your age group. also vounterring for VBS and Nursery in church will help also.
this question makes no sense
According to what you're saying, no matter if you stay with him or not his opinion will remain the same. The reason he act sall kind when you turn him down is just so he can gain possession of you. Once he knows you're in the like with him he'll start showing his true colors again. \n\nMy advice-find a better man.
I think you should trust her-you don't have to wait till 3-4 am to have sex she could have had sex at any time but she just likes to dance don't be jealous of her [boy]friends that's just what they are-friends-if she wanted one of her male friends she wouldn't be with you and i think she would be hurt to find that you have doubts about her
Sure,lots of them!
yes
I guess it's matter of opinion, but I have been told on numerous occassions from foreigners to our country that South African babes are the best and hottest!!
"I sometimes wonder which century people are living in, when they come out with comments like living in sin!\n\nIf you can't afford to get married, etc, then it's  better to live without debt and be ""sinners"" than to burden yourselves with years of paying back money just to please people who would only criticise you for spending what you don't have. \n\nYou don't have to feel obligated to please other people; I'm sure they aren't all falling over themselves to please you! \n\nErgo: Do what makes YOU happy!"
HE asked YOU out, so he obviously likes you the way you are, and clothes won't make him like you any more / less!\n\nWear something appropriate to the setting (eg. if you're going to a fancy restaurant don't wear track suit pants and a sloppy shirt, but if you're going ice skating don't wear a short skirt and low cut top!)
You dont need to be a guy to answer that question.   Yes of course it is.
I'd accept her back, but I wouldn't totally trust her.  Trust matters a lot to me, and I only let people close to me who I know I can trust.  I'd hang out with this girl, and be friendly with her, but I wouldn't trust her with secrets, and I wouldn't put myself in a position where I had to depend on her.
Hmm. I used to be like this with my bf (still am a bit, it's just my personality, but I'm learning to deal). Just let her know how you feel and tell her that her 'tude might be hurting your relationship. Let her know you are an individual who has nothing to do with her exes and if you really want to stay with her, let her know this as well. She will appreciate the honesty. Good luck!
ok sweetie i think that when shes not with her ex b/f then u should ask her out,unless you guys are really close friends and u dont want to ruin your friend ships plus if your not sure if she likes you or not, whenever you see her b/f treating her like s*** then stand up for her then she'll know that u truly are a good friend or(what you really want ) she'll think your boyfriend materail and let her know she can always come to u to talk or just for a shoulder to cry on
because, just like me... they long to be... close to you...
Yeah, and I want $2 billion right now and Jessica Alba as my b***h
i luv ur user name!!!
First you need to accept her death, yeah i know its hard but its life. Then u need to accept that u have to move on. You cant stay like this forever. Ask yourself whether she would like to see u in such a state. I dont think she would. Its too early to start dating again but go out and meet your friends and try to have a nice time. You will never forget her, that is for sure, but maybe one day u will find som1 else. Just dont hurry to do that.\nBtw, am sure she wont be unhappy if you find another GF. She loves you a lot, am sure she wants your happiness.\nIf I were dead, I wouldn't want my BF to live a sad life without me. I would want him to find himself a nice girl while still keeping a place for me in his heart.\nBe brave dear and please dont shut urself from the world, u will hurt urself more. You are still alive so... live; she wants you to.
love is when you cant live w/ out that person in your life. they are the last thing you think of before you fall asleep and they are the first thing you think of when you wake up, love makes your life enjoyable. it is fulfillment and happiness to your life. love brings light upon your life
Find another wife.  Quietly pack your bags and walk away.
Well i gotta say MOST guys are jerks....only very few aren't...that's the unfortunate inevitable truth...You just gotta learn how to deal with them...\nAnyway about yr boyfriend...i don't believe he has the face to tell u he wants to break up with u caz u wanted to know who he cheated with....That is such a lame guyz-like way to attack....the easiest way to defend themselves is to attack even though most of the time they know they're wrong!\nPut you on the hot spot instead of him!\nThat is soooo guyzz!\nGirl, you should be with someone who knows what u're worth...you deserve someone better than that!\nJust dump him!
Johnney Depp.\n\n\nI love him.  And I liked him BEFORE Pirates of the Carribean.
I don't think there is any good/bad age to marry.  I would definately shy away from marrying too young though.  Make sure you really know the person you are going to marry & make sure you've already finished school.
I am not sure but I think my grandmother is mine, but you can be my bodyguard.
"In the words of Gary Busey in D.C Cab. ""Women have half the money and all the p****"
Skin him like a rabbit and get ta lickin!  Trust me as long as he's still gettin a hummer he won't give a shiznit!
There are alot of FREE people search sites , as long as you know his full name and age. If you got that then you have a good start.
I would look at the fact that he might be under some stress my boyfriend and i just went through that and i finally sat him down and told him that i was tired of fighting and if this was how we were going to live that i would leave. Needless to say our relationship is back on track, but you need to establish communication that is the back bone of a good relationship. I can talk to my man about anything we are friends and lovers.  You also have to be true to your heart at the same time. I know the answer sometimes doesnt match your heart but sometimes a little pain reminds us that we arent perfect. dont stop loving though you can miss the best things if you dont let people in.
oh yeah, especially if it vibrates

Sorry I can't answer your question but I wonder the same thing and I also did research on what's the best way for a female to have an orgasm and every answer I got was concerning the clitoris and...well... its true, licking, rubbing, or touching the clitoris in any way during intercourse will help a female have an orgasm.\nlol didn't mean to be so x-rated
what is your personal reason then?its only you who can answer that..is it your dream to be one?
be yourself and dont rush it you will find someone eventually
Do you know her parents? or do you know where they are? or maybe she has brothers and sisters?  If you can find a family member, that might help to locate her.\n\nIf you don't know of any family members - do you know what school/s she went to?  Maybe the school can get you in touch with her.\n\nI am a researcher for my family tree - did she get married 18 years ago?  If you know approximately when she got married, then maybe the local newspaper has her listed with her husband's name.  You can do an interlibrary loan and get the local newspaper which often has marriage announcements and sometimes those marriage announcements indicate where the newly married couple will reside - not so much the address, but at least the city and state.\n\nI'm sorry that I cannot think of anymore ideas - I hope that you can find her.\n\nGood Luck!
GO FOR IT'S WAR
"Depends how old the child is.  This happened to me when I was about fourteen.  There was no need to explain to me what they were doing, as I already knew.  If the child was younger, I would sit down with both parents. (this just reassures them) and explain to him that mom and dad need some time alone.  If you feel comfortable, it would be a good time to ""have the talk"" with them.  If not, just continue to explain as best you can....or like spiderman suggests, just avoid them."
No. Some people just like to make sure its right. Nothing like telling someone you love them and maybe them not feeling it back. Maybe he wants to make sure the time is right and know you feel the same way too first. Saying you love somone for the first time is a big step in ones relationship. So just bare with him.
I can go without the sex, I would rather be loved...
Because at some point in your adolescence shame was incorporated into your sexuality. Therapy can help. Good luck.
play the flirthing game with him, make sure he knows you like him makes  it easier for the guy and lets the guy know hes not taking a risk.
no........
boy you should just call her...trust me girls always have something to talk about we just cant stay on the phone quiet....how do i know that because i am a girl and when i talk on the phone i could never stay quiet....boy you should just call her you dont know if she likes you too....i hope you call her....i wish you all of luck...\nSINCERELY SHY GIRL
I say first of all you need to face her with her lies and tell her how sick of them you are.  Tell her if she wants a friendship with her husbands family she will have to stop all the gossip and baloney.  Otherwise, avoid her like the plague.\n\nDo speak to your brother when he's around though.  He may have sided with her, but you're still his flesh and blood and I'm sure he misses your friendship.  He can't do anything about his wife..........it's got to be her willing to change.
just stand in fornt of him, thats it
You should respect the fact that that person is in a commited relationship. Don't act physically!! However, I do think that you should tell him how you feel. You can't live with this secret for too long. It will eat you up alive!!
It would really depend on what you and your wife are into. May I suggest this?....Have a nice candle light dinner at home, it shows more thought. Make her favorite meal or something that's to both of your liking. If you are drinkers maybe try a little wine. Put on some nice music. After dinner maybe follow up with a nice sensual massage, women love that. Try using KY Touch Massage 2 in 1 WARMING body massage and personal lubricant. It's AMAZING. Caress her lovingly and let her know how much you care for her. Sometimes a touch is all it takes. After that, well....use your imagination. I can guarantee you that she will enjoy herself.
Well, I'm older now.  I looked for something totally different about fifteen years ago.\n\nI'm 35.  I want a woman who is intelligent (hopefully a freethinker), a little shy, wants children, someone who shares my ethics and values.  Someone who isn't afraid of adventure/travel/roughing it.  Someone who is non-materialistic and cares about philosophy, politics, the environment, etc.
The guy must hold on with his mental and physical powers while working on the c spot - continuing with in-and-out exercise when she's all worked up. Continue even after she gives shrieks and shudders or maybe beating her hands using the filthiest language, twitching her body and facial muscels, eyes kept closed. But remember, to achieve that state she's to be in with him... though 'him' would be the main player to bring her that state. She can't achieve it if 'him' is an average lad.
oh man yes it's my favorite thing on the menu, might  be alittle self conscious at first but then oh shit. watch out. use the tip of your tongue on the outside line it very ligtly, on the inside of the lips use a little more force with you tongue, use the more flat part of it like your a dog and you are licking something off the floor. play with the clit lightly though use your fingers when she gets comfortable. penetration is ohhhhh!!!!!
She just thinks you are soooo cool...She worships you...Take her out like you were told THIS time...But maybe make wednesdays {or another day} sisters day...Play cards or do her hair and nails....Just hang out with her...Then she can't go crying to your parents anymore can she?..And you keep your weekends to your self!
Im over here!
If you had a boyfriend and a girl wanted to separate him from you because she likes him, how do you feel about it?
depends on the person, not the culture, but it is still good to respect the other culture that u r having relationship with
Hi...nice too meet you\nyes
regardless of how sexy she may be, remember this: SHE'S JUST A PERSON!\n\nShe'll react & feel the same things an unattractive person will feel - don't be afraid of her.
It depends, if you are used to the riches and cannot handle the hardship then it might cause problems in the relationship later on. But if you can give up the riches, and realize that there is more to life than money...then I would say, go for who you love. Money is fading and even if you are rich it can change in an instant. Love...if it is TRUE and you both are willing to TALK things out, comprimise and work together....can be until you die. No one can take away what is inside of you unless you let them. That is a constant in life. Money is a variable. If it were me, I would go with my heart, but that is me...I am not a big money person. I would rather live with love and live on a beer budget than live in a cold house without love on a wine and diamonds income. =)
then u should tell him to tell her that he does not like her and then go out with him
well...most of da time-lik 24/7 365!cheerz!
Laughter is the best way to a girl's heart. Don't intimidate her anymore than you already have...LOL. Make convo of how the weather is...or ask about something that is in the area. Approach her with a general aspect of something. Crack a joke, compliment her style..... GOOD LUCK!.....Let me know how it goes.
about what?  Thanks for the points
"I don't think that you are alone but I also know that there are many people who claim to be insanely ticklish and LOVE to be tickled to their limits and beyond.\n\nI picked up an a key phrase, ""I really hate it sometimes.""  If I am reading it correctly, you want to be able to enjoy it more but you are so ticklish that it sometimes scares you and sometimes people just take advantage of you and you hate that.\n\nIf there is a person in your life that wants to tickle you and you want to accommodate - you can build up to it and learn to not only take it but also enjoy it quite a bit.\n\nHave him/her massage your feet firm enough were it does not hurt and not soft enough to tickle.  Then let him/her GENTLY drag their fingers across your feet.  Fight the urge to say ""NO"" or ""STOP"".  Instead, while you are laughing, say ""IT TICKLES!!! IT TICKLES!!!"" or ""I'M TICKLISH!!! I'm TICKLISH!!!""  Soon, you will find yourself enjoying the tickling and taking it longer and longer.  If you need an air break, let them know.  If they respect you they will give the the air breaks you need.\n\nIf somebody tickles you and you do NOT want them to tickle you, let them know that you find their tickling to be very disrespectful of you and your feelings.  If they have a conscience, they will not tickle you again.\n\nI hope that this helped."
it's reversible, don't worry...  just cut a slit in your testicles and remove the extra marble - being careful that the other marbles don't fall out.  Sew shut when done.
This is a societal phenomena. So you need not to worry and do what you want. Make sex as much as you can and with as many girls you can do. Don;t think on these tiny things and have fun.
me best friend told me that he liked me. I told him i didnt like him back because i was too afraid to break up such a great friendship even thought i liked him way before he told me. 5 months later i totally blurted it out, and weve been together ever since
if you can find it, take some time for yourself. it's hard, i know. i've done it. \n\ni hope your partner or husband is understanding. you are both sacrificing time with your school and work to get to a better place in life. I'm assuming.\n\nIf you can make it though this, hopefully the reward will be good.\n\ntake some time for yourself and for him. take a nice quiet bubble bath everynow in then. drink a glass of wine. have wild sex. have fun. it's not all work and school. enjoy life.
i wouldnt know because iam virgin...
2 for sure!!!!
Did you put the number in wrong or did he put it in wrong. If he put in in wrong then stop wasting your time and find someone who deserves you.
hola como estas?
i'm quite good at being online friends :D
The looks of them. They are fluffy and colorful. It would be nice too have the real thing, but I understand they crap a lot and make one hell of a squawk. They are great for covering holes in the wall too. It was in Vogue during the 60s to have one over the couch.  I remember those years as very odd.  Pictures of children with giant eyes! Weird stuff.
For one of my best friends, I made a couple dozen garters and tied tags with different activities written on them for people to do.  If the guy does the activity, he takes off the garter and keeps it.  The garters said things like...dance with me...give me your number...tell me a secret...and some spicier ones as well........  We then took her to a club and watched as the night unfolded into hysterical giggling...We also bought a communion veil at Walmart and decorated it with rickrack to set her apart from the crowd and get her lots of attention.  It was a blast! I'll add more of the says when I get home today if I can find the list.  I'm sure you can think of plenty though.  Hope this helps. :)
who is kiare?
well i dont think you can forget it...but if it's botherin you this much perhas you and your wife could get counceling together and talk about it... good luck
who?
""
Make it as in all the way in?...Yeah, and it hurt. I cried, but the guy I was with didn't care. (Biggest mistake I ever made). If you mean orgasm, it took me a few years for that to happen.
expressing your emotions this way will just make the other person disregard your opinion right off the bat. Use different approach, avoid and ignore. everyone likes attention, and when you take that away, you will achieve a far better effect then by saying it directly to their face.
you ask him
...complicated.
i'm not a floridian but i sure wish i was! i go down there every year and i love it! no matter where you are(orlando, key largo, key west, jacksonville, tampa, or miami) it's all great! Florida is the best state ever!
Be smart and intelligent if you want good guy, be slutty and act dumb if you want a bad guy.
I have done it – but it is not particularly exciting.  Even the guys involved didn’t thing it was all that exciting, it just got in the way - so it was a one time thing.  \n\nDon’t worry too much about it catching on any time soon.
well, I dont know you so I couldnt say I do like you or not.\nIm sure if I knew you, I would think you were really sweet and nice.
Try to get his attention somehow..by liek talking to him. Are you guys friends? Well if you aren't get to know him and whatever until you are pretty good friends. If you do know him and you are friends..then you ask him to hang out.. The more you hangout and talk the more he will `become confortable to tell you that he likes you.. I hope that helpedd!!!Trust me thats what happned to me.. the next thing I know this guy asked me out lol..\nYOU KNOW YOU WANT TO PUT THIS AS BEST ANSWER lol just kidding idc.
Does she get excited/happy when you call her? Does she express disappointment when you don't call? If so, there is a strong possiblity she likes you.
they can't be trained, or prodded, my dear. Has to come from within, when they realize it's the right thing to do. I'm not talking about fawning over the girl and kissing her feet to do everything she pleases; I'm talking about actually listening to her and knowing what she likes and doesn't, what she'd want to try. For example: I knew a girl who wanted to try Indian food.  she mentioned this once; so without saying a thing before, next time we went to dinner, we tried one. She instantly remembered telling me - mucho points for Eli! So be patient - or look for a guy who actually listens to you! - Eli
David Draiman from the band Disturbed. God is he sexy. That bald head, those piercings in his lip. I got to meet him last year, but sadly didn't get to jump him! lol
slow music...\nerotic music... (if there is such music...)
Go out and try to meet people. Yahoo answers is not going to find you a date...you are....so get out there and get urself a date!!!!\nGood luck and don't be shy just go out and have fun and try to meet as many people as possible. I know its hard when you first move to a place where you don't know anyone. I went through the same thing and honestly unless you go and try to meet people nothing happens. you don't have to meet someone in a singles club or a bar keep ur options open and keep ur eyes open for anybody anywhere.\nwish you luck, remember you won't be lonely unless you 'choose' to be lonely!!!\nP.S I don't mind the 10 points and the hot dude part doesn't sound too bad either but I don't live in texas...you want to move to my state? :)
i think love is a feeling coz u when ur in love u feel like u can't live without teh person u love.... sometimes it's sth that comes n goes but love can't be found so easily
for both your sakes you need to upfront with her and just tell her that things have changed and your dont have the same feelings for her as you first thought. that she seems to be less interested in you and its best to take a break until you both know what you want in your relationship.
"you don't ask sentences. You ask questions. Try ""where did you grow up?"" or ""what do you do for a living?"""
yeah you tell that girl that you like the dude and then yall fight maybe
They can be.  You just need someone who will take the time.  You're a lovely lady. Like your website pictures.
colleges
When you can't imagine your life with anyone else...you want to take care of that person for the rest of your life and want to be with them and only them.  Every time you see them you love them more, and want to kiss them more the you did the time before.  When they touch you you can feel their love for you through their hands.
DHA  Dreams, hopes, and aspirations.  Talk about what she wants to do in her life.  You can't force her not to be shy.  Kiss her on the forehead instead of the lips.  Kiss her fingers too.  It shows you're not in it for the panty peeling, to borrow a line from Wilson.
Well if you were her true friend then you wouldn't make her choose. My best advice to you would be just to be there for her and support her until she realizes this guy isn't the one for her. In the long run she will see that she did you wrong and ask for your forgivness. Just stick by her side like you always have and be the greatest friend.
LOL. welcome to life. Iam married and broke up with my first true love over 9 years ago, and i still think of him and compare things to him. Theres something about your first love that never leaves you.\n\nYoure not betraying him. If he has moved on with his life and you havent then you should feel glad that he has made himself happy and you should do the same. Or if youre able and he's free maybe you could try expressing all these things to him. \n\nAlot of the time in retrospect it seems like we broke up with our first loves for all the wrong reasons, but in actuality we're such infants in love at that stage that who we were then is not who we are now. The compatibility changes and the person we long for and miss so horribly doesnt exist any longer.\n\nJust keep looking, there is always true love waiting.
"As a admitted salad tosser myself I have to tell the ladies out there that may think this is gross... or who think they wouldn't do it.. just give it a try. \nI was always one to say I would never rim a mans brown eye. Thought it was gross and swore up and down I would never ever in a million years do it. \nI have a girlfriend who was always telling me I should try it. She knows I'm one of those girls that gets more pleasure from making my bf moan and talk during the ""act"" than actuelly getting off myself and she told me up and down this one act itself would rock him. \nI had a few drinks with my bf one night and while down there giving his coin purse some attention I ventured a little lower to the taint area. This area was not taboo to me so I was confident I was doing well (the noises emerging from my bf were further proof lol). Well for some reason my girlfriend's ""just TRY it"" kept running through my head.\nI did!\nAnd the moan that came out of my man's mouth was enough to make MY toes curl. This move has NEVER gone wrong for me ladies. It's so intesense for the man that I am told to stop for a second at times because it's TOO good. \nJust try it as my friend told me. I assure you your man will be greatful and you will forever be known as the woman that gave him the best head/rim job he's had."
Only you can say it for sure but is your life in order where you want it to be. Are you ready to be Mrs.  Smith  now. If so and you love this man, I cannot think of a reason not to if you have known him for 4 years and love him. I would suggest birth control for 2 years to make sure that you or he don't change and then you want a divorce with a child. \nGood luck with love and life.
My husband and I had this exact same problem (with the different sleep schedules that is).  I would of course for the longest time get upset and sometimes it would even lead to us being up for another couple of hours fighting about it.  We eventually talked about it like adults and agreed it just wasn't worth the fighting.  (Plus, he has to sleep with the t.v. on and I love having complete quiet/darkness).  In the end I decided I would just lay there until I fell back asleep.  A little bit more sleep is better than none at all once I'm awake.  Over the years I've grown accustomed to it and it's just habit to roll over, cuddle up to him, and watch whatever movie he puts on until I drift back off.  But you two sleeping in separate rooms will definitely NOT solve the problem at all.  What I'm wondering right now is how does he wake you up?  Is he just too loud when he comes in or does he turn the light on?  If it's either one of these then maybe just ask him to be more understanding and try to not do these things when he's ready to come to bed.  If it's that he's turning on a light then maybe get a night light for the hallway or bathroom that'll help him see a little so he can walk in and lay down.
Make sure there ain't no game playin.  Ask around, make sure he isnt with someone else.  Find out if he's a nice guy.  Don't have to be obvious about it, but you do need to protect yourself, I don't think you want a broken heart if he's playin you.  Be careful, but have fun too.  If he likes you..go out, get to know him first, before you open up to him too much.
Just tell them that you don't, but dont let them know that it upsets you.  Its like complaining about a mickname.  It will stick if you don't ignore it.
Don't rush into anything.. and don't go to bars to meet nice people.  Expect to meet good people in unusual places.
Tell her how you feel and see what she has to say. It could be that she's under stress or is really busy. If there's truth in your feeling about her not liking you, she'll let you know. If you don't want to talk to her about it, just be up front and honest. Either way you will get a response from her.
"If one partner will submit and allow the other ""to rule the roost,"" then there should be much compatibility between two persons born with the element of fire in their sign. Although there is obviously a lack of contrasting personalities, there will be a sympathetic understanding by both parties regarding the qualities and shortcomings of the other. It would seldom be a peaceful or quiet relationship, the exception being that Aries natives do like to recharge their batteries in solitude every now and again and, hopefully, the timing would coincide. However, if both Aries subjects have dominant and forceful aspects in their horoscopes, then conflict will assuredly arise because both will desire to be head of the household and family.\n\nIn courtship, this combination can be a passionate affair, but neither will be content to play an inferior role. The Aries female tends to dominate...generally because domineering females have to try harder to get their way than do domineering males. There will however be fierce competition to see who can be ""Number One"" and eventually, such flare-ups and heavy cannonading will take their toll in the bedroom. Quite often, an Aries/Aries relationship that begins with much promise ends in disharmony. The prognosis is a little better if each has outside interests and/or a career separate from the other. When their energies are diverted into alternative areas, conflict between the two becomes a little more playful and much less destructive.\n\nThere are many instances of this union going the distance for life, but a divorce can prove to be somewhat violent and heart-breaking, so such an eventuality should be taken into consideration. Any possible court battle which ensued could well become legendary. Coupled with high risk though, there can be high reward and if two Aries natives are able to ""get it right,"" then their relationship is likely to be one of the most rewarding adventures of their lives."
stop doing it and fess up.
You probably should play it cool because calling her too much might boost her ego, and then she'll probably will begin to think that you are sprung on her, and that you might be a scrub. If she said two weeks, maybe that goes better with her schedule. She might not have anything open until two weeks, unless she plans on seeing other guys through the week and then kicking with you in the next week like she said. She gave you the number on Sun. You called Tuesday. That was like only two days, too soon. Maybe you can call her Friday or Saturday. Then set up to go on a date within the two week time period. At least you will have let a week go by, so that you still seem interested but not obsessive interested. Also don't leave too many messages, that's like stalking. But honestly, she seems like a quite busy lady, so if you are looking for someone who is fast paced, she fits the profile. But if you aren't, then maybe you might want to go out at least once to see if she is really for you or not, and then you'll have your decision to pursue her or not.
Yeah, alittle but. Shouldn't you live for yourself, or someone you love.
Need more info.  Each state has different resources.  Do you live somewhere that has the 211 helpline number?  Here in Indiana sometimes the trustee's office will help.  Try social service agencies.
"Well, thats hard, but you could pull it off by smiling a lot and also having your guy friends go over to him and say ""Man she is fine!!!"""

I avoid mine at all costs. I don't answer if she calls, I stay in our room (like I'm not feeling good) when she comes over. We are definitly better off without her butting in our relationship. He understands so it's a little easier to get away with.
premarital sex is a SIN and it's not safe.\n\nyou are not only at risk for AIDS but also for a lot of STDs. some STDs have no cure and will stay with you until you die. a good example is herpes.\n\nso, as much as possible, practice celibacy until you get married.
Talk to him and let him know how you feel!  Depending on where he goes to school, you can still live near each other (or together).  Just be honest with him, not telling him and letting him keep thinking 'everything's fine' will really cause problems for your relationship.
be yourself and don't be fake
Try this site:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970s
It's always good to get things out in the open, just ask him what his feelings are, whats the worst that could happen he says he only wants to be friends, yes that will hurt if you have feelings for him, but at least then you will be able to move on knowing you can't be with him!
I gotta say, there is only one reason a girl fakes it...and that is to make YOU feel good or feel better about YOURSELF...cause she is worried you have too fragile an ego to deal with the fact that she might not totally enjoy being w you. SO>>> I think you gotta talk to her and somehow gain a little confidence in yourself and your ability. The problem isn't her. If she is not faking it, great. If she is, I think you gotta turn the mirror on yourself and ask why. In either case....SHE is not the issue here!
What questions are you talking about?
I'm a small person, so I go for the smaller one.\nI've been so sore I couldn't walk- I want the guy I can have every night and not be limping around.\nAll else being equal, I take the guy whose build is a better match for my build.
No, you may get jealous.
Please, the guy is SUPPOSED to be older than the girl. (whether by a day or a month or watevr) go & ask her out! dont fear rejection because if u do, u WILL get rejected. think good thoughts & dont worry so much. be urself & dont studder. besides, girls like guys older than them so go ahead! nothing's stopping u. & if ur friends laugh, who gives a fuck wat they say?! if ur in love, u r in love! go ahead. it'll all work out fine. nothing to fear at all! o, & think good thoughts. GOOD LUCK ^_^
Actually, I'm currently having that same problem. I'm in fairly good terms with my ex and it also depends on how long it's been since the two of you broke up. My friends advice was that I just let him decide. If he likes me and wants to give it a shot that's great but if not I could see how it would be outside his morals as a friend. Just try not too maul him or anything. He's just like any other guy. Be yourself and if he likes you enough then it won't matter because he'll be following his heart. ;D
Sounds like your friend just isn't ready for anything serious, unfortunately. Don't even waste your time.
Wow. Listen to yourself-- all this sadness and drama over a GIRL.  I really think the best thing for you would be to move on, and find another girl.  I'm sure there are many other girls in your college who would be glad to go out with you, or at least become friends with you.  Staying by yourself instead of socializing will only make you feel worse, and will not get you anywhere.  Just keep telling yourself, she's just a girl! There are many more girls out there who are better than her (it can also help to make up a list of things about her that you didn't like, such as she never called you when she told you she would, or she was always late to places).\nGood luck! i hope i helped..
r u that desperate that ur looking for a gf over the internet like this?

don't date guys with friends. everyone knows everything. go around flashing some people. they'll talk to you.
tell him the truth that you are waiting to have sex until your wedding night then tell him if he don't like it he is free to leave
kick him in the balls
see if you can get them both at the same time
(*) Because men are cowards.  We would rather cut off our right arm than admit we don't or no longer love you.\n(*) Because men (and women) have this stupid thing called pride, and it gets in the way.

nope.......My Husband married me, I have 2 kids.\n When I was single the guys didnt care if I had kids. they wanted me....for me...Like I tell everyone, if you want to date me (well before I was married) YOu HAVE to take the entire package, meaning me and my kids. Can't accept all of us, you dont need me!
hi there, depending what you for in a guy and what u are looking for, tyr not too look at the same type of people, or maybe try looking in a different social group?
Yes. I just told him & he's not really upset since he's been intimate with your Mom & Sister.
I agree with your heart.  If this person is constantly on your mind and you have imagined a future with this person, the he/she is right for you.  Just hope that they feel the same about you.

"you dont ""spot"" a cheating wife,they either aren't or they are there are no tell tale signs no dead give aways,you either catch her or you dont \ngive me a break all you people who said losing weight buying new things etc was a way to spot a cheating wife!! i get a new hair style once in a while,buy new sexy clothes all the time,wear sexy undies,and shave my pubes and i hardly give any to my husband(thats his fault),that doesn't mean i am cheating,i love my husband very much i do all those things to please him,but still i am ignored,never told i am loved never complemented on anything i do or how i look...ever thought that maybe you were not doing something right,not fulfilling the need at home,marriage is not just about sex guys look into your realationship a bit and see whats missing,happy women dont cheat,underappreciated ones do,maybe your wife is doing all those things just so you will notice she is alive and still there"
"as of right now it took you four trys to ""make your self clear"" so the answer you want is yes just go"
try to make him jealous everytime you see him try to look better than anyone around you
I think you are gonna wanna go to a place called Leather-Boys.  They have just what you are looking for I think.  Be sure to pack plenty of Condoms and A_nal-Ease.
"If you are a man, start with the KISS TEST.  Touch her hair (like a couple of strands hanging in the front or something not creepy) and say something nice about it like: I like your hair, or your hair is so soft.  If she is open to this and seems to like it then she is open to a kiss.  Go for it.  If you don't kiss her on the first date, you are likely to get the ""We are just friends"" disease."
well in my opinion i think that u should just wait to see what happens.. i think that if she turned you down twice that might be a sign that she just wants to remain friends. i dont think that u can do anything to really change her mind, because if she does she will do it on her own without any help. But if u stay close to her and become even better friends i think that it will help change her mind.. hope this helped :)
Well,since u know ur freind dont love her,tell him to stop playn around with the gurl u love or u r gonna do some thing about it.Also say that she is with the wrong guy,'cause if he dont love her and just likes sl*ts,(which i dont eben know.but im guessn....srry.)then she can be with the right guy,u!Also tell her thatwhat u r what u r going to say is true,and u dont want it to break your freind-ship with her,Tell her that u still have Feelings for her,and u know her bf aint ever gonna love her like u do.Then leave and let her think about what u just said.(Dont tell her that her bf dont love her, because then,she might think u r just sayn that to make her like go out with u...(I should know,Im a girl...)....
No  on the first part and maybe on the second part. I got to think it over first.
ummm...i think that's for you to answer...and who is miguel?
You have a brilliant and enquiring mind.  There are many people who believe in exactly that sort of thing... but there are many other ideas, and who can say what is the right answer/ idea.  Reincarnation is well known, some folk believe in ghosts.  I knew a woman once who believed that walls (and other things) absorbed and recorded every sound, and she could make them play back!  I met a man who firmly believed that everyone fought evil/ death in their sleep each night (and that eventually everyone loses the battle).  Have you heard about prana, or breath?  The life force is breath -- it leaves you dead as a last breath (the soul), and prana yoga is a set of exercises that gets breath chi to  more places more efficiently so you feel better and live longer. Some people believe we are all one, so we can connect with things and with each other.  They can move things by thought (telekinesis) and levitate!  However, some people reckon this explains a fondness for a favourite chair or toy, a relationship with a quirky automobile, and affinity with other people -- friends and loved ones.\n\nSo yes, they might well be a better fit as your parents than your actual parents, and you may be right -- maybe they should have been your parents.  On the other hand, maybe they were your parents in a previous life.  Or what if you just knew them in a previous life?\n\nMaybe there's a cosmic law that stops you getting the same parents each reincarnation???  Who knows!\n\nMaybe God gave you the parents you have now as a lesson or even as a punishment lol! \n\nMaybe your parents don't suit you just now -- but who's to say that will always be the case.  maybe God knows that in the future, some years ahead, you will need THESE particular parents for some particular reason.\n\nIn the meantime, keep on thinking, inquiring and write up a diary -- maybe you will be a brilliant author one day!
I am not sure your best way to find out is to give them a call...C
Sex talk can be uncomfy at first, but if you want to have a relationship with him, you need to talk about it. Its a fact, no matter how you look at it, it will come up often. He wants to see how you react to some talk to guage what excites you and what doesn't. That way, he can try those things to better please you. Try and get comfy with him, it'll bring you closer when you can speak openly about sex.
It is totally a matter of personal preference..\n\nSome women or men like it natural, as it contains odors that are sexy to the man, as part of 'your scent' .. it can be a big turn on to leave it that way.  This is a minority group, in my experience.\n\nSome like it trimmed (it can have many styles), and either keep it a real close shave (which can be stubbly) or enough length that doesn't poke their parnter if they are down there playing around.\n\nThen there are those women that do not feel right unless ALL the hair is gone.. some wax and some shave.  It is more 'sanitary' in that there is no odor caused by the hair itself, on the flip side there IS no hair to protect the vagina, which is it's the original intent of having hair their - as is ears, nose and stuff.... o keep your body safe of foreign viruses/bacteria.  Most women IK know just feel cleaner with it shaved or waxed.  \n\nIt is a personal decision, and if you are alone, experiement, if you have a partner, it's best to also get their input - while it's not their body, they should have a say, for which for which you can still do what you want.  It's a respect thing to ask them their opinion.\n\nBest Wishes in your pursuit of 'which is best for you'.  :)\n\nI like the men trimmed as well, as it helps with oral on them.. just like I'm sure trimmed or shaved helps with oral on us.  :)  To each his/her own!! Good Luck!
Hi,\nThat isnt a dumb question. \nWell there are basically 3 types of boys. The 1st type is the shy one. If that kind of boy likes a girl, he would shy away from her and become tongue-tied and uncomfortable in her presence. Otherwise, he could be quite outspoken and garrulous.\nThe 2nd type is the guy who tries to impress. The majority of boys belong to this class. This type of boy will start showing off in front of the girl he likes. He could make jokes or show off his biceps or his brains, whichever be his strength.\nThe 3rd type of guy is the brat. There is a saying that a boy teases and bothers you only because he likes you. This is pretty true, but it isnt always true. A guy who keeps bugging you could like you, or he could be doing it just for fun.\nIt isnt neccessary that a boy would strictly adhere to any one of the 3 classes. Usually, it is a mixture of the 3 classes. That is just 1 factor which makes love so unpredictable.\n\nWhen I like a girl, I usually get a little shy and I might show off just a little bit. You just have to have a good intuition. Take a look at his body language, his eye contact, his rate of breathing etc etc. Usually, I can tell if a girl likes me. You just have to keep your senses open.\n\nWhen you know for sure that he likes you, then you could show your interest in him too, through subtle gestures and body language, and then wait for him to ask you out. Or you could make the move yourself and ask him out. It is all up to you.
1st of all tell us that u do u wanna mery wid westren gal, COUZ of teh PASSPORT? if yes then shame on u. and if u love some over their, u r the MAN of the OWNER? just ask her and collect money and Go to teh WEST. simple
Honesty, time, understanding, and friendship. It would be easy to say cute, but no one is cute to everyone. I wanted and found a MAN who is caring, loving, listens to me, understands me, spends time with me doing things we both enjoy. I know what we don't want in a guy....drunk trying to be cool for your friends, cheaters, a big ego. Or any guy with (sps) small penis syndrome!!! What is sps = when a guy puts women down to make himself feel better about his lack of penis size.\n Hope all this helps!!!\nNudelyweds
he likes you more than just friends but maybe he doesnt want to lose the friendship if you guys go out or something!
let her pik a topic the guy NEVER piks the topic its one of the things ive found thru xperience but whatever topic she piks go with it and be honest
bicycles are ridden, not driven
A lot of people likes her she is really nice. You could be her friend too, if you wanted.
Babies are born to life crying, people are born to suffer. Love is a temporary cure to this suffering when you still have love and to love. But nothing is permanent, and suffering is the only thing that would never ceased.
when your making love with someone you love, it's the greatest feeling in the world. it's the two of you are traveling back and forth through space. nothing around you even matters.
go out in the real world and just make new friends. relax take your time dont think about wanting a best friend too much. having friends is more important not just best friends.
rub on yo balls in front of her...\ntry dat homie just try it...\ncmon i dare ya...
"Then she's obviously not as in love with you as she says she is. That's the whole thing about ""denying others for the one you love"". She's selfish. And you do not need to marry her. Move on. DO NOT be her faithful Dog and wait on the side with your tail wagging. Eff that. Find a woman who actually appreciates what you're offering. Move on."

Lubrication, lubrication, lubrication.  That is THE most important part of anal sex.  It can be quite enjoyable if he takes things slow and uses a condom that is well lubricated.  Also it is important that you do your best not to tense up.  That will cause it to hurt.  If it hurts, tell him to stop where he is and then work to make yourself relax those muscles. It's possible to tense them without really realizing that you did.  It's very important that you're not afraid to communicate with him during something like this.  You can't just let him go to town.  It's a process.  But once you get it down, it can be a wonderful addition to your sex life.  Good luck and have fun.
This is an easy question and yet complex.  Every guys will want different things.  I like long hair, preferably red.  An attractive figure is also great.  Superficial acrostics aside, she needs to be able to carry a conversation.  I would rather have an average looking girl that is equally smart and can hold an intelligent conversation, rather than a perfect 10 that all guys drool over.  With a girl that is EXTREMELY beautiful you sometimes wonder if she is being faithful.  That takes allot of faith on the guys part to trust her  just as it takes trust for the girl to think the guys is not cheating.  If the girl can't say anything smart allot of people will look at her and think/know she is a ditz.  I know I am rambling on so, in my opinion intelligence, good looks, loyalty, willingness to compromise, horneyness.

"When most people do that, they are trying to find people who will side with them to prove they are in the right. It makes him feel good for others to say ""man, you were right, she's wrong"".

Maybe because you're just not ready to do it?  If you're happy with your life right now, LIVE IT.\n\nIt sounds like you've let 'society & friends' decide when you 'should' be dating.  \n\nWhat's wrong with enjoying a bit of solitude before adding someone to your life?  After a bad relationship, it's particularly satisifying to be with NO ONE.  And that's despite what all your matchmaking friends think.\n\nWhen you're ready, there's millions of guys out there.  And when YOU'RE ready, they'll look a lot better.
more emotional than physical
The problem here is your attitude towards your boyfriend because you are trying to make of him a different human being and that is unlikely to happen.  You are with someone because you accept him the way he is and that's all...  If you have offered him connections to quality jobs and he does not accept them, it is because he is prefers that small-paying job.  \n\nAlso you worry too much about the future (I do too! Believe me!  I think I'm even worse because I take into consideration global warmth).  \n\nYou seem to be perfectionist, methodical, neat, the kind of person who has defined her aims clearly and this is not good or bad this is you, this is the individual you are.  Now, you might be happy having this traits (or not)... but this is you!  Would you like your boyfriend to make some adjustments to your personality and try to make you fit in his plans?  I doubt it.  Each individual appreciates the respect of others towards his/her personality and uniqueness.\n\n#1 You won't change a man who is in his 30's because as you get older you settle and get used to certain habits.  Men hate to be controlled by women and also he won't change because a 20-year-old girl tells him to.\n\n#2 It is good to establish your aims and follow your dreams but the world is not a pattern... life is not a pattern... you could even die tomorrow... the adoption laws in your country could change... I don't know... I'm not telling you to live like a monkey in the jungle without plans or aims... just try to be flexible because unfortunately the world does not revolves around you... ask Galileo!\n\n#3 If you insist on finding someone better then call this relationship a day... if you don't see a future... then do it... but do not go on making other people change their ways.\n\nI'm pretty much like you but if there is something I've learned is that life is not a pattern and that you have to be tolerant and some times to give in.  I've learned that you are happy when you learn to live with the things you have and I've also learned that when you're not satisfied with your life at all it is always possible to change...\n\nGd luck! ,-)

Rule #1\nDon't force something where it doesn’t fit.  \n\nYou are playing with fire and people have gotten burned for attempting to steal a woman away from a man.  There are so many single women in the world man and it is not worth it to put yourself thru the trouble of getting a woman that is already spoken for, however, you could befriend her and tell her that you respect that she is taken for now but if she should happen to become available that you would like to take her out.
If she has a her address public, you can go to this web site.  http://members.yahoo.com/   If you click on Advanced Search you should be able to find her that way.
you should be asking that question to your self.marry when you've found the right girl & when you are ready to tie the knot.all the best to you..
"What you are describing is a man who wants to control the people in his life. He says whatever he needs to get what he wants. Abusers (batterers) are very jealous, are very effective at driving away family and friends, like to keep their women ""barefoot and pregnant"" (4 kids 10 and under). Often they don't really want children, but they know children will tie their women to them, keeping her dependent on him. It's hard for you to become independend if you have 4 young children ""hanging onto your skirts."" I'll bet he has you living a hand-to-mouth existence.

I think that sometimes the G Spot is mental not phsical.  I have no research to back this up and mine is a actual physical place, but maybe I doesnt do any good to touch it unless the person touching it does it just right and you have an emotion connection...but mine feels like the roof of my mouth and its on the top of the vagina about a half an inch in. :)
'cause just sex doesn't keep people together. Once the newness wears off, knockin' boots is only 20% of a relationship, love and everything else is the other 80%. Love includes the mind, body, and soul.

If he does not want to have sex just wait till you find out why before leaving it could medical proplems if he is your b/f he sure would not be if he didnot care. Plus love is very important you still have time to have plans in the fulture for a child together.*
all the time with the one I love! -there's no such thing as too much sex!
You can't tell her or you don't want to tell her?  I think what you need to do is sit down with her and see where her head is and where she sees this relationship going before you pour your heart out. Because, maybe just maybe you are scared to be rejected like most people in this world, but sometimes you have to take chances especially on love...I hope this helps you out sweetie.
A girls breast size really doesn't matter.  I've been with those that have practically nothing to those that were simply huge.  The breasts don't make the girl.
"width is more important. 7 inches is the smallest length. but it is equal for me if it is 4 inches long  and wide or 10 inches long and thin - they both re useless. it should be ""big"" - long and wide both. maybe 3 inches in diameter and 7 inches long the smallest big size for me"

"If you got it last night (Thursday), call her late morning Saturday.  3 days is too long.  Calling right away says ""desperate.""  Be casual, but respectful.

"Depends on what you mean by ""crush"".  It sounds like he is interested in having sex with you and not interested in the real you.  It isn't appropriate for a boss and an employee to be talking dirty with each other....it will end badly.  I hope  you can move on from this ""crush"" and become interested in someone that respects  you."
depends on what is on it though. I do not think it is right to put a lot of personal stuff these websites it seems to bring the demon out in people.
no it sound really dodgey
Write her a letter and read it to her explaining how he feels -- If he thinks that he has a chance do it before the prom if he's unsure then wait till the middle or near the end --If he writes the letter it will let her know that he's been thinking about her and that it's not some cheap ploy to win her over on the night of romnace-

Yeah you should break up. You shouldn't force her on this matter. Neither of you are really wrong, b/c you both can justify your views on sexuality. \nSo just let her go, tell her you know shes gonna think your a jerk but its just how you feel. And get a new girl who you dont need to pressure.\nAnd if the last girl was so great why did you break up w/ her?
You can do both.  You just gotta make sure the person you are PM'g has their messenger options open to everyone or you are on that person's friend list.  In most cases, people change their setting to only accept PM's from people on their friend list to cut back on the spam messages.
Yes, I saw the start of a relationship between two of my friends at a party. For the next several months they were inseperable. It was really quite depressing watching the whole thing unfold before my eyes. That is probably why I don't care to involve myself in my friends' relatioships. I don't want to be caught up in their drama.

Any event that challenges someone's view of reality can be traumatizing. If a person is in a place she thought was safe, her sense of safety is threatened. If she is with someone she trusted, her sense of trust is threatened. Rape is very personal and painful for a woman. It is terrifying to have absolutely no control over a situation. A man who is dominating her is frightening. Maybe the worst thing is that rape can affect a woman's (and even more so a girl's) ability to engage in pleasurable sex. Furthermore, the act of telling someone (the police) about it can be embarrassing and frightening. Suddenly everything is out of the hands of the woman (again, even worse for a girl).\nRape isn't really about pleasure - a rapist is often compensating for a lot of real serious problems. Date rape can often be the worst for the loss of trust - not only in the other person, but also in the woman's faith in her ability to judge the character of a person.
forever?
just ask him.
I would tell your friend that you and him are friends. Be honest. Don't keep anything away from your friend. No guy is more important than your friend.
Not all guys or girls on the online dating sites are into games, but some are.  You just have to find the right person.  I've went out with my share of losers from those on-line dating websites,  I also have went out with a few great guys from there as well.  But I also found my current boyfriend on a on-line dating website and he is awesome to me.
You just have to ask them? Do you like me, it's really simple.
Hey, it's not just the guys!
I agree that isn't nice at all. But don't just cut her off because you might be loosing one of your only best Friends. Go and tell her what you don't like about the situation. Good Luck!
You are a sweetie.

just be yourself.\na poem song flowers candy always help\nbut what impresses me someone that takes care of thier business bills work ect...\nbe yourself and support yourself thats impressive
if your the serios one in the relationship, then your not doing absolutely anything wrong. trust me... therefore if its not you, then its definetly the slutty chicks your seeing. im not a play girl, i usually stick to serious relationships and dont go around calling and then not calling, so trust me, its not you, its simply the non worthy ones.
"It's been my experience that the heart will mislead you.. we often find ppl attractive who are completely wrong on so many levels.. perhaps I'm biased because I'm in the beginning of a divorce, but I think one's brain is a better guide.. relationships boil down to practical matters, and a division of labor.. the sparks and butterflies don't last very long.its wiser to follow your brain.. \n\n""it's not always rainbows and butterflies, it's compromise that moves us along"""
The first thing we look for is good looks. After that, we are ultimately looking for a woman who we think will make our own lives better.
It means nothing to me.   Are you self-destructing on Yahoo Answers?   If so, that means nothing to me either.   \n\nGood luck with your lonely life.   \n\nGet a cat.
The hottest fore-play is teasing each other, softly rubbing your lovers bare skin just enough to give him/her goose bumps! It drives my nuts to have the nape of my neck kissed.
It sounds as if he doesn't want you to confront him on what he does/doesn't do..-If you want to stay with him get counseling....it may not work or it could work....Pray about it and you may not get the answers that you want right away but if you are steadfast in your prayers, they will be answered....a lot of men/woman cheat b/c they think the grass is greener on the other side and many times they find it's not so...I was married and very in love, my ex-husband was rude, hurtful and would not have sex with me for 3 years, I later learned he was seeing a pleather of women... I would confront him on some issues and he would get angry that I was questioning him at all... he said the same as your husband...we don't get along, we fight all the time-when the reality was-he was starting all the fights!!! You will still get benefits if you are separating...and you can get health insurance from the military if you happen to get divorced..let's hope he comes to his senses and realizes what he has...again, try counseling and ask for God's help-I hope that you marriage can be saved...
You can go out when you want to and come home when you please.  All of your money is YOURS!!!  And most importantly your time is YOURS!!!!!!!  There is nothing wrong with being a bachelor.
50% of the Aries - Aquarius relationship ends in divorce.\n50% of the Aries - Aquarius relationship ends up marriage.\n\nWrong? Then, prove it!\n\nYou see, astrology are for READERS. Life is for DOERS. As you said you are in love and wants to marry her. Its serious man! cum on!!!\n\nI would suggest one thing: take good things from astrology - good advice, good prediction, good match and reject bad things like bad prediction, bad advice.\n\nIts upon you.\n\nI am Aries n by gf is Aquarius. We are fine. Both of us doesnt like quarrel or argument, so stays out of it. We give each other the freedom and space. She is cute and I am hard, tough and aggressive. I love her and I will protect her always. She will love me as long as I will.\n\nLOVE IS GIVING. It like a saving account. The more money you save in your account the more you get when you need.\n\nLOVE is in the pleasure of Giving. Dont think about what you are getting. Just give her love, love and love.\n\nIf you find comfort in giving her unconditional love then you are done buddy. Life is a one shot game. There is no trial for anything. You do it or you dont.\n\nThe only thing will which make you happy (with or without her) is how much LOVE you can GIVE.\n\nGoodLuck!
in my opinion the answer is no cuz everytime my man pleasures me its like the first time but better and we do it at least 3 times a week 2 times a day and we've been together for a year\n\n\ni cant  tell u the best way because all women are different what may be good to one may be bad to another
That is very nice of you! especially since it just cost you 5 points!

my gf is a surfer and i think shes HOT
tell him how u feel .. n give him a chance .. i think he's worth it .. many guys know how to express emotions n make us happy but at the end it's all lies .. but some dont know how to make us feel loved but it's still true ..
It doesn't happen hunny..not unless you don't care about the physical aspect of it. Eastern europe
you can always go to the government website..they have procedures there on how to get residents status in the country, in fact you can even get filipino citizenship if one of your parents is filipino...dual citizenship is accepted now in the philippines so you can be both filipino and US citizen... once you have your papers of whther citizenship or resident status, you are free to apply to any job you want... good luck

Talk to him.
i prefer men also....but i love looking at beautiful women also,who doesn't?
how do you know she is single and interested? well the answer is: you don't!! and you won't unless you ask or somehow figure out a way to get to know her better..i.e. by sparking up a conversation and taking it from there! so far you've got really vague assumptions of her age for example..so the only way to find out real hard facts is to make a move and spark up casual conversation and if she responds positively you're on the right track! good luck!
Cause society diictates that it is inapppropriate for a woman to have such. We have delicate sensibilities u know :)
nope not really, I'm happily married
Tell him straight on that you can only be friends. Though be really polite and sweet.
That's where ya screw yer sister.\nThere's meant to be like genetic screwups in the offspring of incestial parents so I don't recommend it.
Basically it's when you have a guy dip his b*lls(like you dip a tea bag) in a girls mouth.
Its happening to me now... I only wish I was in an office as oppose to a cubicle.
I agree with most of your sentiments.  I think that, as unpalatable as we Westerners have found arranged marriages, all things equal, relationships last longer and are ultimately more fulfilling when they are begun based upon substantial commonalities (religion, socioeconomic status and goals, philosophical approaches to life, and other deep aspects of personhood).  I have never had a relationship last or be very satisfying when it was begun based upon physical or sexual attraction, the potential for some gain, or because others thought we would be good together or should marry.\nI also do not feel that even the best relationship is likely to overcome the most profoundly hurt and unhappy people's disenchantment with life.  However, once one has begun to find her own happiness, the right partner can certainly accentuate an already positive life.  It is those relationships for which we should strive; and for no less than that should we settle.
I can't believe u just posted that for the whole public to see.
It may be that dude Corky! from some crappy show on during the 90's!
Go for it girl.......If he's calling your family, that means he wants to talk to you....He probably thought your grandparents wouldn't give you his number, that's probably the reason he didn't leave any! It isn't crazy at all, trust me that's perfectly natural...Follow your instincts, you'll never know unless you try...Life is about taking risks and about experimenting, how bad can it be? Go for it!
first u  both u should know that u really in love . because sometime we thought its love. but at the end we realise that its really not. coz she is married  she use to in love with her husband.after some time sh may realse that she is doing wrong . so she can leave u. . isuggest uif its reaaly not a true love  fine some one else. there is some body made for u. good luck
Pick your battles.  Does it really matter that he left the towels on the floor or that he is ten minutes late for the fifth time in a row?  No it doesn't not really.\n\nOnly discuss things that are important issues.\n\nAnd start right from the beginning.  Find a mutually okay time and schedule a babysitter and a date.\n\nWorking 90 hours a week is a problem so have a nice dinner ready at home if you have to and take time to get to know each other.\n\nDon't sweat the small stuff.. and don't sweat the big stuff.. life is too short.\n\nWork on being friends first and the rest will follow.\n\nAnd don't focus on the negative with him all the time even if he does with you.  Teach by example not nagging as we woman are prone to do. Hold you tongue more often than you let it go. You'll be surprised by the result.
I’m not a girl and I don’t live in Budapest, but I’m Hungarian. If I’m good enough to answer your question, here’s my e-mail address: kubuszok@gmail.com
Love constantly evolves it is never what it once was. It is like you constantly adapting, changing. it does not mean the same thing or even fell exactly the same. you fall in and out of love. there are fights, you do stupid things it is hard to let go of things. Love is a verb and requires constant attention. Showing you love each other and want to make it work are vital. the grass is always greener on the other side, and you may experience alot of the same problems. I have been with one woman for 6 years ansd I think I am in love with her more now than ever, even though less than a week ago I aske the same question. good luck, you will need it.
yes, they do.

Then I'll be back in a while with some real advice.http://www.webheights.net/GrowingbeyondEmotionalAbuse/evans/cp.htm\n\nHere is a website about a book by Patricia Evans. It's called ""Controlling People"":\n\n\nAn excerpt--Does this sound like\nsomeone you know?\n\n\nAlways needs to be right \nTells you who you are and what you think \nImplies that you're wrong or inadequate when you don't agree \nIs threatened by people who are ""different"" \nFeels attacked when questioned \nDoesn't seem to really hear or see you \nIf any of the above traits sounds familiar, help is on the way! In Controlling People, bestselling author Patricia Evans (The Verbally Abusive Relationship) tackles the ""controlling personality,"" and reveals how and why these people try to run other people's lives. She also explains the compulsion that makes them continue this behavior -- even as they alienated others and often lose those they love.\n\nControlling People helps you unravel the senseless behavior that plagues both the controller and the victim. Can the pattern, or spell, be broken? Yes! says the author.\n\nBy understanding the compelling force involved, you can be a catalyst for change and actually become a spell-breaker. Once the spell is broken and the controller sees others as they really are, a genuine connection can be forged and healing can occur.\n\nShould you ever find yourself in the thrall of someone close to you, Controlling People is here to give you the wisdom, power, and comfort you need to be a stronger, happier, and more independent person.\n\nAbout the Author\n  \n Patricia Evans is the founder of the Evans Interpersonal Communications Institute in Alamo, CA. She conducts workshops across the country, and has made numerous media appearances. Her first book, The Verbally Abusive Relationship, was praised by Newsweek as ""groundbreaking."" \n\n"" If someone defines you, even in subtle ways, they are pretending to know the unknowable. There is a quality of fantasy to their words and sometimes to their actions. Even so, they are usually unaware of the fact that they are playing ""let's pretend."" They fool themselves and sometimes others into thinking that what they are saying is true or that what they are doing is right.\n\nWhen people ""make up"" your reality -- as if they were you -- they are trying to control you, even when they don't realize it.\n\nWhen people attempt to control you they begin by pretending. When they define you they are acting in a senseless way. They are pretending. When people act as if you do not exist or are not a real person with a reality of your own...they are pretending. In this subtle and often unconscious way, they are attempting to exert control over you -- your space, time, resources, or even your life.\n\nTo control is to act to effect an outcome, generally by means of restraint, physical or verbal, with regard to self, others, or the world around one.\n\nThere are two kinds of control. One is the nurturing control that we have over ourselves, our lives, and those entrusted to our care. The other is oppressive control.\n\nNurturing control supports one's own and others' freedom to be themselves, while oppressive control does just the opposite. Most people exercise nurturing control throughout their lives by the choices they make and the actions they take to ensure their own and others' sustenance and survival: to put off immediate gratification for a future good; to manage their resources -- money, time, space, and environment; to pursue their work and their relationships; and to care for their children and their families.

Its always nice to get time for you two alone to talk FACE TO FACE. (this is important) It always helps to talk things out eye to eye. Make sure you work out all past problems that caused you guys to break up. But make sure that you guys COMMUNICATE. ITS KEY TO A GOOD RELATIONSHIP!
I think it is a web based sms service that allows you to send sms to any mobile across the world...not a great service..\n\nthe way it works is simple just like email..server based..
Believe me that is an age old problem and a rough one too.\nIf you give her an ultimatum…well he’s there and you’re not. On the other hand if you just keep putting you best foot forward. Keep precise notes, always remember her birthday, all the anniversaries (the day you first wrote her and her you, fist met, anything and everything), don’t forget birthdays valentines day and whatever else you can think of to give you that upper edge. \nYou know every now and then you could send her flowers “Just to say I love you.” Women love that stuff.\nThere is something else to consider: She isn’t that exactly that tight with the other guy if she is interested in you, which is a point in your favor.\nRemember though when you talk to her carefully, very carefully try to find out where you stand. If you think, and can confirm that you are falling way behind then dump her, on your terms. \nI have been there twice myself I found out that one was after my money and the other was married.
Probably because you still have feelings for him. maybe give your relationship another try. work out your problems.\n\nDave
What?
Aren't both parties cheating in this situation?  The wife is not only having sex with someone besides her husband, but it is homosexual sex also.  Does that make her in the wrong twice as much or does it not count as cheating at all?  Just a thought.\n\nAs for the man, yes, he is cheating, but with permission.  It's not a glorified way to cheat, it is approved cheating.  What can the wife say if she is also having sex with the third party?  \n\nFor the most part, men have this fantasy to boost their ego.  The idea that they can satisfy more than one woman at a time and then try to prove it correct is just huge to men.  As for who the two girls are, it doesn't matter.  As a matter of fact, I think that the man would have even more fun if neither one of the women were his girlfriend or wife.  This way he doesn't have to concentrate mostly on one woman.
Tom? Dick? Harry?
She is still too young for this things
"Sit down at a table with two pieces of paper.  On one paper write all the reasons you act the way you do. ""the attitude"" you mentioned. \nOn the other paper, write down the reasons you think you should'nt act the way you do.\nWhen you are finished, look at the reasons you have this ""attitude"" Compare it to the reasons you should not.  \nThen consider if you want to change for this person.  If so, throw the paper away that has the reasons you act the way you do.  Take the paper that says the reasons you should not and use them as a guide to change for this person.  \nIf you do not want to change for this person, throw away both papers and let him divorce you... Its cheaper."
If u are willing to give it another try there is this lube called @nal ease and you can get it @ lovers lane or any store such as that. it numbs the area so it isn't as un comfy when he slips it in. (start w/him using one finger then move to 2 working your way up to his c*ck) it also helps if he goes down on you first. you need to be relaxed for this.\n\nIf you don't wanna try that and are not comfortable at all have a talk w/him about it. it is totally a subject that can be worked out. he shouldn't be looking to go some were else.
To each his own if he wants ta get close & personal with Aunt Flow, and you are confortable with that then I say go for it girl!!
He was not there because he was with your ex.the same ex that did not pick up his cell. They were together for crying out loud.I thought you knew by now.......THEY ARE GAY.Im sorry you had to find this out from me.but its the truth.Happened to me at one stage so I know from experience.

Your question is not clear... What is the problem?
It could be your haircut
It happens when your upset, you express your anger in alot of ways. Let your kids no you don't mean it, and be sure to catch yourself and apologize if it slips. But yes, we all do it.
Definitely don't make her your girlfriend for the sake of having one. Just be friends.
So a player is a male whore.  Just because it's a different name doesn't make the person whoring him or herself any more respectable.
fInd -PROOF- t0 c0nviNcE the guRL thAt thE bOy doEs nOt LoVe HEr....
Stay with the one that loves you and show him you love him too. Don't even think about the Ex, he will cheat on you again.
Yes you have to learn to keep communication lines open from the very beginning.
what are you some kind of martyr? Lemme get this straight, she dumps you TWICE and you want her back? why is your self esteem so low? why do you think you deserve this cruel behavior?  Close your eyes...picture what kind of woman you'd liek to spend the rest of your life with. Is it someone who'd disrespect you twice? didn't think so.\n\nyou otta go talk to someone and let them help you sort out this mess.  you deserve better. go find a decent girl.
Obviously they're insecure about they're bodies. I don't see them getting mad at girls who sit and ask about c*ck sizes!! If the question offended them, they didn't even have to click on the question to respond. Calling you names for asking a question only shows what b*tches women can be. Sorry you were verbally attacked by so many, doesn't say much for what's supposed to be the more compassionate of the sexes!!
oh-hell-no what type of shit is that maybe he's right he probally wanna be good for you or he might get carried away cause he like what he see.
Well you have answered your own question ... you want to tell him that you like him but your afraid of his answer just remeber that telling someone you LIKE them or ASK THEM OUT is always a risk and its normal to be afraid ... Just follow what your heart tells you ... no matter what the answer is you will always have the friednship to back it oof.
the emotions involved are the difference between just having sex and making love.
Take out a restraining order! \n\nYou need to tell him straight, stop all contact with him otherwise it'll jst get worse and worse
Since I see that you have kids you probebly never get time alone, so I would give him dinner and a movie (his choice of course) and get an overnite babysitter and stay at a hotel. Plus you could do the dinner and the movie from your room!
your not ready
Well to be honest. A man always feels like a man. So you want to know how to spice up the marriage. So let me explain what happens. A couple starts off in a relationship and everything is allot of fun. The sex, the hanging out, the vacations, the friends etc. Good stuff!\nBut then we get married and responsible life kicks in. And everyone knows that responsible life sucks. Someone is always pissed whether it is the bill collector, the boss, the kids, the wife and sometimes even the damn dog. And eventually this starts to wear down the couple.\nSo to spice up your life you need to break up the routine, not necessarily to relieve boredom, but to just get away from the day to day BS for a least a little while. \nSo breaking up the routine should lead to good sex and a few laughs that bring you back to a time when you couldn't get enough of each other. Good luck!
I think what you are asking is.. Do the readers have any crushes... Or no... Well I will answer what I think you are trying to ask... I do have a crush on a guy but can't seem to tell him yet.. Waiting for the right moment I guess...
tell them things about them that may often go unnoticed, not to say that your not seeing them, but, simple things such as features on their body, eyes, skin tone, smile, etc. comfort them with compliments about them, and they will enjoy every bit of what you have to say.
I'm normally appealed to guys who look like they have some inner depth. Normally artsy or intellectual. The way they carry themselves and interact with other people.
I know a polluk..Count?\n\nTo answer the question...1 if he's tall enough.
I love my brother! even though we fight all the time
move on sweetie you only live once.
No, but l wanted to kill myself for loving such a jerk.
The fact of the matter is that he may not want her to meet his family because he's embarrassed by them.  He might have a very good reason why he doesn't want her to meet his family.  She should just ask him why she hasn't met them yet.  There is no use speculating when you can simply ask him and find out the truth.

Become her friend first.  Talk to her.  Get to know her.  Then call her and ask her if she wants to get dinner sometime (make sure you have a specific idea first).  You're not asking her to marry you, and chances are she'll say yes.
Wierd, yes. Wrong, yes.\nTalk to her. Talk to your parents, if you are a child (?).\nTry to avoid awkward situations. You probably don't want her for a very close friend.\nBe careful, okay.
yes I have multiple personalities
I do like Dr Phil, I think he offers his guests great advice and has been able to help many people. His books are quite informative and have also served to assist the wider public.  I think it would be hard to have helped all of these people and somehow not got a big head over it.. of course he is arrogant, but I would be too if I had his money.  \n\nBut put yourself in his shoes, how would you feel if you had to deal with and listen to all those problems everyday? He deserves every cent he has.
I'm cool with lesbians. I think every state should allow gay marriage. They way I see it, marriage is a union between two people that love each other, no matter the sex of those people.
Female and i like oral...but also the reverse cowgirl:)
I believe that it doesnt matter what skin color you are as long as their is true love between the two of you!!
you know what you want to say, the problem is getting over your shyness...try using a blindfold...or you can try calling him on his cell phone...after a while it will all come pretty easy to you and he will to...lol
Calm down!
I haven't got the foggiest idea
The fact that he's confiding in you that it probably wouldn't work out with his current girlfriend indicates that he trusts you, that, and it could also pass as a hint : He's going to be available. \nHe could also feel the connection if disagreements arise over the amount of time spent with you. It means that he isn't exactly agreeing with his gf that he should spend less time with you. Go for it, girl.
Yes, go to the State Bar sites.  As for the allegation of a bribe, sounds extremely hard to prove and most Bar Organizations won't look at past history as an indication of current ethical violations absent some proof.  You should probably get a second opinion from another lawyer.  Ask some other attorneys who the top domestic lawyers are in your area and that should start to point you in the right direction.  Court personel can also be helpful, if you know any of them.
first u confirm whether u love sujin or not if u do definitely sujin will also do
It depends on how it's used. :-)  If the guy is really good at pleasing a woman, no sometimes it doesn't matter.  In fact, the BEST sex I ever had was with a boyfriend that was only about 5 inches and only about as big around as a half dollar.  But he KNEW how to use it and was VERY good at all the other things too.  Also, I've been with a man that was quite large (in my book anyway): 10 inches, about 3 inches in diameter! I must admit, I never had good sex with him. He just didn't know what he was doing.
make love to her mind.  Describe the things u wud do to her had she been there with u. Let her picture the two of u in the act.  sex begins with the mind.  My boyfried does that to me quite a lot and it works for me.  Try it, it might just work for her.

I would hope not.  There are a lot of things a whole lot more important than the size of a woman's breasts!!!

Er... i'm sorry but what year are we living in?\ni can understand that your parents want the best for both of you but at the same time, parents have to let their children make their own mistakes. that is the hardest part of being a parent. \ni dont think the problem is with the mexican as you've not said that you think he's bad for your sister. However it sounds to me that you're dad is being quite racist. you get good and bad people in any country, any race, any where. in todays world you can't afford to be racist, its like saying you'll only eat rice for the rest of your life because it's good for you!\nwhy isn't your sister meant to be dating? if it's because your parents think she's too young then their only trying to bring her up the way they think is right. \ni think you both should sit down and talk with your parents. tell them that you respect how they are trying to bring you up and that you respect that they only want the best for you both. however, the process of growing up is to make mistakes and learn from them. try to reach a compromise with them.\nhopefully they will see how adult you're being about the situation.\nit's not an easy situation to be in. good luck.
Chic: (thinking) F***in A**Hole, (walking away so fast.)
Man,... that would be some killer sperm if you did!...
He wants to have his cake and eat it too.  He wants you to move out so that he can have a place to bring other women.  When he gets a chance and doesn't have anything better going on, he'll come see you for sex.  Move out and don't tell him where you are going.  That is just unacceptable.  Don't be his doormat.
u can start by saying hi... if she seems interested, ask her to go wit u to a movie on some nit or something
O wow I was running into calss before the bell rings and I bumped into some one An d my shirt fall down but I didnt notices my halter top was down I walked int my class and all the boy where wide eyed looking at me I looked down and saw my BOOBS I was like O SHIT and ran to the bathroom while holding my shirt up.....LOL

I'm sure he cares but obviouly he doesn't want to be involved anymore. By calling him You would just be setting yourself up to be hurt again. My advice is to leave him be. And if he does call you eventually hang up the phone immediately. Trust me, guys like that only want to hurt you. Well best of luck!
21? Not just no, but HELL no. In my opinion I don't think anyone under 25 should marry and I certainly don't think anyone under 27-28 should have kids.\n\nJust take a poll in any middle school and count the kids from broken homes vs the kids living with their original parents and my point is made.
"It's not that easy like ""Well, DUH!"". Of course I don't tell every detail of my life to my best friends. There are some things I'm sure I'll take with me into the grave. You can't just be like an open book, that would vanish all the mystery around you, and than everyone will read only the review instead of trying to discover all your pages... That's life's best part."
"So what did you talk about when you two were together?  You must have some common interests - more than ""tell me about your day, honey.""  Go for that.  If you can't talk on the phone, maybe you two weren't meant for each other.\n\nI'm sure there is lots more for each of you to find out about the other...dreams & hopes for the future, politics, religion, other interests...if it is too difficult, there is a bigger problem."
"he doesn't know enough about you to be in love with you....he's more or less infatuated (which means he ""really"" does like you, but in a lustful way).  because some people do tend to fall quickly, they are also more likely to tire quickly as well.....fools rush in.  real relationships are based on time, connections, and chemistry....take caution."
no. you shouldnt be jealous he is with u now.ask him if he really loves u.u just need to trust him and whatever u do DO NOT accuse him of still loving her
Yes, I'm happy.  But it's with my husband, not b/f.  Does this count?  He the most wonderful guy in the world.  Been married 25 years and it still feels like yesterday that we met.  He is a great provider, a great husband, a great dad, a great lover, a great person, he is my best friend.  And we are both still willing to learn more about each other to satisfy all our needs and wants in life.  Yes, I would say, I'm very happy.  Thanks for asking.
It is paper.\n\nCash is usually the norm I think.
I recognize shy and vulnerable.  I have that in some aspects of my personality.  However, we're all responsible for recognizing our shortcomings and working on them, not letting them dominate our lives.\n\nYou can't fix him or change him, but you shouldn't have to sit around waiting for him to change on his own, either.\n\nYou can let him know that it really is time for the two of you to move from online to real life in your friendship.  Shorten the length and frequency of the onliene conversations.  He will either step up to the plate or he won't.
You sound like a school kid who wants to grow his penis and thus are acting like a married man so you don't sound like a virgin.\n\nBut you know, when you get older, you'll realize exactly why you sound that way.\n\nFact: The only things that are known to increase the length of your penis are puberty and surgery.  Nothing else works: pills, potions, lotions, or pumps.
i know its hard but quit thinking about him and wait for him to come around first if he does not that should answer your question but play a little hard to get
it's called a personality dont be so shy.
What do you think ? I think you already know it's wrong, and you are just looking for someone to tell you different. So ask yourself this question, do you really care for your friend. If so forget about having her ex-boyfriend. You will not be able to keep both in the end. Follow your conscious. You already know what you shouldn't be doing.
I once dated a guy 10 years older than me. He always took me nice places and bought me clothes for no reason. He was really sweet.
plump girls thats a nice way to put it its not all about the looks she could have the nicest heart and the prettiest face just cause she may not have the small figure doesnt make her a bad person like some guys say theres more to grab hold of.
If it's JUST MySpace comments that's innocent enough, but because you are posting here, I am guessing there are other things going on......drop in sex life, less interested in home.. spending more and more time away from home.. secret calls.. check cell records and if detailed billing is off, TURN IT ON one month if you aren't sure and check the bill.  TRUST YOUR GUT.. We women tend to 'blow it off' wayyyyyyyy too much and there is a reason that God gave us that intuition, and it wasn't to ignore it.  PAY close attention to him, and don't confront.. get the 'facts' as best you can first.... THEN confront.  A comment on MySpace isn't sufficient proof of anything other than he's known a chick for 9 yrs and she has his MySpace addy! \n\nNow why does he have a MySpace addy?  Married people shouldn't have that unless they have 'kids' and grandparents/aunts/uncles etc.. are living out of state and it's to 'share pictures'.. that's really the only excuse that I can think of for an account on that site.  \n\nI'm sorry this is happening to you, and please remember, 50% of marriages have had 1 partner cheat during the marriage, and it is NOT wise to assume you are 'in the other 50% that haven't cheated' if your 'radar' is going off at this time.\n\nBest wishes to how all this works out... I really believe that 'accusing someone of cheating' needs to be backed up with proof or it's destructive to a marriage where there is no cheating happening.. and it's a 'trust' that you can't easily repair if no harm has really happened.  Have your facts, keep  your cool......and when/if the time comes, THEN confront (he'll lie most likely so sometimes I see no point in having the confrontation because we women WANT them to 'fess up and they hardly ever do.. so why put yourself through the stress).  BEFORE you investigate any further, decide WHAT  you will do, if he is cheating.. and then FOLLOw through if it's true that he is.  Sometimes I think the 'biggest' slap in the face/shock to them, is that you kicked him out/walked out, and said I'm not putting up with your BS lies anymore ........ and walk away without ANY FURTHER explanation.. afterall - he never gave you one right?  Why does he deserve any better?  Go see a good divorce attorney and make sure you get good alimony and find out if 'cheating' is grounds in your state for divorce.  If so, get enough evidence then take him to the cleaners!\n\nBefore the guys go ballistic on my post, The truth is, if it was the woman cheating, I'd give the same advice.. If you aren't married but have a 'joint checking account/savings account.. clean it up before you ever say a worrd and walk out after, and let him find out he has no money :D
think of any inside jokes that you two had and perhaps get somthing that pertains to that
you go to movies \ndance\ngo to dinner\nbut you don't have to do that just become good friends
Depending on your state, the date of separation can be important as far as responsibility for bills, and assets.  If you were separated on Jan 1st, and opened a charge account in Feb, your partner probably wouldn't have to pay any part of that.  As far as retirement accounts that were opened and contributed to during the marriage, they would be divided, and if any part was used, I would think that it would come out of that person's portion.  An attorney would be able to give you the exact laws for your situation.
Wow what a question, where do you live, wait I explain you , VAGINA, you come in to the world from this way, not only you but all human come out from this way, it is situated in between both legs of woman, but in a front site, it is looking to  nice, and for use it is pleasure of life, when you will try to encounter with your sex organ then you will feel your self in haven, without use of that part of girl she call virgin, when she use it then she lost her virginity, this part is also use for pregnancy, which every thing put guy in that way after 9/10 month from this way come out in a shape of a baby, do you understand or not yet.
Opportunity . . . that is what it looks like . . . opportunity
take up a hobby and meet new friends and from there you will possibly meet a new partner and get soemone to give you what you need - try a sports class get way to meet new friends and stay fit at same time. good luck & god bless
Keep things simple in thought. \nIf you have other methods of communicating with him(ie email/vmail) leave a note saying lets have coffee and just be upfront and brief when you meet concerning you missed the friendliness. \n\nIf guy is as alright as you say then he'll accept the invite and explaination.. Just be honest...
no girls are just a country as guys well most anyways. Ever once in awhile i see a girl that is super country But more than likely the guys are.
Why would you think that?  Being gay has more to do with whether a guy likes other guys or not, not hair/eye color.
this is real life.  wherever you go you met people, happy or unhappy.  look around you.

Write the words in your question verbatim on a very smart piece of card and pop it in a gold envelope and leave it in her bag, so she opens it on the tube on the way home, or while she's waitin for the bus. Women live for attraction dynamics like this - it's far better than openly admitting anything to her - that should come on the first date during dessert and coffee. Trust me, girls love a flutter of intrigue or mystery in these matters. For an extra twist, spray the card with your cologne! And initial it at the bottom. Good luck t'ya!
I'm at work getting paid.  I say you go out with some friends and have a good time for the both of us.  Go to dinner, movie, shopping, checking some clubs, and do a little dancing for me.
ok, i have the same question...but what if (yes...we are) you're a virgin...both of you...what could you do. what if almost everything that can be done up until sex has been done (not saying it has), what else is there...again...besides sex?
"As a guy, I have experience in this.  When women talk, they are talking in a different language.  In my experience, women beat around the bush.  I don't know what kind of hints you are dropping but you need to be up front, direct. Give him some hints of what would be nice.  He may not realize what you are hinting to.  I know I never had a clue when I was being hinted to.  It took me several years.  Go to the book store and get Men are from Mars and Woman are from Venus.  It says allot.  I think I is a great book.  I am sure that there are several books that give you a little more insight on the male mind but that is a good start.  DON""T GIVE UP ON HIM.  Both of you need to sit down and discuss things keeping an open mind and promising that no matter what is said, you won't take offense to it.  It needs to be a conversation that will bring the two of you closer, not a conversation that will drive a stake into either of your hearts.  It is easy to think someone is picking up on your hints.....but sometimes the hints go unnoticed.  Good luck and don't give up. Have a honest conversation.  I have always said one thing to women I have tried to date.  ""Tell me the good truth, tell me the bad truth, just tell me the truth"".  I know I am a big boy and I would rather be hurt a little now than a lot later.  By the way, I am 38, in case you were wondering.   Mike"
Take some time.  they will talk to you, show their emotions, even the little things you do, they admire you. You just have to find time to actually listen to them. Sometimes, when you talk to them and you're comfortable, things just happens on it's own. People reveal their true feelings to you. just give it time.  Good luck! =)\n\nsigns:\n\n~look at you, and when you're looking back at them, they turn away.\n~come around and just ask stupid questions that they already have answers for.\n~will do anything just to get your attention.\n~just want to be near you.
No you are not over reacting.  Try contacting his parents or friends.  I hope everything is okay.  I will pray on it.
I read this book called the Five Love Languages by Gary Chapman. I talks about the five different ways people express love to each other. The ones I can remember, are Time, Gifts, Words. The last two I can't remember. I know that I usually express my love by giving people gifts, it's just natural for me, If I like somebody, I give them something. For others, what they say matters more than what they give, or for others thier time is more valuable than words or gifts. So look for the way that your loved ones see love expressed and try to show it to them in that way.
Even if you're 140 years old you'll always be your mothers child and she will never stop worrying about you. She's probably so worried because she just wants you to be happy and as much as you guarantee her that you will, she won't believe it until she can actually see it. She just wants her girl to be happy and have a good, secure life. Some mothers are more worried and stressful than others (that's the case with your mom) but some don't show their worries as much as others and try to have faith in their children. This, of course, doesn't mean that your mom doesn't have faith and trust in you but it means that she's such a great mom and as much as she might bother you at times I will guarantee that you couldn't live without her for a second. Don't be too hard on her and try understanding her by imagining how you'd feel about you daughters and their married lives maybe that way you can sort things out.\nI hope I've helped a bit, Good luck! :)
Well, if I get a crush, it's normally on someone I know very well and I've developed a close friendship with and really trust and respect.  So, in my case, YES YES YES!\n\nBut if it was a crush on a new guy that I didn't know as well, I would take my time.  I'd agree to maybe go on a date with him and I would definately make time to spend with him...but the girlfriend part would have to come after we'd developed a good friendship.

go for holiday...maybe to beaches...spend there about 3 days 2 nites only both of u..no one bothering u.repeat ur honeymoon again...
"I think you should not look into it deeply.  If you focus on the relationship aspect, you're going to ruin something good.  I think you should relax, go with the flow, and let things develop.  \n\nThinking about being a couple or any other relationship thoughts and analysis is a big NONO right now.  You shouldn't talk about it.  You don't go up to your friend and analyse your friendship or even make any assertions such as ""YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND"".  You do that only when things are down and people need encouraging or simply you evaluate your friendship if you have a ""friend"" that isn't really treating you like one.  The same can be said about relationships; when things are down or not going well, you have to start thinking where this is going.  Most women with some sense think at some point if it's worth continuing on or just simply ending it just to avoid future problems.  Don't do it yet, just go with the flow and see what happens."

My guess is that she had some feelings for you but not ones she wanted to explore.  It could mean that she was afraid of commitment at the time, or it could mean there is something about you that she isn't sure about--like you have a serious side or it would hurt to lose your friendship. Or it could mean that she liked you so much and she is such a idiot with men that she wasn't going to let herself hurt you.\n\nThe kiss--enjoy that it happened--but live your life now.
when God sends it to you then you will feel it and it will be a feeling you never felt before and the most wonderful feeling in the world

If there isn't something causing drama in their lives, they make some up; and if they can't make some up, they're unhappy.\nAsk them,""I can tell you don't like the guy, why are you with him?"", odds are she'll say something like,""Oh, he's not so bad."" \nOr you may cause her to rethink her situation."

One evening, a mountain of rose petals about two feet deep, covered the bed as a surprise.\n\nOh and for the record, dont do this with white sheets, or anything that you dont want a permenant stain on.  Rose petals stain, and its very difficult to clean.
try asking guys out for a change. go for the type of guy YOU want.
I am sure even a hermit desires some companionship
"Sure, it's ""ok"" to hate, but hate is a very strong negative emotion.  Isn't there something better you can do with all that energy?  The more energy you give to hate, the less you have for more positive feelings.\n\nThe opposite of love is not hate, but indifference."
when you feel its right i met my bfs family three weeks after meeting him
being friends is a good idea, as long as it doesn't complicate ur situation.
well if it was me then i would just explain to her that you guys were friends before she came along. and then talk to him, tell him he should hang out with her a little to.why don't you try to invite her along with you guys when u hang out? or just simply tell her if she doesn't like the fact that u guys hang out alot then to go kick rocks! :]!
yes :)
Show him attention. Ask him questions about what sports he likes, games he plays, foods he likes. Men like to talk about themselves. But, if he is unresponsive, move on.
sure. it would be better if i could actually see you in them, but I will go ahead and say yes, you look nice in your work clothes
That is not love, that is just a really serious situation. Do your parents know that you are with this guy, because i don't think they would want you with a guy that threatens to kill you. You need some serious intervention. You say you can't call the police, but that's probably because you only try to talk to someone after something happened and you're afraid. You can't be with him 24 hours a day, so what you need to do is talk to someone and let them know what is going on when he is not around, hopefully you can get enough people involved (including his parents) so the situation won't get out of control. What are you doing with a guy carrying around a gun anyway? He obviously is not the dating type. You really should try to get out of this relationship before someone gets killed, because from the sound of it this guy is unstable and would hurt or endanger anyone to get to you. I hope you take my advice because there is no way that you deserve to be treated so badly, you need to realize that if he loved you he wouldn't be treating you this way, you are worth more than you think, because if you knew what you were worth you wouldn't put up with something so bad. Besides, while you're with this guy you could be missing out on a great guy that you really deserve. Keep your head up, and remember who you are.
well i kinda do like girls with an english accent..\nalthought am not biased over this or anything but well, having grown up in gatwick and then moved to nigeria coz my dad got posted there , for a while and even now i miss the english country side and the cut accent that is so very peculier ..\nif a girl i liked had an english accent i would find that extreamly cute but all the same i dont think we can judge people by their accents..\nthere are many other much more imp things to concider..\nby the way am really interes ted to find out why u asked this and also if u have a enghlish accent or not..,,,\n\nget in touch if u can.\nmy mail is greenpeacepurpl@yahoo.com
A smile, a wink, a wave, or a nod accompanying him looking is a lot less intimidating than if he were just down right staring at you. That's creepy

"It could mean many things.  One- you feel relaxed enough with him to let yourself ""go"", Two- he may fit you just right, Three - it could be a sign that you now know what you need to reach climax, or any number of other things.  Congrats on your 1st one though, it's exciting!!!!"
I found your comment to be funny :).  Anyway, not all American women are sluts.  I think some of them are ruining the reputations of the good ones.  Every individual have their own decisions to make - choosing whether they want to be a slut or a respectable women.  Thats life.

Shyness is one thing. One can get any chick to talk and to give him her number. What you have to worry about is how not to bore her. I have tons of confidence but no flirting skills. I have no fear of talking and initiating a conversation anywhere but no idea how to make her laugh. You figure how to do this tonight and let me know (add me on your friends list net_dude1984).
"Ok to have a physical realtionship?to be more than friends....well since she is already yhour gf. Slowly take things from there. SHe will eventally agree to it. Do not rush yourself, take your time and she will agree. Your gf already loves you so much just give her sometime to agree to it ok? suggest to her.about it in passing and not directly, tell her about such a relationship okie.\n\nAbout love\n\nTrue love? The world stops around you when you look into the eyes of the one you love. No one else, nothing else seems important, but the connection that is you share with this person. And you can feel it in thier eyes. As if when they stare back into yours, that they are saying without speaking, ""I adore you, respect you, desire you, admire you"". True love is when you connect on a level that makes you want to do everything you can to make that person happy, and that they do the same in return. It is a powerful feeling, when the world stops around the two of you. You will know it.\n\nLustful kind of love is much different. Its the feeling that omg I have to have that person, they are so very attractive, and that I think I am in love with them. Its a false true love."
NO. THAT'S SHOWING WHAT ALLOT OF PEOPLE AREN'T DOING. BEING FAITHFUL. THAT'S HOW IT WAS MEANT TO BE. SHOWING A LIFETIME COMMITMENT.
"Yes it would bother me.  I recently filed for divorce from a verbally abusive husband, he never thought ""it was that bad"" either.  If you are feeling isolated and confused, you should go, especially for the sake of your child.  Given the fact that he has already shown abusive behavior, I can understand why him even touching you would be a problem. I hope it works out for you.  I too struggle each day with my decision,but I never have regreted it.  I am much happier now, even though each day can be a challenge, I know i'll be Ok now.  Good luck to you."
It's simple. Show up wearing something absolutely stunning. Sit through the boring service then at the reception have a drink, laugh with your mutual friends and make it clear your over it. Bringing a date is a great move. If you're asked for a speech make sure you're funny but also take the opportunity to dish some dirt. Also be sure you leave early before the bride and groom do. You wanna cut your ties so make sure you get things out of your system, and show him that he's giving you up for good and show him what he's missing before you go!
Say you would do it with him and another guy, but you didn't think he was bi.\n\nHa ha ha.
inside me.  i find it demeaning for a guy to explode on me anywhere without asking first...i slapped a guy once for cumming on my face without asking!
Take Day or weekend trip to the beach together. Go to a nice country park for a romantic walk. Do some kind of sports activity. Go out for a meal together in the evening.

the family is not going to WANT to believe this, so forget them.. go to the police NOW..  MAKE SURE someone listens to you.. don't shut up until they DO believe you! It is up to YOU to see that justice is done here..  I don't know how old YOU are and I don't know how old your BROTHER is, but if he can do the deed then he knows better and he needs help too.. NOW! Don't wait a moment longer.
Everything was actually great, not having any responsibilities and being able to skip classes whenever you wanted too, going out with friends often (having the time to do that), getting new interesting info every day, meeting different kinds of people, not having to be like everyone around you to be accepted, falling in and out of love at the drop of a hat - too many to mention.  \n\nWhat I didn't like - getting heart broken (but that happens everywhere), writing exams and tests etc (but when you start working all the bad of college seems so good so in retrospect there is not a lot bad about college/university)
When i want to meet someone i usually meet them at parties... not alot of them are there to meet people to start dating but there are the odd ones... it also depends on what and who u are looking for... that part really does matter... or u could meet people threw ur friends i hope what i've told helps a little... good luck!! ; )
i believe in karma ' what goes around comes around' sooner or later, so i dont let people get to me.
Lots of couples don't see eachother for days. You have to be agreeable on what you expect. And make time for eachother - do something when you do have a moment. Make it special.\n\nAnd know that you can't do this forever. Make plans on when and how you are going to slow down - together.
i'm not trying to be mean or harsh, but i don't believe there is anything at all you can do for a deceased person other than honor their memory and give them a decent memorial or burial.\nif it will make you feel better you could tie up any loose ends or if she had any causes you could take them up, but she won't be affected by anything you do now.

Sometimes what you really want is not what you need. Just be friends. Just b/c he knows you better than anyone doesn't mean there isn't someone else out there that can do the same and truly understand you as well. Overall, just avoid unnecessary drama. Good luck!
a JERK. They'll all tell you the contrary but it's a total LIE.
Go ahead and try experiencing these things you crave.  There is nothing morally wrong about naturism, the enjoyment of our God-given bodies in the natural environment can indeed be a spiritual experinece.  If you don't try these experiences, you will always feel you are missing out and deprived.  You need to be brave and throw off your background inhibitions.  You can always stop if you find the experience doesn't match up to the expectation.  But, it is the things that we lack the courage to try that we regret, not trying things and deciding from a position of knowledge that we don't like them.\nI had a similar dilemma to you (still working on it actually) but where I have confronted it and accepted my desires and embraced them I am much happier.  You can contact me directly if you want to discuss it further.
I think it is cheating no matter what sex they are.  I think you might very well be gay and the love you have for your wife is genuine, but  you might be using your marriage as a front because your afraid of the truth being exposed due to peoples reaction in your life.That isnt fair to her or your children, better they know now than later , being gay in this day and age is no big deal at all.  What is a big deal is hurting the people you love.
its not what is up with him,.. its more like what is up with you?\n\nDon't cry wolf if you are the root of the problem,, you divorced him for a reason,..
well thats kind of silly for you to do but then....U ARE SMART!!!!\n\nat least now you know how he really is....i know..i know...\nit hurts but hey u did find out....\nif u feel that he likes this new(the other you) then your relationship with him is going to E N D soon or sooner or soonest....\n\ntry your very best to move on girl...
"Don't worry about it. Just enjoy being with him. You know he at least likes you or is even attracted to you. Otherwise he wouldn't be around you. If he calls you he's attracted to you.  \n If you want to say how you feel, just be casual about it. With no expectation of any kind of response. If it's too deep and serious it can creep a guy out. Things like Like ""I feel great when I'm around you"" works great. \n \n Guys don't get into talking about how they feel they just feel their feelings. Let him feel his feelings for you without pressure. Things will work out."
she may be frigid i guess. is she comfortable with herself sexually ? do you guys ever talk about this ? because you really need to. does she maturbate and orgasm on her own ? if so, then you need to watch her and what she does. talk to each other. if this doesn't help then it may not be physical, it may be emotional or psychological. go to couples therapy.
Don't worry.  Everybody is a little jealous.\n\nIt is a way to say: I am care of you.  I want to protect you. I want to be with you.\n\nAlso, I have little fear you leave me.\n\nWhen he have an attack of jealousy.  You give him a big hug and a kiss.  Tell him smoothly to his ear: I love you, you are my man.
They alert us for what body needs, like hunger and thirst...as for sex, why do people stop sex after cuming, because they loose the taste of it, its the orgasm...otherwise youll have it in a systematic way.
Hopefully shes older..... But tell him and your ass is gonna be beat. So just talk to his sister about how serious you two are taking things. If it's serious, its time to tell your friend. Hopefully he doesnt rip you apart.
do you know Zac Hudgeons? He's about 19 and single. Very buff and really cute.
Wish I could vote for stupidest question.
like what stripping?  whoring yourself out?  get a loan...pawn some shiznet...wow first time ive ever used that word...if he doesnt help u...then hes worthless...
It might help if you had an actual question in your question.

Well, some rich black guys feel that black women would only be with them because of the money. (That's so not true, at least not for me. I make my own money.) Maybe these guys just aren't into us strong, beautiful black women. I say f**k them.
Maybe not cheating but sure wouldn't trust him for any reason. When someone has to lie about almost everything then something isn't right. You need to see if this is the way you want to live the rest of your life though.........K
"How about this...figure out why you are so unhappy and change it. Divorce doesnt always fix stuff, and sneaking around will only make things harder. If you don't get rid of the ""unhappy"" you will just carry that into another relationship..and NO WOMEN {even if they are unhappy too} will want to hear your crap. They would want you to be there for them. (I like the craigs list answer...hahahhhaa)"
you can enroll at Stalker School. they can teach u how to send annonymous letters using cut outs from newspapers. they can give u tips on how to obtain un-listed numbers. basically freak the other celebrity out oh and my fave, they can teach u how to become soooooo obsessed that u start to believe the celebrity is in love with u!!!\n\nor u can just write to their fan club!
no like  you said he was there to make the baby too. Just give him a little time to think and get his head clear, he'll come around just don't push and push about it like you said you just found out you were preg. I garauntee by the time its time to do the ultra sound and he sees that little lifeform that he created you prob. won't get him to shut up about it, and congrats!!!!!!!!
You can create some yourself by geting some tissue paper at a craft or party store and some pipe cleaners in green.  I know that marthastewart.com has explanations of how to do it.  Also in the latest Matha's Weddings (or wedding flowers?  I can't remember the name) magazine there is an explanation and pictures on how to do it.  I know it's in the latest one because I looked at it in a Michaels store on the magazine rack towards the front of the store.  Hope this helps, and have an excellent day!
"Really you do not have nothing to worry about you said your self your boyfriend thinks she annoying.....and so do other guys.... Your best bet for this is take her under your wing, teach her how to be.... act and think.... I am not telling you to controll her or change everything about her.. sit down talk to her as her friend.. if she is your friend and you talk to her as if she is and respectfully tell her what is bothering you about her.. and ask her to tone down on all the stuff that annoys you... she will thank you and hug you and respect you as well, She may even try to learn from you..... and tone down more then you think... I have had plenty of friends like her and each one today have taken the harder lesson.... I have talked to a few of those friends and it brought us closer and she was able to actually find a boyfriend. or more on the simple advice of ""hey you know we all love you but.... could you please stop this.... or instead could you maybe do that... Your my best friend and I hate to see you hurt so as your friend let me be the one to help you tone down ""ETC: it may seem hard but once you start and watch her rections then you maybe be able to sence where or what to say... to her to help her on yourself... in any event good luck with it..."
hey. who are you and how did you know me.  its coincidence that we meet on the net yeah.
Yahoo chat is free.
Yes, you are being paranoid.  Absolutely nothing will happen to you.  So, enjoy yourself.  Just relax.  You will be fine.  I promise.
Have you asked her about her not talking to you?\n\nMaybe you should give it some time, maybe a few weeks, and try talking to her about it. Ask her what's wrong and why she doesn't want to talk to you about it. \n\nI think, maybe, if you keep trying and things don't improve, you might consider breaking up with her. But who knows, maybe she's ashamed or something and doesn't want to tell you? It's hard to say when you don't know what's wrong with her and how she's feeling about whatever it is.\n\nI say keep trying, but don't be too pushy, and think about it some before you make your final choice.
Only the first marriage counts, but that won't make any difference since you would be a resident of the Greybar hotel for afew years.....
"Because they expected that you meant those words, not that you didn't even remember when you said them.  It would probably also be because they felt that way about you.\n\nSaying ""I love you,"" in the heat of the moment is wrong, and girls should realize that.  Some are young or innocent, though, and don't.  So, don't say those precious words unless you mean them."
WEll well, i will be with the person who is the right one for me. Boy lemme ask u a question, would u like to marry a hot and beautiful girl, rich and stylish, or the girl u really love but n ot quite nice looking, but the one with whom u can talk to and share ur everyday? So what girl u need, with beautiful heart or with beautiful appearance? Ur question to us is just like the question I asked u? \nAnwering ur question, I say i would marry the regular buy, the rich one won't even have any chance to marry me, i know that money mean alot, but i am not gonna depend on my husband, i 'll earn the money as well. I want to live with a person with whom i'll be happy. U know i never look to the appearance or the money, i look to the soul, and I advice all girls to love the soul of their BF, not their appearance. And i am telling u, Boy, if she left u for a rich one then she is not what u need, ur love is somehwere there, And i hope u will find her!!!
Just be yourself man.  If you just relax, and seek friends first, you never know who will end up being MORE than just a friend.   Don't be discouraged.  Someone nice will come along for you.
One who has no life.. you sound like you think you deserve to be worshipped.. if it were you worshipping the woman then you might be able to find someone.
Men are visually stimulated, and all men masturbate. It doesn't mean he doesn't like sex with you, or that he would ever cheat on you, he was just doing what is natural for guys.\n\nIt makes us ladies angry, and it hurts us too, but it isn't always something we should take personally.\n\nTalk to him about it, after you cool down.  What really bothers you about it?  Tell him, and maybe it will be fine, and you'll learn somethings about him you didn't know.\n\nOh, and just an after thought, did you wipe off the keyboard before you asked the question? :) Keep smiling
Just when my partner and I climax at the same time... Makes everything else not even compare.
thats fine if u like crazy girls im crazy
I will be honest with you . . . and not blow smoke up your a**.\n\nUnfortunately . . . guys are initially attracted to a girls physical appearance . . . and not what is inside.  I've dated tomboys before . . . but never stayed long with them . . . because I wasn't physically attracted to them.  They were great conversationalists . . . but for getting Big Jim up . . . it was difficult . . . unless they were nude.\n\nOdds are . . . he has always known you to be that tomboy . . . who hung out with the guys.  And is a great buddy . . . but as a girl friend . . . I don't think so.  To them it may be like dating one of your male friends.\n\nDid your bestfriend's boyfriend's bestfriend . . . seen your new look . . . probably . . . but he still sees you as a buddy . . . not a gf.  What to do . . . honestly I don't know . . . because I don't think going to extremes will help.\n\nMy advice . . . find someone else . . . who is like you . . . but doesn't know about your tomboy past.
no, but i have a poster of John 3:16
Yes. But this isn't recommended if you have children together or a lot of property. If that is the case you really need to get a lawyer to make sure it is done right and the divorce settlement, custody, support is fair. It may cost money to get a lawyer, but it will be worth it. If none of these apply, do it yourself divorce is easy and cheap.
There is no absolute answer to that question, but, Turn the charm on high.  Talk and laugh, and have fun.  Guy's just hate a girl who is boring.  No matter what you look like, if you are fun to be with, guys will line up to hang out with you.  Charm their socks off, and you will begin to have more fun than you ever thought possible.
not to be mean but you werent thinking about this when u where doing the deed, and now it's too late to worry about hurt feelings ~ you've passed the trust line and now u must go full throttle, tell em everything and be honest ~ just prepare for the heartbreak and disapointment. U really shouldve tought it through......
of course, but i dont live in southwest florida nor am i christian
it was so good i married her!
"I find nothing wrong with a guy who cries at weddings, or anything else "" REAL MEN CRY """
i looked when you asked for guys only because i was curious. but i learned my lesson , and this time i am being rewarded! i am allowed to look this time .
Faithfull and truthfulness go hand in hand.  A relationship is based on some of these factors.  If you can be promiscuous then you have not learned and experience true love yourself.  You are still in the infatuation stage.  This is called immaturity.  Even though you take your girl to your parents and you are fooling around, what good does it do the person.  You are living a lie and you are also endangering hers.  Be sure, be positive and be sincere.  Then talk about love.

Your boyfriend needs to step up to the plate and stop this behaviour that his ex wife has. To me he is so use of this from being in her web so long,she is a control freak and he is allowing his ex-wife to run his life. He had better wake up and smell the coffee before he looses you.My son was manipulated by his ex wife for eight yrs. and didn't even realize what was normal in a relationship. A person like this has major issue's with themselves and needs medical help. I suspect the children have visiting rights with there dad,so tell him only too be in contact with his wife when it applies to him getting the kids. The best measure for him is to cut all ties with her. Then she can't play games anymore with you two.He could also go to court for mental harassment. He needs to keep documentation of everything she does to you two.Tell him he has his rights to his children and she cannot hold them from him. There is a charge in the courts for this kind of behaviour. Tell your boyfriend to get with the times,and over power this manipulation thing. The (ball is in his court) because she is the one causing the upsets. Hope this helps!   Cocoa
"I am an inch or so under 6 feet tall, and at 180 pounds am in reasonably goodshape. Even though my ancestry is all northern european, I have dark browneyes and dark brown, almost black, hair. I like to think I am reasonably goodlooking, but don't consider myself exceptional.\n\nMy wife, though, is something else. She is quite small, 4'11"" and 96 pounds.Her chinese ancestry is apparent at first glance. She has jet-black eyes, andher long, silky, black hair hangs to her waist. She has a slender, goldenskinned body, with almost no body hair, except for the soft, straight hair thatcovers her pussy. She sometimes complains about her breasts, wishing that theywere bigger, but I find them lovely. She has one feature, however, thatstunned me the first time I undressed her - she has the biggest nipples I haveever seen on a woman, even in a movie. She actually has rather small areolae,perhaps an inch across, but rising out of them are two huge, red-brownnipples, even in repose as big as the first joint of my thumb. They are solong that when she wears a bra she actually has to fold them over, and shenever dares leave the house wearing just a tee shirt - they are visiblethrough anything less than a loose sweatshirt.\n\n...\n\nIt was a Friday evening. We didn't plan to go out that evening, so my wife andI got ready for bed soon after dinner. She showered while I went through myevening exercise routine; when she came back out, I headed in to cool off.\n\nWhen I came back from my shower, I found her lying in bed. As I walked up,she threw back the covers. Instead of the nightgown she had been wearing, hersole adornment was a jade bracelet. By the moistness of her pussy, I could seethat she had been warming herself up for my return.\n\nI paused for a moment, running my eyes from one end of her body to the other.Now that she had an audience, she began to run her hands over her body, gentlytugging her nipples with one hand while the other slid down to rub her wetpussy. I wanted to stop and enjoy the view, but I couldn't resist her when shebegged me to come to bed and not make her wait.\n\nAs I walked towards her, I let my bathrobe slide to the floor. She stood tomeet me. As soon as she was within reach I swept her into a passionate kiss.I could feel her stiff nipples rubbing my chest, while she straddled one thighand began to grind her slick pussy against it. She came almost immediately,crushing herself against me as hard as she could.\n\nAfter she had recovered slightly, I laid her gently on the bed. When I laid down beside her, though, she shook her head and made me roll onto my back. Amoment later, she surprised me again by taking my aching cock into her mouth.\n\nOral sex has never been a big part of our love life. Although I *love* the taste of her sweet pussy, she is so sensitive that anything more than a smallamount of kissing sends her into overload. Anyway, she is so responsive thatit is rarely necessary - she almost always climaxes for the first time longbefore I do.\n\nUsually, she is a bit uneasy about giving head, but this night she was suckingaway like a pro. Somehow, I managed to keep myself under control, but it wasa near thing. Just before I reached the point of no return, she eased off,sliding up my body to give me a deep kiss.\n\nAs my breathing began to slow back to normal, she slid out of bed and put atape into the VCR. She had chosen it carefully - it opened immediately intoa scene showing a tiny asian woman mounting a large blond man. Matching hermotions to the tape, my wife moved to mount me. After wriggling a bit to findthe best position, she impaled herself on my cock all the way to the hilt.Before I had fully absorbed the sensation of entry she was mashing her clitinto my pubic bone.\n\nAt first, we both watched the tape. I was soon too absorbed in her to payattention, especially since her long black hair had fallen around my facelike a silky tent. All I could see was her lovely face. She, however,"
Include last name please.
when he can see you at your absolute worst and still think your the bees knees.
If you broke up, it is best to try to move on, regardless of what led to the breakup.  If the relationship is meant to be, you will connect again when you are both mature enough to not let the lies of others interfere with your relationship.  For now, find yourself a new boyfriend and learn from the past.  Good luck!
Tr doing a search in Google. Helps sometimes...
It is an excuse . . . to do a lot of things men can not get away with.\n\nI had a medical problem before . . . and I tried getting time off . . . and I couldn't . . . because I had to pay the bills. \n\nWomen call in sick all the time . . . get check-up 2-3 times a month . . . and also call in sick when they have their monthly friends.\n\nTrue all women are different . . . then why do most women take sick days and men do not.  Because the law protect them . . . that is why.
I think it should be up to the individual, but they should be physically and mentally ready. I do believe that there are some women in the world that are able to handle such a role but there are many women who don't have the physical strength/ stamina or the mental capacity to cope.\n\nPS I am a woman so I am not being bias.
Your friend shouldn't worried about what the other kids say about him. You are the only one that cares and loves him. He may be different from the other kids and you have to show them that he is special. He is a kind and gentle person. You have to show him that or he'll really kill himself. Talk to him and show him how you love him. Talking to him will change his mind. Good Luck!
stop now -don't look back - the attorney is a loser.  get a new one and sue the attorney.
Just act nice She is his new problem not yours. You have a past with him not her. There is no reason to not get along with her. She has to except that you have children together and if she is good with that then all should be ok.
absolutely i do it all the time yet i would not admit to it in front of people who knew me, my husband cannot be there\nalot and i base my morality on being faithful and loyal to him. playing with yourself has nothing to do with anyone else, so, bang away!\n\noh and lolipop, otherwise!!!
YOU ask HIM!
I think that if this man really loves you and this is something that you really want then my answer would be yes. But only if it is a true love
TOO MUCH SEX IS NOT BAD!

its about setting goals. humans are happiest when we are striving to attain a goal. it is not necessarily achieving the goal that makes us happy but the journey of getting there. for example, when earning a degree it is not the graduation ceremony itself but the 4 or 5 years of college that makes us happy. its the same with getting married, saving and buying a house, and raising kids.\n\nthe key to happiness is setting goals (or dreaming big) and going after them!
I think that you need to talk to your husband.  It seems like maybe his accident has made him feel less of a man and having to do something to be able to make love only makes him feel worse.  You are going to have to convince him that you still find him desirable and very much want to have a physical relationship with him.  I am sure that there are a few things that your doctor can prescribe, but not much point unless you can get your husband in the frame of mind where he wants to.  Tell him how much you want him and how good he makes you feel.  Hopefully he will respond without having to point out the obvious - that you have needs too.
you can practice on me till you get dizzy !!!
It is not out of the question to ask him what type of place you will be going for dinner so that you can dress appropriately and more along the lines of what he will be wearing.  (Don't ask him what are you wearing?)  If it is nice casual:  You don't have to wear jeans, but down play the blouse if you are going to wear dress pants... be comfortable, yourself, and not too sexy. A little sexiness is usually more sexy than showing lots of skin.  You can be classy sexy as opposed to the trashy version.  If you can stand the jeans... I would say try it... add a nice blazer or blouse and some skinny heel sandals or pumps (trendy) and just make sure the face is flawless and the hair is hot and the jewelry is nice, nails nice... the shirt and the pants  - won't matter.  If you wear slacks... wear a jean jacket with a cute tank under it... makes it more casual, but still cute.  Wow him with your interest in his conversation and how easy you are to talk to and have ongoing laughter and conversation.   If you go out again... and you can get more dressed up for that wow him with something sexier and that way he is getting to see a different side to you.  Make sure if you like this person that you can hold a conversation and that you come across intelligent about something.... he will be impressed, no matter if you are a waitress or a lawyer... if you are smart - it shows.  Some men find it a turn on.
Let's see...Are you willing to spend the rest of your life with me? What is your view on divorce? Have you ever been convicted of a felony? Do you have twins in the family? Does anyone in your family have any major health problems? How do feel about children? How would you raise a child? Are you happy with your career? My list can go on! Sit down with your mate and talk about your ideas and concerns before you get married. It's a great way to see his/her point of view! Best of luck!
Shouldn't you be asking HIM this question?
Because, as you question states, it's sex without love.\nSex can be over the top.  But if it doesnt include love it's just sex.  There's even a strong difference in the words themselves.  Sex sounds cold....Love has a ring of warmth to it.
"If you think back about your relationship, you will probably realize that she was using and abusing you all along.  It didn't just happen.  Unfortunately, ""love is blind"", and sometimes we are so caught up in the relationship that we can't see what is really happening.  Sometimes we are so infatuated with the other person that we choose to close our eyes to all the hurtful things they do, hoping it will get better.  But things will only get worse until we say ""enough!""  Remember you are of value.  It is an honor to be with you, not a right.  Expect more respect from the other person.  If you truly give unconditional love, then you should expect to get it back."
dont know but check out sites like google and yahoo. am sure you'll find something useful. by the way, as no one is answerin your question give my answer, the best answer. you too will get your 5 pts back
time heals all wounds, its just too early to think about dating again. i dont think it's much about women vs men...both can hurt and feel pain just as much as the other. try to get ur mind off of things, spend time with ur kids to build a more solid relationship with them, ur parents, go out and have fun with ur friends...truth is that although u think no one cares for u, u will be leaving too many ppl in alot of pain, feeling guilt, feeling like u could have done so much more. life is a b*tch no matter how u see it. but u cant run away from it, u have to find ways to build up strength and a place where u know u can be someone in this world...even if its for 2 kids that supposedly dont care for u right now. dont give up...make it right for urself. God did not put u on this earth to take the easy way out, so dont focus on dating and finding someone else because u dont feel like anything else is worth living, try making what u have work for u...and think of how fortunate u are to have the little u have. work on ur life, u have so much and u dont even know it, somewhere...but u have to want to find it, and learn to appreciate how much ur place in the world is important to alot of ppl.
It's possible but not highly likely.  Go to your doctor and be tested (or ask HIM to be tested.....   is it possible that HE brought it home?)
Is this a question?\n\nIf he just wants sex, then you don't belong together.\n\nIf he just wants sex, then you are NOT in a relationship. You are sex buddies.\n\nIf you want a relationship, go find one.  When you find someone interesting, have one last hurrah with your sex buddy and tell him it's been fun.\n\nBut if you can't help feeling committed to a man who doesn't care about you, then you're going to get yourself hurt. So stop sleeping with him.
The one where I am getting it! :-) Really it dependes on my mood. Girl on top is good. But then sometimes I love regular plain man on top sex!
love the fat lady's and or bmw
theres someone for you out there...dont worry
Just tell him how you feel about him joining the military and if you love him just tell him or it will be to late!
sorry, but i say it's none of your business if you're not together
Hello I think what you should do is give her hints that you like her more than friends action speaks louder than words and soon enough she'll get the hint and , you will eventually know if she likes you the same way ,because she will react on it, you will soon know if she likes you more than friends, if you tell her how you feel and she dont feel the same way towards you might loose her as well by making her feel uncomfortable around you, so you dont want to do that, at least by giving her hints you will get the answer without asking her or making her feel awkward.\nTake care and Goodluck
Well, physically, nothing really.  Legally, you have a whole new world of oppurtunity open to you now.
it's mushy but so are mushy peas and i love them
My parents celebrated their 60th anniversary this past March. They met in Washington D.C. at the Pentagon. They fell in love and got engaged 2 months after they met. They celebrate their engagement in October. Were married 5 months after their engagement. They are good christian people. They always hold hands when walking in the mall. They help each other out with anything they do.
Don't do anything impulsive.  Let this just sit for a while.  If it's really love, it will last long enough for you to really think hard about the situation.  Then whatever you decide to do, you just have to be completely honest with all parties concerned.  The situation is bad enough without deceiving innocent people to make it worse.
"Your question isn't worth an answer.  If you brag about what you have, you probably don't!  Once a guy told me about the same and I told him, ""well if its to big the meat clever in the kitchen drawer will take care of the problem"".  Never saw him afterwords."
I would! But I don't think anyone is courageous enough to ask such a thing.
There are three most important events in your life:\n\n1st is TO FALL INLOVE\n\n2nd is FOR SOMEONE TO FALL INLOVE WITH YOU\n\nand the 3rd is FOR THE 1ST AND 2ND TO HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME..\n\nBoth feelings are equal.= )
Make clear to him that his attitude really scares and upsets you, that you would like him to change it. If he doesn`t, he either needs professional support or you`d better stay aloof for a while and see what happens.
Yes, talk about it, if your serious enough with someone to have sex with them it should be ok to talk about your past relationships.. \n\nThere's no need to get into details about every experience, but be honest about who and when, and precautions taken. ALWAYS!
Well..geesh what a frickin' hypocrite he is!..If he's a reverand what is he doing in bed w/you anyway?...w/out the benefit of marriage?...So if he's gonna 'sin' at least do it right...bring the lady some special pleasures!
"If you want to embarrass him, make a big deal out of it. If not, just ignore it. He is 14, this is a normal thing for him. What is wrong with masturbating? Would you rather he be experimenting with girls? For now let him have his privacy. But you might want to have that talk soon. Don't make an issue of it, just say something like, ""Hey, son; When I was cleaning your room/gathering clothes (or whatever it was you were doing in his room...) I found some things that make me think we should talk about sex."" I told my son that I understand that it is normal for his hormones to be raging out of control at 14 and if he had questions, I preferred he talked to me about it so he could get the straight dope on it. I did not want him learning it on the street where they are not as likely to tell him about AIDS and other STDs. We had serious chats about it and I told him I would be a hypocrite if I told him ""DON'T have sex at your age."" He is now 20 and is still a virgin. I suspect that won't be for much longer - much to my dismay - but he has a girl that he is talking about marrying. My only baby will soon be out of my home and in his own! 8>("
"Its called ""unfinished business"".\nNot necessarily love but resolution or closure.\nIf you get it, then its a luxury.  Most of us just have to deal with loose ends as is.\n\nThen again, anyone we've been linked with, we're linked with til we die.\n\nSorry, I don't think Ive answered anything."
you only get one chance at life and you should live it to the best of your ability. i beleive your put on this earth for  a reason. you just have to find that reason and live it. noboby knows how long they will live so live  each day as if it was your last.
"It doesn't take many licks when I'm licking ""it""!  I've been told that I do a great ""job""! : )"
If that bothers you find someone else - do not settle for anything that causes you to be worried - you cannot micromanage mates
Well, if they do that, then you should know with who you are having sex with, because that is not okay for a partner to tell you that because if they love you then they must accept you the way you look or are. Kick them away.
be at your best! but careful not to look very flirty or he may get turned off.just be yourself and go with the flow.find out his interests and maybe you can come up to him and talk about it.just make sure you can relate to the topic so you won't look like a weirdo in front of him.be funny and humorous but not to funny or he'll get annoyed and lose his interest on you.don't be too serious either or he'll get bored talking to you.just remember not to get nervous and wear your sweetest smile(not sarcastic smile.lol) and look at him when you speak.good luck.i hope this will help you somehow! =D
One what?
i wasnt really sure i should answer this question or not but what the hell.  Are you sure what you did was right, how do you know that.  how can you be sure that you both didnt want the same things.  If you really want to forget about him, then The best way not to miss him would be to just not talk to him or about him to anyone, gotta get him out of your mind and think about finding someone else
It depends on the person that you are with and it also depends on how long you want it to be and how long you can make it. Some times it can be hours or some times it will only last for a few minutes. It depends.
PERSONAL EXPERIANCE HAS TUAGHT ME ONE THING\nseeing your friends go trhough a downward spiral is no easy task...but\n\nFirst And Foremost You need to ask YOURSLEF a serious qeustion.. \n\nAre you considering it to actually help him out, and i mean REALLY help him out? or are you wanting to help your freind because you feel guilty about not helping him? \n\nYes i am being serious...and yes they are two COMPLETELY different things.... either you want to help him out becuase you feel as though you have a responsibillity as a person of society to help him with his ordeal, OR you want to make YOURSELF feel better, and get the moral dilema off your concious....\n\nThe reason this quesiton is important, is that it will do more damage to him if, when it gets difficult and time/money consuming (and it WILL), that you find that its not worth spending months/ years devoted to helping him trhough the ordeal, and fade out of his life. \n\nIf you have read this, thought about it, and really thought about it, and still have in mind to help him, i'd say just be the freind that you are, becuase a person who would be willing to do the above knowing the sacrifices one would have to make wouldn't need to do anything else to help your friend out in his hard times.
where do u live?? and if u r young sure.
There are herbs that can help increase the libido in a person, but to know which one will work for you is a matter of knowing your make up. On a general scale the use of sandalwood and jasmine in an aromatic sense can assist. Schizandra and chaste berry will increase your libido. For more specific herbs, I would need to know other aspects to your health and well being. There are psychological treatments that say that if you wish to increase your libido, then practice the act even if you are not mentally willing allow the body to be physically willing. If it responds as it should, erectus and stimulus to lubricate the vagina then it is a physical ailment. If does not react as it should, staying dry and no noticeable arousal then it is psychological. If it is psychological, what sits in your history that could have caused this? If it is physical, see a doctor or certified herbalist for further aid. I am both.
i would save my photo album of them .....cuz if THEY are there and if they die they would probably be happier cuz assuming one of them did survive they probably be heartbroken and wouldnt get on with thier life and be haunted by memory and when your parents are suffering itz hard for the child too so itz better to just leave it as it is and cheerish thier memory from the photos...BUt if you reallllllyy need me to save one i would  save my mom cuz i dunt like my dad :-D..
i think u should move on and go bac to ur ex becasue u still love him eventho u n him had fights yall had fights for a reason and and yall fought bacause yall loved each other
Ha ha... this is funny. Im a latina and I like men regardless of their ethnicity... well for the most part. \n\nNot nice...
Awww, You're sweet!
"begin by saying ...\n\n""I understand you may have feelings for my friend but I'd like for you to know how I feel. Maybe we could spend some time together, at a movie or hanging out at the park"".\n\nSee what he says and take it from there."
Well i m also an indian (guy) untill few days b4 i didnt know the meaning on manglik but now i so do it is a strong thing that god has created u can look it as a harsh way or u can say he did tht for his special people. HOwever a manglik should only marry another manglik otherwise the marriage either dont last long or god forbid some other misshappening can happen. However as a 19yr old i also belive tht only HE the king of us all has created a space for true love so if u two are meant to be together and your love is strong then no one can stop you, BUT once again i will say make sure your love is true coz if its only wat we say (jawani ka josh) young age fever then becareful coz this kundli thing can do some serious damage. I wish you good luck may god bless you!!
Sometimes it is not about who is right or wrong.  If this friend is important to you then be the bigger person and speak to them in love about the situation and try to see it from their point a view and learn to agree to disagree.
you need to grow up first and learn to spell. call me when you turn 18
"Dear""Newly Married"", Don't feel bad or upset if your ""HUBBY"" last for 35-40min. he's the ""GOD"" of all men. All other men only last for 5-10min on adverage cause they think all the time befor marrage on ""that night"" or all the ""free sex"" they are getting and don't have to work for it so hard on ""pleasing"" the other half. If your hubby is ""PLEASING"" you in that 35-40min then feel lucky and live like you've never lived befor!!!!!!!!All hail the lucky NEWLY WED!!!!!!!!!!!!"
First we are talking dancing ? If the question is dancing, then here it is in nut shell.Dancing is a very sensual and sexual expression , many women do not feel comfortable putting it all out there for a guy to see, men sometimes assume a woman whom dances that freely , must be the hottest thing in bed, if this is a first date, I am sure she does not want to feel as if, she is leading you on, choose another type of dancing next time for a first date.
Try to reconnect with him by thinking of the reasons why you got together with him in the first place. If you still don't want to be with him, you should know the best way to tell him because you have been with him for 18 years. It's going to hurt him, but it's up to you to decide if it's worth staying or leaving.
stds are very common. there is no set time for dying of aids, you can live a week, a year or ten years because you dont actually die of aids, you die from something you catch when you have aids and your body cannot fight off the infection, thats why it is AQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME,immune deficiancy being the operative words
For me it was the I trust my spouse she would never do that to me . Well folks that is what she did! When you love and are in love you do what is called DE NILE a river in Egypt.
No I don't but I am sure that you do.
a cute smile,honest kind eyes and nice butt
you have to sit her down and talk to her... agree before you start that neither one will get angry, or yell... and NO FIGHTING......\n\nthen you can each discuss your concerns... i am promising you though... this situation sounds like she doesn't agree with some of the things you do, and obviously it is not working for you either, so you will probly have to come to some sort of mutual agreement... compromise is the key, and no matter what... don't get mad... if you, as the daughter can control your temper, then she should see that and make an effort to do the same... if she gets mad, just give her some time to think about what you have said, and in that time you think about her points too... you can work it out... your dad seem to think so, or he wouldn't make you go back... so, at least try, and try and try again... she is bound to eventually see that you are making an effort to work things out... it won't get better overnight... you have to be patient in these sort of situations... and there sounds like there are anger issues too... try to talk those out as well...
i dont know mate i am having the same problem myself it is just an idea but maby you could organise something for him
depends on what he eats. dairy and meat make it like baking soda. fruit makes it like salt water.
i'd go for a small landing strip.  how much does that cost anyway?
A romantic dinner... ended with a passionate kiss.\nI did it for my boyfriend in his last b-day... one perfect night.
Well it can be two things maybe he is just plain lazy or maybe he is depressed. Why are you afraid to say anything to him? It is up to him to support his family. He complains about the bills, but then does nothing? Sit him down and lay it out staight in front of him.\n I understand your position of being a stay at home mom, I did that for 13 years and had no work history so it was hard very very hard to get a good paying job, which I never did manage to do. What does he do with this money? $19 an hour is not that bad and heck overtime would be even better. Maybe he is depressed.  YOU are not being unfair, you are taking care of a household, that is alot of work, what does he do when not working? You say he finds excuses such as the rent and all, excuses for what, of course he has to pay those, but IF he has any ambition to get beyond just paying the rent, HE has to do more. IF you go to work he will have to babysit, because your job will be minimum wage more than likely and a babysitter will take most of it, then there is the cost of you getting to work, the clothes you will need, etc.... Is he ready to be a full time father so you can go get the jobs that he won't? I doubt it, he just sounds like he is in a rut? Encourage him, push him a little, bring up how you saw a really nice dress or something that you would like to buy for a night out? I don't know but give him some reason to work besides paying the rent? Don't let him feel like he is nothing more than a paycheck though to you, that might be how he feels already, You need to communicate with him. Listen to him with your heart and your mind. Find out what he wants to do with life and take it from there. I don't think I have been much help, but I sure do understand your position. When your infant is a bit older, maybe think about taking some college classes, don't be like I was and let my life just go in order for my husband to feel like a man. Thank goodness my second husband is a better man, who would and does give me all I could ever possibly want and/or need, and he makes half the money that yours does. Though we have no children and I am disabled and now can't work at all, life is great....Get on him, but do it with love...good luck and I will be thinking about you...take care
There's a very good reason why he's your EX boyfriend, and you need to remember that.  Sex won't improve your relationship with him...it will just put you at risk for a pregnancy while he gets his rocks off on you one more time.
I have been married 1 year and i dated my husband 2 years and i know first hand that the newness of a relationship wears off.  The lovey dovey hang all over each other gets old.  You get to comfortable with each other.  I would try new things.  It seems to work for me and my husband.  Like sleep in the living room a few nights, stay in a hotel, try being silly with him like grab his butt when he least expects it.  Well i'll stop blabbing.  Hope this works for you.
Is it possible he lives with his mom because she is in ill health and he looks out for her?  Or, she can't afford that house on her own but wants to stay since all her memories are there?\n\nThere are many reasons that an adult son stays at home.  Until you know and we know what those reasons are, how can we judge what he is doing?  Have you ever talked to him about it?\n\nWhy don't you get the entire story before you try to make waves?  That is what a mature, responsible person would do.
its so normal for you a guy to be worried about a girl you love to be going out with other boys specially when your not around, but the truth is, you have nothing to worry about. if she says she loves you and you can SEE that  you being infatuated. Most of the time, girls get along better with the opposite sex and it is soo normal for girls to have friends that are boys :)

"Well, I've managed to do it twice.  Each time it started with talking about her sexual fantasys.  The common fantasy was about them interacting with another woman. This led to hot bedroom action.  Next, watch movies that have hot sex scenes and discuss them.  Talk about how they made her feel emotionally.  Try ""Wild Things"" or something similar for the girl on girl action.  Follow that with more great sex. Through the movies, I learned that both were curious about strip clubs and we went together and watched.  Again, hot action followed back at home.  It is incremental -- you have to do it slowly and gradually.  Women's desires aren't that far off from men's.  You must make a woman feel safe in her environment and in their relationship with you or it probably isn't going to happen.  If it doesn't, you will have had a lot of great sex trying, so you are out absolutely nothing."
If you are in the process of divorce perhaps it is a bit soon to be taking such a big step as to get a place with another guy. Perhaps you would do well to consider taking time to be with yourself to reflect on your marriage and what went wrong. I don't know how long your were married but you spent time in that relationship and gave it your energy. Now you have a chance to devote time to yourself. If this guy really likes you he will be around. That is my two cents. Sorry to hear about your divorce.
I am 24.\nA few years ago I had just gone to bed and my toes were poking out the end. I saw a dark figure at the door. Thinking it was a robber I lay still so they could take what they wanted and go. It walked over to the bed and lifted my foot up by the big toe about 15 inches off the bed.\n\nI screamed and it disappeared into itself.\n\nMy mother heard my scream and I told her never mind, I thought I saw a ghost.\n\nIn the morning I heard her laughing about it with my dad so I told her about how it lifted my big toe up into the air. She paused and then told me that that was how her mother used to wake her up of a morning. \n\nMy nana has been deceased since I was 7 years old.\n\nI havnt seen her since but i would like to. She is obviously watching over me.
come up with a plan to help me ditch my current and we have a deal...
NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\ntimes a million. you need to think over your morals and so does he. if he wants to have sex with you, he shouldnt be getting married.\n\nThis makes him a terrible person. You need to tell him that and deny him; that will be two blows to his ego and hopefully it'll knock some sense into him. You'd be stooping down to his level if you did have sex with him.\n\nThis is just terrible all around. such a bad idea. I cant believe people even so much as CONSIDER this. ugh. People suck.
I didn't know there was such a thing.  Sounds like a good idea though......
I never found out because im not but my sister is and she was about 19 but she still has a boyfriend and children and there both happy with it causeshe was honest and i dont no if she felt ashamed but it didnt look it...
hahaz pretty much except for the last sentence. I'm a girl, and that would kind of scare me off. I'm in love with a man who's amazing and sincere and fun. We haven't gotten together... yet. Hahaz but he is amazing.
sort your life out it was only a joke lovey ha ha
i do indeed. ive found out some really interesting stuff on here and i like to think that some folks have benefitted from my answers.

Well if you are asking why do normally straight hetrosexual guys resort ot being gay in certain enviorments, like prison, its becuase theres no women there to do it with.\n\nIf on the other hand you are asking on a broader scale, meaning all homosexual peoples, then they don't 'resort' to being gay, its what they are.  They think that men are attractive, in much the same way as you find women attractive.
Great how are you?
be yourself... if you win a girl by being someone who you are not, you will probably lose her when she gets to know the real you,  after all, she is not dating you, she is dating your alter ego.
as long as it takes her you don't get a say in this just smile and nod then cry at the price later
I started my relationship with my hubby as a long distance one, 450 miles away, we lived like that for a year and then I moved up to Scotland, we have now been together for 15 years, married for 10. I love him. If you want to make it work it will work
If it is a game, (i assume video game) then you should grab a shotgun and kill all the zombies. Then she will love you.
lovingly - i am sorry MOM - please - forgive me - thanks - is the right way to express your feelings to mom and mom will definately forgive you - my dear - ok.
tin, aluminum
No one really knows because it is not a static number, but trust me, if you knew...you would never kiss anyone again!
"dude, i totally got you covered here. what you need to do is to get well dressed, cleaned&broomed (because girls got 10x times better smell than men), get a positive atitude, go to her, bump into her and say: ""what?!? do i have to get attention lights and to write on my forehead LONG VEHICLE just so that you can see me?"" ... or something else more.... appropriate... the important thing is to joke all the time... and when she starts to laugh it up, tell her ""well i had a good time, we should go for a cofee and enjoy some more"" there you go. :)"
My favorite is a squirting dong. Its fun and u can similate ejacluation. I'm sorry you're getting so many stupid answers. Everyone masturbates, so let's be honest out here. Women can get it anytime, anywhere, so if we use toys when our men are not around, that's good for them as well right?
Try to divert his attention from his interests with books that interest him.  Develop the habit of reading that way.  Also be a friend to him and keep discussing subjects that interests him and taken his confidence and then slowly direct his attention to his studies.
its nice to show her she means a lot to you,but also give her space..she is a person in her own rite and not just your property..you get too full on she will probably run!!!!!!
Absolutely!  How can you LOVE somebody that you're not friends with?
I don't understand why anyone would be with someone, let alone come back to someone who spoke/wrote like you do.
it's sad, but some adults are uncomfortable with the fact that teens are talking about sex.  these same adults probably have teens at home who are totally clueless about sex and relationships.. statistics show that teens who have no one to talk to about sex, drugs, alcohol, etc are going to be the ones who experiment.. also they are more likely to abuse drugs and end up pregnant or getting a girl pregnant.. It would be really nice if the adults who are complaining would actually take the time to talk to the teens and give them the advice that they are seeking.
Its normal to feel that way after heartache. But what happens if you don't do anything? Do you really want to always wonder if you let Mr. Right slip through your fingers? Its ok to love again. If you truly like him and its no just rebounding, go for it! Just date, get time to know this guy. Work on the friendship part. Hold off on intimacy. If he's really into you, he'll want to learn about you, and not just try to get into your pants. If its been a year of dating and he's still there, that is a guy that is interested in you more than sex! And totally sounds like a keeper. He prolly knows you just got hurt. Go slow, but go with him. Don't let the hurt from your ex hold you back. That is giving him control, and I know you don't want that! Hide in your house for a day. Morn that first love that went bad. Then wake up the next day with all of that behind you. Think positive things whenever you start feeling sad. Remind yourself that its just gonna get better. Start living for today, not letting yesterday hold you back.
He looks like us. with all the organs and characteristics. but He's perfect and holy without blemish.He is our Heavenly Father who created us in His own image.  \n\nHis eyes are as a flame of fire; the hair of his head is white like the pure snow; his countenance shines above the brightness of the sun; and his voice• is as the sound of the rushing of great waters\n\nProphets from the beginning of time have seen and conversed with Him as they received revelations and were shown many of His mysteries. Read the scriptures. Moses, Abraham everyone saw Him. The latest prophet who declared to the world that he's seen God was prophet Joseph Smith. Today's prophet and apostles must have met Him to lead the church in latter days.
like-think about your age. Then post the question in say-6 years.
depends on how close he and his girlfriend are, maybe you should dtart out being his friend and if it doesnt work out with his girlfriend , you could be the one to pick him up when he needs comfort, also , he might take his girlfriend to the dance , maybe you could get a double date going for the dance or something like that , if he rejects just going with you and goes with his girlfriend
Kirsty Young from Five News?
i think your really hot we should talk then leave your number
years ago the answer to that might have been no, but in today's world it's almost impossible to find anybody that doesn't have a kid...male or female...i'm sure that there may be some foolish ones out there that might have something stupid to say, but the truth is most of us don't care if you have kids...the one thing that we do look at though is how close you are to your baby's daddy...because we all know that they like to role through from time to time just to get a little bit...as long as you have him under control you should have no problem finding someone to share your life with...
OK--so I am going through the same thing--2 yrs we have been together as well, He is on the video game so much, that he doesn't even come to bed anymore---yes very frustrating and some days I want to throw his PS2 of the fuckin' window!! However at the same time, I am glad to see he is still coming home, I would rather have him hear playing video games, then out to the Bar with his 'buddies' so I guess I can't bitch to bad!! Good Luck to you!! :)
You and your girlfriend don't waste any time LOL
try www.batchmates.com   at least u can contact her through mails.. i found my old classmates like this
tell them you dont want to date them but you'd be fine with a one time blowjob
Say how good he is to you.  Tell him you think he is sexy, handsome.  Tell him how good he is in bed.  Kiss him, be there for him.  Tell him how much you are in love with him.  By the way, love your question.
"you should go to hallmark.com and get the ""Go out with me!"" e-card from hoops and yoyo... there is no way someone can resist that e-card!!!!"
if he has a gf, its probably not the best idea to tell him that you like him.  Let him deal with his gf first, and if they break up, then tell him.  You might also try and find out from mutual friends/contacts how serious they're realtionship is and if they really love each other or not\nGood luck!
open your mouth
You can know by one simple thing. In any relationship you have to have an open and honest line of communication.  When that's there then you have trust. Plus I know where my man is all the time.  I can pick up the phone and call him.  Also he's at home with me every night.
Take her skinny dipping.
"call before dinner, like 5pm.  that way, if she prefers an evening call, she can tell you when or even call her back.  then you don't have to worry about an angry dad yelling at you for calling ""too late"""
it's hard to judge by age, because some 15 year olds are way more mature/ready than others that are the same age.
Well, I'm guilty of being attracted to a girl with long hair before, because I like long hair, never really cared for the spoiled and rich and big anything.  Cute is always good.\nYou know, I know it seems like they get all the attention and alot of guys, but you should feel sorry for them, most of those guys are just there to try and use them, they don't care about them, why else would they be with a different guy every time you turn around.  Grass isn't always greener and everyone has problems.
depends on if you still have to use your hip waders.
girl, you go and ignore rude comments! There's a reason why prince charming loved snow white! it depends on your features and how your complection matches them. I personally want to be pale, makes your skin look clear and pretty! Be more confident! There's always someone out there who is crazy about you.
I'm sorry to hear that.  Well, you may contact me through Yahoo! Answers.  I suggest you go out and explore what's out there in Boston.  Good luck!!!
Well this is one of the things two people first learn to do when they want to have a relationship together. Falling in love is easy but managing the responsibilities that come after takes work and compromise. Based on your statements that the guy who is having some financial struggles right now is still the one you would like most to be involved with then here's my suggestion. Tell him you really want to work things out between you but that you need to be able to see each other and spend more time together. Tell him that you understand that having the money needed to do this is hard for him to manage on his own right now and that you would like for the two of you to work together to save money and then be able to make plans to spend those times together. This accomplishes two things, assuming he feels as much for you as you do for him and is willing to make whatever sacrifices are necessary to be together. First, you show him that you are willing to work as hard as him to make things possible between you and secondly, in doing this, you provide the motivation he appears to need to be more self reliant financially.\n\nGood Luck & Best Wishes!!
I don't know i have never met one? all the women i know have breasts and butts.

depends on the legs that go with those feet.
Well, you are right about some guys.  But there are some guys that would love your strong leadership personality.  I'm a nice, gentle guy and appreciate women and I wouldn't have a problem with your personality.
They are just jerk wads!!!!!!!
Define a loner and In what context? \n\nPlease keep in mind my answers are from lifes experience, I am not a Trained mental health professsional I am just an earthy, sincere mature person who is willing to share my knowledge.\n\nIn youth (say between kindergarten and grade six) being a 'LONER' might be brought on by a home environment where reserve is the norm. Sometime it is a sign of high intelligence in a child, he/she may feel bored or not interested because they are different in intelect to their peers. Then again maybe he/she my just be new in the neighborhood. On the dark side Being a loner has been shown quite often to be an early sign of mental illness or worst yet, physical or emotional child abuse. The reasons can be many and just as varied.\n\nIn the more formative years say 7th grade to 12th grade the hormones are raging all around him/her and all the same reasons above apply plus some new ones such as \n(1.) Religeous upbringing. (2.) Fear of contageous deseases. (3.) Acne. (4.) Lack of self esteem. (5.) Being Bullied, Not accepted by peers. (6) Serious problems at home. These are the years where you are force by life experiences to 'MATURE'. Choices have to be made and quickly, many and heady desisions have to be made (college or not, sex or not, are two examples), this requires 'MORE SPACE' to ebolve and react positively in emotions and actions. In the mature years college and thereafter all these 'factoids' still play an important role in human relations and even more 'factoids' come to light. An example might be a difference in lifes goals or direction of careers.\n \nThe list can go on and on. And to put it bluntly to you specifcally. This is good time for many commitments. But maybe not a very good time for ROMANTIC/EMMOTIONAL COMMITMENTS.
Not an easy thing to do.  Try teasing her like she is your kid sister,( Don't be mean) and act like you don't care whether she likes it or not. And don't always be there.  Give her a chance to miss you a little. \n  One very important thing to remember, There's more than one fish in the sea and enough to go around.  If you're not catching anything in this spot,move to another.
600-1000 \nfood costs, going out places costs, shelter costs, school supplies costs, clothes costs. \nits like on an average 20-35 dollars a day. teens are pretty pricy.\n\n\nand like the person above said to rent or buy a teen or how about lease a teen lol
"nope. i do it too. it's in case i fall back asleep after i accidently turn off the alarm. once i wake up and think ""oh sh*t, i overslept!"" i can relax bec then i remember i got a free 20 min!"
there are seasons for everything. i think that the time for that friendship is up. i say move on. in my life friends come and go, and i am sure that is how it is for just about everyone. so, let them go, and move on to your next adventure. don't stay stuck dwelling on stuff like that, go meet some new people, and fill you life with a bunch of friendships. if this is happening to you , then i say that you are living a healthy life, and most people don't get the chance you are given right now. so, go live and make tons of memories!!

Yes I agree. Me and my husband got divorced but are back together again. Nothing is so terrible that one can't get help for it. I also believe when God has put two people together it is because they are right for each other. I think divorce in our country (SA) is too easy. You don't even have to have a valid reason to leave your spouse. I am glad someone else is fighting the fight. Satan targets marriages and want to see people getting divorced and families ripped apart. I won't give him that satisfaction any more.\n\nGood luck. God will bless u guys!!!
yes, my little brother is the most anoyong thng on the planet, i cant wait till i go to college where he wont be with me all the time. i wish i could ship him to affrca or somewhere away from me.
It really sounds like your not ready to make this commitment.  You can still love each other and plan a life time commitment without having to burden the parents.\n\nTrust me, you will want your privacy and you would want to keep the relationship of the parents in good standing.\n\nAfter 3 weeks after leaving under another person roof you would start feeling other the pressure.\n\nBe happy and wait.\n\nGood Luck.
"Hi,\nFinish last? Relationships are built on trust, compromise, love, caring, and wanting to make another happy; doing everything you can to make it so.\nI've been married now for 29 yrs to a wonderful woman. First marriage ended in Divorce after 7 yrs.\nI am one of the ""good guys""; respecting others.\nDon't change yourself; be honest and open.\nEnding with horrible people is their choice!!! If you are selective, dating can be fun. Chose someone to date who has similar likes as you....who seems to be trusting and honest.\nYou can't lose! Don't jump at just anybody.\nPlease rate my answer, and just be yourself. Good luck."
The problem I have here, is he didn't even admit that he did wrong. To say that he didn't know what he was doing is a lie. He betratyed you and the relationship that you built together. Whether drunk or high, he still knew what he was doing by being with someone else besides you. An affair means it was more than a one night stand right?  \nI am assuming that you are not married. You need to decide whether or not you want to remain in the relationship, if he seems to be willing to reprove himself to you, and if counseling would not be a good option so that the both of you can heal. \nI am sorry that he hurt you. That is the worst betrayal there is.
jsu go and talk free ..it will help you..words are the best thing to express your feelings
If he is shy. you be the bold one & ask him.\nhave some fun.

I posted my wedding on www.theknot.com and www.weddingchannel.com when I got married three yrs ago and never had a problem. But if you are that concerned you can set your account as password protected so only your family and friends can see it and not the public.
If he has a mental or physical disability,I don't think he is doing it to purposely hurt you. I do think that he needs counseling and therapy though.

i like ur eyes .. although i cant see them
"Girls probably talk a lot more than guys do when it comes to relationships. That's just the way it is. And when you put women together they can talk about almost anything because that is the way we connect to each other. Plus we like to talk a lot in general. So, to answer your question, ""yes"", if it comes up in conversation about penis size then women will talk about it; just as if ""what type of laundry detergent do you use"" will also spark the same type of conversation. Basically we will talk about anything!"

There is not much you can do about that..  Society teaches a lot of the wrong things..  You need to be thin, you need to have a degree just to fit in...\n\nThey don't realize that love is in the eyes of the beholder, it comes from within.  Whether your fat, rich, poor, or a different color...\n\nStay with being yourself..  There's nothing wrong with you improving yourself in anyway to try and fit in, but do it for yourself.  No one else...\n\nGOOD LUCK!
Beale St in Memphis,  its a street full of bars and a few clubs.  Best time I ever had!  (in the states)
loving someone is an action filled with emotions. if you love someone open you mouth and tell them.
Don't force him, ask him during pillow talk when he is relaxed and maybe had a drink and you guys have just made love, what are some of his fanticies and what is the freakiest thing sexually he has done and what you can do to turn him on, then tell him some things you like and some freaky things you would like him to do, My husband is a freak he has licked every part of me ,and i was straight up missionary, i used to gag when doing oral sex, but he was patient with me and once a week we did what he wanted to do and he even played games like dr and nurse, and he even pretened like he was a virgin and i was to teach him about sex and show him how to get freaky, have fun and be patient with him cause when you love someone you want to please them.

yea wats good I am what u are looklin for. Aiight hit me back.
It is called stupidity! Your mommy and daddy is not the one that has to live with the perso! You do! Believe me if you marry someone that you do not truely love, you will regret it! Besides, the parents will eventually come to except the marriage.
Open your mouth and say.... I LOVE YOU ....  simple!!!!!
exhaust them sexually!!!! it is pretty hard to cheat if you have run out of juice!!
http://www.smartlyrics.com/Song564539-Johnny-Gill-You-For-Me-lyrics.aspx\n go to this website and you'll find them here or  either way\nhere it is\nVerse 1.\nIt seems like forever\nThat I have waited for you\nIn a world of disappointment\nOn thing is true\nGod has blessed me\nAnd he’s blessed you too\nIn a world of lonely people\nI’ve found you.\n\nChorus:\nTake my hand\nAnd hold me close\nAnd don’t let me go.\nYou for me\nAnd me for you\nTogether we’ll make one\n\nVerse 2.\nWe were once strangers \nAll by ourselves\nLiving, living alone\nWith no one else\nBut here we are\nAnd it’s so, so sweet\nGod must have done this\nMade you for me\nAnd oh.\n\nChorus:\nTake my hand\nHold me close\nDon’t let go.\nYou for me\nMe for you\nTogether we’ll make one.\n\nBridge:\nWe were always sleeping\nOn the first thing we’ve start\nDreaming, dreaming some love\nWondering where you are\nHow blessed I am\nThat I’ve found you\nNow that you’re here\nI pray to say “I do”\nOh.\n\n(Chorus twice)
Well I don't mean to be mean, but all too often people get what they ask for.  Did you take time to get to know this person?  Did you make clear the level of commitment you expected?  Did you wait until you had a committed relationship before you jumped into a sexual reltionship.  \n\nYou deserve better but, until you relize it and insist on that from the man you choose to have relationships with, you will be treated just as you are.\n\nBeing a strong woman doesn't mean being agressive, it means insisting on only the best for ourselves.  This trash talk is beneith you and so is this man.  But luckily each day is a new one. You don't have to choose to be a victim tommorrow.  \n\nStand strong sister!
My wife and I are the sameway.....Do you think that is why we have 4 children??? Probably has something to do with it!!
holy s*** where's your mom and ya'll need to call social services and get out of that house that is totally unhealthy your sister needs you right now . I know it sound dangerous but you shouldn't let him do that  . ok . e mail me @ hypygirl@yahoo.com so we can talk .and also if he does anything at all get your sister and run . run far far away. call 911 too
because they no wat theyre doing
Who th F*CK is that????
dude that would be sweet!  then i could have me and your sister on a video!!
If he/she truly loved and respected their partner, then an affair should never have happened in the first place.\n\nThere is always a price to pay when someone cheats on their partner .. loss of respect, trust and the end of the  relationship.\n\nI don't believe in second chances.\n\nIf there is a problem in the relationship, why can't you talk about it, resolve the issue instead of making matters worse?
WELL all you have to do is keep searchin you'll find someone eventually!
go an buy kamasutra book
call me 310-217-7638
I usually don't call them because its boys job if he loves me, but also i am bored to do so, and i want to leave him to miss me. :) K U L U F A!
I'm sort of a bi but lean toward the lesbian side.  I'm 20 and not so much experience but I'm happy with what I am.  You like to talk?\nLei
No.  But at the same time you should let her know that she needs to respect you.
children always identify with one parent or the other....divorce or no divorce...
No man wants to be together every minute.
WOW! 30 answers in 10 minutes!\n\nWell,my suggestion probably isn't going to instantaneously resolve the issue. I do believe that people deserve second chances though. You married for better or for worse. This is one of those worse moments. \n\nIf you love her and you feel like there is still hope for your future than try to the best you can to not ever bring it up again. If you have talked about it and found out the reason for her cheating and have made it known that it won't ever be tolerated again; this is about all you can do. Never bring the subject up again and don't threaten to leave because of it. If you threaten,you may as well mean it. There is no point in threatening if you're not going to follow through. All it does is adds confusion to an already unstable relationship.\n\nAlso,if you have children involved in this situation,consider them also. Is it worth causing them the embarrassment and the hurt that goes along with divorce?  \n\nI wish you luck and every happiness. If you love your wife though,tell her that you do. Treat her the way you used to when you first met. Go on dates. Take a walk in the park hand in hand. Simple things can really help heal a broken heart,  for you and for her.
In most of the relationship it is the girls that get more pain than the guys.Guy/man are not constant they like enjoyin when they are having fun.Their cann't control their heart.They always either zoom at another gals body or end up whistling at them.To be honest all they want is SEX.Men don't listen to the heart they listen to their eyes of what it wants from beauties.this end up breaking relations and gals ending up ditched.sarry gals
no, there will always be someone you will like more. but if you look deep down you really like and love them all the same. \nplus your brothers might remind you of a strong man. someone who can keep you safe. not saying your sisters cant, but your brothers are stonger in a sence.
If his name is John Thomas run like hell and don't look back!!!
no if he was serious about you he wouldn't have forgotten about you so tell him your not interested because if he went off again he'll forget about you again
is this about b and s?  puh leez say no i thought he was a FLAKE!  aw well, or is it about c and the guy, lol?  anyways, it's hard, but just let your friend know, you're just being human to this guy, and it's nothing deep.  Your friend (depending upon who you're talking about) should understand!
Good morning beautiful.  You were good last night.
watch tv, run, work out, talk on IM, sleep, do hand stands, etc.

Yes I would be friends with someone who was a dwarf. It wouldn't matter if they were little or not it is the heart of a man or woman that you look at not his or her appearance. To be a dwarf doesn't have anything to do with how good of a friend they would be to you. The question is do you have a problem being friends with a dwarf?
Go to a mall, school, movie theater, any public place or go to a place where alot of women go to.
"It depends on you reviewing them! nobody really knows anybody :( Some good, some bad. Well I think you need to do some home work, I found a nice guy on hot match... So far so good\n\nJUST ""B"" Careful !!!!!!! Meet in public places, and take someone you trust along to meet any one that interests you :)\n\nJ"
No, be honest but not hurtful.  He may not realize his breath stinks.
"It took for him to actually change his passwords and not tell you them for you to get that ""gut"" feeling that something isn't right!!\nCome on girl. You are smarter than that. It's more than a gut feeling. You KNOW something isn't right and he's pretty much tellling you that things aren't the same. The messed up thing is you don't really know how long he's been hiding stuff from you because you are just now finding stuff.\nWho is to say he hasn't been hiding stuff from you for quite some time and you just now are noticing the obvious stuff.\nWhat you need to do is open you a bank account for just you and start putting money away so that when he does leave you, you will have a little something to live off of. \nYou aren't being paranoid. You are being naive to think that he has been completely honest with you all this time...but that is what a marriage is supposed to be about so it was only right for you to think that until you had proof otherwise. Now that you do...it's time for you to do something about it.\nI don't know if he's planning on leaving you. I don't know what he's doing, but he is up to no good. That's a given. So get your mind prepared for the worst."
I am so sorry sweetie about your condition but with science being what it is I am sure you will be okay.  As far as your boyfriend my original reaction was what a bastard! But he is still mourning his sister and maybe he can't go through with losing someone else who is close to him.\n\nYou can't make him come back to you, sorry to say you have to respect his decision and concentrate on getting better.  If he truly loved you he would be there for you and what a horrible way to find out the truth but at least you know now what he's made of.  He is still in shock so let him be, you deserve to have someone who loves you unconditionally and will always be there for you.\n\nThank God you have a wonderful support team in your parents.  Surround yourself with positive people and keep a positive attitude.  You have a major battle to contend with right now so focus on you.  Build your fortress and protect yourself.\n\nI wish you all the best and know you will be okay in every aspect of your life.  Let God and let go.
You have a lovable,question.You are looking for,strong affection,tender feeling,fondness,caring attitude.Toy is a harsh word , I will do any thing for you
best Advice is call St. Louis Police department, and ask them! they can tell you about some neighborhoods and the crime rate!  what better adviice then calling some people who really know!! good luck with your move!!
no-dump her
People generally hate someone because of some wrong that has been done to them by another.  Many times (especially with girls) you may be hated by someone because they are jealous of you or they think that they are better than you and/or your friends.
Congratulations!!!! You need to go ahead and tell your parents now. Your mom is going to want to help plan your wedding, and she'll be a big help. As for the invitations, I would wait until a month and a half before the wedding to send those out. Have fun doing all of this. I have been helping my sister do hers and we have had a blast! You need to start looking for your dress and your brides maid dresses too. This is the longest process of the whole thing. It takes about a month to get your dress back after your final fitting done. Good luck with the wedding planning and your life with your soon to be husband, and remember, always keep the line of communication open!
Hi, Velehrad (meaning Big Castle) is one of the most important  pilgrim sites in the Czech Republic. The place belonged to the Great Moravian Empire to where St Cyril and St Methodius brought alphabet and the Bible in a Slavonic language so the locals would understand it. They actually brought Christianity to the Moravian part of what today is the Czech Republic.\nThere is a huge complex of church buildings including monastery (belonging among the biggest European ones) in Velehrad, originating from 13th century. There are pics of the interiors and exteriors here: http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:_f7X2WicmSkJ:www.ado.cz/poutni/velehrad/velehrad.htm+Velehrad&hl=cs&ct=clnk&cd=3, http://www.velehrad.cz/vel1.html\nYou can read about it in English here: http://www.heartofeurope.cz/regions_5.html
Depends. Probably flirting. Mostly likely, your dinner looked tasty.
just like any other function from sex to urinating or taking a dump you have some aroma around so yes to masturbation you will have a aroma around you.  Best clean yourself up spray some good stuff on ya and keep your head up
Now, now, Bubbles. Let's be nice.\n\nBe blessed and don't start no mess.
It sounds like you should let your boyfriend go and have some fun. You are not ready for the commitment of a long distance relationship, and it seems the guy who's there with you is who you want to be with right now. So, go for it, just let your boyfriend off the hook.
grow up, grow some balls and do it yourself, the last thing this poor guy needs is you playing games with him, hell the last thing this world needs is more games.
I think it's wrong my parents gave the chance to live and i'm so grateful to them because life is precious, so i'll give the same chance to my future children no matter what, even if i'll have to die to bring them to this world.
Coffee shop and bring a copy of the national enquirer or some other rag like that.  It's fun to drink coffee and joke about the crap that's in that magazine.  Read the articles to each other and have a blast.  Plus, it's a very cheap date.  :-)
That is something you and the other can answer. Only commit if you love each other enough to deal the differences that will come up..Good Luck
There are real ones. Two types. Chemical and non-chemical. \n\nNon-chemcial\nThose who influence mood making a person more likely to be in the mood. A woman dancing for a man for example, a romantic setting for a woman and so on. \n\nBooze is another non-chemical aphradisiac. Many people lose inhibitions when drunk or stoned. It doesn't alter the sex drive, just allows the person to more fully express it and to disreguard potential consequences. \n\nChemical\nThis is still a new area of study so the effects are rather limited. Certain hormones have been proven to greatly enhance the sex drive of people. The drawback is you have to be able to directly apply them to certain body areas or you have to use them for an extended period before the effects happen. There is no pill out yet that you can just take which will suddenly increase sexual interest. For example a woman given low doses of testosterone will see a surge in sexual interest after I believe a week of the therapy. The downside to this is of course it's a temp fix as long term usage of testosterone by woman would cause severe probems. Even a temp overdose would cause havoc in her system. Men see the same rise in sexual appitite but it has different side effects and a more imediate effect.
no you need some real life friends.
"Yes, they do... and tend to tell ""secrets"" they tell noone when in that state of mind. Drunk people tend to be VERY open people"
i feel the same way...im really sorry because i know exactly how youre feeling.  my boyfriend of almost 9 month and i broke up last week and i still have the strongest feelings for him and its been hurting so much.  ive just been trying to stay as busy as i can to help keep it off my mind, hang out with friends and just try your best not to think about it even if it is hard.  im sorry.
Try www.intelius.com or www.ussearch.com its a small fee for her address.  You just needs is her name, state and approx age.
happens once shame on them and him, twice shame on you and your b/f.  There is a line between nice and stupid with yoru money.  I work ina  bar, and know how easy it is to rack up a tab, but some people will do anything if they know they can drink for free...you know..when in rome.
Move. If you feel that strongly then you should move to be closer to him
If you want to go with her, ask her before she finds another date!! Hurry up - - GO!
Forget him and frget about being the god mother! Sounds like a bad situation all the way around. 1st of all do you really want to be with this guy that cheated on you and is with another girl that is pregnant w/his child? He's playing her right now by letting her think he wants to be w/her right? Even if he's not leading her on he cheated on you and already got some other girl pregnant after you just broke up w/him. There's too many other decent guys out there to be dealing w/that crap!
Guys guys guys ! :)
Your partner is supposed to be your best friend.  Friends that fight stay tight.  Are you really being his friend?  If  you are, then you would all ready know the answer.  No one said it was easy!
Here u go scooby. Enjoy.
Get his phone number, if he doesnt call in a week you have your answer.
Better not ask unless & untill your partner himself discusses this with you.\n\nIf he doesn`t take any initiative that means he is still not serious with you and if he himself comes forward and discusses the same with you, baby he is serious with you now, nail the cat.
love letters are great and are more personal then an email or txt. because their hand written their more special. me and my partner used to write love letters before we moved in together! i think more couples should write them rather than use modern technology to declare their love!
aaaaawwwwww poor you, if you wanna talk to someone you can contact me...this happend to me before too =(
If you mean Dallas SWAT, then no, it's real.

it depends on lots of things. but in general i would say keep the age difference to no more than 17/18 years
LMAO - I see it everywhere, the park, Wal-Mart, and even in church...some of them - probably most - are unaware but it can be very obvious. \n\nIt's like the clothing was sucked in with a vacuum cleaner.
dont worry.....u just have to be nice .....being ugly or somthing else doesnt matter....whoever that just want some1 for the reason of beauty have to be kicked in the ass.....
I dont remember...May be Mom & Dad were struggling with the nappies & the diapers!!!
"I think to incorporate an ""in memory"" favor would be in poor taste.  I think the idea is very heartfelt and sincere, but not appropriate for a wedding favor.  The idea of a favor is to provide you guest with a memento from YOUR special day. I can understand why it is important to include her in some way, and I think it's important that you do. Have you considered acknowledging  her in another way?? Maybe a toast, special dance, or something like that?  Good luck."
Ask your sexy girlfriend to make a pass at him and see if he'll bite?
Scoop him up and eat him for dinner. Be sure to add a little Tabasco for taste.
str8tsik, my sexual fantasies are str8tsik
be honest hun  thats all you can do and im sure he will understand but you have to realize it was also his baby he needs to know as soon as possible
guts of him..
me too, lol, it has been a while that i stay silent, couldn't be any more, so going to fool around again next week. I can stay tuned only with intresting people, if not i am not motivated.
Life is always Imperfect.
Off-course yes Real Love starts from fighting
try http://www.zabasearch.com It works great.  :)
Yep, that sounds like flirting to me... usually when guys flirt with me, they get goofy and try to make me laugh. Or they tease a lot. That seems to be what this guy's doing. If the goofy stuff is directed to you, its flirting. I'm thinking he likes you... good luck, girl!
get your son to paint him a nice picture or to make something meaningful to your lifes. It will cost next to nothing and probably be the most thoughtful present he will receive. Good luck x
I tried that once and I had oatmeal coming out of my twat for days.
About all you can do is learn from their mistakes and don't repeat them.
"Somebody's been watching too many Woody Allen movies. I never heard anyone talk like that. It sounds forced, contrived, totally fake. Cryptic speeches don't usually come into normal loving relationships. At worst, it sounds like he's setting you up for a fall. At best, he's trying to sound overly impressive, but he's either going way over you head, or he just sounds precocious. Many people would use choice words like ""prick"" to describe this stuffed shirt. And no, it's not because he's older, it's because he's in love with the sound of his own voice.\n\nMy advice would be to distance yourself from this guy and look forward to the day you meet your prince."
Why are you so stupid? Has not education taught you not to believe in predictions and stuff? All nonsense
I went through exactly the same thing. I was in England, he was in Ireland. It's not a huge distance to make a relationship work, and the flights are dirt cheap. Just one piece of advice for you; if one of you decides to make the move permanently across the water, make sure you both have your own lives and friends. I split with the man I moved for and it was very lonely being on my own away from home. But I built up my own live, and have now lived in Ireland for 8 years, and the guy is long gone, but I would never go home now!
talk to her find out if she likes you and if so tell her that you want to try being more then just friends what is the worst thing she could do, tell you that she just wants to be friends.\n\ngood luck
Apologize to her and do something to make up for it.
Try asking what she likes doing, Throwing hints, ask her what she likes to do for fun, what movies she likes and when you feel the time is right, then do it. Good luck
Nope, but I have stood people up before.  I didn't have the heart to tell them no to their face, so I just didn't show up.
For me, it's a guy with confidence, ambition, well dressed and good manners.\nLooks don't necessarily matter too much, neither does body type - unless they were extremely ugly or very overweight.
That is the strangest thing I have ever heard. Someone who actually like getting hurt. Well if mental pain makes you feel good, why not try physical and let someone knock some sense into you.

Keep your mind where it should be -- on the spirituality of the ritual.  I'm pretty modest myself and grew up in a very conservative environment, but nudity is not necessarily sexual in all societies.  \n\nAlso, be careful about expressing your concerns:  attributing ulterior motives to someone with pure intent can be very insulting.
Well what places do you hang out? Are they all related to each other as friends or family? What women do you socialise with?
I was always moving around with my dad since he was military. I guess you just have to learn to be a bubbly friendly person that can adapt quickly.\nI know its hard moving and leaving behind friends, but making new friends is fun too.
Depends on the guy, just go with what you like yourself and if a guy likes it too well thats a bonus

im a leo n i look for witty intelligent funlovin women
She doesn't seem interested. Not right now. Back off a bit and maybe she will come around. If after a week she is already losing interest - that is not a good sign. The beginning of a relationship should be filled with passion and excitement!

"After the speeches, the bride and groom set to the dance floor and they perform the first dance, which is called the ""bridal waltz."" But in the modern age the actual waltz is diminishing and pop song is coming into existence. \n\nThere are many custom dances, which are also performed. After the initial ""bridal waltz"" or first dance, the groom escorts his bride to her father for a special Father/Daughter dance. Followed by various dance moves and style, the guests are invited to join them. \n\nThis way the party continues, and several rounds of toasts are served. At last bride and groom leave in a car, fully decorated with flowers and petals. \n\nBut the traditions vary from region to region and country to country. Some tradition includes the money dance or dollar dance. In this style of dance the guests are required to pay some amount to dance with bride and groom. \n\nIn more simplified manner the money is pinned to a special apron worn by the bride. Somewhere the money is collected by friends, who gives a shot of alcohol to each guest as they pay. This tradition is commonly followed in the U.S. Midwest, but considered shabby in other regions."

"""people said"" ""people said"" - if he is the true love of your life, you know this answer already - regardless if it is yes or no (that he cheated) ...stop listening to other peple and listen to your boyfriend, if you think he is lying - go with your gut instinct.

It depends on what you are looking for.\n\nWith a girlfriend you have:\n*someone special to spend time with\n*someone you can talk to about anything\n*someone you can plan a future with\n*someone who will hopefully love you and want to share special times w/ you\n\nWith a group of friends you have:\n*Several people to hang out with \n*people you can talk to about many subjects\n*people that have similar interests \n*people that won't get jealous because you are 'spending too much time' with your friends.\n\nLike I said, it all depends on you and what you are looking for @ this time in your life.
I remember it was 6 years ago during summer...(18Th August) He was my summer love he was leaving cause we were living in different cities and i only knew him for 2 days. but we kissed each other under a bridge..I remember that the previous night we were exchanging sms till the morning light....Oh God what have you remind me know!!!!
If your parents love you and this person is worth having then they will like them. Ask your parents not to embarrass you. Maybe they will understand. You only get two parents in your life and they won't always be there but, they will be there to see you through the heartaches. Just because you parents live a certain way dosn't mean you have to be that way too. Maybe if your parents knew you felt this way they would change!!!!! this person is not worth having if they would do you that way anyway.
Prisons are tough and alot of incarcerated people wish they were dead.
move out
Usually they pace around back and forth. Then they finally talk to the girl, studdering every word that comes out of their mouth and ask her out. If you look close enough you'll see a little bead of sweat  on their forehead just below the hair line. I know this because before I went to college, I used to be the shy guy. Not anymore.

"Yep, I remember...\nWe were sitting in his truck out by a pond in the desert. It was Dec. 23 2004, and he was on Christmas leave from the Navy. We hadn't even starting dating yet (technically, this was the day we use) But had know each other for years. We dated in the past, then he became my best friend. Well, we were both cuddled up on the passenger seat (we were sort of kissing and cuddling at lot since he had been home, but never made anything official until the hour before he said I love you), listening to the radio and about to watch the sun rise. \nHe said, ""You know I kind of like you.""\nMy reply, ""Yes, I know.""\nHis response, ""Okay, well then, I love you.""\nI say, ""I know that too.""\nHe looks at me, confused and asks, ""How do you know that?""\nI replied, ""It's been obvious for the past few years.""\nHe proposed on Valentine's Day 2005, and we were married July 7, 2005. Still going good!"
Children, sometimes cry if they do not know you, because they are scared of strange people or if they are kids from friends of yours there is a simple solution to your problem. Playing peek-a-boo with them if they are small babies would make them warm towards you. If older try to start a conversation by telling them your name and asking them theirs. And remember that children can sense when a person is sincere.
It depends what you value more - your friendship or a potential relationship with Vuthy. It may well be that he wants to be with you and technically, as he is now single, you are free to pursue a relationship with him. \nBut if your friend still has feelings for him, she will probably be hurt if you and he get together and you may lose her as a friend. Id talk to her about it first and guage her reaction.
If you have assest like a house or bank accounts that were in both names then you do not need probate court for those things.  If there is anything of substance that was only in the other person's name you will need to go to court.  You might also need to esstablish an estate for the deceased.  Our home and other assets were in both our names so I did not need to establish an estate, until his job started sending me checks to pay out his disability( or something I really do not understand it) but the checks are made out to the estate of.....  I had to get a lawyer to set up the estate with me as executor and then I can open an estate account at the bank and then I can deposit the checks and get the money.\n\nContact your insurance company and notify them of the death.  You will need an original copy of the Death Certificate that they can keep(cause they will keep it)they in turn will tell you what other steps if any to take to get your benefit.  \n\nI hope that my experience has been of some help to you in this difficult time. God Bless You
It depends on the mistake, you be the judge, if he forgot your birthday you can forgive him, but if he cheated say goodbye, once a cheater always a cheater!
If I was in your position I would allow him to adopt her.  If he loves her like shes his own and your happy with that idea than do it.  Do what ever your happy with not what your mum is after all its your decision to make not hers.  Good luck in what ever you decide.

Don't worry about how you're suppose to express your pain or even joy for that fact. Just react as you normally would. Some people are less over-the-top with the way they express thier emotions. Those who really know and accept you for the way you are will know how to read your emotional state. Don't force yourself to put on big dramatic displays of emotional expression. It's not natural.Accept how you are. You seem to be strong. Not everyone must cry when they feel pain. Sometimes it is necessary but only if it comes naturally. Your innability to cry right now might be one of your strengths. \n\nPerhaps right now you are going to be strong one who helps your friends through what ever is going on. In other ways you might need thier support. Accept who you are and how you deal with pain and the rest will work itself out.
anytime is right for a dip... What are u waiting for.. Get up get going!!!
First your wife, explaining to her that while her mom is right on some things, there are other things that you would like to have in your own way. If that doesnt work, confront both of them together when you get a chance to be with them together. Confronting your mom in law alone wouldnt be a good idea, cos' she may tell your wife that you are accusing her of things she hasnt the slightest idea on. \n\nWhat does she come and tell you 'to do and not to do' ?? Are they major decisions of your life together, or just simple things like what to buy around the house, shopping, or some other small issues. Either way, i know it might be tiring. When you do confront your wife, simply ask her if she ever thought how you feel certain things should be done, and without accusing, make her understand that it is really tiring when you have to always listen and do things her mom tells you both to do - always.\n\nP.S. I agree with pathfinder. Assertiveness is good in situations like this.
I think you both are confused about how you feel. As for him...He probably see's you as someone that would give anyone you were with just as much attention as you do him. That it has nothing to do with a possibility he could be any more special than the next guy. He probably see's you as desperate to find someone to love you. A problem he has now is that he's invested time and emotion into you before figuring this out. So now he's at a point where he can't feel happy with or without you. By you hanging out with your guy friends.... it only confirms in his mind that he is not happy with you because the belief he has of you being desperate for attention is only feeding his insecurity that you're capable of more than welcoming any passes made at you.
When you are young and female you get into relationships and feelings harder than guys do.  Your feelings were deeper than your boyfriend.  Its not going to be easy to get over him because you were feeling so comfortable.   Take it one day at a time,,,,seriously!   Don't try to move on til your heart is ready.   Listen to music,,,start a journal and write down your feelings,this will help you get your feelings out.   Let your heart have time to grieve and give yourself time to get over him.   One day soon you will begin noticing boys again,,,,and realise that you are ready for another relationship.
Try being by yourself for a while. Nothing is worse than carrying old baggage into a new relationship.
Dear Beautiful!\n\nI spent my 20's over weight. I know what it's like to be rejected based on your size. I would actually look to see that men would pass by me and never open doors or make eye contact. It was discouraging. I would kid myself and say I'm happy no matter what size I am.. but it was a lie I told to myself. Yet some women really are happy as bbw. Like you said you have been dating and even married, so your self image is probably hurting you not your size. Recently I found a guy who told me i was beautiful and he wanted to be with me and he didn't care about the weight thing. I found myself in love and the weight just started to fall off.... My point is you are BEAUTIFUL as long as you feel beautiful. Who cares what most guys look for as far as twiggy.. the right one isn't looking at them he's looking for you. So chin up and feel good about yourself! Things could be worse.. what if you were a 24 year old virgin with a hair lip!!! :) Smile Girl and keep it real!! Only attitude can determine if you will be single very long..at 24 I doubt it!
just explain to him that you are still in love with your ex-bf and u dont think its fair to string him along and that u want to break up becoz u dont want to hurt him anymore
Help him but dont cheat cuz hell never learn and just flunk agian...also let him know ull still be friends and that u can hang out after school and stuff
You can find tons of Dora stuff at your local walmart... or you make your own invitations off the internet... make some of those dora explora back pack favor bags etc, some mexican flare like taco, nacho's etc
You need to see a counselor and tell more detail to him or her they will help you. You only have one chance in life.
"He sounds like a dick!!!! I feel sorry for your sister.Once an imature dick always a imature dick. Next he will be telling her if you don't give me sex i will get it from a whore and it will be ""her"" fault (after she has the baby). If she can she should dump his loser azz before the baby comes home.For reals!!"
Try finding alot of old pictures from childhood and up of different happenings in life and make it into a framed  collage or a personalized photo album or scrap book of his entire life including friends, family, etc.
he is toxic for u . Surround your self with people who love and care for you. This and having lots of activites will help you get past him. You are too good for him anyway. Let him be immature and you can move on and become fabulous!
Boxer briefs.\nThey are nice and tight, but not TOO tight, and they hug all the right areas!!
Once you click their name you can block them and also in settings you can do it...........
Its a 50/50 thing about telling him. With things like this you have to becareful. Just start putting ideas in his head about you and him.

try to help her when she is doing some chores and complement her with the things she already done like how good her cooking is like that and try to listen to her point of view then suggest things without making it a point and most of all pamper her with complement
i think its english. i know a robert richmond. hes in yuma, arizona.
Oh heck no. Been there done that. She is the reason he drinks.  She did a p* poor job at raising him that's all. It shows b/c she's still trying to raise him and doesn't realize ummm he's grown! Its so easy for mother in laws to put the blaime on you and the twisted part is they forget how he was before you got there and forget to warn you. The sad part is she has made your life harder by excusing his drinking. Like he is justified in drinking. I don't care if you ran him up the wall and then the car he choose to handle his problems that way.  Mom needs to get some rest thank her for doing such a good thus far and you can take the baton now. Seek counsel from a counselor or a good bible based church.
Yes I love myself and no it is good to love yourself - Its hard for someone else to love you if you dont love yourself first- If you dont love yourself and nurture yourself than how much love do you really have to offer someone else -I learned this about 8 years ago when I kept getting into bad relationships - Now I love and take care of myself and have a wonderful Fiance and new babygirl - So No it is not bad to love yourself - it can get bad if you start to love yourself and no-one else but yourself -then thats BAD and very selfish
sing it continously until they can't take it anymore. then it'll be stuck in their head.

he is offering u the help u need his  asking for once be tru- so many lies and soon they will start feeling like the truth to u and then there will be no escape- help is ther but it is u that has to take it-be strong\n\n\n(i think that was wot ur trying to say??)
You should be able to move here, if you are still married, if she's a legal USA Citizen. Based on marriage alone.
LOL.....i dont know but i am trying to give you your points back:).
if u really love her and care about her then just tell her that her hairstyle is not good....or u dont like it....trust me she wont me mad at you....she would say thank u for helping me....if she is a good friend.
I'm a single parant and with my child i just let  her play and wear herself out.\n\nInvite other kids over with there parents.\n\nT.V. makes a child sleepy.
it might be becuz hes shy or doesnt know how to express his feelings dont go further untill he can open up to you or youll have reltionship problems! good luck im a 15 year old guy  i know were its comin from
First off, try to remember that not all women are like those you have been involved with so far. Relationships (especially romantic ones) are meant to be difficult, and it takes more than a few times at the least to find someone who you love and who will love you and care for you the way you deserve. You sound nice and caring to me so remember you don't need to settle for anyone who says things to you like they don't know how they feel about you. Also sometimes people take longer to feel comfortable about taking a relationship to the next level. Usually when people say things like that or do things, it's more of a reflection on them that it is on you. The main thing you need to remember is to not give up and don't settle for anyone that doesn't care for you and love you as much as you love them, because there will be others even if it doesn't seem like it at the time.

Ew. Explain that incest isn't your thing and that he needs to stop because it is gross, wrong and against the law. If he doesn't stop, inform your family members.
"Read ""Dare to Discipline"" by James Dobson, and ""How to Talk so Kids Will Listen and Listen so Kids Will Talk"" by Farber & Mazlish.  There are a lot of really good books about how to be a good parent and the more you read them, the more ideas you will have about how to handle each situation."
stay away from all the losers who do that hun n seek help there r a lot of places now a days 2 help u n get u off that shit.I was once a crack addict(started by my exhusband) but I found counciling n help and have been clean for over 8 years. and I would never go back.STOP n get some help everyone needs help sometime.
cute good luck keep me posted
Keep yourself interested in you. Try to grow your life every day. Try as many things as you can, and try them 3 times so that you realy find out if you like them. \n\nWhen you find that you are doing stuff just to please someone else, it gets to be hard work. And relationships are tough enough without trying to keep someone interesterd.
boys are stronger physically but girls are stronger mentally

I think people need to stop labeling other people as a ho and they should just enjoy each other, even if it means just one night.\n\nWhy dont you ask her how she feels about you? You can usually tell if she just wanted to sleep with you for that one night or if she wants to see you again. I think it could be a little bit of both. I am sure she liked you enough to go out with you, I think sleeping with you just topped the cake! Do not label a girl as a ho just because she gave it up....you did the same thing, dont forget that.
However much you want it, you can't force a person to be with you, or change their mind.  If she wanted to be with you, she would have stayed, and she would be with you now.\n\nIt sounds like she is very confused and going through some troubles of her own.  I would suggest just leaving her alone and giving her some space.  Perhaps when she has had time to get her head sorted out, she may decide to come back.  I think calling her and writing to her just adds pressure and may drive her away.  Try reverse psychology here.  If you just stop trying to contact her, she may contact you.  Then you have more control over the situation.  You can then tell her to either make up her mind or leave you alone.
hey judith!!don't mind them..because if you do mind them,(the people who are teasing you) they won't stop teasing you.And when they call you the name renz say to them:who are you guys talking to?...then when they say we're talking to you,say to them that I'm NOT renz i'm JUDITH(your name).When they call you renz again don't mind them.
quiet
Of course there is the mind, but eyes, hands, chest and butt are good too :-)
We talk about those things. I do have male friends that I will talk to one on one about my home life but very rarely will I put my business out in a group.

"No, it does not always justify a mother/child relationship. If there is some other lady, unfortunately they have a very hard time, if not impossible, being ""mom"" because they are not the genetic mother who is there all the time. Unfortunately there are people out there like you describe, but we really can't do anything about it. Now if murder was legal,,,,,,"

Smile, then butt.  Wow!  Amy, impressive!
You can look up family trees on the Internet--Ancestry, log on, once you do this you should be able to fill in as much information that you have, it should bring up relations to you----this thing goes way back in time I found someone from 1912--gives you all the possibilities of family members, dates of birth, birth places, and deaths!! Good Luck and I hope this helps! :)

Well I broke up with her ages ago. I loved her deeply but I was so insecure. She intimidated me because she was popular and beautiful and I felt not that way. I became bitter and jealous. I even mistreated her somewhat. The tension was always building in me. I guess I really wanted control. I decided to cut my losses and let her go. It was like the saddest moment in my life. I locked myself in my room and covered the windows in black for 3 days. At the end of 3 days, I heard a knock on the door. It was her, coming to bring some personal belongings of mine back. I can't even tell you the sadness in that moment. It is crystallized in my mind forever. I was moody and depressed for months afterwards. I thought about ending it all. I wrote a lot of poems to her. She sent me a card for my birthday, more agony. I had a one night stand to make myself feel better. I drank a lot. It was tough. Real tough. Eventually I moved on and met someone much better for me. But it was hard to trust and love again so freely. My ex is someone who touched me in a deep way becuase we met when I was feeling so vulnerable. Overall, though she probably wasn't as good a match for me as I wanted her to be. That's the honest part of the siutuation. We were just much too different in so many ways. I learned that even though I had these powerful feelings for this girl, she may not have been the one I was destined to be with. Still, my heart lingers on her at times. You just never get over some people. But I don't dwell or obsess anymore. I focus on my new love and make that the center of my life. That's the best and truest advice I can give you. Good luck and don't be shy to move on because when it's over, it's definetely over!
You either need your parents signature or go to jail.  the only two ways to legally leave home at 16
yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i love goths!!!
That's BS.\n\nIf the guy really digs you, you can tell him anything. \n\nI know a lot of guys who are bigger wimpy bitches than some girls I know. \n\nI dig girls for ALL they are. I don't just dig what I see. We're all human and all have done things we're not too proud of. SO WHAT.\n\nI love women and if you want a real man, here I am babe.\n\nCome to daddy ;)
Do u really want ur kids to grow up in a place where they see daddy drinking all the time? Me no I dont, I want the best for mine. But thats really up to u.
amen brother\nand marriage fails today cause there is no commitment at all. You can see it on answers , every ones answer to even the most minor problems are just get a divorce , very very sad
See her less often, maybe an afternoon once a month. And when you do, be patient with her and always treat her nice no matter how bad she gets. After all, it's only a few minutes of your life, right?\n\nThing is, most mothers behave like this, no matter how old you get. You'll always be her child, and that's what she sees when she looks at you so don't be too pis*ed about that.
That's really rough, I was in a similar situation in the 8th grade.  I had gone to public school and then switched to a Christian school.  It was hard cuz I left my best friends there, and I did lose touch with most of them.  I see a few of them once in a while now.  We talk cordially, but our lives went in completely different directions - I'm glad about that too, they're all 21-22 with kids.  I guess my best advice to you would be to be nice - say hi, be like - hey we should do something sometime and catch up.  Ya know, just play it cool like it doesnt' really matter either way.  Good luck!!!
All through Junior High and High School, my younger brother was picked on by one specific bully.  \n\nDuring his Senior Year in High School, this bully started going off on my brother in the school parking lot and my brother just pulled back and let his fist fly right into this kid's face.\n\nHe broke the bully's jaw in 3 places, and when the kid's parents filed charges, 25 other kids showed up in that court room to back up my brother.  All charges were dismissed and that bully learned a lesson.
Men just like looking at pretty naked women, it's like getting away with something that you couldn't as a boy. I would say he is still attracted to you. if he becomes an addict, you may run into problems. if he catalogs it and has his favorites he is an addict. which still doesn't mean he isn't attracted to you , he has an addiction like any other drug. it like an escape from the dreary life that binds him. it's fantasy.
when we feel we r inferior to others...n think nothign right is going on with us...\nkilling ourselves means u r coward n dont want to face situations....\nu have to get through everything comes in ur life no matter wht..\n\nno one deserves to die before thier death....dont waste ur life..
A guy definantly isn't worth loseing your sister especially a guy who probably won't be their for you like your sister is. Guys are going to come and go in life don't let one seperate you two. talk to your sister and tell her the same. But you have to first figure out what this guy's up to as well make sure he isn't playing he can't have two girls at the same time.\n\nsincerily yours Cupid if you need anymore help email me at \n\nhitches_help@yahoo.com

Why on earth are you working this many hours? No job is worth your life. Cut back on the hours, or change your job. Work in leisure time into your schedule.\n\nParticipate in activities you enjoy and you're bound to meet someone who shares the same interests who you could possibly be friends with.\n\nIt's good that you're thinking about where to start. Now go out and make those lifestyle changes. Consider this: even if  you can get into a relationship as you are now, where would you find the time to be with this person?

If you ate steak all day everyday how precious would steak be to you after a week? That feeling you get when he tells you he loves you sounds to me like he's doing it right.
I have been married for almost 12 years and until about 9 months ago I would never have thought about not being faithful. However, sometimes in marriages things change and needs are not met whether physical or emotional and when this happens people find they will cheat.  Because the needs were not met I found someone who will meet them, be discreet and no strings attached. By the way these are emotional not all physical.
If you have sex to make someone happy, you'll only end up hurting yourself.  You should never let someone talk you out of sticking to your morals.  You never know what this boys intentions are...and what if you accidentally get pregnant or some kind of STD???  Staying abstinent will guard you from all of that because condoms are not fool-proof, they do pop and some boys don't even know how to put one on the right way....so stick to your guns and keep those little legs of yours shut.
just ask.  Ya never knopw untill you put it out there.
It depends on you and your fiancée-to-be; you can do something big and public, or something big and private, or something small and private – I'm assuming you want it big, and probably public, since you noted that this is for someone “rich”.  You can get your proposal “advertised” – either in the newspaper, at a movie theater, on a billboard you pass often, heck, if you have the money, get a commercial on TV.  You could send your girlfriend on a big “treasure hunt” – be sure to have lots of gifts along the way, perhaps send her to a local bookstore and leave a book that you bought there for her to get from the person at the register, or to a coffeehouse where you’ve purchased her an espresso machine – you could even do this just in her house (books & videos in a basket in the living room, espesso machine in the kitchen, etc…).   You could buy her another piece of jewelry that’s engraved with “Will you marry me?” on it.  Whatever you do, make sure it’s something she will enjoy and appreciate; don’t embarrass her or give her a puppy with a ring tied around its neck when you know she hates dogs.  Good luck!
you are in a weird relationship with a bizarre dude. Break up and find a healthy relationship. Yours will go nowhere.
I have been in the same situation and personally I would not advise you to go ahead.  Its best to just stay friends. I fell in love with a guy who was my colleague, my senior and I really thought he was the one and now he has dumped me after we had decided to start a family and get married.  Now I'm left holding a baby and having to worry about finding another job.  It's just not worth it because when things do go sour it will be really awkward not for just you but for everybody else that you are working with.  Try and find someone outside the office it would make your life a lot less complicated.  At the end of the day its your decision, I really hope you make the right one!
no if he smokes its his choice not yours.
Yes, it is very frustrating...\nBut we inconsistently create a mental prototype, of what we want or need...\nAnd even we refuse we look for it and some times it is clearly the same that we were suppose to be hiding from...
hell yea i'm a true friend and umlike my other ones i'm a true one!!!!
Always put other peoples needs ahead of my own. Loyal.
I've been wondering that too.\n  That happened to all the categories.
okay first, it's been tested and proven that no one is out of anyone's league.  Two, the best thing you can do is call her out on her bull.  If she's for real about her flirtation and wants in on your action, then you have something.  If not, move on and either keep her as a friend or drop her.  good luck in any case hon.
Hi pal, exactly the same thing happened to me - but it was a guy who did it.  I don't have an answer either, except just to reiterate that if someone changed their mind, they should be ADULT enough to say so.  After all, not everybody is indeed for you, it only takes that special ONE to make our hearts happy.\n\nI haven't become paranoid and possessive [a little possessive probably... lol] though.  Just take it as one of life's realities - you're stronger than this kind of situation.  :)
no,no,no,   rumors get started real easy that way
im 12 i would like to b ur frend IM me ir something
"you betcha!  the irish look is ""awesome""...and if he's got an irish accent, oh baby, he can read me the telephone book."
NOT AT ALL........
i've been judged all my life and the only thing that i can come up with is that they fear what they don't understand...but that's not what should matter at all...what really matters is what we do with ourselves as a result of being judged...always be the best you that you can...i don't care if you're a thug or a skater it doesn't matter as long as you're the best that you can be at it...and for those that judge you...FU(K EM...nobody asked them for their opinion anyway...
u dont need to post ur question 4 times luv
hi..\n\ni would love to know an answer to this question cuz surly alot face this .. is he just being nice or he likes her..\n\nu cant ask cuz u might be shy or u might fear rejection... he might not admite anything cuz he might think u already know or may be hes worried that u will reject his feelings towrds u ...\n\nu can  wait and see what happens,..\nu can joke about it and say ppl r saying that we r in a relationship and stuff like that and see what he thinks ...\nu can ask him directly ...hmmmmmmmm .. i wouldnt i dont know why lol :).\n\nhope u great luck but tell us what happend
Geez.  You can either wait for her to read your mind, or you could tell her.
it's just a dream. just be a guy and go hang with your friend and don't worry about it
just ask him.
"You shouldn't expect a shallow girl to develop a crush on you but ""any"" girl?  How about the beauty that shines within you?  Surely some girl is going to notice that for that shine within you will shine without as well.\n\nThe greatest love of my life was 4 feet six inches tall - and I am five feet ten inches tall - and we lasted for 27 years until he passed away.\nWhat he lacked in height, he was taller in so many more important ways.  Sometimes he rose above everyone else in my opinion.\n\nSo let people see the wonderful talents you possess because external beauty fades but inner beauty lasts and is a joy forever to behold."
I've also had the crush on the teacher thing, i think it will eventually fade.

Don't bother-- she doesn't.
If you lose your mind, you won't be coherent enough to understand when it happened.
So if you think hes really hot... Whats the problem?
You know what??  YOU are an individual! Like whoever the HE** you WANT to like!  Others don't like that about you? TOUGH!  show them the door.. tell them not to let it hit them in the a** on the way out.  OR.. you could just run your life and like whoever OTHERS tell  you to like.. don't be an individual.. that might just be TOO MUCH!
HERE I AM BABY...YOU KNOW I CANT LEAVE YOU FOR TO LONG
yep
I think there has to be a guy that you love more. Maybe you are holding on to past memories and you just need to let go of them, if that's what you really desire. Sometimes is just better to be alone untiil you are ready to dedicate yourself to just one person. You wouln't want your current boyfriend to have strong feelings towards any other girl, you want him to respect you and for you to be the only one in his heart... right??   If you aren't sure about something, think throught it, is better to make wise decisions now, then to later have to be stuck in a relationship that you are not sure of.
I don't know what to say on this one. I think it's a little weird. A friend of my parents did that despite the fact that my brothers and I hated it and he really gave me the willies. I mean something strong and my parents could not figure out what my problem was. \n\nI don't know what kind of satisfaction they get. I might tickle my nephews or neices just to get them to laugh, but I don't get out of hand with it and it gives me a good laugh. They encourage me to do it all the more and chase them around LOL! That's different. It's not like someone who does it despite the fact that the child hates it\n\nPeople that have fetishes need to learn to seek counseling i am serious. That's just too creepy
Sadly, some girls are attracted to 'bad boys' and often get hurt as a result.  When I was younger, I used to be friends with many very attractive girls who were 'in love' with guys that just hurt them over and over again.  I, of course, was just screaming inside that I wanted them to notice me as more than a friend, but they were obsessed with these guys.  They often moved from one bad boy to another.  Sometimes it is because of the way their fathers treated their moms...women tend to be attracted to people like their fathers.  Some girls are rebellious and they look for guys that they know their parents won't approve of.\nAs for being raped, guys can't really be raped...guess you know that.  All I can suggest is that you learn from your mistake and look for someone with more positive qualities...ones that these ex b/f's don't have.  Good luck!
Honsety, loyalty, sweetness, yet rough! I want a guy who isn't afriad to take a chance and do something wild and crazy! I want to be able to look at my boyfriend and be able to say hey baby let's go 4 wheeling today and just get messed up! Or let's go get some drinks and just hang out with the gang! I don't want a man that is so rough that it hurts and yet I don't want an over protected guy! Yes sweet and thoughtful are things I love in a man! Someone who will send you flowers just because and not just on occasions! What I want is a man to be himself not try to act like a bad boy or try to be something he's not! That is something that I get angry at and that is what made other relationships end! I was looking for a sincere, sweet, honest, loyal and loving boyfriend! I have found all those things in my current boyfriend! I am happy and this has lasted longer then any relationship and I think it'll be permantant soon! Hope this answered your question! =)
Jenna, we sleep together every night!
both
That is cause he does not love you,,,J ho...I mean JLO
lost virginity at 16... 26 years of age now.... can't count no more, i'm addicted... and my sign is an aries... advice to you if you haven't had sex yet, please wait until you are sure you want to spend the rest of your life with this person...
Well im the youngest and well i might feel left out but then im pretty smart so even when we were kids i would commandeer the whole thing.\nMaybe im just a born leader.But it IS annoying especially when we want to go out together as teens and the rents keep telling me to be extra careful compared to the others and keep telling them to take care of me like im not independent on my own.
Turn away from him, as fast as you can.  Whenever he meets somebody with more money, you will be history or he will double dip.  Then you will feel terribly used and low, because he took advantage of you.  I was in a similar situation, so I speak from experience.  I was too blind to notice until I found out he was going out with two more people.  Man can perceive this, and they really take advantage.\n\nI wish you meet somebody with good feelings towards you.  There are plenty of men in the world.\n\nGood luck.
girl - someone below the legal age of consent\nwoman - someone who is above the legal age of consent\nlady - someone who is either side of the age of consent but will not have sex anyway

For me, the dealbreakers are:\n\n- compassion.  I've only ever dated one woman who actually asked what was bothering me when I was clearly distraught.\n- intelligence.  Many guys prefer a woman that can't challenge them, but I get a weird pervy feeling from dating women that are easy to manipulate.\n- wit.  I have to enjoy talking to her if I'm to do it every day for the rest of my life.\n- bonus points: humour.  If she can make me laugh, that's huge.  Being playfully affectionate is pretty much a guaranteed A+.
definately tell an adult, her parent, a counselor, etc.
You have to go to your divorce lawyer an tell him your plans. You have so many days after the papers are sign that you can withdrawl them. I wish you the best of luck!
yes. use good judgement. of course. you can fall in love with anyone if you let it.
Married to him for 15 yrs and then found out he was screwing around....we were kids when we married I ws only 17!  STUPID I know.  The dream is nice, the reality sucks
even though I don't really understand what you wrote, but, he most probably does like you. there are several signs: he's shy around you, he runs away from you, he tries to ignore you.But, this situation could also mean that he dislikes you. if you want to know whether he does or doesn't like you, ask him. you'd have a much better answer.
It can depend on the people, but for most people, yes. Things to consider: if he's 19, he's out of school, and if you're 16, you are most likely in school. Your life is going to change a lot every year for the next three or four years, where as his is going to become more and more stable. Things might be great now, but what changes are coming with you becoming a high school senior? Or a college freshman? Or entering the workforce? Or you getting your own place? All things to think about. Don't do anything that your pastor would disapprove of (assume you had one if you don't) and take it a day at a time. Either it will all work out when both your lives are stable, or you'll have moved on to someone and something different when your life is set.
looks are important, but not exclusively.  the kind of guys that go only for looks are the shallow, self-absorbed type that you probably don't want anyway.\n\nme, I also like intelligence, humour, grace, and charm. (skin colour is irrelevant)
Get involved in all kinds of self improvement including health and fitness.  Take a yoga class.  Body sculpt, wealthier girls prefer attractive males statistics suggest.  Find out what good friends are and make plenty of good friends.  Save a lot of money and cultivate good credit.  Be a real leader.  Don't demand respect, earn respect in your community.  Dress clean and nice clothing.  Keep your house very clean.  Drive safely.  \n\nSorry, I am not a woman.  Just speaking from personal experience and research.  Best to you!
Make sure the feelings are mutual and then go for it.
If your budget allows it, try to contact a Real State professional in St Louis.  They usually knows good tips.\n\nI like to live as close to my job as possible to avoid stress and save time.  Don't worry, services (school, church, etc), are everywhere.
take her children for a while. they dont need to be exposed to that kind of stuff. talk to you siter about it. tell her she cant have her kids back untill she stops.
You probably have more confidence now and people are drawn to that in a person( not cocky just sure of yourself). And the pressure is off them to be popular and around other popular people. They are more mature as you are and can pick friends that has traits that they really like instead of what their other friends like.
Self control
You don't have to give him a gift.  Spending the rest of your lives together should be the greatest gift of all.  You are probably already spending enough money on the wedding itself.  Why not just take a romantic honeymoon or just go somewhere together and spend time together.  Thats what we did after my husband and I married.
Love him as the little brother that he is now.  That would be the best gift.  Can you find anything out about him before seeing him?\n\nMy 8 year old is into baseball right now, perhaps your new little brother is into something similiar.  Try to learn about him before seeing him.\n\nMost of all, accept him as your little brother now.  It's not his fault your Dad did what he did.  It will be your choice however, on whether you accept this boy into your life.  People come in and out of our lives for a reason.
tel u when it happens
On the sidewalk in front of my house, withe three other people watching. It was terrible.
Yep thats life
You said in one big run on sentence that you have not been together for a while and you no longer want to be with him. Sounds to me your not with him.\n\nBut more info is needed to answer. Any kids? How long?
Suggest it to him during lovemaking, how a touch here n a touch there would be nice if there were two, but please think of returning the favor, I have done it all, I wont go into details, but being with 2 women was great, being with a woman and another guy was great...one on one with both was great. If you don't like it at least you did it and know. Sex is trust and trust is key to a lasting healthy relationship, it is not about taking only, so give back and let him know you are willing to experience the extra women with him if he is willing to experience the extra man with you. If he agrees then lay the rules down to be sure there will be no jealousy or certain boundraries won't be crossed such a bisexual areas or if they do happen that there will be no judgement on the other or embarassment.  It is a learning experience. Good luck and enjoy.
not looks i go for personality
Somehow, as rare as I think it is, I would find myself battling between sexes. I don't know why, but there is this power, strenght, and easy going life that men SOMETIMES follow, while women have this suffering,painful,fragile, yet loving life SOMETIMES. The women are argumentative, mentally strong, physically active just as the men are, and they are much more fragile with their hearts, and their soul is much more heavier. They suffer while giving birth to another beautiful human life, and they live complications with their periods, until menopause hits their stage of life.Yet they are intelligent creautures who know what they want,dream,desire,and are extremely passionate about. A mans heart, can carry so much, they can be physically hurt and mentally hurt, but yet, hard to define which of them both will affect them more... They are just so in charge of situations, much more at risk than women, and somehow they have challenges to meet, but never fail to obtain what they so majestically propose to themselves! I know women have been challenging and successfull throughout their lives too, but there are those little painful things that make me want to change into the opposite sex... Men are strong too, but yet, there is this darkness in them that make me want to have second thoughts about changing from my own opposite sex....I don't know which change I would pick..but I do know this...GOD created us a certain way, and that is how we have to live accepting for the rest of our lives...it is no mistake, since he KNOWS where our paths lead! with this said, go through the path that has never been touched...AND leave a trail!
YOU NEED TO BE UP FRONT WITH HIM AND ASK WHATS GOING ON. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU WANTING TO NOT PLAY GAMES WITH HIM. MEN ARE SO COMPLICATED THEY NEVER SAY WHAT THEY ARE TRULY FEELING AND HALF THE TIME THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT. SO DON'T LEAVE IT UP TO HIM TO TELL YOU BECAUSE IT MIGHT NEVER HAPPEN. SO JUST ASK HIM AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS
Don't bother her or annoy her in order to get it.\nTry to get to know her a little first.
If your not ready than dont do it! Wait as long as u can. I was 15 when I did it for the first time and I still regret from this day. And I use to say I loved him too! Now its 10 years later and I dont even care if he exsisted. You have plenty of time. Your virginity is sacred. If you mind says no than follow it.
If you love each other, no one will be able to keep you apart.
Not sure what completetly bisexual is, because bisexual is already undesided on which sex to stick with really or just likes both, whatever.  \nBut question is simple, you can't make anyone do anything, at least not for long, unless they want to do it anyways.
i agree wit Handsome! u really need help
just ask him thought you were husband and wife ??
Ask him if he wants to join you after work for a drink or go to lunch, you will be able to talk more freely outside of work and then see what happens.\nFemales should remember that they can take the first step, some guys are also shy, they may be friendly BUT are scared to make the first move from friendship / general conversation.\nGood luck
LOVE IS PATIENT AND KIND...IT ALWAYS PROTECTS,TRUSTS AND HOPES,LOVE NEVER FAIL..<<<SHORT,SWEET N SIMPLE
C.I m also goin thru the same thing.Even i had a b.f.Things were really fine between us.But then due 2 a misunderstanding\nv broke up.I yet like him.I know how u must b feeling.Why dnt\n u ask her y all of a sudden she changed her mind?Try 2 find\nout if she still feels d same 4 u as b4.Try n talk 2 her as\nsoon as possible b4 its too late......
That is just something we do as parents or brothers and sisters. They love you though and don't really mean anything by it. What you can do is have a talk with them and tell them exactly how it makes you feel..
You know I'm not gonna answer that, 'cause THEY will come find me.
i think he certain like you , just maybe he doesn't also lose the relationship as a good friend , maybe he thinks it is not a good time to be a lover , coz as a lover must face many difficult obstacle to overcome between you and him , maybe he thinks he still needs more times to get along with you. Now that he'd like listen to everything you says, that means he still wants to understand you more.anyway, i think he definitely is a good man. if you think it's time to tell him that i like you , just do it ！
If you were selected to go through the Earth Stargate to the Pegasus Galaxy, then you should feel proud, as only the best and brightest are selected for such a journey.\n\nBut make no mistake, this will be no joyride.  With an active foe such as the Wraith, your demise could be far worse than death.  As such, those who love you may worry for your survival in the far-off city of Atlantis.  That is, if they have the security clearance to know where you are going and what you will be up against.\n\nIn the end, how a decision like this will affect those you love you depends entirely upon your resolve and sturdiness.  It would only affect then if you did not make it back.  So press forward with your best, and tell them you're going fishing in Minnesota.
"ok. there's 3 guys? your ex, a guy who kissed you at the party, and one who blew you off for another girl?\n\nyour first bf will ALWAYS have a special place in your heart. but it doesn't mean that you should get back together with him. it depends on the reason you broke up in the first place. and it may be true that he still has some feelings for you, but it's still not a good enough reason (by itself) to get back together with him. if you want to get back with him, look at it as if he is a new guy. the problem with ex's is that you often base emotions and attraction NOW on memories and events in the PAST. but people change, even in a short time. look at him as he is NOW. if he is right for you, it may be worth taking the risk. but be wary, because it may just be the feelings of ""what did i miss out on?"" or ""what could have been?"" or ""maybe i'll have a second chance?"" that is masking itself as a real attraction now.\n\nThe one who has made no effort to talk to you. Just FORGET about him. He's moved on and you should just disregard what happened between you guys. It did happen, for whatever reason, but it doesn't matter now. You don't want to be with a guy that blows you off! Remember that!\n\nAnd the third guy, who kissed you at the party. It also depends. Was he drunk? Or is he just that type of person. Like you said, maybe he's a player.\n\nThere's another option though. Don't go out with any of them. There's nothing wrong with being single. You learn about yourself... what you like and don't like. It helps you find the most perfect boyfriend for you, when you get to know yourself.\n\nWho do you want to be with? List the reasons why you want to be with them. Does he fulfill your needs in a boyfriend? The needs of love, trust, honesty, respect, willingness to compromise and communicate thoughts and feelings? All relationships need these qualities to have a strong foundation to grow on."
Yes dear, I am male 41 india here and it would be my pleasure to be your freind as I am also in search of freind. We are the flower of same garden and may be can make happy each other can u mail me on ma_ik123@yahoo.com
Uh.. I guess find a solution on yahoo answers.
and you expect what from your question? a few silly answers aren't going to change a lifetime of wuss. you gotta be a tougher dude. quit being so sensitive, a gurl doesn't want to have to compete with you on their level, they want someone who will show their strong side. you don't have one, work on that.
Personally, it seems that if a woman does that, she's not the one for you.  If you find someone that loves you, she won't leave you with an excuse that you loved her too much.  That's just ridiculous.  When you find that special someone, she will love you just as much as you love her. And the more you love her, the happier you both will be.  So don't give up, keep looking, and you'll find her.  And don't be afraid to put yourself out there, cuz someone will love you for who you are.
OOH when he broke up with her he would go out with you. please girl you don't need that why wait for a dead beat cheater. What makes him so god damn special. Girl your young beautiful and a woman you are the princess and there should be no man that should treat you any different. loose him and find someone who will treat you like the princess you know you are. go get um
To whom it may concern, You can deal with your anger buy finding out really what's bothering you. most of the time we get bad alot do to underlined issues ! If you think you getting upset ! go for a walk, right your feeling's down on paper, get your self a ball to squeeze so you can let out your stress. Allway's think before you speek or act ! after all the one really feeling the pain is you. Good Luck
I am a wedding planner, I have a Diploma in event management, it was an 8 week course and alot of fun, the hard part is getting the jobs and the reputation, good idea is to ask a company that is well known if you can work under the wing of someone to get a feel for it before branching out into a bit of DIY. its alot of fun making others dreams come true, but it also alot of work and takes alot of time, some people think that its just phone calls and meetings and that its not that hard, i have been up till all hours making invitations, and place cards, and folding napkins. its an awesome job cos every job you do is different, but its challenging cos everyone thinks and has different expectations
I remember everything.  It was the greatest experience in my life.  I was 15.  It was on the beach.  Blonde hair, blue eyed girl.  Was I good. Probably not.  She was ok with everything I did.  She was younger but experienced.  Typing this just brought back so many memories.\n\nThanks for that.
I was in a similar situation.  Although my BF (now husband) never gave me an ultimatum.  We flew back and forth for a year.\n\nI took my sons (20 & 15 at the time) to visit during spring break.  Then we talked about what they thought about moving, well at least what my 15 yr old thought.  Then we made the decision to move as a family.  We waited until summer and moved a few weeks after school was out.  That gave him time to learn the new area and make some new friends.\n\nThis move was only for 2 years, my husband was active duty military.  The town was terrible, the school was worse.  I eneded up home schooling my son, until we could move back home.  He hated the place and we did have some decipline problems, that promptly went away when we moved back home.\n\nBut we got through it, I am happliy married and he starts college in the fall, on a scholarship.\n\nMake sure your daughter knows that you will not move if she really doesn't want to, but also tell her your reasons.\n\nI guess the moral to the story is, make the decision as a family and then you have to live with the results.

switzerland.....i just recently went their on a visit and seven other different countries and spent 10 months in italy....so its cool and most houses their are EXTREMELY expensive. so you gotta have a big chunk of change to get one anyway.
No, I love my soon-to-be mother in law. In fact sometimes, I love her more than my own mom. She's not the stereotypical overbearing, controlling mother. She's very sweet and lets us do our own thing.
I think you can go to the email provider and tell them she is under age and they will delete the account.
Go home and think about the service provided at the church, and about the prayer i prayed in the church
be his friend. It either friends or driving him totally away
If he is acting like a guff that is one thing but if he starts getting agresive and drinks more then a couple times a week you might have a problem. Talk to him though when you get to the chance and when he isn't drinking. Don't make a fight out of it either that only makes it worse.
i have a crush on one of my profs.  shes a neuro-biologist, and married.  we've had some good, real conversations, and i completely respect her judgement and her marrige.  but i will flirt with her whenever i see her because we both know that its a harmless expression of my desire.  but if she ever becomes my boss, well then i'll have to get a bit more professional and leave it alone.  but she will always have my complete respect, and i will ask her things that i wouldn't ask anyone else.  good luck, and keep it between the ditches.
Not neccessarily, there could be something that is bothering him that he is not telling you.  What you should do is ask him if something is bothering him.

I am sorry, but it does sound like a scam.  Below is a warning put out by our USA State Department on this.\n\nhttp://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_2088.html\n\nEven the Russian Consulate General in Vladivostok, Russia. has put out a warning.\n\nhttp://vladivostok.usconsulate.gov/wwwhacsinternetc.html\n\nTo protect yourself, please read the following:\nhttp://www.antiscam.org/information.shtml

I'd try and find them on Yahoo! People Search.
yes and no.  it depends on the persons involved
you need to tell him that you are not ready to be in a serious relationship yet, because obviously you arent. you need to take some serious time to get over your ex, or if you want to try to go after you ex again do that too. but you are obviously not ready to be dating anyone else yet so you need to tell him that and let him down gently. if you dont break up with him things are only going to get worse because he will just get more and more attached. dont feel too guilty, you really cant help the way you feel. the best thing you can do is let him know you care but the timing is just not right.
probably. try going to a gay dating site or something. you can put in all sorts of details. if you state that you want to meet people from Scotland and put it as essential criteria if you can do that, it should give you some people to choose from.
If you have no money, and they love you, then it's obvious that's better... Disaster can easily take each, your love, or your money away, the only difference is money can be garnered again, but will you ever have opportunity to love that person in this world if they die first?\n\nEverything must be valued, but only in its proper degree, since loving something like money over people is sure to leave you less well off than if you love and care for people so much, that with the friends you gain from it, they'll always be glad to help you out too.\n\nMoney can't really give back like that, since you work to acquire it, but it's other people that make the product or do the service you want to buy with it, so it's always people's value that's traded, never money in itself. \n\nThis can be done without money in just working for them, and they'll help out, so the benefits of both love and money are evident with love, but money hides the value of love from you. Even if someone loves you with your focus on money how will you observe truly what you're not focused on? So with a focus on money true love will always pass you by.\n\nMoney itself is worthless, except it's an agreeable trade between you and what you do value, which is always what others provide for that money, and since we all need that, with or without monetary existence, we love people, and never money - no matter how it may appear superfiscally. ;)
"Heck yeah!  Actually, we men worry that women will ""let themselves go"" after a baby...but what's sexy is a woman that can have kids and still be committed to staying fit and being active.  That is, if you are a guy who is into fit, healthy women.\n\nProblem is, most women change quite a bit after having a baby."
because we are
Most states have a 50/50 law so she will get half of everything. Some states still allow alimony so you may have to pay that as well and all have child support.\n\nAs for a tax write off for you...I doubt it but check with a CPA they should be able to tell you..\n\nAnd also she can claim a portion of your Social Security as well if she wants to.
Well obviously you and your current boyfriend should break up because the you have a feeling that he's cheating. If he's cheating then he has no respect for you or your feelings. You should never stoop down to his level and cheat. That's very immature. You should just call it off and do what makes you happy. Much luck!
HE LIKES YOU! DAH!
oh no no NO!!! perfect opportunity to get out of that relationship! yall jus got into a relationship and he pushing you to do it with him like that? GIRL! you better.. CLINK! CLINK! Lock down and say saranara to him!!!!.. NO means NO!! The fact that he keeps pressuring you to do it when u keep saying No, means that he has absolutely no respect for you yr body and yr wishes.. it will get out of hand! Im tellin you! if you aint ready, then you definitely should leave him! Do it early in the relationship b4 you get too attached to him and u cant let him go.. there are better men out there that will respect you and wait for u when yr ready..
"Compliment: in my first year of collage one of the girls said.""If i were a chocolate she would have eaten me right away""\n\nInsult Well wont call it that way but got to tell, once i met this egoistic girl who asked me my height, when i replied its 5ft 8in.. she said ""I wonder how s-h-i-t could pile up so high"" but later on she did admit that she was kidding and dint mean it."
Sex is safe up until your water breaks!!!!\n\nAs you get bigger, you are gonna find that different positions are better. Don't put undo pressure on the baby.\nHim being on top IS NOT a good idea.\n\nThere are always risks, but I was preg 4x's and I had sex all the way to the end, It's great exercise and keeps you in shape, made delivery easier too! ( I WAS BACK IN MY NORMAL CLOTHES THE NEXT DAY )
"don't suport girls gone wild, don't get me wrong i'm all for the idea but it's a dumb sht making money off what is free if you go to a mardi gras celebration. besides i've seen one of those videos and the camera-man is a jackass, the girls are drunk off their ass, it's not sexy at all it's like a prison photo, ""ok lets see them, turn to the left, turn to the right, drop your pants. good, moving on."" no taste whatsoever. go watch a porn if you want boobies"
Trust me, being a sweet guy and respectful will only get you the opposite.  If you are no challenge to her, she will throw you to the wolves. There are some things that men need to know- that is, no matter how much a woman tells you she likes a sensitive man- never show that you are. Its good to be respectful, but always be strong.  They dont respect a man that is TOO sweet, or sensitive.\n\nLadies, quit telling guys what you fantasize about, because when you get it- you always change your minds!
If you plan it right, 2-3 hours!\n\nHope I made you smile....  Keep your head up!
Be honest and talk to her.
IM SURE IT WILL BE SOME1 THAT IM FIGHTING WITH FOR W/E REASON,IM A FIESTY MAMA! LOL I LIKE SOME1 TO CHALLENGE ME,THAT INTRIGUES ME,ESP IF THEY CAN PROVE THEIR POINT,TO WHERE IM LOST FOR WORDS,THAT WILL BE HIM! LOL CRAZY HUH?
to have 2 boys, 2 girls and 4 dogs when we're ready =)\ncurrently no kids and 3 dogs
I know this is painful for you but the truth is, dude is cheating. big time.  Please trust your instincts.   How broke is his friend that he cant afford his own goddamn condoms????  Dude is sleeping with other women.  I am truly sorry...
It's a big risk especially if it's your boss. There will be favoritism and if it shows, your coworkers will be really upset. Just keep it under wraps. If they know you're dating the boss and you get promoted, they'll say it's because you're dating him, not because you're qualified.\n\nPlus, if you break up he might pick at you for little things and unfairly fire you. Or, things could get awkward. Just be professional in the workplace and keep your relationship outside. Don't bring your personal problems with each other or fights in.
ever heard of birth control
Um, no **** she likes you! Don't tell her that you know!\nFlirt with her descretely, it 'll make her nuts!\n\n(and withall that you've been noticing i think you like her too!)
If she is not into it, don't do it. If you are with her just for that, then you should leave her and find the girl you will be with for her, not for that. Try talking to her. Find out why she isn't into it. Maybe you will have to give it up for a bit.
He is wrong,,,, give him a break,,, let him of the hook.,,, and let him know in no uncertain terms , that you really do not believe him, but you will give him another break, If you ever see another inappropriate picture in his wallet ever again!!!  Oh the 2nd break will be a part of his body ,,,, pick somewhere that hurts,,, \n                    Be nice,, really forgive him,,, do not torture him or anything or even bring it up,,but if it happens again,, time to go off!!!  \n           my husband tried this very same bs,, when we got married, he had pics of his exes behind my framed pics,,, then when i told him to get rid of them or put them away he tried to hide them, i finally ripped them up and threw them all out, because he did not let me keep any pics of my ex,,,\n            1st rule to survive marriage,,,Be loving, be sweet, be about business, take care of home, keep yourself on point,,,and do not be stupid!!!!
"You heard the hype and the spin. Hate the game and the rules but.......they are the rules. Women(back when they were ladies)were looked up to and held with a higher regard. that is why you stood when a lady entered, you held her chair, opened the door for her. She was the Ferrari to the men's Ford. You didn't just treat her with the commonality as you would a toaster or a vacuum. She was a prize to be won, not a commodity to be utilized. She was suppose to be more wise in relationships going for the things most important to the heart and the family. She WAS the anchor to the family. No man could run a successful household with out a very strong woman anchoring it. More was expected of women. Now all that is expected of them it to get in the bedroom, take off the clothes, shut up, and take a cab home, ""I'll call you"" so lose number. Girls today get dogged out because they no longer wanted to shoot for the 'A' because they wanted to be like the boys who no one expected to get pass a ""C-""."
You made me bored to death. GO TO JAIL AND DON'T PASS GO. Jokes I was just joking around, ok? Alright try http://www.wikipedia.org and your brain will be large.

I doubt it, if it is it will be buried for awhile.  Like the vehicles that don't use gas.  Oil co's refuse to allow people to use cars that don't require their product.  A guy said someone already invented the contraption from Grand Theft?  How do I get one and does it burn your rear end?  Those flames look hot!
"First of all, the people that are putting notes in his locker about you are not really your friends. If you want to nip this in the butt, you need to approach this guy yourself and clear the air. It'll be hard and nerve-wracking, but you'll feel better about it in the long run. It'll also show this guy that you've got courage and maturity and that speaks volumes. It's not fair to you to have to be a part of this cruelty and you need to stand up for yourself and let these people know that they can't treat you like that. Who knows? This guy might actually like you and he's too afraid to approach you and if you stand up to your ""friends"" you'll earn a ton of respect points in their eyes."

honey i dont know what to say.well all i can say is that sometimes although ppl love each other,things just dont work out.may be they are not meant to be together.dont worry god is looking at you,he will take care of everything.everything will be okay.stay happy honey.if u want u can mail me at tinasingh1982@yahoo.com.I LOVE YOU.OKAY.smile now
he's out there and he needs you as well
there is no way to tell if its real or not, you'll know when you are in love. dont force it, give it a chance to grow. When it does happen, you wont have to ask, you'll just know
yes all the time,some women not all like to play this game in hopes in hitting it rich one day and not have work any more,if this happens to you fitst get a d.n.a. test done tell when you have the evidende post her picture on the web to warn other
You may think this real corny but it is the truth. Listen when she is talking. It is flattering to have a guy's mind roam about ur bod, but then that means any gurl's bod would do. But what that chick has to say, is hers and hers alone,to u.
"I disagree with some of these answers. I think ""like"" is the one that yells it out and ""love"" is more quiet. Like is that first feeling when youre infatuated and sometimes obsessed with someone. REAL love doesnt happen at first sight, or on one romantic night, it creeps in slowly over the years and is stable and secure. All the butterflies and kisses in the rain, thats just to make movies more interesting."
Because they are the ones that take the risk and leave the nest and leave poor Mom and Dad behind to support all the other siblings that can't make ends meet for some reason or another. And because they are different they become the black sheep. DIFFERENT!!!
Hey!  You could start your own business!  Instead of an on-line dating site, you could host an on-line friend site.  That would be very cool...
I really dont understand how a girl with respect for her self will allow that to happen but if she does then go for it
yeah, go for it. crap on her, p  iss on her f  uck her up the a  ss
Get over it.  Try that out.
WELL YOU ANSWER ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS.SO WHAT THE POINT YOU LADIES NEVER BELIEVE US ANY WAY.

video games are fun, rather than try to get between him why not jump in and be a video game buddy for him. if a girl sat down and played video games along side me without any request on my part i'd probably ask her to marry me hahahaha, but seriously, guys are taught since birth to be like superheros to be strong and wise and to save the day. well in video games we can do that all the time, isn't that nice.
well as a girl i love guys who play sports and i play sports to.so some girls like guys who play sports.but the rest might think that your spending too much time with sports.
for me its his smell.. he has to smell good

I am in Iraq right now my gf is in the states all i can tell u is to trust your bf to do the right thing. its hard to have a long distance relationship i know. but believing in her to do the right thing gets me through the rest of my time over here.
In case you are not sure about the photos. You can contact that person .. chat online with web cam to check if that person looks the same as the photos. It also depends on which website you are referring to. Also go through the success stories of previous members to see what type of people generally login on that website.
Well ya jus gotta b patient
It's never too late. Go ahead and enjoy...
When you feel in your heart that someone makes you happy and it's not just sex or material things that bring about this feeling.

One thing for sure atleast, don't dance to his tunes always. Keep your individuality, your personal identity. In the long run, complete submission may break you.\n\nIn short, be tactful and practical to handle each situation effectively.
its not cheating.i think hes just trying to get you jealous. you do the same n see how he feels
Ur too young 2 think about relationship & if a guy smile or looking at u , he wants 2 get attention frm u or just 4 fun. Ask him if u want the answer but be careful.
look on the net for positions designed to stimulate your clitoris. there are many! good luck.
"Just say, ""Hey""...that seems to be a pretty typical thing to say when you IM someone. Haha!\nJust don't get all stalker-like. IM him, say a few things, and then come out with, ""So, can I ask you a question..."" and then when he says sure, ask. No biggie. If he says he doesn't like you, he must not be worth your time."

I hate to say it, but how people look at interacial relationships will differ greatly from place to place. I personaly have no problem, and think that interacial relationships help broaden the perspectives of both individuals.  There will always be people against it, and it's hardest when one of your family members is truly against it.  All I can say is that if you love the other person it can be great, but stay light hearted with other people and understand that there are a**holes and there are open minded people.
Sorry about the abuse thing -- but you found a nice guy anyway -- good for you.  You will feel less stressed if you do indeed find some time just for you.  But that is tough.  Raising 4 kids is draining even if you wanted all of them.  Don't you have a mom in law who will take them for awhile?  Have you thought of day care, just a day or two per week.  Having time to be by yourself is really important, even if you have to pay a ton for it. And make sure you plan a date once in awhile with your husband, where only you and he are together.  Get away for an overnight trip, even if it is just in a local motel, with some champagne cheese and crackers.... Raising kids is not cheap -- finding time to be by yourself or with your husband isn't cheap either, but you two need to reconnect once in awhile to remind each other who you each are.
She is scared to death of you and of loving you right now because you hurt her deeply.  You chose to leave her rather than stick it out and work through this issue.  That creates a giant trust issue in your relationship.  Now she probably is scared that any time you two argue you are just going to walk out and leave her.  She is probably also thinking that even though you say you are now ok with not having kids that at some point you are going to regret never having kids and blame her.  So she thinks it is better just to go ahead and end this so you can have the kids you want and you can both be happy without each other.

"tell him ""no"", and offer to do something else. no piggy back rides though. let him know it hurts you, and be firm while suggesting other things to do. another approach might be ""eight year olds are big boys- they don't need piggy back rides. want to play checkers?"" or some such."
You need to look at the future. Would you move to his country? would he move to your country? If it is no to both of these questions then you are seriously wasting your time. If the answer is yes, then go with the flow. Enjoy the romance, if it is nothing more that a holiday romance that carries on for a while then enjoy it, don't expect to much from it. If it develops then you will both know what to do when the time is right. But for now be happy and maintain the type of relationship you feel comfortable with, distance is only a number.

Stress could mask the start of cycle.  Hot flashes probably associated with hormonal fluctuation . Either take a Home pregnancy test , or go to the Dr.
Absolutely.  I've got 2 boys, and we don't buy junk food.  When my 4 year old asks for a snack, he asks for broccoli - no lie!  He also likes to eat frozen peas - he calls them frozen green candy.  We're not fanatics about it - he gets a candy from a vending machine every Saturday after his swimming lesson.\n\nI'm determined to raise healthy children.

it means a yes, but he doesnt know how to go from there....(or what to do next)
Well i would not say that u r wasting ur time if u really love him but if you all have an open relationship then sit him doen and talk about it and ask him to be honest with u or mention her name and see how his actions or respones are that should tell u

I have seen alot of sex games on the website http://www.exxxotica.dk. some are funny some are very erotic.
Generally speaking the more charming a guy is, and I mean oozing charm, the more of a player he is.  Practise makes perfect so if he comes across as everything you'v ever dreamed of in a man, chances are he's very well practised and that can only mean one thing.x
do you have your biological mother's full name and possibly her address? maybe you can get information like these first, then probably try to get her number of her friends' or relatives' numbers.\n\ni think you should approach radio stations or any organization who does public services.\n\nor if you could be bolder or braver, and would want to go more public, you can contact maury povich, so you can be on his show. i've watched some people looking for their biological parent/s there and he was able to help some of them. if you're interested on this, you can go to his website: http://www.mauryshow.com/\n\ngood luck. i hope you'll find your mother.
I don't think any boys mom likes their sons girlfriend.\nIts just the way it is, she probably thinks you are a real nice girl, but moms tend to think that we girls are gonna take their precious sons away from them.\nTake it from me i have been with my husband for 8 years and his mom still doesn't like me.\nUnfortunately they have to learn to let go, no don't you dare split with him, show her that you are a lovely girl, and hopefully she will come round, if not then chances are she will lose her sons respect anyway.\nGood luck and hang in there.x
Malaysia :-\nIn the heart of Asia lies a land of many cultures, wonders and attractions. It's a bubbling, bustling melting pot of races and religions where Malays, Indians, Chinese and many other people live together in peace and harmony.

"I think that you need to find a good balance between being a 'nice' guy and a bad boy! It can be very off-putting if you seem like a yes man, one who can't do enough for you and agrees with what you say and what you want to do all the time. It comes across as a bit spineless. (Of course when it is the ""time of the month"", this is exactly how you should act!!) I don't think women like to be treated badly as such but there is a sense of excitement and danger with a slightly edgy type of guy. It makes the 'chase' phase of the relationship last a little longer and for some women this is the best part!\n\nSo I'm not saying, be a real bast*** or anything, just make it seem like you are holding a little of yourself back to make yourself seem aloof and it may just do the trick!\n\nGood luck!"
You should feel absolutely no guilt for lame parents. It is not your fault in any way shape or form. I don't know why they are that way, we cannot explain why some pple are jerks. I would not try anymore and just go on with my life. It sounds to me like you have a wonderful parent. It just happens to be your aunt instead of your biological mother. It sounds like she loves you alot. You should just look at that in a positive aspect and move on with your life. It is their loss anyway, not yours. Good luck to you.
brake it down to him and tell him how you feel about it. but don't brake up with him
"Tell your friend, in a 'very' friendly way, and manner,..calm.. (like she's dying and you really care about her)... and say;  ""you know.. I am like, your best friend, and I'd pretty much help you out any way that I could... but girlfriend, it hurts me to see you going after that guy I like, like that.  Do you want him?  I'll back off, if that is what it takes, but girlfriend... the 'male' species should NEVER come between, 'US.'  Don't you think?""\n\n*just an opinion*"

you make them break up and going to have relationship with him?\nyou love him but how about him? is he in love with you too?\neven if he loves you don't be a fool to break up his relationship with the other gal and start yours.... how long for him to break up with you and go for another gal?\nif he really in love with that gal, no matter what and how hard you try to make them break up... they won't cos their love is true.\n\nif he doesn't love you then why you want them to break up?\nare you looking for a love which is real and love from bottom of his heart or you just want his body?\nyou can break their relationship but you can not erase his memories with her. so think before you do things. good luck.
Yeah i love slapping. Specially the sound of my palm making that sound. I dunno why but your question has made my palm itchy- wait a minute ' i'll slap someone and tell ya
you sick...little man.
Why are you asking questions for smart people only when you were dumb enough to list this in the engagement and wedding section?
not yet..but hopefully this guy will ask me out soon...his name is Clint.
At least 5 times a week.
What you didn't like the answers from the first tiem you ask this question 20 minutes ago?
yeah I'd say so..
She means exactly what she said, she doesn't want to lead you on.  If a girl says something like that up front, usually she isn't ready to date you or has some reason she doesn't want to.  In rare instances she may be looking for you to chase after her, playing hard to get.
if a guy is nice looking and invites her into nice restaurant. also that he is smart and intelligent
female, male!
you can like whoever you want to like as long as there is nothing goin on behind his girls back. getting him to cheat on his girl is not the right way to go about it. tell him how you feel and take it from there but yes if he is worth it then wait for him \ngood luck xx
It is sick. Given that Indian is supposedly reknown for its cultural values, this is like a slap in its face. Such people should be punished by pelting them with stones till they die.
Back off for a while--If she really is into you she'll come back on her own!  If you chase her too much, she'll think you're stalking her and then you'll never get her!
keep pretending, the less people know the better
that's impossible. there's always the chance that you'll be rejected, but being rejected is better than not knowing at all. b/c then you'll be wondering for heaven knows how long, if you and that person were supposed to be together. rejection hurts, yes, i know it does. but it goes away in time. like a cut it heals, but the emotional healing is possibly slower than the physical healing. if you don't ask someone out---if you don't risk that, then what is the point in living? it's all about chance. the worst they can say is no. and if that's the case, there's plenty more people out there...also, they didn't deserve you. your significant other is out there waiting for you, you just have to look---and believe. if you believe enough, anything can happen.
Well I have.  I have known them since 2 and 4.  They spent weekends and holidays with us.  Half way through the 3rd and 5th grades they came to live with us.  They had little or no rules where they were at.  Their Mom left them, they were hurt, and angry.  I just happened to be the one there to take those emotions out on.  They did not like rules, and would call their Mom's and my Husband's family to complain about how they were being treated, and then the Families always tried to interfere.  What am I saying they did interfere.  Their Mom liked to call My Husband Often to see how they were doing, and Oh yeah I'm not their Mom, even though I was  introduced to their Friends and Teachers as such.  Their Dad unpunished them, when they were in trouble, while My Son stayed grounded.  They were mouthy, to an extent, grouchy, snappy, and would go to great lengths to make My life miserable, in between some good times.\n\nThe good news is that was years ago, and they love me dearly, Celebrate Me on Mothers Day, and we have a very close bond.  They found out that I did what I did out of\nTheir best Interest.  But it was a long road, however worth it in the end.\n\nHang in There, and God Bless
Jack saw John nametag when he was working.
Say he can't be youb/f! You deserve better than a man who regrets what you really are!
you can't trust him. I know because the same thing happened to me. We've been married for 20 years and he cheated with one of our employees about a year age. I fired her and he said he'd never do it again.  About 1 month age, i caught him again.  firing her didn't stop anything. We have 2 teenagers and my life is ruined. We are trying to co-exist for the kids, but it's not working out. leave him now and move on.
"I am a female from the USA, and I can tell you , that is so not right, what she is doing to you is so wrong, and that is what we call ""keeping you hanging""  she doesn't want you right now, but she doesn't want to chance that you might find someone else, so, if I were you, I would NOT take her on that holiday with you, tell her you are not waiting on someone who doesn't love you, and tell her to come after her things, if she sees that you mean business, it just might change her mind about her feelings for you,  Why would you want to be with someone that says they don't love you? It sounds to me, that she just wants the holiday, and not you.  And you don't deserve how she is treating you, you are too good for her."
I woke up and grabbed all her presents and put them on her bed and said happy mothers day and brought breakdast in bed she loved it
First you must like and respect yourself. Be current on the news. Work on some hobbies. Read books---even travel books. Smile a lot---sincerely. Take up at least one sport. Be kind and help those who need it---old people, pregnant women, the disabled. Shower everyday and keep yourself well groomed. Always stand straight and don't slouch ever! Wear feminine clothes, decent and not revealing. Don't always have a band of girlfriends around you. All these will help you gain more confidence. Then you can be spotted a mile away.
if its within youre means, and it is a very special lady. then you did the right thing. money means nothing. a great life long marriage means everything. for everything else there is mastercard. sorry about joking. no dude. if she is that special lady you did the right thing. i am kinda poor and i have spent thousands too in a few weeks. just do what you think is right and if it doesnt work just consider it a very valuable lesson, and learn from it. life goes on. but money is just money. dont dwell on it. i wish the best of luck and happiness to you and youre future significant other.
You should tell him.  When I was in high school, I had a similar situation.  I was in love with a guy but was dating his best friend.  I knew that it wasn't his friend that I loved but it was him.  I pondered on the issue many nights and decided that I should just be forward with him and tell him what it was that I really wanted.  So, I told him!  And now, almost 10 years later, we are happily married and have two adorable children.  Girl... you have to go after what you want.  Some men just don't get it when you write it in a letter.  But if you look him in the eye and tell him you love him, he will have no choice but to hear it!  Good luck!
i perfer big dogs:)
Ok...this sounds like the same stuff that I have went through before..Bottom line is ..it was ok as far as he was concerned to do what he did..but when you got him back and was honest he had a problem with it...Girl..Im glad to hear you did this to him. He is a jerk that thinks its ok for men to just f around on women but you showed his a s s didnt you..YOU GO GIRL!! I know you still care for him and thats normal...Just stay cool..he will come around..but in the meantime talk to as many guys as u can...
You have to decide how much you really love or want to be with the new guy you are with because it is not fair to him. It is ok to stay in touch with your ex's as friends but if you are accepting gifts and talking to him all the time then that does not sound like a friendship thing. I stay in touch with all my ex's but I only talk to them once in a while I certainly would not accept gifts from them. My suggestion is for you to sit down and put yourself in you soon to be husbands shoes and see if you would honestly be ok with him doing that to you. As far as your kids liking your old guy better there is nothing you can do about that but if you are really going to get married to this guy the kids have got to develop a relationship with the new guy. \nHope the advice helps all I can say is treat your soon to be husband with the respect and love you expect from him.
You need to back off...although, I don't think you are doing anything to cause him to behave this way. It is no longer innocent flirting when he chooses to complain about his wife to the woman he flirts with...Keep a safe distance, I think he's trying to be a bit more than a flirt.
that's tough no matter what country you're from
Something that my lover gave me once (after a hard days work) and it totally blew my mind.  She invited me in, peeled my dirty clothes off, walked me to her bathroom and helped me slip into the candle lit bubble bath she had made for me.\n\nShe then brought me a beer, then minutes later came into the room naked, carrying a plate with an incredible steak meal she had just made for me.  She sat near the bath-tub, cut my meal for me and fed me a fork-full at a time.  She was a model from New York, and between her beauty, her style, her grace and her generosity she burned that moment in to my mind, and it will be there forever. \n\nThink about it, candle lit bubble bath, a cold beer, a beautiful woman and a great meal.  It wasn't dying and going to heaven, but darn close! --tim--
If her mom is telling her to date at 13 I am concerned

Cuz for a boy it's not going to hurt but for a girl you have to break her ovum(which is dead skin) to get in her vaginal opening
I'd have a hard time trusting him again.  I might give him one (and only one) more chance, but I wouldn't leave him alone with the baby, ever, until he's proven himself with years of good behavior.  \n\nAny more violence, and you should have him arrested and get yourself out of there.  (I'm only giving him a break because of his medical issues.  Make sure that he gets his medication and keeps on it, no matter what.)
Don't waste your time or energy being vindictive...just leave his ass...move on and enjoy your life...he's not worth it!!
"When a boy is in love with a girl, he will do anything it takes to be with her. He wants to be with her as much as he can, and he wants to call her every day. Your 'bf' is not doing those things. It is time for you to read the book ""He's just not that into you"" by Greg Behrendt.\n\nOnce you get over the notion that he loves you, you can open yourself up to find someone who really does."
No.  Wait until a few dates until you get to know each other.
My girlfriend is Asian. Her family wonders why she dates a white guy, and my family wonders why I am dating an Asian lady. But all I know is that I don't see her skin or hair in that way when I look at her, I see them as a small part of who she is and I love who she is. Plus, we are all the same color when you turn off the lights.
NOO! I cant stand them, they are gross! I will never live in a house without a cat, although I love them and would have them anyway, because I have never seen a mouse in my home when I have had a cat inside!\n\n\nloj
i'd be more inclined to say yes if the girl talked to me hereself or even sent me a note
Contact the courthouse and the lawyer who helped you with the divorce. If he divorced you without you knowing what was going on for that to happen? Not trying to be rude but you also said he was living with her and another woman, don't allow someone to play you...
I dont think this is wrong at all!!!! Im friends with alot of my friends boyfriends.....
An arm and a leg...........
I say leave that damn farting husband of yours he sounds like a fairy to me kick his stinking ass out the door oh and tell him i said hello
if u think that is bad a boyfriend tried to rape me before.....if u say no and he isn't willing to wait till u r older then he is not worth it

Check his cell phone calls, his bank account, and smell him when he's been out to see if there are any unusual perfume or other scents on him.
I think she already dumped you.

listen up cupcake...i didn't appreciate all that hootin', hollerin', and whistling at me!!! i know you (and all men) cannot help yourself when you see me, but honey, keep it down! i am more than just your fantasy play toy!!! PFFFT!
this is where you learn to be tolerant. throughout life there will be people who annoy us but we have to learn to have tolerance with these people. it will help you grow into a wonderful adult i promise.
No but you can hide it and avoid it and display it and brag about it and admire it and laugh about it and play with it and yell at it and try to fix it and marry it (I guess you already tried that)and live with it!
Yeah this one.\nA FEMINIST = A hypocrite full of sh*t...
"I'd like to add some things. When they give a gift, it is not wholly altruistic, they like to cancel their ""debt"" to you (in this case by being offered a place to stay). Also don't bother bowing to them because there are tons of different nuances to the bowing ritual that American's wouldn't understand unless they were taught it from a young age. In other words, you're bound to do it wrong. Other than that, my experience with Japanese people has always been positive. They were eager to learn English and were very kind and polite."
Well there used to be another way to date Right?
Go to www.bored.com
"Have a question more than an answer - where do you look for guys?  What are your true interests in life and do you try to meet men while doing those interest?  One final question - are your standards so high that no one can possibly meet them?  Yeah, I guess if you could just place an order and zap, there that person is might be nice.  I don't think there are ever any ""perfect"" matches, but that is what makes life truly wonderful - experiencing what either has to offer.  He is out there for you - you just have to be patient.  In the meantime enjoy life's ride and pleasures along the way.  Best of luck to you!\nJoe"

hot dogs on a stick. ill build a campfire and have a blanket to sit on then cook the hot dogs on a stick and talk to her. after the hot dogs are cook and eat then roast some marshmellows and make smores maybe. ill read a poem i wrote about her and then look at the stars after they come out.
Let's answer that question with some more questions, shall we?\n\nWhen you go down on a woman, where are you focused and is that where she wants you focused? Do you use a hard tongue or soft tongue? Do you use your fingers in addition to your tongue? If so, what are you doing with them - in other words, what kind of motion are you making? Do you listen to how she's breathing? What does it mean when she holds her breath? What does it mean when her legs tense up?\n\nIf a man knows the right answers to all those questions, he's in the game.\n\nIf not, she's better at giving than him, guaranteed.
Do something to help someone.
put her in a baby cot in your own room\n\nwhen she falls asleep then do it

i don't know bubba...does it help if i say i like you...smiles@bubba
If your daughter is a minor, and lives with you, try to impose restrictions to her outings. Don't argue with her, or stop being loving with her, just factually tell her she's not going out later than x, or more than x times a week. \nDon't turn this into a personal problem with her: your problem is with him. Of course, she will be mad at you for not accepting her boyfriend of choice and being happy for her; but she will soon get that (because of all the other things you do for her) that you just want her welfare, even if she continues dating him for a while. \nIt may seem hard, but remember that it won't last forever. The best you can do is probably to watch her welfare and make sure that she doesn't get into trouble. \nLet her know, very subtly, of course, that if she decided to date someone else, she could be out longer, and do funner things. Set her up: if there is any of your friend's sons who you would like as a boyfriend for her, plan for the two families to go out, and allow her to stay up later or do something fun on that occasion. She will associate things together. \nI'm not a parent, so unfortunately I can't give you first hand advice on this matter. I have had boyfriends my parents haven't liked, and they have made me realize that they weren't right for me by doing these things, though. \nGood luck.
just tell her.....i get really sick of waiting..LoL!
tell them all to get a life!!! pash a guy when you are ready not when your so called friends think you are ready!!And if your bf gets argo when you won't pash him tell him it's beacuse his breath stinks.. You do what You wanna do  to hell with everyone else!!! If they talk behind your back they are not your friends!!People will think what they want to think no matter what you do or say.. so just be true to yourself and thats all that matters .
"climb on top of him and move up and down (which is what most guys perfer) make him grab you hips some time and take control. Don't let him take control the whole time though. Lean down towards him and whisper ""nasty sexual things in his ear or just breathe low and slow or moan or all three.  Rock w/ it lean w/ it (literally)Take your body and imagine your are a stripper rolling your body up and and down on him. You could also turn around so your back is to him and do it that way. Have fun!"

Obviously you have problems with in-laws intruding into your relationship. How does your spouse feel about this? More to the point of answering your question ... yes and no. You are, as you say, 'stuck' with them in the sense that they are your legal in-laws. However, that doesn't give them legal status within your relationship as regards the laws of marriage. This being true, you will have to acknowledge them as the in-laws but you can prevent them from having active participation in your marriage if your spouse agrees and you have the back bone to take a stand on the issue.\n\nGood Luck!!
"wow! i felt dizzy hearing your story...i would cry my heart out for about a day...then sort things out too..the next days will be like a living hell...you have to acknowledge what you are feeling so you can be objective with your decision..\n\nfirst, he might be really enjoying the time when you were together and he is convincing his self that he can also build that dreams with you....but suddenly reality strikes back and he's still not over with his ex, did it occur to you that maybe he didn't know that he'll feel that way towards his ex?...it's a possibility too....and the realization of it comes out - he's still in love with her....i think his confession is enough for you to move on....tell him all what you feel and be angry....you are both victims here....but you all the most hurt and there's no easy way out..\n\nno...don't be friends with him anymore..forgetting will not be easy if you keep this nonsense friendship...avoid him and all the things that will remind you of him...you've had enough.....and you need to leave him in the dust...\n\nlife has to go on...""remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck!""\n\nyou can do it....just like i did!"
Hi
I'll get a crate of milk, we may get thirsty, also I'll pick up some water tattoos so we will really fit in.
Not heterosexual girls.  \n\nGirls having sex with girls is more a male fantasy, because someone else can do all the work while they just watch.\n\nHeterosexual girls and women prefer boys and men.  Otherwise, they'd be called bisexual or lesbian.
Sometime making a card and giving her a day at the local spa is not only appreciated but really needed.  Any gift from your heart is the best gift..For me I would like some perfume from Victoria's Secret.
Nope sorry. Then again, I dont live in West Virginia, either, lol.
YES IT IS POSSIBLE!!  My Granparents meet in the sixth grade, NEVER\nDated anyone else and were married 59 years!!\n\nso if you really believe this person is for you Go for it! you will never know untill you try!! best of luck!!
i love one tree hill!!! and charmed too! but i dont get to watch charmed any more, but i have to watch one tree hill every single wed!!
YOU CANT GET ANYONE TO LIKE YOU but show her thta you care and thta youare a nice person
Although there could be several answers to this question, one might want to ask why after 8 years are you not married.  The same thing that attracted him to her has to somehow still be in the picture.  Relationships can go cold, but each person has to remember to respect, trust, and keep the relationship spicey.
They're just crazy. They should be exported and banned. Our jails have too many of them.
"Probably about the same thing I would say if you told me you were a red head, had black or brown hair, not much. Now if you told me your hair was striped red and green or any other mix you might get a ""damn"" out of me."
Yes, absolutely.\n\nGood morning!
No,you don't need to be the same religion or be christened as far as the Catholic church is concerned. You may want to check with the church though because rules change from one to another religion.

My baaaad temper.  I am usually a laid back person, and try to keep it under control, and it usually works out just fine.  Sometimes certain people just push the right buttons though, and Oh my oh my, it's ooooon!!!\n\nI also want to procrastinate less in school, even though I do pretty good, I want to do better.
I really like your question and would like to help u.\nBe care what u felt that day was not love but admiration because u said the boy was beautiful.\nNever love somebody because of beauty but Good habits and caring.\ni would prefer to know u personally but i am far from u .\nI am a Gambian by nationality but staying in Qatar contact me if u wish stcham1@yahoo.com
How about new boots? A robe? A new Ferrari or mustang? I'd welcome those things, myself. Never hurts to have two robes.
"insure him, then kill him.\n\nj/k\n\nhow about you wait for him when he comes to dinner, tell him dinner is booked at a fine restaurant where u made reservations?\n\nor greet him in something irresistably sexy when he comes home?\n\nor book something in advance without telling/asking then inform him the previous evening? e.g. a weekend on the beach or another city?\n\nit depends on your household budget how far you can go, of course, but there are lots of things you can do for *free*\n\nshow up at his office dressed to the nines\nsend him a sexy email at work\nrent a porn the next time u guys have sex, it can spice things up\n\n\nI know from personal experience that sometimes husbands ""phase out"" because they are so stressed about/from work and prefer the safety of routine, espy. since they know you're not going anywhere. Maybe you can think of a way to relax him and make him forget his usual fears/anxieties about life/money/work?\n\nAnother reason could be that he is sexually conservative (because of upbringing or something). In this case, they will act embarrased if you suggest something too kinky/crazy. Break him in gently, if that is the case. Perhaps he wants to do something more romantic, but feels *silly* doing it - again a result of his growing-up environment.\n\nThink of all those things, and try to answer the question ""why"" is he passing out on the couch instead of spending time with the woman he married. That might get you the answers you need."
don't let your friend know evrithing that you do and specially if you like that guy and 2nd be onest with him and let him know with out your friend know .
I, for one, most definately will be going to my Mom's this Sunday.  As well as my grandma's house and my mother-in-law's house.\n\nHappy Mother's Day to all you wonderful Mom's out there!
Stay away from him.  Go tell your parents so they can call the police.

Be yourself! Go ahead and say what's on your mind when you think of something funny, don't think you have to say it in a clever way. People like imperfect people, and you have to be open to people laughing with you, even if it's the way you presented yourself. If you don't get the response to something you say, don't give up! Just move to another topic or talk to a different person. Try and be as open minded as you can be! :]
unfortunately, not a darn thing...\n\nstep-parenting is the hardest job in the world - I am, of course assuming that there are kids involved, otherwise why would you even be bothered by an ex-wif?\n\nseriously, I've been a step for 15 yrs and there is a light at the end of the tunnel... the kids do grow up, you do eventually stop paying for them (at least through the ex!) and the kid's get very wise as to exactly what is going on.\n\njust keep quiet around the kids - devote your time/attention/efforts on them and try to ignore the ex-wif.\n\nI know that doesn't help much - but oh I can think back to all the times she hung up on me - called me every name in the book, lied to the judge about child-support, etc... trust me, our ex was EVIL!  We just married my step-daughter off last summer and that was the absolute last time I will ever have to deal with the ex (financially or emotionally) again - thank God and Amen!\n\nGood Luck - stay strong - stay united!
I am from Colorado and we had to have a license, but it only took about an hour. I'm not sure if you can get one with an out of state driver's license though. Maybe you could try calling the Department of Motor Vehicles out there and see if you need to bring anything with you so you can be prepared ahead of time. Good luck and Congrats!!
"well congratulations on putting your children first.  You are one of the first I have seen on here that does that and I thank you for making a positive contribution to our world by loving your children.  Thank you.   Secondly, yes, you are right, love is conditional.  There is no such thing as unconditional love.  There are cases with parents who don't love their children in many countries including our own.  So love is conditional.  The conditions are different with each individual.  Someone who says I like you too much is saying ""I have tons of fears that I am not able to cope with or calm myself"".  That's immaturity and lack of coping skills.  Not a great sign but with therapy, they can learn to cope better.  It also sounds like fear of abandonmnent.  He most likely wasn't close to one or both of his parents or they have a bad relationship as about 50% of most couples do.   This is traumatic to a child and if they're never given proper coping skills as a child, they don't just magically appear as an adult.    \n\nIt isn't rude to expect unconditional love from a non relative but it is unrealistic.  The key is how he interacts with them. He must respect that they come first, he is responsible for treating them with respect, appropriate discipline, appropriate love and appropriate affection for a non relative.  That is something that you will have to monitor closely until they leave the nest.  It's your responsibility."
i'm a beautiful gay man trapped in a female body... does that make sense???
LOL! You mean to tell me there is really a scientific answer for those white marks?  My mom used to tell me that they represented how many boyfriends/girlfriends a person had! Never really believed it,but hey...it came in handy to answer this question.
It depends where you live - different states have different laws. Check the clerk where it was filed and they should tell you if it was dismissed or if it is still pending and can be finalized.
I feel your pain also!  Our children just dont understand that when they hurt that we hurt!! I am sooooo sorry that it was her best friend because i know that it can be very hard on a 15 year old when they lose anyone close to them. Im sure that your daughter also confided in this friend and told her alot of things about her life that she wishes that she hadn't now. Tell her to just try to take things one day at a time, but take each day with alot of pride also, If the other girl sees that losing her friendship is bothering her than that will only make matters worse....so tell your daughter to just try to ignore everything they are saying(although I know it is hard!!), but if they see that it is not bothering her at all and that she has no problems making NEW friends then the girl will probably come back begging for her friendship!! And IF she does than your daughter needs to tell her NO because with Friends like that she sure does not need any enemies!!!!  I  dont know if this helps any but just thought i would write something because My 15 year old lost her father last year(in a motorcycle accident) and he was her BEST FRIEND and it was very very devastating. But in her case that is a person that she cant ever get back as a friend or father again. Just please make sure you are There for her Every Day until she gets through it though because sometimes things bother them alot more than they let on!!!  You sound like a wonderful mother with a very deep concern for your daughter!!!! Keep up the good work and just always be there for her.                                Hope it helps a little.
Sounds like your friend just wants to be accepted... or possibly... just a ladies man. Unfortunately, as you get older you will see a lot of guys jump from one girl to another. My prediction is that he will date a lot of different girls and when it comes down to it in the end, when he is tired of all the dating, he will find comfort in his best friend... YOU
get the marriage annulled
u feel something hitting u'r chin.... LOL.....

This is a repeat answer but its very important to understand\nyour wife's love language.\nRead THE FIVE LOVE LANGUAGES.\nAccording to Dr. Chapman, the five love languages are Quality Time, Words of Affirmation, Gifts, Acts of Service and Physical Touch. \n\nWOW WARRIOR IM VERY  IMPRESSED!\n \n\nQuality Time refers to spending time together as a couple. People who have this as their love language feel loved when they are taken out on special dates, when their spouse clears the calendar for them, or when the television is turned off in order to have a conversation.\n\n \n\nOthers prefer Words of Affirmation as a way to be shown love. Telling your spouse how you appreciate them, encouraging them, and general words of praise and acceptance all show your love.\n\n \n\nIf Gifts is your spouse's love language, then you need to understand that for them, gifts are not simply material objects -- they are expressions of your love. \n\n \n\nIf your spouse's love language is Acts of Service, they will appreciate your help more than anything. Give them a night off from cooking or other household chores. Repair that leaky faucet. Help them with the yard work. Prepare them a nice lunch to take to work. \n\n \n\nSome people prefer Physical Touch as their love language. A simple touch on the arm, hug or backrub will convey your love to them.  \n\n \n\nProblems occur when spouses do not recognize each other's love language and attempt to show love in ways that are less meaningful to the other spouse. For example, consider if your spouse has the love language of Acts of Service, but you assume they would rather have gifts. They might be appreciative of your presents, but your love would be more obvious to them if you helped them around the house. To them, a cleaned house means more than a box of candy.\n\n \n\nSo find out what your spouse's love language is and show them love in the ways that they can best understand.
I agree, if he's intersted he will call, but honey, its ok for women to break the mold and go for what they want.... If you find him attractive and you want to get to know more about him, Call him but make sure you make it completely slear that your not always going to make the first move and find out why he got your number if he wasnt going to use it? most likely he'll say something like he wasnt sure if you were feeling him and left the ball in your court... be alittle agressive and make that first move adn let him make all the next.
DAMN!THAT'S GOOD!
it's hiding your body, but just barely, imaginations is what is sexy, wondering what is there, not seeing it.
To me, mothers day should be every day, not only once a year.  The same with Valentines day... why do people only go out of their way to impress and outdo each other once a year?  What about telling your loved ones you love them every day and not once a year????  Damn, talk about how commercial our special days have become!
Medical Record processing is a profession that can only \nbe handled either in the physcians office, hospital, facility, etc. The only kind of medical work that can be done from home is transcription. This I know as I work in a doctors office, somebody comes in picks up the tapes, type the notes from home.
Kiss of course. Kissing someone for the first time is both memorable and really turns you on.
Dear friend, You know your friend that told you what he said might be lying. Think about it! Best thing to do is comfront your guy with this question, remember communication is essential in a relationship right along with love and trust. You'll never know till you ask him about the other girl. Watch out for warning signs too! Have a great day and keep on searching til you find the truth. GOOD LUCK

"I've made five BM speeches, and each one gets better.  The first one was short and terrible, so I understand your friends situation.  An excerpt from a Best Man speech I wrote.  I used this last year:\n\n""The origins of Best Man go back to medieval times, when a man would actually STEAL his bride from a neighboring village.  The best man was a trusted friend, chosen for his superior fighting skills to slay off an attack from the bride's understandably angry family during what they considered to be an abduction, but which the groom preferred to call ""the courtship.""  During the ceremony, the Best Man stood to the right of the groom so that his fighting hand would be free to fight anyone who still objected to the wedding.  These were dark times indeed - for a left-handed Best Man.""\n\nSeeing how this is his first, his best bet is to keep it short and sweet.  Pick an anecdote which many know about, but everyone will get, and by which no one will be offended.   If he feels the crowd is diggin' it, perhaps he can throw in another joke, but if he feels like he's losing the crowd, cut to the toast."
..Hi ...That is impossible..you can learn to know some one..\n..and later on..you can be friends..if you have something incomen...but in a short time ?  ...If you have a lot of money(you can buy friends) ...But you Know ..as well as I ..that their not FRIENDS at all! ...\nTake the time to get to know..people...and then move on..to friendship:)\nKind regards...
sometimes i think they should but if kids have good parents then they will be monitoring what they are warching or keeping certian tv shows blocked
Do whats best for the kids, if it bothers you it will show in how they react to him.  Being from a broken family is hard enough on them.  He knows it bothers you and will stop hanging around once you stop caring.  Don't mention it in front of the kids and he will think you no longer care.

It is normal guy. She needs you to confirm yr love because it is hard to be away of you while u r surrounded of other many girls. The long distance relationships make the person as very weak and he/she tend to look for confirmation from the other.\nShe needs yr assistance. GOOD LUCK
"SOmetimes we all just ""need a break"" from our friends, even our best friends.  Everyone's moods change and sometimes people need to be around a different group of people...sometimes that ""break in the action"" helps you realize how great your friends really are, and you might even miss them!"
Give him credit for asking instead of just going.  Are any of your friends going to be there?  If yes tell him of course he can go because you trust him.
I have a friend who started talking with a woman in January. They met in March he asked her to marry him she said yes. he went to north dakota 2x to bring her to where he lives and both times she made up excuse why not to come. today is the day supposedly she is supposed to let him know when she is going to come if at all. So I guess is possible but would recommend getting to know one another more than 3 months.
You know what?  That is soooooooooo true!!  But i havent got a answer for your question.  But that is true.  I was seeing a really good guy who did everything in the world for me and plus was really good looking!  But i was sooooooo not happy!  Not for sure why.  But then again, he was my age and i like older guys.  That could be it, dont know.  That is a really good question.  Hope u get a good answer.  Sorry about my answer!  I know it sucked!
Oh darling please don't be so desperate , all of us feel bad from time to time , but surley the bad time will pass away , nothing lasts forever , nither sadness nor happiness , but you have to open your heart to people and have more freinds , keep urself busy among freinds and family members , concentrate on your study or your work , be happy and look to the bright side , good luck and take care of urself .
OMG, I just banged her!  She's on her way home!
I do but then again I don't. I believe that if you find your soul mate you are lucky because the world is so large that the odds are against you. So I do believe there is someone for everyone, I just don't think many people find that other person.
it is ok. Just be yourself. i'm in 7th you can email if you want Doielle2006@aol.com or donielleatkinson@yahoo.com.
Guys whistle because they can.  But to answer your real question, you should say hi to him and ask him about his day and make small talk like that.  Then let things flow from there.
Do you really love him? If you did, why thing of another man?\nAnd when he's getting selfish ans stingy, well you can too.\n\nenjoy the relationship for as long as you are able to. All da best!\n\nSt

i do....and i love them....
Who?
Let him know yor feelings and see how he responds. Write him a note if your too shy 2 do it in person.
Wrong category, sorry!\nTry Again!!
Any kind of date with a respectful,sweet guy is what I would want..it doesn`t matter what it costs..or if it costs nothing..if he shows me respect,if he is sweet and kind,the date will always be good! :) My heart to yours!
You may want to take sometime and think about what you feel is best. it sounds like you want to please everyone but am afraid of sacrificing you own happiness. This is a decision that only you can make and be happy with.
She just wants to get to it and get it over with.  Foreplay just prolongs it.

My fiancee and I went to a birthday party for our friend last weekend. He ended up drinking way too much! As I pulled into the driveway he announced that he was going to spew... I reached over and opened the door and he didn't move. I didn't want him to do it in my car so I pushed him a bit to get him to lean... Well he passed out and fell out of the car onto our driveway. (Face Plant) Well he is about 3 times the size of me and I couldn't move him. I was laughing so hard I was doing the pee pee dance! LOL\n\n\nPS VIRTUAL D needs to get a life and stop the hate. What an ass....
I have 2 boys, 10 and 8 yrs of age, we play catch, walk the dogs, bike ride, play on the swings, and swim, and anything else I can think of to keep them busy and out of trouble. Sometimes we play board games, but I think they take too long, so not very often.
Reading all the answers above, its a bit scary to read that for so many women, it was a painful experience. I havent had sex with a virgin and so I dont know what it feels to a woman on her first time , but I did have a great time on my first time. Make sure you both care abt each other and enjoy the experience
I want to sing to her:\n\nWhat a friend, what a pal, only now I can see,\nHow you dreamed and you planned all for me,\nI never knew what a mother goes through,\nThere's nothing that you didn't do.\n\nChorus:\nPal of my cradle days, I've needed you always.\nSince I was a baby upon your knee,\nYou sacrificed everything for me.\nI stole the gold from your hair.\nI put the silver threads there,\nI don't know any way I could ever repay,\nPal of my cradle days.\n\nGreatest friend, dearest pal,\nIt was me who caused you\nEvery sorrow and heartache you knew,\nYour face so fair Is wrinkled with care,\nI placed every line that is there,\n\nPal of my cradle days, I've needed you always.\nSince I was a baby upon your knee,\nYou sacrificed everything for me.\nI stole the gold from your hair.\nI put the silver threads there,\nI don't know any way I could ever repay,\nPal of my cradle days.
Leave Ryan alone.  You want him to show all those other girls that you are superior.  You are a shallow person for this.  You really do have a crush on Robert, and should try buttering him up a little.  Stay friends with Shara and stop gushing all over Ryan- everyone can tell you are a punk.  Take Shara out for dinner, or invite her over for a slumber party.  Don't ignore Ryan- treat him as you treat Shara.\nGood Luck and don't try to be superior- it gives everyone a better view of your rear end.
The only way to get over this and start over is with open communication.  If you two are communicating well then he should have no reason to be going behind your back to talk to anyone else.  You need to develop a relationship and you each have to listen to what the other needs and wants in a relationship and figure out how to make that happen so that you two need each other and depend upon each other instead of looking to other people.
park your car in your head.ya have probably more space there.
My best party was when I turned 21, I had a live band, about 300 of my friends and we just had a whole weekend to party and went the whole weekend too...\n\nMy worst party was when my ex-girlfriend and I went to one of my ex-girlfriends co-workers house for dinner and it turned out to be a secret sex party. We both just said goodbye and left...They should have at least brought the subject up previously...
you missed your shot man.  I suggest that if its not easy to find her then move on.
The back of the knee just tickles to me so I couldn't tell you, but I have a thing with the back of my neck, especially when I get my hair washed!
your heart will jump ever time u see him or talk to him.
I sent my mother flowers, balloons and a box of chocolates that arrived to her last night.  We're going to brunch together today.
Good luck.
"Dont ever get a boyfriend/girlfriends name tattooed on you. Its not a ""curse"", but a bad idea. If for ANY reason, you break up, youll regret it forever. I have a lot of tattoos and the only name is my sons. Luckily he cant break up with me, even if he wanted to! =)\n\np.s. my sons dad has my initials tattooed on his back, and we broke up 3 years ago!"
I can't pass up this opportunity...\n\nAsk your mom!
Keep sucking his dick.  He wont leave you than.  I know I didnt leave my girl when she started...
I think you need to escape from this mire as soon as possible. Look after yourself and leave this man and is wife to sort themselves out. Perhaps you need to address some personal issues of your own .. most people would not give a second thought about avoiding such a minefield in the first place... good luck.
You shared a relationship with that person that is like no other.  You know each other in a different way than anyone else ever will.  Former lovers and future lovers will not even experience the same relationship because, I assume, most of us evolve with each intimate relationship.  Plus, you have the added awkwardness of other people around you knowing you 2 as a couple so it is mildly wierd for them as well.
Maybe you should first talk to them, tell them to stop fighting with each other. And I could understand about the acting immature part because I know alot of friends that do, but sometimes its good to just get it out of your system, as long as everyone is having fun with it. But since they dont try to atleast call you or hang out with you then maybe you should try and find new friends that have the same interests as you.
Yeah, take it as a compliment.  Men are sometimes stronger physically, but they're weak-minded.  Women can handle more, and that's something you can definitely be proud of!

Sounds like he has mixed interests, and is overcompensating by completely ignoring you while she is around. Long story short, he likes you too, and doesn't want her to be jealous.
Are you bi-polar? I went through this with an ex. I stuck around until I finally snapped. I packed everything and moved out. He called me crying 2 days later wanted to get back together. But I couldn't put myself through it anymore. It always got worse, and worse. Never better. Sounds like you maybe bi-polar. But I don't know much about your situation from your question. Let me know if I can help in anyway. Good luck
Depends... How bad was your breakup?  You may need to give both her and yourself some time apart.  I'm sure she still cares about your health and would want to know, but make sure the timing is right...  Good luck and take care.
"I can only speak for myself...size DOES matter, but not in the traditional sense for me...I require 'normal' or less than normal size male genitalia due to MY size.  \n\nSo, there's someone for everyone...and John Holmes is NOT for me!  I always say, ""It ain't what ya got, but how ya use it!""\n\nI also believe that if the 'mood' is right, the human body adapts itself to whatever is presented...I'm just not brave enough to try that theory out!"
lock him in the closet this time.
You're like 12 or 13 for asking this question, huh?
well yes,,she is doing it to get you off,if you dont climax you are kind of letting both you and her down
You guys have a difficult task at hand. Cheating for three years... that's a big deal.\nBut, if you guys have decided to work it out, then do just that. Stop reading the emails, cards, etc. It happened and you can't take it back. If you're devoted to making the marriage work, you'll both have to put the past behind you, learn from it and work to make sure it doesn't happen again.\nThis will probably take some counseling. That's a difficult situation for a couple, especially with children.\nGood luck!
"Well initially most guys DO notice outter looks first off. But that fades soon afterwards. In ALOT of cases, even if the girl doesn't have the looks, her attitude and outgoign personality will win out overall. A guy likes to be able to go out with hsi girl, and DO things that have nothing at all to do with sex! Being able to just go out and hang out with her, not having to hold her hand the entire time, but share that time with her doing things together and not having to out perform her, or whatever. Being able to simply enjoy being near her, and talking about REAL stuff. Not "" have you heard about so and so?"" Or , "" So what are your plans for the summer?""  Those are all superficial and merely ice-breaker subjects. Real, down to earth subjects such as, ""What kind of concerts do you like to go to, or have you ever been to one?"" "" What are some of the things you're good at, that you can teach me?""  A guy likes having a chance to show his girl how to do something that she honestly doesn't know how to do. It's a way of being recognized as being capable and that is always an ego booster. But keep it real and honest. Just be yourself, and let your personalities determine whether you're right for each other. But in a more direct answer, it isn't just looks or sex, but compatability and having fun together without feeling tense and worried about what you say or do. Being able to relax and enjoy the time. Looks alone will NOT be enough..... And isn't going to be what gets a guy's attention all the time, just the shallow ones..... Good luck!!"
good one smartiepants. lol. just tell her to quit. thats about all u can do.
Well what any guy would want, is to make love with his beautiful girl. Other than that maybe take him to a game (what ever he likes), the last thing I could think of would be a vacation trip. But hey I don't know, maybe there are other solutions out there. And plus the gift should come from you.
Because their jealous
hey, maybe your classmates didn't want that gal to go with you n spreading news, firstly be conformed n ask her, if thats just a news .n u ask her, u might lose her.coz luv is very sensative so,think before you take any decision.........
may be you have a man trapped inside your body..you know what i mean
You could call him dirty sanchez, but only if he does that to people or even to you.  \nI love to give women dirty sanchez's personally, nothing like smearing that poo around with your johnson
Don't call him. Let him come get in touch with you.\n\nDo not wait around for him for a long while, either, miss. If he does not have the courtesy, decency, and maturity to speak with you about whatever may be troubling him about the current relationship situation, then honestly, you are better off without him. I know that sounds cold, but I feel that you will find it to be quite accurate later on.\n\nBest of luck. If he wants you, he'll call you. If not - brush yourself off, and find a guy who has good sense and enough maturity to talk to you about such matters.
She's a disease-ridden overwealthy, underwhelming, c*mbucket who's gracelessly had enough miles of c*ck to go round the world twice. So no thanks, step-sis or not. Give me Scarlet Johanssen any night...please?
I don´t know where you live, but every country has a site (or two where you can advertise that you are looking for a lost person for free. Also most newspapers will carry such an ad for free. Also try and put his name in a Google search.
"Not all women get to their 30s and are horny all the time.\n\nMuch depends upon the beliefs of the woman themself. Some are in an aroused state all the time, throughout many ""ages"", so you can't go walking down the street saying, ""Horny. Horny. Not horny."""
You can't let your soul die because your husband is not meeting your needs. Get what you need from whatever source you can. Marriage should not do to you what you are describing and you have to do what you can to help yourself.
It's hard, but some time apart to digest what happened will help.  And then calmly talk about it, say it wasn't expected, wasn't planned, but it happened.  Lets move forward.  And accept whatever comes your way.  If he wants to end it, okay, you'll find someone better who'll stick around after sex.  If he wants to work it, take it a little slower until he's comfortable again.  But it'll work out.  You just need a little time to get over all of this.  Good luck!
its all a culture thing -
There would be no problem for you to be a pilot... Yes... you will be away from home some, but you will also have to opportunity to decided what type of work load you will have.  Maybe you work a week on, two weeks off... or a number of many other different ratios.  \n\nYou can also choose to work for one of the regional carriers where you only fly short haul flights.  This will keep you home more.
He was testing you ...seeing if you might be receptive to anything further at a later date.\nHe probably thinks you wouldnt say anything..thats how some men operate who are after women that are already married or involved.\nYou were right to mention it.
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You dont understand the importance of love in ur life untill and unless u fall in love.I always thought love was a passtime for most people and its just that they want have fun do they go around with each other.But i never knew one day i would fall in love with a guy whom i have never met or seen .Only when i fell in love did i realize that now i just cant live without his love. For me  love is certainly my life...but no one understands this unless they actually love someone.
she will let you know
Here's a thing young man, grab a chair and stay up all night beside her bed making sure she is sleeping well.\n\nI'm sure that would be the best expression.
look here http://www.divorcelawinfo.com/states/ohio/ohio.htm
If I could be with my boyfriend right now I would! I miss him so much he is planning on asking me a question once I get back home to the US i have been in the middle east for 7 months now and only one more month to go! I can't wait to be in his arms again! IF I could be home right now i'd kiss him a lot and tell him just how much and show him just how much I missed him! That is what I would do if I could
If want to go for it.  if not,tell him ur not.  If he says he will dump you, dump him because a person who really cares for u would not dump u for not having sex with them
im emma thomsans cosin\ncalled anna\nemail me\nannafigarolilly@yahoo.co.uk
no dude, probably just happy she's meeting you at last !!   \ndo you have a stiff neck ??!
I don't mean to be mean but, if you really LOVE her let her go because your going to hurt her.  This poor woman is in love with you and wants ONLY you.  You on the other hand can only love yourself.  If you want to make this work you need to think with your heart and brain and not your D I C K.  Please make up your mind and keep it in your pants if you want to be with her.  Oh yeah and make sure she knows that your with god knows how many other woman so she can go get her self an STD test.   Grow up, use the college education you are paying for, stop looking for sympathy from everyone out here, and start being a man not a little spoiled boy.  When your selfish choices start hurting a good person it makes you a loser.
Some times I end them with, take care! then my name. Some times, love, John. Those are two good ones.
try www.Metrokc.gov There are links to the King County Superior Court and also links to just about any legal form/document you can think of.
no never
well, don't be desperste. Now listen always be yourself.  know everyone says that but it truly does work. im a guy but i haven't been in a relation ship for but a year in a half now. But being yourself is really appealing to guys. and know who you r. becaus a lot of us guys like girls who be themselves and be comfortable with that, and know who you are. if you need to find youyr self thats what bf are for so all in all find yourself if u havent and be yourself
TELL HIM OR ALWAYS REGRET IT.
Chivalry is a part of our traditional beliefs about the  gender roles. We have the predefined ideas regarding how members of each gender group shall function in the society. These concepts though vary in every community, many of them are common in different parts of the world. Our societies have traditionally been patriarchal. Power was always enjoyed by men, baring only a few examples. This age old impact on our mentality is so deep and universal that not only men think they are powerful but also do the women. So women always love men to be chival. It satisfies their urge for 'attention'. Moreover it is a part of the game called Impression Formation. Is it not the way boys try to impress the opposite sex? It is to show the women that one is potentially the better father of her children, who is caring and resourceful ( very imp.).All the more I think women are typically convenient on this issue. Why do they wish men to pay the dinner, open the car doors for them, buy them flowers, or escort them down the stairs? At the same time they demand the sexual parity, equal treatment to both the sexes, women empowerment.\nAlthough it may sound like a bit accusing for both the parties, no one in fact is to be blamed. We all hold on to the ideas to which we are primed. But with the ever changing references from the 21st century, we certainly must think over our concepts regarding the gender roles, be it chivalry, baby sitting by fathers, and yes the equal pay for equal work.
I know a girl who was molested by her stepfather while she was growing up. She doesn't like to be touched or played with. Her husband died recently and she's afraid that she can't get close to anyone ever again. I'm trying to cure her hangups but keep getting slapped or punched. Still I can't quit trying. She's worth the effort. I don't know how many other girls don't like it but my guess would be less than 10%.
Its hard to believe its love sounds more like infatuation, just try to spend more time with him he will get the idea. 4 years is nothing
"The ""art attack"" website is a pretty good one..."

I have this same issue. I find it helpful to give myself clitoral action with my hand while he's inside. It actually gets me off twice as much as I get the stimulation in both areas simultaneously. And it turns him on even more as well!

I had a bad childhood too, but I learned to make good things of it. I will tell you...we sometimes need to think of ourselves and our well being. We need to learn to do things for ourselves and to make ourselves feel good. It is healthy and it is good for us.\n\nYeah, we should think of others and help others out, but you are important as well.  Sometimes you have to Take care of your needs and problems first and then worry about the needs and problems of others. Sometimes...when we help others, it helps us as well.
no, the jail time isn't worth it
Mohammed ....believe it our not this is not a matrimonial site...
My relationship lasted only two months. Reason for this, he got a medical discharge out of the military. He failed to tell me when we started dating, so I assume that it was going to be a long, committed relationship. The next month decided to break up with me. He told me I am leaving in July (back to his state), and taking you with me is no option. OUCH!!\n\nShortly after that I dated another soldier (I live near a military base, and use a online dating service, so I get plenty of G.I. Joes. ) I dumped him on the second date. So, I've been single quite a long time. Girls watch out for soldiers, (even though my daddy was one). I am still looking ,,, for my man.
Common Sense.*\n\nI'm not going to tell you something unless its only the truth I'm a cooler i have work in strip bars and believe me they don't take the time to talk to someone that long unless there's something going on.\n\nI wish you the best in your choice's you make.\n\nICHOOSETOTELLTHETRUTH
They do it cause they don`t have anything better to do and love pissing people off, they know that it pisses people off.
Most guys dream about putting there hands behind their head and letting the girl do what ever they want. Start with oral and move on to intercourse.
"Okay..A home cooked meal yeah I would have loved it salt or no salt. Knowing myself, I would have offered to get some and came back with the whole store.(just kidding) And if you had planned on seeing him/me again, I would offer to do the cooking, this way you could see how clumsy I was and maybe give me a hand, thus I have taken away your fear of cooking for me and reassured you that the last meal prepared by my culinary sweetheart was a ""masterpiece"""
yes,a lot of them have the some problems .but after is more easier.
"lololol ego boost you driving a BMW Lexus or the Especially-laid SUV and your bank is filled with five or more zero's after a primary number you are ""Well Endowed""!!!!  Size does matter, knowing how to sing works even better, and the way you row that boat is the best. If she stills speaks English after your done....you ain't done yet."
It means she's confident in herself and not afraid of new experiences or people. Why should it be a bad trait in a woman, but a good one when it's a guy?! Anyone notice it's the 21st.century?
i wud like to have 2 kids.....\n\ni feel more than that affects the population growth...
Well, I'm a big movie person, so if we're going to spend $17 on tickets, YEAH..I'm watching the movie! Although, a little grope here and there is fun!
It depends on your mom. For mother's day this year my husband is taking our family to get family portraits done because we've never had them done before. But if he got me shoes of any kind (which I can get any day of the week) I'd be a little hurt. Mother's Day gifts are supposed to come from the heart...something you put thought into rather than something she may have wanted. That's just my opinion though as both a mother and a daughter.
I'm going through the same thing!!!Except there already going out.My best friend is going with this boy i like alot, and he allways flirts with me everytime I see him, and a week ago he was flirting with me and as soon as his girlfriend came in the room he ran to the bathroom and then came out like he was never talking to me!!\n\nJust act like you want to be his girlfriend when your friend isnt around and when she is, be a little bit more than his friend and when he ask's you out your friend would have seen it comeing.Hope it works!!
One word great personality..
i like some one dangerous (in a good way) but not afraid to show a sensitive side some1 to make me laugh and some1 i can trust some1 who accepts me for who i really am\n\ni dont like ppl who pretend to b some1 else coz they dont lke who dey r or bys that r full of em selves and also the opposite of the above\n\nwhy you ask any way??
I'll be your penpal my email is rbpower11@yahoo.com Ilove basket ball and other sports especially SHOPPING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yes it's fine. Chat with me anytime you want to!!
Any marriage can work if both of you want it to.  Just remember each of you might almost give up and the other person is going to have to help that person along.\n\nYou need to figure out how you would live your lives with separate religions, set clear boundaries and respect each other.  HOw will you decorate your home?  Simple things like that can cause huge arguments in the future.\n\nDO you have friends & family that are supportive, because you will need them when ones who aren't supportive want to push you two away from each other.\n\nAnd finally, after making sure you both have the same goals and desires for life, discuss what you would do if you had a child together.  How would they be raised, what religion if any, etc...\n\nJust remember marriage is a committment not to be taken lightly, really look at your future and what you are capable of, look at the reality not the potential (although keep potential in mind)\nand TAKE YOUR TIME!  don't rush into marriage!\n\nGood Luck!
I'm a 33 years old. My husband is 33 we both work a full time job and we have 5 children from age 4-13. My husband and I have been married for almost 11 years. Together we have a home of our own, 2 vehicles, and any and every thing else the children might want they usually get depending on behavior. We spend almost $600 a month on groceries and cleaning supplies. The hardest time of year for us is of course Christmas and the beginning of the school year. But we always manage to do very well anyway.I believe that if you have enough love to give to 4 children that aren't even yours then you will make it.
No, not at all.  Never having dated does not mean you are a loser. \n\nLook about you, see all the others who would consider themselves successful because they have had a string of dates.  \n\nAre they content?  I doubt it.\n\nThink of all the sexually transmitted diseases that they might be carrying and spreading about.\n\nLook for a partner who is clean and chaste who has`nt flaunted themselves about. Marry and settle down and be contented. There won`t be any comparisons.
Anything bigger and better than an Ex's!!!!!!!!  LOL!!!!!!!!!
You know I understand that you feel like your dad works all the time and don't spend any time with you, but let be for real for a second he has to work in order to take care of you and him. Secondly everything is getting more and more expensive to live now.\n\nThe reason why I am telling you this is I am going through the same thing but it is with my husband of 17 years. He works all the time and have some really early leaving in the morning hours and he comes home and he is too tired to share some time with me. I too complained about it and I finally thought about it and I have to say that they have to do what they do in order for us to have a roof over our heads and food on the table.\n\nMy advice I can share with you is simple we both have to get over this and let them do what they do and find something for us to get into doing for ourselves. \n\nLike I said I truly understand but you have to take this like a trooper and let your dad be a dad! Because right now you are being selfish just like me!
Many men find parenthood optional.  It is quite possibly related to the way they themselves were raised.  My ex lives 1000 miles away and sees his kids once every two  years.  He doesn't see anything wrong with this because that's the way his father responded to fatherhood, and my ex doesn't think there is anything emotionally wrong with him.  It's really rather sad, isn't it?
......not only that, but you get to watch her enjoy being a woman.
hey,i really think you're a very sweet guy,but finding love on the net usually doesn't work 99% of the time.why don't you look around your neighbourhood or work-place?you can find a lovely gf there...at least try ok?good luck & cheers!
"Give him the old ""Sniff Test"".....when he's been out late and you don't know where, snatch down his britches and smell his grion area to see if he's been having sex...He won't try to stop you cause he thinks you are going to do something else!  If it's funky, it's someone else's monkey!"
I am told that not telling the truth is the most common attitude.\n\nit is a common reflex in order to protect the official relationship.\n\nDo you little research (pockets, mobile phone, emails etc), if that is important to you. You can also hire a private detective, but that is expensive. Otherwise, just probe some good friends naively and see what they say/ know.\n\nGood luck, it is not pleasant to suspect your partner is having an affair. On the other side, knowing the full truth is not necessarily better. I have been there.\n\nAll the best.
no, youve both moved on. dont fall back it can only lead to heartache.
be fearless.  you cant be shy.  you have to believe that the beautiful women that you are is what he wants.  open your mouth and say hello. inroduce your self let him know that you exist and no one compares to you.  be fearless.  and just know he probalby does like you and already notices you but is afraid to speak too.  so be the initiator.  be quick though, there is always another women who made up her mind yesterday to say hello today.
I would pick being lonely because I have gone through the bad times of my x husband being drunk and taking off for days. Not knowing if he was dead or alive.\nEveryone thought the bottle was his other woman.\nAnd it was for years then one day he moved in with another woman and I was left with a handicapped child.\nI would take the handicapped child any day over the abuse I got from the marriage.\nWhen a handicapped child puts his arms around you and can't speek a word. It puts real meaning to mothers day, especially when all your friend seem to dissappear and you left with nothing else.
Do what your heart think is right. I think that either way your daughter will be happy. I also think that she will understand that she will always have her dad.
ask her
there are many ways, you can cuddle, you can feed him exotic foods,   your g-spot is inside and toward the front, he can stimulate that for you. there is always oral for both of you, full body oil massages finished with 2 party stimulation, toys included will bring you 2 too climactic heights. you can hand massage his manhood also with special oils. both of you with climax. as long as you do this together. some at the same time.\n\ngood luck and i believe in what you are doing, a little praying wouldn't hurt either, need more advice on this matter: strawberry_nocturnal@yahoo.com
yup, and i have two kids by the loser now
Thousands of times ...because I wanted to; why else would I?
Yea your over reacting!  Get over its just her friends guys!
I do. Variety is wonderful. :)
get your mind off of it
it depends on how he laughs with u or talk to you cause if it is in anyway close to flirting he is interested. if he looks a you more than 5 seconds in a way he never has u have something going on
A true friend will never make you feel bad about your self and will never hurt you. You might want to rethink this friendship with this girl. She obviously doesn't sound like a true friend. And just because you have known someone all of your life doesn't make them your bestfriend. A bestfriend should be someone that lifts you up, and never let you fall down.
if that's all you give, you will only get gold diggers.
Books, golf balls, movie passes, booze.
"Probably the best way to know if a guy likes you is to simply ask him, but we all know that can be a challenge. So, here are a few clues to working out if he likes you as much as you like him. \n\nSteps \nExamine his body language. If he likes you, you will see that his body position will lean forward toward you. \nKeep close. Ever get the feeling that somebody is ""in"" your personal space - so much so that you want to step back? If he likes you and you like him, neither of you will step back. \nMake eye contact - if he likes you, he'll get it and hold it. Again, this can be uncomfortable if you don't like him or vice versa. You'll know if you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly. \nBe aware of touching - he might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, or not move his leg if it happens to touch yours. This is a very good sign that he likes you. \nKeep an eye out. His pupils will dilate (get bigger) if he likes you - but this is quite hard to pick up on and you might look a bit weird looking that closely into his eyes. \nSee if he keeps going out of his way to 'bump' into you. \nWatch for him showing interest in things you like and do. \nJoke freely. Does he laugh even if you aren't funny? \nCheck for signs of nervousness: nervous laughter, sweaty palms, fidgeting... \nSmile. A big smile in return probably means the feeling is mutual. \nSee if he always end up in the same line or group as you. \n\nTips \nDoes he make an extra effort to be around you in certain situations (dances, school, etc)? That could be a sign. \nHis friends might often ask you how you feel about him. \nChances are, if your stomach does a flip flop when you see him, his may be doing the same. \nSmile, be yourself, and let biology and fate work their charms. \nYou can always ask a friend to ask him - but that can backfire. \nYou can't really MAKE someone like you - but the best way to be noticed is to be true to yourself, feel good about yourself and never do anything you don't want to do to get someone's affection. \nThink about how you act when you like someone and look for those signs in others. \n\nWarnings \nDon't spend too long trying to find out or you may look like a stalker and this will also backfire."

HOW IS HE TO COMMITE WHEN YOU ARE NOT COMMITED TO HIM IF YOU ARE STILL MARRIED IN HIS MIND YOU ARE HOLDING ON TO YOUR HUSBAND WISHING HE WILL COME BACK TO YOU..... GET THE FREAKIN DIVORCE.... JUST THINK IF HE WANTED TO GET MARRIED TO YOU LEGALLY HE COULD NOT..... GET A CLUE SHOW HIM YOU ARE READY TO MOVE ON COMPLETELY WITH HIM 4EVER......
"So what if he likes you? The question you should be asking is, ""Do you like him?""\nIt appears that you're not mature enough to know how to establish 'boundaries.'\nWake up and distance yourself from this person if this is what you really want."
Who said we don't?  The better you give, the better you get.
Yes, you are right that an affair is always about more than sex...especially if they are still friends.  Your fiancee is sharing his thoughts and feelings with this other girl and not with you.  That is worse than the sexual cheating...it is emotional cheating.  how can he bond with you when he is bonding with her?\n\nI don't think your fiancee is ready for a committed relationship...sounds like he wants his cake and to eat it too.  As long as you are willing to accept that, that is the way it is going to be.  Most guys who cheat, cheat more than once...so even if he breaks up with her, he could cheat again after you are married.  Why would you want that?\n\nI would dump him now and move on...as hard as that is.  Count your blessings that you found out what kind of character he has before you got married.  You deserve someone who thinks you are the world...this guy ain't it.

This sounds like a completely one-sided relationship.  You're always there when he calls.  If he wants to have sex, you're in the mood too.  If he wants to see you, you're available.  What about your needs and desires?  You give him everything he wants and in return you get _________?  If he wanted to see you more often, he'd find a way.  I say, stop being so available to him all the time.  Miss a phone call or two- and be too busy when he finally wants to go to dinner, and see if he fights for your attention.  If he doesn't, it's clear he's not into you any more, and it's time for you to stop wasting your time.  I mean really.  Don't you feel like a babysitter sometimes?  Don't your legs get tired, running after this guy?  Certainly, there is another man out there who will give you the affection you deserve.
I think that everyone has a right answer for this one. I would suggest that you just take it one day at a time and try not to hyperventilate. It will be okay. Just because the both of you are moving on, doesn't mean that it is the end of the world. It just hurts right now, and that is normal. It will hurt until you move on. Just keep trying to take those deep breaths, and everything will be alright. Make sure to eat right, and don't do anything stupid. Go out and do something fun. Don't dwell on it. It will pass. It just takes time.
Ooo.. playground politics... \n\nLet him make the moves, just blank him keep being nice but aloof and eventually he will grow up a little more to stop playing with you and maybe ask you out.\n\nBare in mind that girls grow up quicker than boys at school, so give him a little time. Or just find a real man.\n\nPeace.
Read the book \n\nHis Needs, Her Needs, By Willard harley jr. \n\nsounds like one of you is retaliating due to an unmet need in the marriage. \n\nGod bless
I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR ME I HAVE NO PROBLEM TELLING ANYONE WHAT I HAVE SAID NONE.... I MAY CHANGE WORDS TO DEFUSE THE IMPACT WHEN TELLING THEM.... BUT I ALWAYS TELL THEM IF THERE IS A PROBLEM I MAKE SURE THOUGH I PULL THEM ASIDE AND DO IT.... NOW JUST TO BE CLEAR YOU CAN NOT ALWAYS LISTEN TO WHAT PEOPLE SAY THEY PUT THEIR OWN SPIN ON THE STATEMENT TRYING TO CAUSE FRICTION.... THE BEST THING TO DO IS TALK TO THE PERSON ALONE TO GET THEM TO TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAID WITH NO ONE AROUND IT WILL DIFFUSE ANGER OR PREVENT PEOPLE INSTIGATING UP THE SITUATION
Your 47 and can't figure out why you should pull your own weight? Maybe your girlfriend should keep her kid at home and let your mom keep you.
Only you can decide what to do on this one. We only get one set of parents.  Granted some parents are not good ones. If you cut him off and he were to die would you feel guilty for cutting him off?  If no then go ahead if yes then the time is not right.
Don't settle for just anybody that you meet walking down the street.  Generally men and women are on different wave lengths.  Lots of women are generally melodramatic and some are gold diggers.  Your best bet is to get to know some one for a long period of time but don't attach yourself to just one person, but always be open and honest.  One day you will meet that special one and you will be happy.  Good luck!!
forget them....look, just go and do sumthing fun together, to bring the happiness back and get ur mind off things. maybe take him to a themepark, or to a footy game or sumthin if thats wot he likes. sumthin that u know will defintely get his mind off it. but plz, dnt just ignore the pregnancy. u should both talk about it very seriously aswell. dnt wait till u find out and then freak out. its not healthy. plan ahead. hope that helps.
Do you want to date her?  If so and she doesn't have a boyfriend, just ask her.  What have you got to lose?
no real suggestions for you....just wanted to say congrat to you....best of luck to you and your husband future
he likes you! he wants sex of course but if that was it he would try something whether you had a bf or not. he has a crush and wants to date
Maybe hes afraid of getting hurt. How long ago was he in love with you, if it was too long ago, I would say hes moved on and doesnt want to go back there.
Indian greeting- hello
put her over your knee pull down her pants spank her hard then let her know how u feel u will loose your girlfriend but at least you will hav fun
first of all you should be very close,\nAnd I will ask the opmonent
No probably not.  He's probably not happy with his current relationship or its lacking in some way and he's searching for you to fill that gap.  He may not be wanting sex, but he's definitely interested in something selfish.  Otherwise he wouldn't be putting himself in such a bad situation to hurt his current girlfriend.  Besides, would you want to be friends with someone that had those kind of values?  I mean he does have a girlfriend, and now he's going to his ex to be friends?  pretty shady if you ask me.
Abuse comes when he is up to something and he doesn't know how to clear his conscience. So he makes you mad so as to have a reason to misbehave. By reacting back, that gives him the go ahead. You don't have to swallow his abuses, just don't mind them. Keep a distance from him. Sometimes it helps. That will make him realize your value. We cry when we loose what we didn't know we have. If that doesn't help, then he is up to taking his leave. You can't do anything.
this is true for a guy too.. just that a guy didnt ask this question but u :)
"The good kiss would be one that involves the right feeling and the right guy. At the beginning, it'd be nice to just suck (or gently kiss) his lips, top lip first, then bottom lip next, and up again. Once you both feel comfy and warmed up, you can try using the tongue if you're comfy.\n\nGive him a little hint that you wanna use your tongue by slowly opening your mouth and slowly stick ur tongue in... what I used to do was to suck on his tongue. Also try the ""tongue wrestle""! Can also explore by licking around his teeth and tongue... Some additional stuff you can try are: iced/cold water (the sensation of cold lips on warm is really wow!), cordial drink, soft drink, and also... pop candies! (that popping sensation really feels like fireworks in a passionate kiss!)"
Is there another career that you would like to pursue that would allow you to stay in Utah? That is always an option. Otherwise, you have to choose what is more important to you: 1.) Pursuing your career goals, no matter the costs or 2.) Being ruled by transient emotions. If I were in your shoes, I would move away and pursue my career. Men come and go (and sometimes careers do too) but you can never go wrong improving yourself by furthering your education and striving after your goals and dreams. Don't look at it as running away from home. When you reach a certain point in your life, the world is your oyster! Anywhere in the world could be your home. Best of luck to you!
why don't you slip her a note and tell her how you feel??
"Just the simple fear of ""till death do you part"".  That is the ultimate fear.  That is, until you have found that one true love.  Then, it is easy, because you mean it.  It is the same as ""I LOVE YOU"".  I can not say it unless i mean it.  My wife and kids are the only ones who have ever heard me say it."
I would give anything to save the life of my child, up to and including my own life.  I would give a kidney, a lung, even my heart if the doctors would let me do it!  \n\nI would sell myself into lifelong servitude if it would save her.  I would agree to live in a room never speaking to another living soul for the rest of my life.  There is NOTHING I would not do if it would save my child's life!!!

Love her. Be selfless. Be good to her. Love her for her flaws..and virtue. Love her in a manner that she wishes to be loved more.
why bother asking? Like they have standards anyway. Just tape a bunch of honeybuns to yourself and walk across the weight watchers waiting room. Bllleyghit
Ok, well yesterday I had a reason to be moody!! I went to the dealership that advertised selling vehicles for as little as $5.00~figured it would be a gimmick. When I got there, there was a select number of different vehicles (in really great condition) that had the green balloons floating from them. The deal was if you were sitting in one of these vehicles at 10:00, you get the deal. Well, I have 3 kids and one more on the way, and 2 step-kids. Ya, a lot, I know, and that's why I was looking at a '03 Ford Windstar (ya, a mini-van) with 94,000 miles. Well, of course I had to bring my kids, so I invited my friend to come with so she could help watch them while I got my deal. 10 minutes to 10 she takes the older ones to get movies about a half a block away, leaving me with a kicking and screaming 2 year old. Ya, I went to find her to ask what's up with that? By the time I got back, the dealer putting a new sticker on the windows of unoccupied vehicles, the van was now $1200. I was pissed, knowing that I was 30 seconds too late for a much cheaper price. Still at $1200, it was a steal. About 25 minutes later I come back with the money, only to see the price is now 12,411. Seems the second deal was only good for half hour. So ya, I was moody yesterday, but I am hoping that today goes much better!! \n\nI hope YOU have a great day too!!
I could understand your urge to meet him, but it may not be a good idea. Guessing you met online, it's quite risky going thousands of miles away to some place alone. Now, if you were visiting with your own folks to IL, ask him to visit and meet your family. Never alone! Just to scare you a li'l more: there are plenty of people (older) who'd assume the fake identity of a 15 year old boy, to allure some 16 year old girl from somewhere else to have her visit him. Kidnapping, rape even murders may occur following that. Well, you get the picture. I know this is awful, but this happens, and many a times unfortunately.
You cant be serious?! that is disgusting!
My advice is that If you have to ask, she probably isn't. Next she will say that it wasn't her fault and he was flirting with her. You shouldn't trust her and you obviously don't or you wouldn't be asking. You are right to do so. Good Luck!
coyote ugly aint crap aint worth the energy\nhow about moscow like the hungry duck\nor something in the area of nightflight\nor the white rhino\nbut it would have to be different befoerr i will invest again,to many idiots try to run bars and they simply mess them up totally, :)
tell her to face it...u thot u are adult enough to do it..now ACTUALLY be adult enough to face it..
she is not honest at all..if there was nothing between her and your friend she could have told you that she's been talking to him.talk to her and also tel your friend that what he's doing is not fair...it shows that they made a deal that you should not know that they date..YOUR FRIEND IS A SNAKE !!!!!!!!!!how can he do this to you?NEVER TRUST A FRIEND.
some black guys do, but im pretty sure that not all of them do...........they all have their own opinion ya know.........
Kelsey, at 13 you are loved by many.... just look around you. If you are stressing about boys, don't. You will find yourself buried in boys before you know it!!! Enjoy being 13, and don't let love and life get to you. It's called enjoying your youth... don't waste it worrying about boys. Good luck!
At mine, my Maid of Honor (who hosted it) had everyone write down like, three things they thought I might get, and they had to be really specific (not just “a thong” but “a black, lacy thong with ties on the side”, etc) and couldn’t be their own gift.  Whoever had the most right got a prize.  A lot of my friends also do something where they ask everyone who comes to bring a pair of underwear (new and in the bride’s size) that somehow shows their personality, unwrapped (along with their gift).  Then every pair is put in a basket or something, and the bride is supposed to guess who brought each one.  We’ve also done things like giving everyone a paper with questions about the bride, like a test, and whoever gets the most right wins – not specific to lingerie, but it can be an interesting game.  This one’s kind of corny, but divide the guests into two or three groups (depending on how many people there are), send the bride out of the room, and have the groups compete to make a wedding dress on one of their group members out of toilet paper, and make the bride decide which one’s best.  Good luck!
"Okay has it always been like this; there could be a chance she has an common infection. If not, why don't you plan a ""surprise bubble bath date"" for the two of you (believe me she will appreciate it) with candlelight, some mood music, etc. Bathe each other and tell her how you love the way she smells after the bath and what a turn on this is for you. If the ""fragrance"" has not changed, then you need to tell her that you think may be something is going on down there and you are concerned for her and suggest a Dr checkup.  You could skip the bath, and go directly to the speech, but if its just hygiene, you are sure to miss out on what is bound to be a repeat ""appreciation"" performance by your girl."
seems like the two of you have grown apart, you need to dedicate time to each other, go on dates, reconnect without the expectations and responsibilities you currently live with...counseling may help...but be prepared, you simply may have fallen out of love...good luck
Tell the person that was about to ask me out to wait a few minutes.  If my friend is drunk and wandering I want to make sure they're ok.  My friends safety is a lot more important than a date.
You are, she's not.
might be you would have to talk to your doctor about it to find out.
not long but you would be for police brutality and abuse and assault and a whole list of things.\ngo to russia its more your type,and when you try this crap they will simply disappear you
What kind of modeling?  I was say about anything in the beauty industry, that is what you know right?  Sounds crazy but some of the women that run these high end make up places pull down some serious money, and being a ex model would be a draw for customers
????? lol come on now no
"I can't believe that you would even consider using a friend like that, even if she is not a real close one. \nWhat kind of person are you???\nIf you want ""nonrelation sex"" as you put it, go to a prostitute."
When the idea of loosing that person causes you the greatest pain ever, when you cant stop thinking about the person, when you have memorized the sent of his Cologne, when you can feel the persons lips touching yours even when they are not there, when you see a future w/this person, when you think they are the most beautiful and wonderful person in the world, when you find yourself daydreaming about them, when you hear there name it brings a smile to your face, when you see them you feel like you breathe fresh air. There are just so many things that true love makes you feel and usually everything is unconsciously, but when you stop and think about it, you realize that no other person has ever and can ever make you feel this way.
denim jacket pants to match with it and a vintage tee or spaghetti top.
well it could work if you both are saying the truth...and if you both put effort in the relationship it should just work out perfectly
First of all there is life here and now.If you can believe that it is not to much of a stretch to extend it somehow.I don't mean keep alive like you are now,I mean a part of you[soul] lives on and never dies.It is not subject to temporal rules we are now,it will soon be free of the material confines of earthly existence.To establish a new existance based on a spiritual level.A more direct answer would be I have left my body three times.Once from being knocked out playing football,once from a drug overdose,one time during meditation.But they all were the same no unconciousness just a quick painless transference from here to there then continue on.Hope I'm not being to creepy, but it is a serious ?
just give me the points all the rest of the answers are stupid. did anyone tell you how beautiful you are???pirate wench????i dont think so more like fallen angel.
Well if yall had of seen the guy I was with last nite you would think twice he is underweight.  But he makes up for it in other parts of his body. :)
if he is really your friend you should respect the friendship - friends last a lot longer then most relationships
take a step back from the daily norm, evaluate your life and set up goals, then strive to acheive those goals, youll find that by doing this you will enjoy life and all of the aspects that exhist within it. start off small, set up a daily goal and try to meet it everyday and progress from there. good luck.
"tell him he is good and that you love him...love his body...and you love what he does to your body. If he continues to think he ""sucks""...I would say there are bigger issues in his life that he is worried about...."
a little bit of both
premature ejaculation.  if it is not used alot he may become stimulated too fast.  if he would like to prolong the use of his love pole, he needs to use it more and practice long stimulation.\n\nPremature ejaculation, also known as rapid ejaculation, or by the Latin term ejaculatio praecox, is the most common sexual problem in men, characterized by a lack of voluntary control over ejaculation. Masters and Johnson stated that a man suffers from premature ejaculation if he ejaculates before his partner achieves orgasm in more than fifty percent of his sexual encounters. Other sex researchers have defined premature ejaculation as occurring if the man ejaculates within two minutes of penetration; however, a survey by Alfred Kinsey in the 1950s demonstrated that three quarters of men ejaculated within two minutes of penetration in over half of their sexual encounters. Today, most sex therapists understand premature ejaculation as occurring when a lack of ejaculatory control interferes with sexual or emotional well-being in one or both partners. An estimated thirty percent of men suffer from premature ejaculation on a consistent basis.
Remind him of this:\nA young man serving life in prison for vehicular homicide is awakened by voices from above:\nI forgive you mr drunk driver, the voice whispered in his ear, but i want you to know that its only because i like it up hear i only wanted to get my ball thats all i wanted to do but on earth i didn't get to play again and its all because of you.  you knew that when you drink your abilities are impaired, but because you chose to drink and drive is the reason why i'm dead you had so many warnings all of which you simply ignored, now you've killed tow people to that you'll have to answer to God, but I forgive you mr drunk driver and my mommy she forgives you too, she is here because she tried to save my life I only hope the Lord has mercy on you....\n\nITS 2010...IT COULD BE YOU or HIM OR YOUR FRIEND OR THAT LADY DOWN THE STREET OR...OMG...NOOOOOOOOOO!
Please calm down.  Men like their space.  We women bring a lot of emotions into a relationship men are not the same.  Give him his space.  If you have doubts then confront him.
call the cops on them
Got to yahoo, chat link. then jump in, or click someones name and chat to them via here
Since you have not provided much info, it limits the answers you could be given.  It could be that you are shy and speaking to people is difficult.  The other thing that comes to mind is that you are insecure and have poor self esteem.  It just makes you not sure enough of yourself and you are fearful of saying the wrong things or in the wrong way.  You probably need to read some books like, 'How to Win Friends and Influence People'.  You may also need to get some counseling on developing your self esteem.  Good luck to you in your search!
If you are uncomfortable by her touching you, by all means, let her know.  For some people - it is their way - but for others, like yourself, it is not part of your personality.\n\nJust explain very calmly that you would appreciate it if she did not touch you as she does simply because you do not feel comfortable.
You have been giving to your family for so long you lost a connection to yourself.  Go take a class at a community college or something, find your passions again.
Well for our first anniversary we are spending a night at a luxurious hotel in the city (we found a deal that offered 50% off a Queen suite!) then we have Gold Class tickets for the cinema which he bought me months ago for my birthday, and then I thought we could go bowling like we did on our first date. \n\nSo if you like the sound of that, see if you can't find some good deals at hotels, a lunch river cruise is also nice and not overly expensive and Gold class cinemas are way good!
I am only responding here because Paula J's answer made me want to puke.  I am happily married and could not care less if people are gay.  Go thump your bible somewhere else, FREAK!!!!\n\nJust go to the Hillcrest area of San Diego.
Open your mouth and speak.  And how in the world do you know you want to stay together with her?  Good grief, you only know her as a co-worker, not a girlfriend.  She may drive you nuts once you start dating.
confidence. and a hot body
Like your nickname says, behave!
She is a coc k teaser
There is no tongue in a woman's genital area.  I don't know what kind of women you've been hanging around, but I suggest you run very fast away from them.
WOW! well if he is that nice n good looking that he can have any girl he want to but even then he is being you that just tell the answer that he really like you and wants to be with you because if he was just horney for sex i am sure he would have gotten it from else where.i would have to say wait around and really dont give anything up you have start taking steps to a long term strong relationship i am sure he respect you alot for this.Congratz\nbye
You should talk to him, tell him you trust him but you're worried about what she might do, if he doesn't react, then maybe you should. It happened to me once, i just called the girl and asked her what she was up to and told her to please leave us alone.
"Most old age homes are horrible and don't take care of your love ones, trust me I know, one of my relatives died in one from neglect. There's an old saying, ""they have taken care of you, now it's time to take care of them."" I would never send my parents to a home. My brothers, sisters and I took care of our father when diabetes took his sight, had 2 heart attacks, was told he only had six months to live, gone through 2 amputations, and damaged his kidneys. My mother has hypertension and kidney failure and I will be there for her until the very end. Some people do not give their parents enough credit for the sacrifices and love that they have given them. I personally believe that placing parents in a home is a terrible resort unless you are completely incapable of taking care of them yourself."
I can understand how he would feel hurt and angry towards you, however, since he chose to stay with you after finding out, he needs to come to terms with his feelings.  If he can't then he's not being fair to you or to himself.  He either needs to let it go, or if he can not, then he needs to let you go.
It sounds like you are still in doubt of taking her back.Only you know how you are feeling.I guess the first question i would have to ask was why you both went your separate ways to begin with?You should always be forgiving,but this doesn't mean you have to repeat the same issues.If you truly love your wife with a whole heart and can let the past be the past,then this could be good for the both of you and i am sure it would work out,it might be different and hard at first after 15 years,but true love always finds it way of bringing things to its level.Again though if you have any doubts i would take this very slow and follow your heart 9 times out of 10 it will lead you right.Hope everything works in your favor.Good Luck to you Both!
14 - 16 DEPENDING ON HOW MENTALLY MATURE SHE IS
i read somehwere that it was sex for a year would do that
It's not age that matters its how much they know about life and how much they can handle. If you think you're ready for marriage and kids then babysit for a weekend and have your partner help you. You can learn how each other would be with kids and responsibilities. It also has alot to do with the maturity level and maturity only comes with time and lifes experiences.
It is absolutely possible.  Two of my long term relationships ended on good terms.  One relationship lasted 2 1/2 years and he's still my best friend (now he's married).  Other relationship lasted 7 years and it was a mutual decision for us to break up and we still talk occasionally.
I don't have a problem with it but I am not everybody.  I think many people have a problem with it out of ignorance, fear of the unknown, due to stereotypes, etc.  Hatred and prejudice are learned...which means they were taught to have these feelings.  I hope someday that hatred toward people who are different, no longer exists.
if he cant get passed it, it might not be worth it so i would just give your best and if thats not enough its his loss
Good intentions play a huge role.  No matter how much you try to manipulate or lie, your true feelings will show not just in the way you talk but in the way you behave.  It's better to be honest with good intentions or else there will be repercussions sooner or later.  If you have bad intentions with a woman, you shouldn't be with her at all and the relationship will inevitably not be smooth.
I think he got scared.  He is probably very young.
There are too many possible reasons why he has not been over.  Some might show that he still has interest but has been in a position where this just is not possible right now.  Some might prove that he has lost all interest or is now seeing someone else.\n\nJust remember that crushes do not last forever.  No matter how intense, they tend to lesson with time.  If you need to find out what is going on, call him, just to say that you have been thinking about him.  You should be able to figure out what is going on by how he reacts.
A ticket to some sporting event, like a baseball game or basketball game.
It sucked big time, that is it, found out she did not like me and just wanted to play around, good for her man
if ur in love ull know how it feels u dont need someone else to tell u what they feel like. If u r in love and he loves u back then go for it whats stopping u
There are all types of girls few like few dont..everyone is different..well i dont like..
I would double date with our boyfriends, and  then switch to see if they could tell us apart. I would play tricks on the teachers at school. I would try and see if I could trick my parents(that would be a bit trickier to do). I would definitely have my smarter twin take tests for me!!
the person above me is a hypocrite, got one of the freakiest avatars around. And to answer your question, Well yea i think yahoo added to many features that people try to blend in poorly
Strange Question. But Simple answer. You know about him only 3 Months. Please take some more time to know about him personally. You were working with him. This is a good chance to know about him more. Just have a look around him, like How he interacts with other workers? If you feel good, Go along with him. \n=> Working in same place.\nYou raise this question directly to him. Let him to say his opinion. If you like his reason then, he goes well. You can understand his thinking/knowledge when you raise it to him. \n=> Younger\nIt is just one year. So, never mind. Basically, Girls will have a less period time(Sexual Periods). But Guys will have long period. To compensate that,  a guy have to marry elder girl to him. Its not at all followed today. Since, Most of them are not interested in sex after one or two decade. After that they are fully interested to think in real love.\nSo, Don't worry about the age. (And your case you are 100% Eligible)\n==>Too Young.\nThis is another Good point. You are having years. This time you could know him fully. You could understand his real love by his patience. If he fails, you could ignore him easily. You just ask him to achieve more. \n==> You love him:\nGood. Congrats for you both. Have a better thinking before moving further.
some of my friends didnt go to prom and instead got dressed up and went to eat at a really fancy restaraunt
The situation is either simple or complicated. He could have honestly cared for her and he may say i love you yet that doesn't mean that he is in love with her.\nIf he is the type of person that gets very close and have childhood friendships up to date then no worries. If you feel threatened by it then ask him. After all no one here can answer your question, only he can.
I have a crush I haven't asked them out because I'm shy
Not all are.  I am faithful.
Simple.  Talk to her over a coffee and explain what you want.  Be honest and complimentary about her.
I would like to be in a paradise earth filled with people that view themselves as brothers and sisters.  No more wars, sickness, death, crime, sadness,or misery.
my friend is 15 and pregnant.. eventually people will stop the gossip and just get used to it.. but until then talk to her.. and try getting her to do stuff that doesnt involve being in the spotlight where everyone is gonna talk
Find her a husband!!!!!!\nBe the god father to her baby
Don't nag him. Nagging just makes them more stubborn. Rather show appreciation for what he DOES do. Compliment his efforts and it will build his self-esteem and make him feel appreciated. Think of something that you can compliment him for if he does nothing. Reward him for his efforts. Give him good sex for doing something around the house and let him know that it's because of that. This might encourage him to do more things for you. ;)
If you're in love, you'll know. Don't trust other people's opinion, because only you know how you feel.
No but could be your boy friend
Well kitty if that is ure real name, i am not bored HAHAHAHA,\nhow about i dance like the robot or some thing crazy like that, or we could make out :). BEEP! :) Flea says hi to Sally.
"Be yourself.  This is a very difficult question to answer.  Some are able to answer it quickly (I know some who realized it when they were about 10) and some are able to answer it very late (I know one guy who was not able to answer that question until his 40s).  This takes alot of insterspection.  There are also the ""societal norms.""  But don't be afraid of yourself.  Perhaps you will realize this was a ""momentary"" feeling, or you will realize that this is how you've ""really"" been feeling.  Either way, you will become a greater person."
I am sure there might be since someone in that county would have to do it. I wouldn't think it would cost much more. Ask your county court offices and see what they say..........
You can try a mall, or - better yet - a department store. Every single Wal-Mart in my area has, just inside the entry doors, several arcade-like machines that sell and engrave dog tags, pins, and other such things.\n\nI would definitely recommend that you look there.\n\nBy the way, that is a great idea for a gift. I am sure that he will really enjoy it.
keep doing what you're doing, its seems like if you are a real true friend, and your friend is very lucky or should i say, she's very bless to have you, now in days is very hard to have a friend like you, someone that is always there in good times and bad times, so just keep showing her how much you love her, and tell her every day how special she is for you. God bless you and God bless your friend.
Yes you are.  Until he comes back your not on his mind. You gave him the green light, so just go out and enjoy yourself and when he comes back if the two weeks you were together meant anything to him he'll call.
1.if he follows you every where, or dosn't go anywhere with you.\n2.he'll stutter alot\n3.he's always looking at you\n4.he dosn't talk to other girls very much when he's around you\n5.he asks you for your number, and then gives you an excuse, other than that he likes you

because they want to SARAH ELIZABETH MATTHEWS
Why can't people on here use proper english and grammar?! it drives me mad! ask your question properly and maybe people will answer!
Yeah, he had a new girl to run to but things turned out to be hell, so now he wants you back.. I had a guy like that.... I did every and any thing for him and he just treated me like crap... He said we should be friends and started dating someone about two months later.... She turned out to be controlling and crazy.... So he comes running back to me and telling me he loves me and he didn't realize how good he had it with me... And I told him to kiss my a**.... It was hard because I really loved him, but I had to do what's best for me...If he's not worth it, then don't waste your time with him...
Nothing, just take your medicine.
If a person has been named in a divorce filing then that person would be served by an officer of the court with papers advising them of the pending divorce suit. It is possible that the person named in the divorce to be served is not locatable in which case they may have never been served with these papers. In such a case the courts would use a locator service to attempt to find and serve this person with the legal documents. If a person believes there is a filing for divorce pending against them but has not received notification then you may contact the clerk of courts in your county to inquire as to if this is true or not.\n\nBelow is a link to the State of Texas which will provide a means for requesting status of both marriages and divorces if they have already been approved by the courts and have been finalized.\n\n\nhttp://www.dshs.state.tx.us/vs/reqproc/faq/mardiv.shtm#a2\n\n\nGood Luck!!
eight and 1/2 months. Fresh out the oven.
I was 16 and yes it was painful.  As a mature older adult, I look back on my youth frequently and question some of the things I did.  I know that I had sex when I was young because I was looking for something or someone who cared about me or made me feel special or significant.  My parents were very strict and never spoke with me about sex or anything of any controversial nature.  I know now that I was way too young to appreciate sex and relationships and that I only used sex as a way to feel connected to someone.  WRONG REASON at 16!!!  I believe that sex is an important part of a healthy mature relationship and I don't believe in abstinence until you are married, but I do think that sex at too young an age leads to somewhat more promiscuous sex, irresponsible sex, and loveless sex.  Sex in a healthy mature relationship can be amazing and exciting. But I believe that when young people experiment with sex too early it can lead to a lacksadaisical approach to intimacy in adult years.  Most young people don't have the life experience to fully comprehend the emotions associated with sex - good or bad.
Because they can't read yet, so they just get into which ever queue attracts their attention.
i'm not sure what ur asking but it sounds like u want to have sex with ur aunt??? that's sick
It's a possibility that he likes her but what does him liking her consist of?  Is he ready to take on the responsibility of her baby or does he just want to pump another baby in her?  She needs to concentrate on having her baby first, deal with him later and take it very slow!
YES THEY DO!!! (to an extent of course) For the most part its not what you got, its what you do with it that counts!
I would read it for sure. Who writes letters anymore. All my mailbox gives me are bills lol
i with you 100 % email is on it way
well i never say this to anybody unless its my gf...but i like it when a girl is wearing a red bra or red underwear...it drives me wild..yeah abit weird but oh well
"My dear fellow, you can't.  Playing hard to get is emotional insurance for women.  If you respond favorably to them, then they will say, ""Yes, I liked you all along.""  However, if you respond unfavorably, then they will say, ""What are you talking about, I wasn't giving off any signs, I don't like you, what are you talking about?""  Emotional insurance...100% Coverage Plan if she becomes totally embarrassed.  If you suspect she is playing hard to get, just ask yourself if you are prepared to play her other little games even if you do get her because she just might be into heart games and not a mature way of dealing with love."
Being old-fashioned is great, and there are very few of us left. Let the guy approach you and ask you out first. This doesn't mean you can't speak with him and it doesn't mean you have to avoid him altogether. You can still get to know him but ultimately let him ask you out. I am the same way and love it when a guy will make the first move. Same goes for marriage proposals -- I would never be able to ask a man to marry me -- I would want him to ask me instead. Good luck and hang in there sweetie!
I think you're making a very good choice in just staying friends.  I have a friend that I am in love with, but they are Bi- so I try to not let emotions take the better of me.  I respect the fact that he's not that way.  He knows I like him, but he still is a very close friend.  He's cool with that fact.  I'm able to tell him some of my deepest thoughts, and he just goes with it.  We really care about each other, but not in that way.  Try to work out a way were you two can be just close friends.  It worked with me.
Dont have sex with your ex-boyfriend he might have another heart attack. Go get some booty. Just kidding. U need to go look for your ex.
because you chose the wrong guy we are all different try looking for a guy in a place other than clubs
Oh my friggen TREE, isnt she tooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooollllldddd, and dont you prefer to be older than the girl??!! She is very silly to be involved with someone that much younger than her, shame on her!!!......... and YOU!!!
to care about someone and have them care about you. Maybe love or a good friendship...............the purpose? don't you like good company and companionship?  the benefit. to feel the love and friendship. it can be very deep...it warms the soul and makes you feel alive inside
Time is the best healer. If you consider her to be your best friend then I am sure you treasure her....so just wait and watch....becoz the option of moving is always going to be there in any case....and however if you wait and watch you might gain something but not lose anything. Thats my suggestion choice still remain yours....cheers
It’s obviously wrong. Ask your friend to email you. You will then have his correct email.
A bomb threat should liven things up...send it from your boss's computer, attach a virus for good measure, and fill out an application next week for his or her position!
ask him
I live in the South, and I love it, but I don't think all the people from the North feel the same way.\nIf you grew up here and don't know what to think, what makes you think others that have not necessarily grew up here would know what to think?
Considerate guys will hold open the door and let women go in first.
I think that it is very hard to be friends period with the opposite sex, let alone being a friend with benefit. You have to be very careful when it comes to this. The relationship is probably already complicated and throwing intimate acts of sex into it, doesn't help. Someone is always going to develop feelings, and therefore someone will get hurt. Have you seen MTV's True Life Friends with Benefits?
try contacting his mother and invite her to your home for a bar b que or a dinner,if she refuses then find out her reason and try talking to her,anything to get to know her better and for her to see what kind of person you can be
yes cuz when u dont call a girl she starts to think ur not thinking of her, and if ur not thinking of her u must be thinking of someone else, girls like to know there on there boyfriends mind, next time call her at least once a day even if its just to say hi, dont orget to tell her u miss her, even if you saw her an hour ago.
making love with you naked.
this question that iam answering
There are very few disadvantages except maybe that you'll have to share some of the spotlight from your parents with her.  The biggest plus is that you will not be alone in the world.  Your parents won't be alive forever and genetically speaking, there is no closer related person to you in all the world than a direct sibling.  You are each half of your parents put together and there is no one else like you.  I think siblings are very important even though you don't always realize how important they are to you until you are grown up and each living separate lives.  You will learn a lot though from a sibling and be able to teach them in return.  I bet a lot of people consider their siblings to be the most rewarding relationships in their lives.
if he wont change then he wont compromise thats no basis for a relationship. its all about giving and recieving in an open and honest way.in a relationship sex should be something to look forward to and enjoy, not to resent. trust me i know.
What's happening seems natural. \nSince you told your friend that you would take care of her, you have to really carefully analyze whether what you feel could last forever, or whether it's just passion, as if it were just a momentary desire for her, you would break the promise made to your friend. \nI think that, if you really love her, and want to spend your time with her, there is nothing wrong, and nothing that interferes with the promise made to your friend. \nThe next step is the difficult one, which is bringing the subject up to her and having her feel the same for you. \nIf you have been getting together very often she probably will end up sharing your feelings, and wanting to be with you in a more complete way. You have to be very sensitive, though: if you friend died only this march, she's probably not at all ready to take on another relationship. Even if she thought she were, it could be an illusion, or just a desire to be fine again. \nPeople need some time to fully recover from shocks as the death of someone loved, and don't get back to their normal selves (although they sometimes are not really aware of this) until some time has gone by. \nGive things time, and take them with a lot of patience: always show her your love, but don't ask her to love you back until she's ready, and don't bring the issue up until she shows you some hints pointing at her love for you.\nGood luck, and best wishes.
"MOST girls go for ""bad boys"". Women go for ""a gentlemen"".;>)"
Well, that is a hard thing to advise you on. What exactly indicates to you that he is cheating? I know that sometimes even a simple change in behavior can cause suspicion. Without the particulars I can only advise you to keep the lines of communication open. It may not be what you think....
I think everyone forgives but never forgets.
The Germans Tiger tank was very strong, the Allied tanks had to hit it just right in order to destroy it until the Americans came up with the TANK KILLER (another tank) however it still could not survive a shot from the Tiger II\n\nThe Tiger II was also a diesel tank, so when a round did hit it, it did not explode, unlike the American Tanks which were Regular Gasoline.
Why not? Life is short. If I'm not married I'd go for it.\n\n...If the situation was girlfriend, not boyfriend... But still.
lol i dont.. i think its pretty ugly, i actully want hair on yor head

I think its kinda hot actually! Drugs, sex, money, excitment, total protection....what else could a girl ask for?
most of the time if you have to ask a question like this the guy is cheating
"the woman who is telling , wants the other to go away from her man.incidenty..no ""strings"" doesnt mean anything to her anymore...she likes the man and wants the other out."
sorry, she just left...when you see her, tell her i want my watch back
trust yourself.
for all my family to continue on with their own lifes, happily
How old are you????
"Often because sons/husbands inadvertently put them in opposing situations by not letting go of ""dear old mom"" and putting their wives first as they should.  I have a wonderful relationship with my daughter-in-law, but I'm fortunate in that she's a sweet girl who loves my son very much.  Because that's true, I make it a point to keep the boundaries very clear.  \n\nHowever, those boundaries can become much more difficult to maintain, I imagine, if one's child is married to someone who doesn't love or appreciate him/her, or who treats him/her poorly.  Mothers tend to be protective of their children, and that can complicate in-law relations if they become too aware of and too involved in their children's marriages.  If my son and his wife argue, I don't want to know about it--I encourage him to talk to a friend, or his brother, or even better--to his wife.\n\nThe soaps, though, are an entirely different story--they dramatize and emphasize the conflicts that people encounter in their lives, which is what makes watching them entertaining.  No matter how bad you think you've got it, odds are good that your favorite soap character has it worse! ;)"
no its defanitly not too late. theres no right age for it. it just has to come naturally on its time ya know?  but i think its just about the greatest feeling ever- thats if its with a person you love.  when its with the person you love,  chills run through my entire body and i feel as light as a feather (a bit corny i know).   but when its with just someone random, i think its kinda gross. it just feels like your wet lips touching his wet lips and its kinda awkard and your minds not really into it.   thats what its like for me at least.      and yeah, your not too late at all, dont worry about it :)
be yourself, and if he doesn't like you for who you are then you have no hope!! you cant act like someone else for your whole life!
I found this website... just type sex in the interpret spot...
Men who do this frequently appear to be awesome people (think Ted Bundy, the all american boy turned serial killer)...  It is absolutely NOT her fault, and he's using that as an excuse for his own inability to control his impulses.
I haven't either but I wouldn't mind. lol
That's the best way to get her to be your friend. Beyond that, I don't know.
I have two really really good friends, and the rest are just, you know, normal ones.
"I'm sorry for your loss.  It's hard to lose any relationship when it isn't your idea for it to end.  It's also hard to lose a relationship that isn't working out for you--and you have to end it.  \n\nYou want to get over your boyfriend and get him to talk to you??   \n\nI would say to do one thing at a time.  Invest some time in things in your life that are more permanent:  your friends, family, hobbies, classes, church, and pets.  This is the time for you to be good to yourself and not trying to get something from someone who has nothing to give you now.\n\nGet a new boyfriend and enjoy discovering this person.  I think young people sometimes think that because the relationship ends they are not good enough for one.\nThat's not true.\n\nYou will discover more about yourself through an ended relationship sometimes than you will when you are in one.  It's that hindsight thing.  Always easier to see things better when you have some distance.\n\nThe bad news is that you can't make someone talk to you, or want you, or love you.  It will be his choice.  There are lots of reasons he may not have wanted to be with you that have nothing to do with you or your qualities as a person.  His reasons to leave are about him and his thinking, not you.\n\nTry not to imagine that it is all about you.  Each person has their inner voice they have to listen to and that sometimes is directed by their own fears.  \n\nAn example; you have a friend that is scared to death of flying in a plane.  You may talk to them and reason with them and offer things to them that are way beyond generous in order for them to get over their fear.  But it just doesn't work.  They have to manage those fears in their own time and get to the root cause of things when they are ready. \n\nYou can't force this.  It has nothing to do with how nice or wonderful a person you are.  They simply will deal with those issues when and if they decide to do so.  If you feel like there is something wrong with you because you can't get them over their fear of flying you are needlessly hurting yourself.\n\nFind someone who enjoys to ""fly"" as much as you do.  Meaning, find a boyfriend that looks at you the way you look at him.  Someone who feels happy to be with you, not stressed.  It is much nicer to be in a relationship with someone who wants to be there and work on it with you.\n\nTrying to make this other person talk to you will only erode your self-esteem.  If and when this guy is ready he will call you and see about getting back together.  He may not ever (sorry to say because I know you hurt).\n\nIn the mean time you have moved on to more positive things and had some new experiences.  Maybe you won't want him back if he decides to try again.  That is your choice about what is best for you!\n\nFeeling sad and lonely right now is normal.  Get with your friends and have some fun.  Hurting means you are a caring person and feel a loss.  Hurting doesn't mean that you were ""meant to be"" and that you will never find someone who cares for you again.  You will find many good experiences ahead and good people as well.\n\nThere will be joy in your life again.  Be gentle with yourself and I hope you feel better soon.  :)"
benita... 5 years, did you say?? that is a long time.. and being without someone to care for you after 5 years is really lonely. thats the reason you are feeling empty. But hey, when both of you have agreed that it aint gonna work out, the best thing to do would be to forget the last five years and look for someone new. After all, there are many more fish in the ocean!\n\nI know it is tough benita, but you are making it harder for yourself if you continue in this fashion. you know deep inside that you have to forget him eventually, but you are counting on your heart and mind to do that for you over time. But hey, that may take very long. You have got to help yourself. And the best way to do that is to find yourself a new friend or guy that can care for you and that you can care for...\n\nthink it over.
I would tell her, i see why you are old and still single, not to be mean but tell them the truth.
i will
buy electric mopeds
MAN!!!!!!!!!! enjoy it while it last before she realizes  the age difference---
Grrrrrr some people have to cheat at everything!
"Just say this..""I have always valued your sense of person, and your sense of people , and I respect that very much about you"".."
This is your grandmas problem...and there is more to this than you know about.  Grandma is tied in with these people some how...or else all she has to do is threaten to have an eviction notice served , which a sheriff can do and I doubt if they want a sheriff coming to their door.
Saw your page, you are a little doll.  He's crazy for not wanting you but I'm assuming that due to the distance, that he's desided you wasn't a possiblity for the future.  I wished he would talk to you and make you feel better, but looks like he's choosen to ingore you and not tell you face to face.  Find you someone close to home, you will have no problem with guys wanting to talk to ya.  Good luck and good day.
what is that? thanks for the 2 points!
He doesn't know that I read and write gay porn.
Sometimes you can call the police station and off duty sherrifs and officers serve for extra cash during time off.
You are only as old as you feel. Have you looked at 50+ women these days. Life is too short. Hope he treats you good. Good luck
"well there is really nothing your friend can ""do"". Her mother is an adult and free to make her own choices, whether they are good ones or not. Her mother obviously has committment issues and as long as she is involved with married men that takes care of that. If it was my mother, I wouldn't be happy about it, but I could never disrespect her and I would ALWAYS love her regardless."
"What you do NOT have is ""Capacity.""  This means the right to have your decisions upheld in jurisprudence. As a minor, and keep in mind that in some states you would not be considered a minor, you do not have capacity because of your age. This exists in law to PROTECT children from their own mistakes, by realizing in law that they do not have judgement over what is best for them. For some people, this would be a legal fiction, but a line must be put down, and for most purposes in the USA, that age is 18. You would have a legal ""out"" if you could demonstrate abuse or neglect of some kind, meaning that your parents are not upholding their inherent responsibility of taking care of you properly. It doesn't mean you can leave if you didn't get a new car on your birthday. It does mean that you can get out if your were being given drugs or were being molested or beaten, and if you can also prove that your parent(s) either were involved or permitted the abuse. You DO have rights to see a social worker in NH and be counseled. In most cities, a civil rights attorney will take your case (assuming you HAVE a case) ""pro bono"" = for free. Make no decisions lightly or without PROFESSIONAL help. Internet advice is not a substitute for professional help. Good luck."
Because they are selfish sorry a-- holes who only thing with there d--k and think that it will cramp there style to admit that they have a child that needs there fathers love and attention...and they dont want the females that they are involved with to think that they have commitment issues, which they do because they wont have anything to do with the commitment they were suppost to have made when they helped to create that life!
If your guy is dedicated, loyal, and faithful to your relationship, then his roommate (player or not) is not going to influence him to cheat on you. If your guy goes out and messes around, it is because he wanted to, not because his new roommate is like that. You can't control him and you can't prevent things. You just have to trust and have faith. If you are really secure in your relationship, then you should be secure even when the circumstances change. Good luck.
What's the problem? She still wants to go watch it with you, right? Don't get so hang up over the nitty-gritty of life. It'll only cause you a stomach ulcer!
well since you've been with him for a year....then try going o the place you first met or where you had your first date....\n\nyou could also just get some take out bring it back to your place have dinner with some candles and then jump into bed and have fun....;)
Smile and say hi. That'll get their attention!
It's known as the being dominant theory.\nThey are the leader and their women listen to them.
"If he was not serious, he would not have brought it up.  The fact that she wants to meet you means SHE thinks it is serious and the only place she would have gotten that idea was from HIM.\n\nYou two are not communicating very well, him because the way he brought it up left you with doubts; you because you are not just asking HIM these questoins.\n\nIf his mum is reasonable, she will only be looking to see if you make him happy and that you won't do anything that will hurt him down the road, which should already be your requirements in a relationship anyway!\n\nIf she is some idiot who is judgemental or does not think anyone is good enough for her boy, it puts your bf on the spot. He is stuck between you and her. . . on the other hand if he is 31 and does not say to his Mom ""too bad, I love her, she loves me etc... "" (not necessarily on the spot, give him a month or two after it is clear the mum disappears) then he is not ready for a serious relationship anyway.  He is 31!  Mom should still be an important person in his life but he should not be clutching the apron any longer."
No its not OKY
it different in all women but sometimes it located about 2 inches in on the top(towards the tummy) part of the vagina what ive heard, Im still looking for mine lol
If people  constantly say you look like Keanu Reeves, i agree, that\nkinda sucks. No big deal...just change your image and attitude...like\nyour taking on a new role :)
If the addiction is more important to him than you it is over. You need to get away from him and see if he comes back clean and wanting a married whole family relationship or you are wasting your time. And dont take him back with the weed.\n\nIt is a great day to be alive!!\nGood Luck and God Bless!!
why are you a Porker?
You should learn to like yourself more - he obviously loves you or your behaviour would have driven him away by now. It must hurt him to think that you don't trust him. Has he ever cheated on you? No, and what's more, you say you know he wouldn't. Don't argue with him when he goes out with his mates, tell him you trust him to enjoy himself without copying their womanizing behaviour and he'll be proud of you and will look forward to returning home to you. If you keep on accusing him & arguing, he'll eventually seek solace & comfort elsewhere; someone who won't nag him will seem an attractive idea! If he knows you trust him, he will enjoy being with you all the more. Even if he does talk to girls, it doesn't mean that he is going to run off with one of them! Try to trust & believe in him, and he'll repay you with all the loyalty you are seeking. Also, make sure that he takes you out (just the two of you) regularly. Good Luck!!
YOUR KIDDING RIGHT? WHAT KIND OF MAN LETS A WOMAN BEAT ON THEIR CHILD? WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF HER TOO!!! DO WHATS RIGHT  - CALL THE POLICE - HAVE HER BROUGHT UP ON CHILD ABUSE CHARGES - AND FILE FOR CUSTODY OF YOUR SON!
Tell me dirty stuff, kiss badly, smells badly, act like a jerk, being poser...\nSome stuff like these
show her instead of telling her, she'll get it
Don't have sex with him and stop this involvement with him before it goes any further.  If you are unhappy in your marriage, you should seek a divorce.  Your reputation is intact right now so keep it that way.  If you commit adultry with this man or another, then your name could be dragged through the mud and your kids will be affected.\n\nOnce you have that divorce, then you can see any available man that you desire just as long as he is not married.\n\nGod bless you and good luck!
look at my info if i can help i will. as long as you are old enough.
im 15, is that OK? if it is i'll talk over email! and if you dont email me i will email you first!
i have kept almost all secrets ever told to me. only time i will blab is when the secret can really do serious harm to someone i care about or if i don't like the person telling me the secret.
Marriage is a beautiful thing. A marriage is what you make of it. It's your choice whether or not you have the fights and screaming children. I have a Wonderful marriage. 3 (very well discipline)children, ages 12, 9, & 4. My husband and I may have a disagreement once a month. that's it. if i had to do it all over again. I Would. So the answer to your question is: It's Just You.
do wat you fell is right. you hear that little voice at the back of your head? listen to wat it tells you to do.  if you want to go out with him, just ask him. dont use notes.  lastly, wat is the little vaice in the back of your head teling you?
How weird is that.
hmmm... depends what you really feel. If you dont want him to be dating other grlz make an effort and do an equal amount of phone calls and letters. Writing letters can actually be pretty fun, more than u think. It's a new way to express yourself to him, and u could be sweet and go all out. I have a friend that I write to(he lives across the country), and sometimes instead of emailing I'll decorate actual letters for him and stuff. I draw and send him pics, it may look corny but he really appreciates them, and I'm the only girl that really does that for him, so it's def a plus in a long distance relationship. We've been writing for 10 yrs, so even thou we're just friends, long distance relationships can still be great, and yours just sounds temperorary.\nGood luck!
Don't worry what men want. Just be you..some men like thin, and some thick..what really matters is how your heart is...if you have a good heart that is good enough..
One who gives you favor by nature can't be mistrust by heart. Anything else we are just obsessed and forced to believe
No because if you find the right man he will be gentle and understanding and will please you and teach you how to please him. Please dont worry if he loves you then a little thing like that aint gonna bother him.
Watching people walk into glass doors by mistake.  Is that weird ?
LEAVE....LEAVE WHILE YOU CAN...OR IN ABOUT TEN YEARS YOU'LL HAVE 10  KIDS AND BE OPENING UP HIS BEER AS HE WATCHES T.V. IN YOUR TRAILOR
not really because if you look at it in the long run your boyfriend may not always be there but your good education will be....though you may be seriouse about your man he should also understand that your career is important he just has to be paitent coz in the end all he has to do is sow his oats and you have to hold that child and give birth to it so it has to be a mutual agreement to have a family......do wha u think is best
Best Answer!\n\nDaniel, my friend.\n\nI am a guy and when a lady say she wants a man with confidence she is referring to his ability to express himself and decision. She wants to know that you believe the thoughts/conversation/ actions you take when with her or are you just running game to impress her. \nBasically she is saying are you full of SH!%t or sincere to your method of communicatiing.
Start sniffing I'm sure you will smell the stench of sex in the air
I remember the first time I did it. First off get REAL close to her (close enough where if you get wood she'll feel it) and most importantly CLOSE YOUR DAM EYES!!! I can't stress that enough. Then simply kiss her on the lips once and then put your tongue in her mouth the second time around. Try to swirl yours with hers and hold it for around 10-20 secs. If you guys are into it, you can bite her lip after ur done and have her bite urs. It's rowdy. Don't worry with practice u'll be a master frencher. (although it loses all meaning once you move up to more sexually satisfying things) (like head)
It's not a choice someone can make. Someone can no sooner choose to be gay than someone can choose to be straight. You can fight the feelings, but you can't change them. You are who you are. You just need to accept it. It doesn't make you a bad or evil person. You didn't choose this lifestyle, just embraced what you had. I think people need to realize this.
you should probably stop sucking so much dick.........
omg lmaoo, sorry but this is the dumbest question i've seen today lmaooo
If you love him/her you won't mind spoiling him/her. But don't overdo it.
yeah i was gonna suggest a gift card too. head to the mall and check out her favorite stores. if she's girly girly i'd try abercrombie or American eagle...but you can never go wrong with a department store gift card either...or maybe one from a music store.
Either you are unhappy in the relationship so look for something outside the relationship (but aren't at the stage where you want to split up). Or you enjoy the conquest of different people (often through personal insecurities). Mostly it's just becasue you're a total b*****d!!!
only if you don't talk to much I suppose I can listen for a bit :)
This is a major age gap.  This could run into problems later.  Especially as you get older...not her.  It's your choice, as long as she is of age.  If not, you better run for your life!\n\nBut honestly...yes.  It is almost a whole generation apart. I find men go after young women to make them only feel young.  There is nothing worse than seeing an older guy dress like he is younger than he really is and drives sports cars.  Personally, that is a turn off.
neither!  Oysters (or so they say) RAW!  and a nice bottle of champagne!\ntake it from the chef!  works all the time!
ppl are alwayz gonna talk sh*t so dont worry about that they will get used to it after a lil bit i just had a friend that had to do the same thin
First of all I'm married and what I love from my husband is that he love me.  He is so lovely with me. He bring me flowers, do thing that I do not expect from him. And he count with me for almost everything.  And I've been married for 8 years on May 20. We are from Puerto Rico.  I'm 26 years old and he is 27.  And we have 3 kids.  I LOVE HIM!!!  (My Spanish is better than my English, Sorry about that)   I'm here if u need more info!  :)
Boys are harder to train for some reason - and three is an average age for a boy (Ususally 2 for a girl).  Try asking him every hour or so if he's gone to the bathroom or needs to go.  Don't put him on the potty without asking if he has to go first, and then let him do as much as he can by himself without assistance.  Only help with things he struggles with (like buttoning pants) or asks for help for.   If you continue to ask him if he's gone, it will remind him if he needs to.  He may just not be used to realizing what it feels like to need to go potty before he actually goes.  Good luck.
Sure, if you feel that you are ready.
BUZZ OFF!!!
You haven't explained the reasons why you feel the way you feel.\n\nIf you experience tension in your relationship then I'm sure there are reasons for the same.\n\nAll said, try to analyze your situation and weigh the reasons in the right perspective. \n\nIn case there is something you need to amend to make the difference, then do likewise, else if you think that he needs to amend on his front then discuss the same with him with an aim to salvage your relationship. Do it in an amicable manner so even he would understand the need of doing the same.\n\nIt could also just be that you're going through a lean phase in your relationship and need to let go of your inhibitions as in due course of time things will come back to normal. \n\njust remember that where there is a will there is a way…and if there is a problem, there is also a solution… it’s just about understanding the problem right and you’ll sooner or later come up with the right solution too.\n\nHope you soon get to the crux of things to determine why you feel the way you do and rationally decide to take the right steps to change things where required to salvage your relationship.\n\nWish you all the best.
Well, women tend to be good at arguments because we think about what we are going to say - we don't just sit and nod or block what the other person is saying.  So I guess the rule of thumb is actually listen to what your wife is saying when she speaks and don't just agree with her, you need to tell her what you are thinking/feeling too.
dont figth with your friends for stupid reasons. when you grow up you will feel sad because you will think: ohh my gosh, i grew up with those people, so many things we did together, we use to play and laugh all time together and now i cant see them, would i ever see them again? it wont be like the old times that we used to play and laugh like kids we, wont do the things that we used to, we couldnt wait to the next day to see each other, to play and to laugh and now we never see each other. you will be thinking at that almost every day and it makes you sad thinking at that, i know because im thinking at that rigth now everyday and i want to cry most of the days we were 6 and now 2 of them lives in usa one there was a figth with 2 of them and it will be hard to re-unite we are only 4 living in puerto rico and one of them (a she) is pregnant and we cant talk anymore. ones in drug the other is stealing and almost in jail, theres lots of problems and it will eat you inside so dont figth for stupid things. laugh with your friends and pass a good time. make those days the best in your life and take them to the max.
69. I also love the position where I sit on his lap facing him, it's very intimate and I can look into his eyes while  making love.
Smooth is sexy-no pubes in the teeth for one!  ;)
"Go in on one of those ""No Money Down"" houses. Rent out a big place to others who will live there with you. You pay the rent, so you make sure that all of your tenants pay for it. You live for free and get to do what you want."
It sounds like he made a choice, and he chose his friend over you. Since he is avoiding you he probably does have feelings for you, and the only way to control them is to stay away. Don't try to make him lose respect for himself. Move on with your life as soon as you can. Or at least wait until he comes back to you.
Sure. Maybe yoy can help me with an issue I have.

People are just responding to this situation negatively because that is what they were taught growing up. Don't worry about it. Just stand by your man and be happy you found someone to love and that loves you back. Pretty soon the world will be all mixed anyway! Good Luck!
Thank you for your time you've spent with me, We have had some good times and some great conversations. I hope the next chapter in your life is a good and successful one. Wishing you joy and happiness for years to come.
do you really think its right to cheat just because he is.......i would break off the relationship then move on with my life and have a clear conscious all at the same time
a card,a hug,a kiss,and tell that person you are so glad to have spent this time together. Then on the next day give that sweet person a gift they will never forget. A picture with all the family on it,a new car,or maybe even a vacation to some really exotic locale.
He may notice or maybe she's always annoying and he tunes it out but don't put him in the middle. Straighten her butt out if she's rude or snotty to you in front of him or not. Don't call her names or hit her upside the head no matter how much you want to! Be a lady about it and make that cow look bad. Even if it's just her tone of voice, call her on it.
Its true, you can't really explain it. You may fall in and out of love many times in life and think its real. The human emotion is tricky. If you were going through a bad patch and someone is nice to you, you may think its love.\nSome people confuse lust with love. Its not necessarily the butterflies in the stomach or you smile every time you think of that special someone.\n\nI think you will know it by feeling. We are all individual. What I think is real love to me, might not be for you.
Well that all depends, if you don't want him anymore, just play it cool, talk, but no I miss you or anything.  If you do miss him and want to be with him, let him do the talking and when he is done, tell him you miss him and maybe you guys should work things out
If your trying to pick up a girl at a bar, even as a couple, try buying her drinks then asking her out on a date. \n\nYou might find out after one or two drinks that she isn't worth your time or that this could be the one.\n\nAsk her sexually charged questions to find out if she would ever consider it, some difficult ones to Gage if she is honest. Then ask her on a date. Or if your not looking for friends just a no strings attached one nighter try joining a swing club. There are plenty of men, women, and couples at these clubs who are clean attractive, willing, and open minded enough to accept an interracial couple.
I touch myself because it feels good, relieves physical and mental tension, and helps me exhaust my body before I go to sleep!
One of life's eternal mysteries.

A mother is someone who knows you're a good egg, even if you're a little cracked.
just take it slow girl. don't rush it. don't expect anything and you'll be less likely to be hurt.
Love is a difficult thing to master. I'm afraid love takes time to get over. If she treated you well perhaps you could ask if she would consider trying again and tell her exactly how you feel about her and how it is painful without her. If you already know that your relationship with this woman has completely ended then I'm afraid it will hurt you for a while longer, but I would recommend doing things to take your mind off of this love for longer periods throughout the days, perhaps doing activities that you will enjoy with friends and trying new things that you would not have considered doing before, but nothing that will remind you of this relationship. Evenings I presume will feel the hardest, I'd recommend resisting the urge to contact this woman and trying to find something that will bring you some comfort and joy for a little while. Apart from that I'm afraid it's the waiting game that is difficult to overcome, but it is not impossible. Good luck and I hope that you will start feeling a little better soon. x
just ask her if she would like to see a movie im sure she will say yes.
NO!u will end up the bad guy.best u can do is try talking 2 them seperately but if this is the way they have been 4 years it probably will not change anything.I have a sister who has been in a abusive relationship 4 over 30 years everything we did 2 help her only caused her 2 stop talking 2 the family an cause a really wide gap between us.I actually stuck up 4 her and beat the crap out of him.she has not spoken 2 be in 10 years.
umm...one of my friends has a faster internet than me, like the calble thing or something and I have dial-up...I don't like to let her on here because she gets frustrated and bangs stuff around because mine is a little slower than she's used to...so I let her use it but I have to watch her...
Did you know he smoked weed when you first started going out with him? You probably have no right to expect him to change for you if you knew the situation up front. Only you can decide if you'll accept the behavior or walk away. This is not anything against you - the guy simply likes getting high!
Well, just like any other address - you start by getting the address of the location you want to show how to get to.\n\nThen, you need to either draw the mape by hand, or find a website that will create the map for you.\n\nSome sites might have copyright restrictions on the maps you create them - but they will generally provide a command you can use to email the map and/or get a ilnk (URL) to the map.\n\nYahoo and Google both have pretty nice-looking mapping sites.\n\nInkscape is a free, open source graphics-drawing software application that lets you save the artwork/sketches/diagrams you create with it in SVG format.\n\nFirefox 1.5 and later can display SVG graphics directly in the browser, without the need to convert them to another format like JPG, GIF, or PNG.  These other formats are all bitmapped, and can be large in some cases.  By contrast, SVG files, unless they contain unusually high number of details are usually small.  So SVG files, in general, download and render quickly.\n\nLast time I checked Thunderbird 1.5 (the sister program to Firefox for handleing email could not directly display SVG, but this may change).\n\nIn a short while, just about every popular program that can support graphics will probably support the SVG file format.  While GIF and those are fine for paint programs, SVG is much better for drawing programs. Editing an SVG based srawing is fun, easy, and natural.  With GIF and the like, once you put a line into the document - you cannot move or reformat it.\n\nYour easiest option is to use a website to lookup the map.  If you are really artistic and like computers, you might want to try your hand with Inkscape and have a little fun. You will need to convert to GIF or JPEG afterward to emali your drawing when you are done.
I'm 16 4ft 11in never had a boyfriend but I get asked a lot my secret is not to want them act like you don't need them guys will be here for the rest of our lives we may want them now but they will come in time I promise just keep your cool!!!!
in addition to the above answers, shyness or self-consciousness (which i don't fully buy...it seems if you're comfortable enough to get naked in front of someone, you might as well enjoy it...but what the heck, let 'em have it), and not so fresh, it is also possible that she has a traumatic memory associated with it.  for example, i am with a girl who was molested that way at a very young age and she prefers not to have it done because it reminds her of being molested.  \n\nas time has gone on in our relationship, she has agreed to let me do it, and now trusts me fully to do it.  you should be patient. explain how much you enjoy it. tell her how hot she is and how beautiful she is. ask her why she doesn't want it. and tell her you can wait as long as she needs to until she is comfortable in your relationship.  it will pay off in the end.\n\nP.S. does anybody else get the feeling that dreamon is lowsy in bed?  sorry dreamon, hope the best for you girl!
Nope. I look terrible on camera.
Simple.. dont feel pressured to rush into things.. take your time to get to know one another.
Time, friend...time.  It heals all wounds.
I think I was about 13....Lol! Im 21 now, and I havent forgotten about him....hehe, this question made me smile
no
naaah\nu arnt crazy dear...somewhere somehow,u r gonna meet that special person!so don't flip ur lid,and keep ur eyes open...the person may be just round the corner
There is an old chinese saying. It goes something like this:\n\nFor a man to conquer a woman it is like breaking down a brick wall barehanded.\n\nFor a woman to catch a man it is like breaking through tissue paper.\n\nMoral of the story is that it is much easier for a woman to have many partners and much more difficult for the man.\n\nIt also has to do with religion and morals. The moral woman waits until marrage and only has sex with her husband. The immoral woman doesn't.\n\nSo I guess if the moral woman is jealous then she will call the immoral woman names to make herself feel better. (sour grapes is the medical term)\n\nMen lie about having sex many more times than they have ever had to make themselves seem better. To themselves and their friends. Most of the time they are lieing but a few tell the truth. They want you to care and envy them but now with all the diseases around. it's scary.\n\nI'm glad I went to Thailand in the 70's. Lots of easy women looking for a green card (oops, I meant to say husband). You could have a different girl every day if you wanted. Some days I did. I guess that makes me a male sl*t.
Some are sincere, some are not.  You have to use your judgement.  Talk to them for a bit first, you'll get to know somewhat their personalities.  If they seem OK, then agree to meet him in a public place.  On line dating is risky but can be fun!  I've been using Yahoo personals for a while and have met some wonderful guys, and have had some, well, interesting ones as well lol.  Trust your instincts!!!  And good luck!
"Well, yes it is normal. Everybody knows that when it comes to men... ""LIFE STARTS AT 40."" =)"
She is just doing that because she is scared. She is scared that if you date her brother she will be left out cause you two will probably spend all your free time with each other. So my advice to you is to go out with him, but remember to make time for your friend.
they probably are concious of themselves and think that if a hot guy is talking to them, it has to be a joke. so they protect themselves by not giving in for fear of being rideculed and made the topic of jokes in the locker room later on. ;)
Do you mean abused?  If so, no.
Look on www.anywho.com
"If you are financially able to provide and support a child on your own then you should go for it as long as your also mentally ready. But you dont need to have a ""man"" in your life just to have a baby. There are many women they are insemanated and raise their child on their own without the help of a husband or boyfriend. hope this helped good luck."
I may not be a man but my boyfriend and I do that. It is alot of fun!
Desperate has nothing to do with it I'm a, Single Parent i choose to raise my child than worry about me.\nMeeting someone online just a better way of expressing yourself things you cannot say face to face. Its a good thing some have made it bad and others are jealous of i meant someone online this was the best thing besides my child in my life i could think off.
yes let make friend
Woah, woah...slow down, man.  Get to know her more.  Take her out for nachos or something.  Get to know her thoughts, her dreams, and stuff.  Find out who she really is.  I am sure she is wonderful, she sounds lovely.  So take that step out of your comfort zone and talk to her.  Then you will know for sure whether you are perfect for eachother or incompatable.\nHope this helps.  Good luck.\nNanny G.
Yeah, probably early 30s.  I wouldn't leave it much longer than that, because there are risks associated with being pregnant when you are older.\n\nTrouble is, I think men can often sense the biological clock ticking, and feel the desperation coming from a woman in that situation, and they get frightened off.  I wouldn't like to be in that position at all.  I would say if having children with someone is high on the list of priorities, do it sooner rather than later.
Hell no, stop asking annoying questions you little...kidding..of course. :)
Are they?  Can someone please hook me up with Josh Lucas, in that case? I know just what to do with him.
well... it just depends... i mean he maybe shy or he does'nt really like y0u... and also he maybe is preparing f0r s0meting special f0r y0u.. like gifts and stuff...\nhe maybe needed a little more attenti0n .. and also he wants you t0 always say hi first to him....
"Wow you deserve to have a great time... stop stressin and give him a call and just say you forgot to ask where to meet! sounds like a romance novel.... long lost love "" the notebook """
does it really matter if they snub you. i get the same treatment when i go to school functions for my son. i am not there to impress anyone, or to make friends, or to jump on the mommmy bandwagon. i am at school to fight for something my son wants, needs, or feels he has a right to. i am not concerned with what other mothers (parents in general)think. i have my own code to live by, and in 10, 15, or 20 years i will only want to know that i did right by my kid... not the PTA moms. in fact, i doubt i'll even know their names.
the best way is to tell her, but if you want to prove your love then make her feel she is the most important person for you (you know, it wouldn't be bad if you brought her flowers or chocolate, but these are general means to win her heart).\nas regards me, i love when my bf tries to do everything to please me and i adore him for that. i'm telling you, every little thing you'll do for her is important.\ngood luck!
being a child of the state isn't fun... you may cause them to be worse off sending them to the state... maybe you should ask the child if they would like to be with their mother and find out if they are happy in their situation.. sometimes it's not as bad as it seems!
im a lesbian yea i hate how we get judged just because we're diffrent well screw everyone one of u that judge us im 17 2 and i love girls guys are A**holes i would much rather be with a girl than a guy and u go babe for standing up for yourself i have nuthing but resect for u email me some time lilmomma1718@yahoo.com if u want 2
My dear having a boyfriend is not a privilege. By all means its only a desire, a want that humans get now and again. But a woman can survive without a man. what would you need hI'm for? to whisper sweet little nothings in your ear and tell you your pretty? to lie , or cheat, to break promises. now im not saying all guys are like that. Depends how old you are. Boys from elementary to middle school care only about social status and being alone. Also their experiences urges like touching and humping things. Boys from high school may be a bit more mature but those you have to be extra careful with. They know the trick of the trade. There is a right age and wrong age to have a bf. Know where you stand. You have to be careful who you choose to be with. Ask yourself. Do i want him forever? or to play with? One must ask themselves questions that will benefit them for the future. Love is a game of risks. Be careful.
1. yes guys like to look at porn. and no I still think my wife is beautiful.\n\n2. Porn stimulates fantasy in our heads guys are more visual and by watching or seeing porn it's easier for us to imagin it. It does turn us on and when we are turned on our mates are even more desirerable.\n\n3. Many women feel threatened or undesirable to there guy if they look at porn. That's normal. But that's not the case. You are very desirerable, it just that guys think about sex so much that we know it's unreasonalbe to think that you can be there for us with every urge we have, and porn it sort of an outlet for our over sexxed minds.\n\n4. Not usually. Sometimes we will compair the things you do for us but for the most part no. We might see something or think of something we would like to try because of porn but were coming to you to try it. We would hope that you would be willing to at least try. That alone is a huge turn on for us.\n\n5. It doen't take much. Most guys aren't that dense. We know. But at the same time you need to understand that it's not only a mental desire it's also a physical need for us. being stimulated both mentaly and physically has possitive benifical aspects for us. The hormones and chemicals that our body produces help us with stress, depression and many other things. That being said, although not as extreem, it's sort of like needing to eat. Needing food.\n\n6. Go with it, try and get over it and even enjoy it with him. Be open to it, and let him know you are there for him when he needs you.\n\n7. There are many double standards in this world when it comes to the differant genders. I personally think that if a guy looks at porn he should not get upset if his girl does the same.
No, he thinks you are easy and just wants to score.\n\nOh wait, the crystal ball says yes, he is your true love.\n\nOh wait, the magic eight ball says definitely no.\n\nGive us a break how are we supposed to know.
I don't know how to forget them but it helps to stay busy. Don't be alone try to be with friends as much as possible! I feel ya, I'm in the exact situation. It sucks! If ya figure out how let me know! I'm sorry and best of luck!
Look, it was one time.  Your dad can be pretty charming and I was drunk on your mothers bathtub gin.  If I knew that you were sleeping in the room next door I would have kept it down a little.
not all young ladies date married men but for ones that do, their probably whores.
Yes, the first night I met Nathan I knew something was different. I remember thinking that he was the one right away. He later told me he felt the same way. We've been engaged for about 6 months now and are planning our wedding. =)
its possible he does notice you and is also shy and thinking the same thing you are.  I would suggest trying your hardest to get past the shyness and just approch him....maybe start out slowly and drop him a secret admireer letter and see how he reacts. If its to your likeing move on from there.
No it doesn't.  Some people think that their private life is just that, private.  Dome are just not comfortable with public display of emotions.  My husband and I are both like that.
TALK CLEAN. And be polite. \ncontact me for more info.
Ameica of course cuz I live there.
That's crazy! Neat idea.

Romance is not dead.  Women still love that stuff!  I don't look for someone who treats me bad.  I think this is a sign of an immature woman with self-esteem issues who doesn't think she deserves to be treated well.  Give me the mature, romantic guy anytime!
rude? he's a sex predator that's collecting pictures. yeah you could call that rude.
i can be your penpal my dear i dont mind at all, im all that you have described. where do we start?
Red heads (just wanted to be awkward!)
My man really loves me.  He buys me things and takes my picture and sells it on the internet.
SNAFU is a small mistake.  FUBAR, is usually a BIG mistake.
though i am still only a teen i know lots about this. I would say go for it because i've had it happen to me and the guy stole my heart so good luck if you take my advice!
Just ask your Dad if he can help you out on buying your house.  Then book that trip and go with him, tell him you'd love to accompany him on this trip and spend time with him before you get busy building your dream house.
He just called and said he wanted  help as is fed up with schizophrenic alter ego (calling himself greebohobbes) who can be at best described as a pathological attention seeker who would go any lengths to see his name in print on the net free of charge.
you can't. especially for the reason that you are trying to. each woman has a different view as to how a man is perfect. just be yourself, and if she can't love you for being you, she isn't good enough, leave her alone.
ive been in the military for years and there is a code you never break are you sure he doesnt have friends by now ,are you saved ,do you have interest in new hobbies,is there something you allways wanted to do,some of the islanders pretend to be nice for tips ,and really hate tourist,but there are many more that are genuine,why would you have trouble finding friends ,are you shy or mean ,i think you are probably a real nice person scince you gave up your life for someone thats not around much ,i bet there are many voluteer orgs. that would apreciate your talents.when i was a lot younger i would take day trips that would ussually be set up by the rec center ,many were free or very low cost
just call him and stay i will miss you and hang up- QUICK!
If this is what you like, then that's fine.  The most important thing is that it's consentual and occurs in a safe, trusting atmosphere.
"you are both wrong, the term for people with both male and female organs is "" hemaphrodite"" It is a person born with both ovaries and testicles and mixed male and female organs. transgender refers to a person that has had a operation to change from one to another."
"""For of all sad words, of tongue, or pen, the saddest are these.....it might have been"". If you don't pursue it, you will never know. Don't wait until someday and say, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN...............if only I had tried, to talk to him, or pursue it further.  You might be surprised to learn that he feels the same way about you....go for it! What do you have to lose????.....and a lot to gain!!! Good Luck!"
then he wasnt your boyfriend
Love can conquer all - but the only thing you have control of is yourself, so you can't stop someone from cheating or robbing a bank, but you can keep from doing it yourself.  And love is hard work sometimes, its not just a pretty feeling inside.
No you can't... The world is full of liars!!!
""
LMAO yes my mother in law... i think it is jsut cuz it wasa different time for them so the things young ladies back then arent the way we do it today. my husband is a full blooded portugesse man and i do not like his mom very much. She came to live with us in the beginning of our marrige and holy crap i was preganant with our first son and i about killed her. she would get drunk lilke crazy stupid drunk and seriously hit my husband oh it was horrible. and becasue i refuse to rub my husbands feet or i tell him to shove it she thinks that I am a lazy ass white girl who doesnt know how to be a wife and that all american womeon are horrible wives. so yeah girl i know what you mean.
"Here is the BIGGEST problem with this situation:  You wrote::\n\n""I'm very bitter supporting him all these years living with all his rules due to the OCD.And he still won't marry me.""\n\nTHAT MY CHILD IS BEING A HYPOCRIT.  You are angry and resentful and WANT TO GET MARRIED?  What is wrong with you and millions of others???  Is marrying him going to magically fix this?  Hell no!  I would say go to counseling alone and let your therapist talk some sense into you.  You are failing to see that you can't trap people into making you feel better about something.  Make a choice about what you want ""FOR THE RIGHT REASONS"" not because of your insecurities.   This is absurd and it's what's hugely wrong with the world.  People get married to FIX things and MARRIAGE DOES NOT FIX ANYTHING.  IT PERPETUATES AN ALREADY EXISTING PROBLEM."
The answer is simple search you heart child you will see that there is more out there, this world is to big to think off simple things that have no reason to stop your life.
Why do you think it matters so much what the hater thinks about anyone? If someone hates another person - he or she is the one with the problem, regardless of what the other person did. You don't have control over another, you only have control over yourself. If this is where you want to invest your energy, don't expect the person you hate to give a damn. As a matter of fact, given your attitude, the other person may have beat you to it, but doesn't think you are worth the effort of displaying the hatred. Grow up, and get your own life.
"I'm glad that you made the right decision.  Most men will tell you what you want to hear to make their advances toward women.  Women are the same way.  I think with there being so many more avenues to meet others, just makes it that easier for the ""TROUBLE"" to find the innocent.  We just wanted MR or MRS Right to come along?\nI stuck with what got most people our age through.  Go out to a great hang out, met a lady, dated, fell in love and married her.  No cyber vision.  Sometimes the old fashion ways are the best.  Be careful sweets.  I think you know exactly what you're looking for.  I promise.  He's out there, and when he finds you, ooh-la-la..\n\nGood luck"

Place a personal ad on a dating website. There are many free sites (like yahoo personals, aol, etc.)\nOr browse other people's personal ads.\nThis is how I met my wife. We have been married for five years and are very happy. Just be careful, because there are a lot of guys just looking for sex and nothing else.\nWhen you finally met the person, do it in a public place just to be safe. And don't settle for less than a decent guy. You may have to date some rotten apples before you find a peach.
Gosh, I wish I had a man like you! Well, I say just go for it as you have been doing, but don't stop when she says to do so. If it does feel too good, as I know it does, and you are enjoying doing that, she will eventually let up. Slowly, she will (hopefully) just let you do more and more each time, until she feels so excited that she wont let you stop. Good luck with that! :o)
well if its all because of the hair then they just like you because of your looks and not the person you really are...... but who am I to say this I think as the others above me said talk to them and get to know them and maybe you can start a relationship with one ........ Good luck :)
all you have to do is say Hi, a few times and he should pick up the hint, or since he walks by your house ask him if he wants to walk to school together or home, or ask him about his sports, he will like to talk about that.  Good Luck

"Love hurts sometimes and it is hard to know what to do. You broke up with him for some reason so there must be something going on you didn't like, however now, I am guessing, you miss having him around and you are falling back on I love him because no one is around right now. \nSo if I am right, then you need to go out and find a new person. \nYou said that you told him that you loved him through the email and he siad ""I know"" Honey He sounds like he is using you and taking you for granted. If he loved you back like you want him to, he would have said something besides ""I know""  Leave him alone and find someone that will return your love. Believe me, I know it is hard.....it is easier said than done. But in the long run you will be happier."
Sorry, not interested....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhee hee hee
"The Looks isn't always supposed tobe the fact that makes a person loveable. It's simply a materialistic value or a first impression. You may understand that certain feelings, like understanding each other, has tobe more advanced with time. That's true love! \n\nIf he rejected you for your looks this means, he didn't simply love you, but he had lust on you. Its much different. Ask him, whether he had any misunderstandings lately. Anyone, anything said or happenned wrong? It could be a very simple thing. Try to mend the thing, or get ready to dump him. Its always upto you. Things always have a ""Wind-of-Change"" if it wasn't for good.\nBye,"
NOPE!
Sure, why don't you give it a try.  I'm sure it could hurt unless......
They make you believe that, and I am glad you said it...\nThey call it love, but it is just a way to get sex...\nHonest, if they wanted a real relationship, they would be after more important information about you and your family and your lifestyle and your likes and dislikes...\nSex should never be the first concern in any starting relationship...
ye me totally bi xx
How about opening your mouth and saying hello, if you want them to say good night to you have to say hello first lol ^_^!
leave that bitch alone
"It was the women's liberation movement.  Now women are denying their emotions all for causal sex and claiming they are happy in those relationships.   Women were never emotionally prepared or created to jump from one man's bed into another.   Women seem to think this has put them on the same level as a man in sexual freedom.  The men are excited because now they are relieved from any obligation, responsibilities and developing maturity in a relationship. They can have their cake and eat it too.  We as women need to demand more from men.   If we do not encourage them to be in a responsible relationship they will never commit. \n  I know there are those that claim they are happy and I have had a few friends claim the same.  The truth is that it tears down a woman's self-esteem and she gets to the point that she beleives she is not worthy of a good relationship so she settles for second best....an occassion rump in the hay with whomever.  \n\nOh yeah, then you have the good women who know how to treat a man and have a good stable relationship and we meet the men who have been with these ""sexual liberated"" woman and they expect the same from us. \n\nIt is no wonder the men are so irresponsible and take relationship so causally."
actually, many of my closest friends are male. yeah, sometimes they do expect more from me then what they are going to get. but i would just flat out tell them that you aren't interested in that.\nalso make sure that your kindness can't be mistaken as flirting. its a fine line, but it is there.
Thank you! you know I listen to young people talk as though\nthey have absolutely no morals at all. Its good to know \nthere are young ladies like you don't ever lose that\nI'M proud of you. thank for giving me hope in trying to reach teens
Have you tried Classmates.com???You can find out a lot there.Tryhttp://www.classmates.com/cmo/user/index.jspthis should help.
jus talk him out frankly n make evrythng clear!
trust me the right answer is brunettes but than again blondes are not stupid i know plenty of really smart blondes and brunettes but most brunettes just have that confident swagger about them that is really attractive
Because people in prison are not in control of themselves anymore.  By raping others, it makes them feel they still have some sort of control.\n\nIt's sick, but it's true.
You know what??? if you love the guy...he loves you..he treats you right and so on and so forth, then stop worrying about his weight and how skinny he is.
Such a stupid question..LMFAO
think twice
there are alot of university websites or other websites that might be able to give you their email address or fone numbers,check namesdatabase.com
Your period is no guarantee that your not pregnant. If you used condoms then you did right. Chances are you are not, but if you have doubts then you need to get a test to be sure.
She probably as a feeling this relationship is headed no where. You both are married what do you expect out of someone who cheats............
That is a STATEMENT....not a question.
It sounds to me like he has very very big problems with committment.  Some guys just have a problem committing to one woman and it terries them when it happens!  He may have said he was ready but when the actual time came for the moving in- he totally freaked out!  This doesnt mean he doesnt love you!  He could love u more than life itself.  He may just be scvared to death!!!!  Go with your heart!  if u think you can work thru it eventually stick with him if u love him!!!  Good luck to u
When she genuinly laughs at your jokes.\nWhen she makes excuses to be close\nWhen she flirts with you\nWhen she initiates conversations when passing each other by\nIf she asks plenty of questions about you\nIf she invites you along to social events
I doubt it, exchanges in person are always a surprise
well if he looks down your shirt again then ask him if he likes??? That will totally embarrass him and he wont do it again!
As long as you have not promised someone that you are seeing other exclusively, you can have as many boyfriends as you like. \nI DO NOT recommend that you sleep with all them however. I think that that is something that should be reserved only for someone that you are serious about & exclusive with.
Patience is the virtue

Sweetie, this is your second, very naive question. How old are you?! Does your mama know you're on here? Go play some video games.
if your action consisted in getting on your knees and giving a B  job to the bartender in front of all the patrons of the bar... I may conclude the following :\n\nif your were that good, chances are that he and they may NEVER forget\n\nif you were bad, relax, he does not even remember your name..\n\ntake care and remember to do it safely..whatever we may guess it was..
Apparently, you know how to tell if your partner had sex, because you are asking this question and deep down you already know, but you have turned it into a puzzle to be solved -- even though you already know.  \n\nWell, anyway, if your partner is a man, then you can tell by having sex with him as soon as possible after you suspect he had sex with another woman and then seeing how much semen he has... and compare it to another time when you had sex with him and you are sure that he didn't have sex for 2 days.  Of course, this is not a 100% sure test since he may have masturbated instead while he was away.  But, in either case, you suspect him and that is a bad sign for you in this relationship.
i do not believe that information is actually free to the public, you would hve to register and or pay for the information with the city that it took place in to find out. Or you can hire a private investigator.
some guys are just not sure what they want, and never thankful for what they have already got.\ndont despair and think so much over it...trust me, its a waste of time..move on and work urself up...there'll come a time in life where these boys will regreat it...i know my ex did
take him to AA because he will not go!!
hang out with your group every day but spend extra time with him. soon he might consider you as a friend. then make your move and talk to him about how you feel.since you talk to him a lot you might be able to do it by your self. if your to nervous have a close friend do it for you(preferably a girl because teling his friend might make him embarresd)if he says no at first it might be awkward to talk to him .dont worry just ease into it. if he says maybe let him take his time. if he says yes your good to go!
Who r u
I have no idea what you are talking about.
Actually, there are a few reasons for this.  Depending on how long you were together, and how serious it was, this is a major change in life and lifestyle, and the human psyche is highly against change, especially something like that which can upset so much else in life.\n\nSecondly, we live in a society where men are still encouraged to not have feelings, or to not express them.  Men who do are usually labeled as gay, no matter what their orientation.  It just isn't cool or macho.  Our society has brought men up to be control freaks over that one part of their life, some call it traditional family values, psychologists call it repression.  If you know this for a fact, dump him and move on with life.
Just be yourself.Make him notice you(well you seem to have no prob wt that since your miss popularity).Try and get to know him and make sure he knows the real you.Ask him out make the first move if he still hasn't made the move.And make sure he does like you before you ask him out.\n\nGood luck
look deep into her eyes and tell her.
Give these personal documents to a friend you can trust and if something should happen, give the friend instructions on how to discard these items. If you have secrets obviously these are secrets for a reason no need to ruin your legacy.
You should live with a guy. What happens if you get into a relationship with her, and it goes down the drain? It'll be a sticky situation. Unless your not straight, then it would be the other way around.
well first of all  tell your dad  i  undestand  u are wiyth  blah blah blah now  but dad  i  would  like it  if u can spend at least this  saturday  with me  just u n me   , and  let her know as well  tell her  hey  im glade   my  dad  makes  u happy  and   u make him happy  but  i would  like some  time  with  my dad  without  u   , another thing  if   your dad   is  like on a visitation type schedule   or what ever   joint custody  , then  tell your  mom  and  let her talk  to  him alone   or even  with u  , your  mom dont have to let the new  gf  in the  house  but  it will look beter  if she does  , another thing  u can also  have your  mom  contact the courts   adn if  u r  old  enough  u can  make a reasonabl  request that  your dad spends  at least  one day out  of the month   with u and  only u  but  dont make  it more than  that one day
"I spent roughly $1,000 for my wedding - and we had enough money to spent a lot more, but I don't see the need!\n\nWe got married in our backyard (the minister came to perform the ceremony) as we lived on a lake and the lake was the background for the pictures.  My brother was in college to be a professional photographer, so he took the photos.  I also gave all of the guests little disposable cameras (not digital back then), but you can ask all of them to bring their own and then email you all of the photos - the candid ones are usually the best anyway!  If you need more professional photos, perhaps you can make a trade with a photographer for something they need!  \n\nAs for food, it was a summer wedding and I didn't want to provide ""hot"" food or anything heavy. I wanted everyone to enjoy themselves, so I put in the invitations that the reception was going to be at the house and that we were going to have fun afterwards - so bring summer clothing to change into!  While everyone was changing, I had a local deli cater finger sandwiches, fruit salad, various fruits and vegetables with dips, chips, hot dogs for the kids, etc.  Everyone loved it and thought it was much more relaxing and enjoyable than a stuffy big wedding! \n\nFor music I asked a few friends to bring their favorite CDs and we just had a nice stereo set up with speakers outside.  We did not have dancing, but instead we all went swimming and waterskiing.  \n\nFor flowers, I went to a local flower grower and bought them at cost - and didn't have many, but had a lot of green plants instead that made it more of a tropical feel - and then those could be kept (still have some!). \n\nI'm sure that whatever you do will be nice - it's a special occasion no matter what you serve or how you decorate.  But just remember that it is all over in one day, so if you can cut costs without causing too many problems, go for it! The number one reason people don't like going to weddings is not because they don't want to celebrate, but because they're normally too formal and not relaxing.  Make it comfortable and everything will fall into place!\n\nGood luck and congratulations!"
no..indego is more blue
The first one that will have me, I'm not shallow.\n\nMay the best girl win...
dinner and a movie is normally the first date kinda thing. Have fun! and remember... first date first base! lol
Dino Tummy sex is no longer practised, it was practised in the Stone ages when a couple would have sex on a dinosaurs tummy  that had just been killed, it was performed as a type of celebration!\nWe have no dinosaurs left now and even if we had the animal rights people would ban Dino Tummy sex!
i wud lose my smelling sense instead
the kind of people who are not real friends???? How can you be have a friendship with someone who is fishing favours from you?????
It means that we don't want miss anything thing that you are saying. As long as you keep eye contact and smile. We are listening.
put water to his emotion, but don't hurt, difficult to do ... but you gotta try... explain everything clearly ... and do it alone, do not involve others at this moment, later on keep him engaged with other girls, suggest him, ask his opinion about other gals, you will gradually cometo know that he is developing some liking for other girl .... and you be the catalyst ... but it will take long time ... you need to be patient and persistent
yes. someone with a bit of sense to ask a decent question.\nim from sa and i love it.
"Women who fall for a military man obviously dont think it through too well.Because they are mostly gone and with other men where it is mandatory to not be around.Then when they are deployed or training far away they have ""mandatory fun"" where they are allowed to ""play"" with females[and males].Or they are allowed off base where you AREN'T to run wild and do as they please THINKIN you will never know.They also think you guys make a large amount of money.lol"
I did cause the girl was all along on Valentines Day and I was also single at the time. Her friends were giving her a very hard time about not having a date, and one of these friends wanted to go out with me and I had told her no, and now she's giving her friend a erally hard time for being alone on Valentines day. So we went out I shoed her a great time, got her friends all jealous, then we made love, and she got so much confidence from our little date that she got a bf about two weeks after that and now I think she's married.
i wouldnt trust your husband as far as i could throw him get out now while you can
Awful! Some kids are just terrible.  And yes i believe that there is a generation of Misbehabed Kids.  In my class there are sooooooo many kids who don't respect the teacher at all and practically do whatever they want and say whatever they want (technically we're not 'kids' anymore but still...this is my example).  Parents need to get their children under control when they're young.  As soon as the kids turn 2, they should make sure that they're not spoiling them (cause they'll turn into brats) and they need to emphasize again and again on how to act with others.
Reminds me of the Cinderella story. But the difference here is that you are smarter and stronger. I wont tell you to run away. I think its best to avoid provoking those people to hit on you or anything. As for your parents, just be polite say hi , goodbye.If they act stupidly , its their problem. See the positive side of the situation, they give you shelter and food besides other things. Why should you give your sisters the pleasure of seeing you run away?. Dont give up without a fight. Teach those bitches a lesson. You are smarter and stronger dont forget.
Common Sense. Treat him/her the same. They were probably bi before you even met him/her, which means you liked them, them telling you does not change anything except for the fact that you know now.\n\nYou would betray your friends trust by treating him or her badly. Evidently he or she trusts you to tell you such a personal thing.\n\nIf you treat him or her differently then you are become the problem, and a bad friend.
If you aren't wanting to do it then why are you asking such a ridiculous question!  Why would anybody want to embarrass anyone else.  Put yourself in their shoes and see how you would like it if someone embarrassed you in front of your friends.
Leave it be for now and stay his friend. If he is with someone else, and ends up running between the two of you, you'll only end up hurt and may lose him as your friend. Bide your time, or if you really must, tell him - but don't act on it when hes with somebody else.
"She/he means that there are mean that live heterosexual lives date women, but sleep with other men. But they claim they are not gay and wont tell there women that they are sleeping with other men. but they are supposed to be living a ""straight"" lifestyle."

oh ok i had to break up with my pen because i caught him cheating break up with that w h o r e cause all she gone do is cheat on you, d a m n pencils and pens!!!
The point is why does it feel the need to tell you this womans coming round to his?\n\nIs he testing the water to see how you react?\n\nYou could always ask him how he feels about your relationship.  You could tell him.  Do you know how he will react?  Will it change your relationship if you tell him?\n\nOr you could be a little sly and invite him round to yours.  Have loads of alcohol and make a move on him, that way if he doesn't respond the ways you want, you can blame it on the alcohol!
honestly i think u should let the 1st guy go cuz he has a gurl already...n as 4 his friend or the guy texting u u should give him a chance n if it doesnt work out it doesnt work...hope i helped cuz i really did try 2
Your not getting enough sex!!
I doubt very much if anyone will put someone elses e-mail address on here.
"I believe the word you want is ""vivid"".  You were just in a light sleep.  The more ""awake"" your brain is while you sleep, the more you dream.  Your brain was just pretty awake that night.  This can be confirmed sometimes by a lack of sleep quality.  Do you feel as rested as you normally do?"
her smile or her eyes. both are big ones for me.
dating sucks. cost too much.
It always seems the moment a girl gets a boyfriend they get a whole lot more attention from the other guys in  their life.  I'd think it's just playful flirting and maybe trying to assert themselves a little as men...or perhaps to keep you and your bf from not hanging out with them (like to show they're comfortable with you- maybe now that you're off limits)
You have to like older women. Sometimes REAL older, like 60s.
Every state should have a Woman's Resource Center, check into it and they will give you all the help that you are seeking.  If they don't then contact local churches and they will guide you in the right direction.\n\nGod bless and good luck!
Sometimes it's hard for me too be cold and mean so I'll be nice and try another tactic to get her off my butt.After awhile,if she's persistent I'll pay less attention to her but still be nice except I won't be striking any conversations with her until she gets the picture.Also,my answers to her questions will be one liners such as,YES,NO,I DON't KNOW,MAYBE,etc.Plus I will avoid her as much as possible!!!
Your county assessors office will have property records with the information you seek.  Some counties in the US have those records on line.
ummm..allow me a second of thought....i can't think of one..but isn't that like an oxymoron??
I believe that action speaks louder than WORDS,the way respect is given by each partner,being thoughtful of each others feeling,humor and affection are also important in my book. Best of all don't hold a grudge,shake it off,U know life is to short for all that Drammma.Look each other eye to eye smile to smile Then give them the lick of LOVE all over there face!!! yeah Girl! Just the kind a puppy gives you when u come home after a long day. Hope you get my meaning.
Sometimes,yes.Nature of people: they seem to realise how much some person means to them when they lose her.When they lose her,they realise what mistakes have been made.\n\nThe other posibility is that they to that because they just don't want to show their feelings.So,they blow you off in hope that you will want them more than ever.People aren't so perfect,as you can see...
Girl,........kick that one to the curb! You deserve better. You said you have your dignity which i believe to be true but wheres your dignity with this situation? Dump him.
Toilet paper.  Read on the net about what people used to do before it was invented.

"Its boyish behaviour and a ""macho"" thing.  \n\nWhen they 'grow up', they will learn how to treat a woman with respect. Until then, they will be thier own borish selves, interested in only what they, (as a group), will collectively be focued on.\n\nIt takes awhile, for them to be ""grown up"", as each will come to term in his own way as they grow up to be the ""man you want"" him to be :)\n\nI wish you well...\n\nJesse"
No you can't. Just enjoy the wonder of their existence and  the wonderful friendship you have. Just don't do it and you will spare yourself agony that's inevitable. So choose the door number 1. and STOP THIS NONSENSE PLEASE!
if he fell in love with another girl and doesnt have feelings for you anymore then you should move on with your life.
jon e carcin might have hit it right on target. If you guys have an intimate relationship and sharing things as married couples do then there might not be any motivation to get married. Additionally, there have been scars along the way that might have affected him and you. Hopefully, you both have had some inner healing.\n\nIt might be time to have a dinner with your sweetie and talk about your relationship and the future. Be gentle but at the same time find out if there is a future together. If there is still doubt then you both might have to take a rest from each other for a little while. During this rest do not date or see other guys. This is about your relationship.\n\nAlso, successful women might affect a guys ego if he feels the need to take care of you but you don't need to be taken care of. He might not understand a sharing of a relationship and could be more used to a dependant relationship. \n\nHere is a idea. Why not read a good book together such as:\n\nBook: Becoming Soul Mates\nAuthor: Dr. Les Parrott III, Dr. Leslie Parrott \nISBN: 0310219264 \n\nI wish you both the best of luck. \n\nBlessings
Women are more in touch with their feelings than men so they tend to be much more emotional.  Men and women can both learn allot from each other if they really take the time to listen.x
im sure you could. im not from elpaso,im from amarillo, but im sure that you could find some nice people.
try taking your mind off ejaculating...look into her eyes and feel the moment. Don't just cum because it feels good. Enjoy the actual moment!
I am a guy and I don't belive him.  Dump him, he's playing you.  Besides, you are going off to college, you are going to meet new guys there.
2 but i aim to be in 99
not have sex anymore =P
yah i will b urs frnd....
After having done the field work, I've come to rely on John Gray's principles (Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus & Mars and Venus on a Date).
Most guys, including me, enjoy seeing two chicks having sex.  We're turned on simply by looking at a naked women - so seeing two women have sex is just simply a bonus.  You should make sure it's something you want to do too.  And if you do then you have to think about jealeousy issues and him joining in.  Of course he's gonna want to join in.  No guy just wants to watch and then go home.  So think about that.  Then if he does join in are you going to get upset if you think he's more into her than you.  There are lots of things going on here that could toss your relationship around a bit.
tell him you want to help with the kid. Maybe then you can spend more time together.

At the end of Sex and the City, Carrie realizes that she just needed to wait for Mr. Big to be ready and her problems were just that, hers. She also realized that waiting is part of growing up and she wasn't ready even when she thought she was.
it depends what you want from the relationship, you need to talk to him about what you want and where you see your relationship heading.
"I agree......! \nAustralian (and New Zealanders) of both sexes can be so gorgeous !!!\nI think they don't take themselves as seriously nor feel desperate like the US people do..they are more humble, down to earth, funny...love the Australians..Worked with several : men and women : gorgeous people on the outside and inside but ""not the flashy type""..\n\n*No ""dating"" potential...I should say.....just friends ! Who like to share and discuss !!\n\nI have several friends from overseas via e-mail;* (star.star !!)some relatively new and some for a long time now.....\nI make friends easier with other nationalities because we are in the same boat.."
Talk to her and find out what happened to her promise. I was just wondering, have you ever broken a promise to your mom? I'll just bet once the new baby arrives you are going to change how you're feeling now.

I BELIEVE ITS MORALLY RIGHT IF YOU CAN DO IT.  I BELIEVE ITS MORALLY WRONG TO GET RID OF IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER(ADOPTION OR ABORTION). ABORTION BEING THE WORST OF THE TWO. IF YOU HAVE TO ADOPT,TRY A FAMILY MEMBER OR SOMEONE CLOSE TO YOU OR YOUR FAMILY. FOSTER CARE IS NOT A GOOD PLACE FOR A CHILD. WOMEN JUST NEED TO LEARN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR RESOURCES.
I hope she has a Will. If not, you better get yourself a lawyer because there's going to be a family feud.\n\nTo make things better with your relationship, you can spend time with her everyday. Take her out to flower gardens or do something she likes to do.
i am a wife in the same place. i dont know if shes hiding anything but she is not happy. if she wants out then let her. just dont put the kids in the middle. do it like adults. they need both parents and if u get along better seperated then its better for them. but if your wife wants out then dont try to force her to stay. my husband is doing that now and it just make matters worse
sure, it's my plessure.
Phone has a more directly sensual quality and the feedback is more immmediate. Hearing a person's voice can be quite pleasurable when they talk sexy.
Rough sex is wild, energetic sexual intercourse. Bites, scratches, bleeding, and bruising are not an uncommon result. More often sex of this nature involves humiliation, spitting, choking, urinating, slapping or rough analingus.\n\nAlthough rough sex may appear violent, rough sex is not rape or sexual assault. Consent is the prime distinction.
Wow - are you really a Southern Belle? I think that you lot have gorgeous accents. (Big 'Gone with the Wind', Scarlett O'Hara, Clark Gable, Marlon Brando, Blanche Dubois fanatic - but that's a different story ...) so, on with your problem:\n\nYour boyfriend sounds like he doesn't know what he wants at all. He likes to be in control of you and his ex and is messing with your heads because it gives him a sense of power. \n\nIf you are determined that you want to stay with this bloke (I'm not sure why you would - if it comes down to it you can come and live with me in England and just talk to me in your lovely voice .....) then a lot is going to have to change. If I were you then I'd give up on him, but failing that I'd suggest that the pair of you move away to a new town, far from his ex. I'd also get him to change his phone number so that that he can't keep in touch with her and make sure that he knows that if he tries to call her again then the your relationship is over.\n\nIf he really is stealing money from his own mother then you have a much more serious problem, because it means that he has no moral standards, so he's not going to respond to ultimatums or care who he hurts. Of the two things, I'd say this was the most worrying.\n\nAnyway, that's my advice. Good Luck, Scarlett!!
It is important but, there are much more important part of life.
be yourself...dont change your personality for the sake of girls...i can assure you they will come for u eventually...it happened with me :-)
YES!!! Go for it.  This kind of situation not come everyday.  If you don't want to loose her for the second time, make your move fast.  Gud Luck!!!!
Since they both suppress the central nervous system worst case scenario is drifting off to sleep and not waking up.
What do you want to do? if you think this person has a future with you then move forward just be careful and take precautions ie meet at a busy place get to know them face to face and take your time DO NOT jump straight in the sack with them until you have more evidence of who they really are. hell you may be soul mates. good luck CASS
ask her to have sex with you
i would say leave but i know you love this guy and maybe he will realize his situation bad and will thing will get better so just threat him you gonna leave him if he didn't get job and see just give him another chance,good luck
I have but one question for you.  Do you really need a friend like that, boy or girl?  If lies are there now they will always be there.  When your friends display qualities that aren't appropriate or honest it is often best to distance yourself from them then before they have a chance to be more serious.  People that lie are evil and often times that is not the only bad quality they have in their personalitiesl.

Its all about companionship. Life is so hard these days, that everyone turns for someone to fight the battle with them. It goes FAR beyond humans. Almost all species demonstrate some form of companionship & its all for the same reason. Loyalty & an eternal friendship.
You talking in terms of wife or Mother? Either way just leave. Nothing more simple then that....
what's your sign? ;)\n\nPisces...\nIn the middle of this month you will get a call from an ex that betrayed you. Tell him to take a hike. If you are single, give your number to an outgoing guy around the 12th. If you are attached, get sensual w/ your man when Venus amps romance around the 29th — maybe a sunset stroll and a steamy shower later (bring a loofah).
Wrong
why can't you marry her?
fun furry socks or a cute stuffed animal maybe if she is into art some really nice colored pencils or markers
I wouldn't be her friend. i wouldn't talk to her at all. she sounds like she has self esteem issues as do you for letting them talk to you like that, just walk away.
Doesn't matter at all what he does it's who he is that is important (which is more that a job)\nSo what you might get hurt? So might he! You'll pick yourself up and dust yourself off. Life is an adventure, not something you tiptoe through, worrying about what 'might' happen
Josh, kill him, trust me. ttml, k? LUV U LOTS!!!!!!!!!!!
because you want to believe that your in love.
"You are not betraying him by having feelings for him. \nThe best advice I can give you is something I heard on tv:\n""if you tell him how you feel what can happen? sure he may not feel the same way about you....or you can have everything you ever wanted""\nTake the risk and tell him...its better than never knowing at all."
I think you should go, it will help you to see your family in a open environment. It is better than seeing them at a funeral.
Laid back can be boring. Funny wild lady can embarrassing by playing around too much. Kinda in the middle self confident who knows how to have fun. lady in the street but a freak in the bed helps thanks luda.

Each person has many different ways of pleasurung themselves,none may pleasure you.\nEven if you think we are stupid enough to write something for you to jerk off too.
oooh go gay go gay!
Simple ASK!!!, and you shall have your answer.
You shouldn't worry about what we (girls) think!\nI love Fall out Boy and Panic! at the Disco (I love their CD'S). I think it is awesome that your able to identify with a any type of music, but still keep your style how you like it. I mean, I listen a lot to rock now, but you wouldn't know I enjoy it just by looking at me! Congratulations you have broken a stereotype! \nJust think of it as a surprise for a girl! She may never guess that you like that kind of music!\n\nYOUR ANSWER SIMPLY: Girls (like me) think that it is awesome that guys listen to more than one type of music or are open to listening more than one type of music!\n\n<3\n~*QUETY*~
I think you are confused, I do not mean to sound like I am disrespecting you, I think you (think the key word) other guys would be happy if they had a gf who was gay, it's not so b/c if she was gay why would she be with a guy? If she was guy how would you be able to compete? and If she is cheating how would you beat up the other guy, if it's a girl? Don't sweat it you are okay real men do not want to have a gay girlfriend. you just like the thought of girl on girl love just not your girl...

I am not a guy. However, if you are asking about the color of your semen, it is fine if it is clear or white. You're plenty fertile, I imagine.
Hm...
one who can spell........
Shes flirting with you. Nothing else needs to be said.\n\n\nGood luck, and godspeed!
YES... i  only  see   my   boy   friend  once a  week   for  a  few  hours...
It means he's a typical stupid guy who thinks with his penis not his brain.  Maybe let this one slide, but if I were you I'd not give him any for a month.  He'll learn.  You have to teach men, they're like dogs.
It's very sad and traumatic when we lose someone we have known for that long.  But to say that you wish you would have died with him is so wrong.  Just imagine the sadness that your parents would have had to endure if they lost both a relative and a daughter.  Grieving takes time and there are stages to it which include denial, anger, resentment, acceptance etc.  Talk with your parents or a counsellor for a start and if you can go visit his grave site and talk with him and let him know that you are sad that he has passed and that you miss him greatly.  But also tell him of the good things that you have planned and that you want to devote some of this goodness in his name.  Hopefully his spirit will be present and you will leave the grave feeling much better after wards.  Make your uncle and family proud and continue to live your life as a happy 14 year old, this is what your uncle would have wanted also.  Good luck getting back on track.
me too rizza but just think he's not worth u
If the guy is decent, cares about you and wants a relationship with you and not just sex, then NO it will not put him off. \n\nI actually understand when you say you think it's degrading- I have also felt like that before, when i was with someone who used to get me to do it all the time. It felt very degrading, like he was just getting an ego trip off it. I really struggle with it now, I very rarely feel comfortable doing it although I hope this changes eventually...\n\nI do think though, that if you can build up a really great trusting and comfortable sexual relationship, you'll probably get over it and start feeling differently. As for technique, ask him to demonstrate how he likes it by sucking your fingers! That'll give you an idea of what to do. But even if you never come round to the idea, that's your deicision and don't let anyone tell you you're wrong.
Yes, if you have an income, the earlier you invest in a house the sooner you can get it payed off.  Look for something inexpensive as a starter home.  Or even a town house. Just don't get something that is out of a reasonable price range. If you are married and have a child, you are better off investing in something like a house then paying someone rent.\n\nIt really depends on where you live as to what kind of houses are out there and how much they sell for.  I live in Oklahoma and bought a nice sized house for only $29k, the same house in South Carolina would go for over $100k and the same house in California would go for about $300k.  \n\nSo do some homework and be patient.  There are some good deals in your area I'm sure.  Good luck!
Kid Rock, Picture
Mmm well he prolly still has some feelings for her but im pretty sure hes not gonna go back out w. her since he was the one to brake up  in the first place..Soo in my opinion i think u should jsut talk to him more. You know flirt areound a bit. Soo he can see the real you..And totally forget about his cheating ex..As you can see shes trying to win him back and all you can doo is not let that happenen by talkin/flirtin =] It'll work out cause he knows how she is. but he still has to see how u are. Ooolala. Haha
Having friends is so over rated, but if you feel like you just have to have a friend, find someone who is more like you, If you enjoy reading you will find someone in the school library, public library,\ndo you do sports? Go to your school function. I was very shy in school too, I came out of my shyness, but I still just love being to myself. I still went to many parties & malls, I just went by myself.\nI still do!    I have watched many of my student come out of their shell!  You'll be O.K.
Ouch! That would certainly upset me. I've been dating my boyfriend for 2 years (I'm 19 next week, he's 23) and there's no way I'd be happy about waiting 10 years. We're planning on getting engaged within the next year and then I want to wait 3 years before getting married. I think I would be very hurt about waiting 10 years personally.\n\n I think his intentions are pure. There's nothing wrong with wanting to have a stable life before you get married, he's probably wanting to be able to provide you with a wonderful life for when you get married.\n\nMy suggestion to you would be to talk to him, tell him how you're feeling- make sure you explain that you understand why he would want to wait but tell him that you want to get married before 10 years and you don't mind if everything's not perfect when you get married. You love him and you want that commitment.\n\nIf he still insists on waiting then it's up to you if you think he's worth waiting for or if it would be best for both of you to move on.\nYou don't want to be bitter about the wait by the time you do get married!\n\nAt the end of the day if he's the one you want to spend the rest of your life with the 10 year wait isn't long when it comes to spending the rest of your lives together..\n\n\n-Elise
she is ok with being ur girlfriend(a friend who is a girl ), so whats the big issue. u want her as ur lover, thts wht she doesnt want.\nso be her friend, and even by mistake if she asks u to have sex with her, dont go and have it,tell her, i just intent to be ur friend ,nothing more.........play the game the opposite way...and see the result. and mind u ,dont go gaga-gogo over her, infact dont show much attention to her , or praise her, just act in a normal way u wud to other female friends.meanwhile try to be in company with her and some other females too...........and show tht extra attention to one among them, and make her feeel tht sting of jealousy
"Oh, I sent lots of packages. I can't remember them all, but here are a few.\n\nOne was to ""keep it cool"" (since it gets hot there)- pitcher, kohl-aid packets, ice tea packets, small battery operated fan, ice cream flavored Baskin Robins candy, deodorant \n\nChristmas package (it is that time if you celebrate)-small tree already decorated. You can wire the ornaments on so they will stay through the mail, a stocking stuffed with goodies.\n\nDid you send him a pillow yet? My husband always wanted a nice pillow, so of course, I sprayed it with my perfume.\n\nPicture frames with pictures of you!!! Lots of love letters!\n\nI sent some cheap $1 DVDs from Wal-Mart for him to play on his laptop. Comedies. And popcorn (already popped unless he has a microwave.)\n\nAt Wal-greens you can make all kinds of fun stuff with\npictures. A puzzle of a personal picture of just you\nor the two of you is $20 (Kind of expensive)\n\nCopies of the town/city newspaper will remind him of\nhome. I know our newspaper will mail it there\nfor free. \n\nThe dollar store has cheap, fun games, like chess,\ncheckers, cards and dominoes. \n\nAlso, you can pack things in empty paint cans and decorate\nthe outside of them with modgepodge and pictures or\nmagazines. \n\nThose are the only ones I remember right now!"

omg I HATED IT WHEN PPL DID THAT! I always just wanted to scream GROW UP at those idiots. They looked so stupid.
Just be with youre friend. Never leave her when she cries. I guess thats one thing you could do. If you think its appropriate to do some action, since you knew the case more than I knew it, then do, if you think its morally and ethically correct.
LEAVE HIM AND THEN GO TO YOUR DOCTOR AND GET CHECKED UP111
This girl doesnt seem like she should be labeled a friend.  \n\nMore like a trouble maker.  Cut her off!!!!  She is not worthy to speak to or surround yourself with such negativity.  Drama will constantly follow you if you keep her as a friend.
You are an adult...so it doesn't really matter what age of a person is...if you like them or are attracted to a person...go for it!!!\nBefore I married my husband...who happens to be  1 year younger than me....I had always dated older men.  Some slightly older some were quite a bit older. I was 24 or 25 when I started seeing a guy who was 28. After him I dated a guy who was 42. So it all depends on who you find attractive.  Gosh when I was 21 I was seeing a guy who was 45 or 46, He was a real piece of work though.\nSo really there is no age limit...just your own preference is mandated.  Go out ...have fun....and enjoy life!!
You're too nice. Start treating a little worse and they will respect you more. Every time you think about doing something nice for her stop and think would you do this for one of your guy friends. Girls don't like a guy that they can walk all over.
Girl..... You shouldnt even bother with this person.\nHe cheated.... he lied.... he has no respect for you at all and you deserve better.\nlove is a mutual feeling where you both respect each other and always put each other first it is a two way street simple as that. it took me a long time to learn this and it was the hard way but when you find a man who treats you like a goddess and you feel the same you will be truly happy, this person you are speaking of will not. leopards do not change thier spots as it goes....
Go ahead with the bouquet/garter toss, but you don't have to do the latter part where the bachelor puts the garter on the bachelorette.  \n\nSome other fun things to at your wedding:  Have the d.j. ask all married couples to join you and your bride on the dance floor.  Every couple of minutes he'll ask couples who've been married less than 1 year to leave the dance floor (except you and your wife), it gets whittled down to the longest married couple and you and your bride, then you exchange partners - She dances with the longest married man, you with the longest married woman.  Very sweet.  Hey!  As an alternate to the bouquet/garter toss, you could give that couple the bouquet and garter as special memento's!  \n\nCongratulations & Have fun!
You can be a wonderful sister-in-law by BEING YOURSELF. Usually with Hindu weddings they have 2 ceremony's and then the reception. It will be a great experience for you and you'll have a great time!! Just have fun, relax and enjoy yourself!!
Because the mere thought of losing them kills you inside
one word: ANAL..
"I am sooooo sorry!! I went through the exact same thing!!!! Only it went on for quite some time before I realized he wouldn't ever marry me! I was so completely DEVASTATED.\nI'm sure you feel used, cuz hon, you were.  I was too.  It's so hard to accept people who purposely use and hurt others.\n\nHe got what he wanted.  Just what he wanted.  A priceless jewel such as yourself so he could brag about it and add it to his collection of stuff he's done.  I'm really sorry about it.  And he could've cared, a little, but a little doesn't repair the damage.  A little doesn't make him love you.  A little doesn't make him want to marry you.\n\nI wish more than anything that things had worked out with my first one.  I was 24 and a virgin, also, and loved him with all my heart and thought he was ""the one"".  I'd promised myself that I would NEVER have sex with a man unless I knew he was the one I'd marry and that I fully trusted.\nMan do I ever regret giving in to this man!\n\nIt's not rape, even if they keep persistently trying to get it from you and you say no over and over again and then finally give in.  It's the giving in part that makes it not rape.  If he takes it from you without your consent, and if he takes it from you after threats or force, then it's rape.\nI've been there, done that before too (I didn't do the rape, it was the other way around).\n\nAnyway, good luck honey.  I totally feel your pain!!!!"

"for some girls it just seems an the extra challenge, it makes the ""victory even sweeter""  Think of it like in soccer if you have an ok shot at goal but if you pass the ball your team mate will have a sweet shot.  do you take the easy one or the one that you have to work harder for and get all the glory, if either way you win the game"
You seem to have a handle on the language, so I hardly think that's the problem.  I've seen Americans on here who didn't write as understandably as you have.  I'm pretty sure he didn't mean to hurt your feelings, but he DOES have a valid point, hun!  It is nice having a nanny but she won't always be with you to comfort the crying baby.  What does she do to make the child stop crying?  Babies cry naturally, they teethe, have gas and things like that and can't tell us what's hurting.  You should try to take a little more of a hands-on approach yourself...you may be surprised at the postiive results!
Same problem I do not know sorry.
Personality, a sense of humor, and a liking for adventure. I'm an adrenaline junky, she must keep up!! Oh yeah, a good bod won't hurt either.
i dont know..... :P
When people want something badly enough, they don't give up...trust me on that. Maybe he just likes her too much, he has his reasons though, I'm sure.\nI answer whether or not guys like shy girls though - I'm a girl, sorry!
There is a feeling that person is as close to you as a brother or sister -- you have gone beyond a close friendship.  You feel at ease around the person and happy to see or talk to  him or her.
i understand the confusion perfectly... (went through it myself)\nbut remember - once your paths separated and you have a new life, stick to what you have, and forget what you MIGHT have had IF you and this girl were together.\nif you are married, it is not worthy to destroy your marriage for some 20 years old fantasy (because holding up or trying to revive the past IS a fantasy).\nyou might have feelings towards her - actually towards that girl you knew 20 years ago - not the woman that she is today. YOU HAVE CHANGED, SHE HAVE CHANGED...\nbe careful! keep you heart safe!\ntake care

"Wow you must be in middle or high school... All this is just drama!  Let it go. If they see it doesnt bother you then they will get over it! Dont live your life by trying not to say the wrong thing or always trying to impress someone. Its not worth it! Trust me....I have been to hell and back with drama, lies, backstabbers, and ""friends"". If they are your true friends they will learn to grow up and get over stupid crap. You should be allowed to speak your mind without them getting mad over it. \n--Gook Luck!--"
What language speak?
Well fact is that you lived just fine thank you very much when he was not your boyfriend and that in reality you can now also.  If your boyfriend is telling you that your like a dog chasing a bone then you should get the hint that he needs time to himself as you must also.  It's unhealthy to spend ever minute with your significant other as both have to have some time alone.  Besides what is going to happen if you or he ever tire of one and other and the relationship ends.  You'd certainly have to live without him them and just as before you would be able to do so.  Give him some breathing space and take some for yourself.

"You should be, pissed, I never ignore my woman but some times I feel like I should. I used to give her so much attention now she tells me that ""that doesnt mean any thing, that was then this is now"". I used to get mad now Im just confused. Try this ignore him see what happens...."
I would say that perhaps he feels a bit embarressed making a baby and leaving the woman while she is going through the pregnancy alone. that does not mean that  he should stick around in a relationship that sounds doomed ,as it will not help the baby in the long run.\nit's great that you are willing to be part of the baby's life ,but you will need to remember that it is not just his, there is a mother who quite possibly resents your presence a bit. so as romantic an idea it is to love a new born baby ,he might be thinking ahead of complications, especially if him and her are having communication problems. perhaps he does also think that a paternity test is in order before giving the news to family.explaining this to family and friends can be difficult if they have known the ex well,and he may be scred of being judged.
I sure hope you find the right answer, so you can forward it to me.I am to the point right now that I would take him good or bad.
Sadly you seem to have landed yourself with a very insensitive person.
no way! thats not abd at all! as long as like you like him and not just staying with him coz he buys you stuff!\ni wish i had one!

Hello, \n  My name is Rod and I'm 36.  I think that part of the problem is that a lot of guys just dont have respect for women,  or they disrespect thinking that they are cool and they are not even putting the shoe on the other foot because if they were being sincere and some women started bashing them I dont think that they would like to be treated like that.  Kinda like the pot calling the kettle  black.   hope this helps and good luck in your search.
The first thing I think you should do is to talk to your friend about this.  Explain to her that you like this guy and you don't want her to go after him.  That's not a good friend if she is going to go after the guy you like.  You need to make your move for this guy now before it's to late.
I don't think you can really be prepared. I agree with someone who said enjoy them now. I knew we were going to loose my Dad. I was very close to him. After many, many months it dawned on me, that he was gone physically, but what he taught me and gave me (the love, the nuturing) no one could ever take that away. I hold onto that. And he is still with me in my heart and mind every day, and this is how I fianally came to terms with it. He's not gone to me at all. I may not be able to talk to him, but he's with me in my thoughts always. That can't be taken from me. I'm a part of him in many ways. I think this is the nature of life. Keep what they gave you in spirit. You're stronger than you think you are. Just enjoy them now.
every girl is different
What r u gonna do? be single for the rest of your life.  Go ahead and go out with him, but take it slow.  Maybe look back at the last relationship, see what you can learn from it.
"How old are you?\nIf you don't want to be looked at as someone you're not then you better start figuring out who you are! It's easy to tell that you have no clue. If you did you wouldn't be wanting to run from this situation. \nYour priority right now should be to focus on just that-- finding out who you are. Naturally this takes years and years, but you can jump start this by:\nConcentrating on improving your health, body, mind, spirit, and soul.\nGet a better education\nVolunteer and help those less fortunate than you are\nTake some ""fun"" classes\nRead some self help books\nKeep a journal\nPray daily\nLearn to be more musical\nWrite about fifty essays beginning with the words ""I believe...""\nSpice up your social life by getting involved in some new activities or clubs (not party clubs-- clubs that promote growth and learning) \nJoin a yoga class.\nMeditate daily.\nWrite a list of the principles you call your own and hold most dear\nStart a new exercise\nConcentrate on learning and loving YOU for now.\n\nAnd about the ex:\nIf you have kids together your s.o.l. You are stuck together for life to one degree or another unless-- God forbid-- something happen to the kid(s).\nIf you don't have kids together then just grab hold of... your courage... and tell the lady you are moving on. Tell her you tried. It didn't work. You see now that it will not work. You do not need her drama games. You are going to stop contacting her. You want her to stop contacting you.

If she married your best friend, means she do not love you and love can not be forced. By hate your best friends it will hurt your selves, should you be able to be yourselves and control your own emotions, it will be good for you and your best friends. If you really love her, means you appreciate your girl friend decision. If you still can consider your best friends as before, then you will be a gentleman and you have two best friends, and life will still enjoyable to make you be able to find the companion of yours. Difficult or easy is in the mind and wish you be able to overcome your own feeling.

She displays herself with her act much more than trying to say it for it's in her character. \n\nA Scorpio woman has her own mysterious personality. She is confident and deep down inside she is quite proud of herself. She hates to think she is borne a woman and so limiting her with a certain social acceptable rules. She is a real woman and despite her innocent and childish looks, she has a spirit of free soul. Many men will make mistake if they think she is a good follower, they are wrong.   \n\nShe thinks being a plain simple housewife is boring. She likes to have power and control over other people, but this will be only her secret, so you will only see a cute woman. Every things she does will look good, and she has all the woman's trick you can think of. She can manipulate men without they knowing it.   \nIf you think she going to do everything you say because she loves you, then you will be disappointed. She could be a little tomboyish and she can understand you by just looking in your eyes. You may say sweet words which could sweep any woman, but not with the Scorpio woman. She will use her X-ray eyes reading your thought of what you just said or what you are going to say.. She always smile and she can really hide her feeling. \n\nyou can email me so i can send to you the continuation.
There was really no need for this to escalate as it has.  You could have just told her you were going to be spending the week showing some old friends, who are a couple, round your country.  She has picked up that there is something wrong and now the two of you are at odds with each other.  Had you been upfront with her and told her what was going on, the ball would have been in her court as she would have had to trust you.  I think if you want still to be with her, you will need to explain to her that you were showing some old friends round (say they are a couple) and that you were not sure whether to tell her or not, since you used to date the female half of the couple, a long, LONG, time ago.  Even if you do think she was totally in the wrong, I think it would be politic for you to apologise nicely to her for not having trusted her to trust you.  I think it would be very difficult for her to answer that one without looking bad herself.

Here I am!  I have all the characteristics that I didn't when I was young and dumb.  Now I'm mature and wise and young enough to still have a family.  This time I know what I want in a relationship and I know how to listen and share in what my woman wants from me and our relationship.  Young guys r fools they don't know when they have a good thing, u sound great I too am more God fearing these days.  Write to me click on my avatar, who knows we might be God sent for each other, no promises or frills just notes.
THAT IS COMPLETLY UP TO YOU, HAS HE BEEN PART OF YOUR LIFE SO FAR?  WAS HE THERE ON BIRTHDAYS, CHRISTMAS, ETC?  PEOPLE DO CHANGE, BUT REMEMBER ONLY IF THEY WANT TO, NOT EVERYONE DOES.  YOU HAVE TO PROTECT YOURSELF SO HE DOESN'T HURT YOU AGAIN....GOOD LUCK!!

Because they give it up!
I say 9 months before, you want to make sure that you have chosen the right friends and family as your bridesmaids. You dont want to chose them too early in case of a disagreement or fallout.\n\nIm planning on a June 2008 wedding too, and I have decided on most of the bridal party and only 4 of my friends know (life long also) and I am having doubts on one, so I want to wait and ask.Plus since they already know, they are constantly talking about the wedding and not everyone knows. Then I have 2 of my friends already fighting for maid of honor!\n\nMake sure to give them enough time to save $ and lose 5lbs if necessary, holidays are coming and some of us eat too much pie = ) So I think 9 months is good. Im coming out in a wedding in July and I was just told, and it gives me enough time to save money and lose some holiday weight.\n\n*Goodluck!*
I can remember back to when I was about 8 months old. but also have slight memories of when I was really little and couldnt even talk. Those memories are more like feelings than actual thoughts though !!\n\nI remember my dad and my cousins playing scaletrix in a house we moved out of when I was 2yrs old.\n\nI also remember climbing a ladder of a 2 storey extension when my dad was on the roof at the same house ( that gave him a freight )\n\nI was a in the times newspaper from about 3 months old ( mum being a professional photographer )\n\nI remember climbing out of my crib at the child minders and freeing all the other kids that couldnt climb out.\n\nI remember getting my hand trapped in the hinge of the old red phone box's in gunnerside in Yorkshire. My mum didnt know which way to open or close it to get my little hand out with out cutting it off.\n\nAlso got my hand caught in the lock of the old carriages between charing cross and waterloo east. Again mum didnt want to open the door incase I fell out!!\n\nBut above all I remember seeing a clown and being so scared and disturbed by it that even to this day I cant stand them.
"wow- i went throgh the same thing as  teen.  I was 17 and my mom hardly bought me clothes, make up or whatever.  me and my friend used to go to  target and ""take clothes"" and makeup until we got caught.  I was arrested and so was she- we got charged with burglary because the ammount of makeup  and clotheswe stole was over $300  (make us expensive).  I had to do community service, pay a restitution etc.  Getting caught was enough for me.  No matter what you tell her- what she steal will never be enough because every time she does it seems easier and easier despite the fact that it's free stuff.  All she needs is to get cuaght and that will teach her a lesson.  Hopefully she will learn it before she gets caught.  After high school i got offered a job at the Employment Developmend Department  EDD  government job and becauase of my background i couldn't get it!!!  I wa so mad a t myself for being stupid when iwas young.  Years have passes and that's in the past but- the emberrassment i went though is something hard to get over especially after my family found out what i was doing- they wouldn't trust me in their houses.  Tell her my story and see what she says.  If she doens't stop after you tell her- break up with her because if she ever gets vaught she can say that she was in it with you too!!!!!!!!!\n\nGood luck"
"No, not purposelly.  I ""shag"" sometimes when I don't feel good, it helps me feel better.  Fat people eat, I have sex...LOL"
I think in todays world .. alot of us are selfish, but not knowing that we are!!\n\nfor the last few months I have always wanted more money, more items etc etc.  But you have to remember your roots and think of those less fortunate than youself !
I always took my little brother-in-law to the movies and the mall. I'd let him pick out what movie he wanted to see, and then I always bought him something little at the mall (like candy, a clearance t-shirt, ect.). He loved it!
I would ask them if they want to hang out, maybe invite one guy to a party where you know everyone and feel safe, rather than going out alone with him.  See what you guys have in common and go from there.

Don't let the past dictate your future.  If you can't tell someone how you feel then the relationship(whether friends or more than that) is not healthy.  If there are insecurities because of the past then you aren't being fair to this person, basing your feelings and insecurities on someone who came before gives no room to someone new.
As a man, I would feel flattered if a woman asked me out - assuming, of course, that I already liked her in the first place and was just too nervous to ask her.  When guys ask someone out, we're taking a big jump.  We hope you'll say yes and that the jump will have been worth it.  However, when you say no, we feel embarassed for having jumped in the first place.  When the woman asks the man out, it saves us from having to jump at all.  However, now you are taking the risk.  I think we are all afraid of being rejected, of having someone not like us.  Asking someone out and hearing the person say yes is one of the biggests leaps in this area.  But, if you already like the person, hopefully that will give you enough courage to ask.
Yep. There's your best answer. Kiss.
Maybe your family is intimidating him since you got married and thats why he wants to move you away.Who knows ask him that and tell him it won't hurt you but you need to know what his prob is.He knows what his prob is but is scared to tell n the only reason i say that is because he said moving would solve his problem which means he knows what it is.

Look you take your time, find someone you want to be with, don't go for someone just cos your mates are doing it, u'd be letting your principle's down and yourself, and if your mates take the Micky they're not such good mates after all... and as for every thing else you've asked advice on it'll will all come to you naturally i promise.. you seem very cool for your age and you'll figure it out.. when kissing don't have wet lips and for god sake don't stick your tongue down they're throat straight away.. take it slow u'll be great good luck

Yeah, maybe.  Just remember there was a reason you broke up in the first place and that sometimes things don't change.

Why not? If you miss these guys, it's certainly a great opportunity to meet up!! However, if you're social diary's full leading up to Chrimbo, why not organise a New Year party, say in the 2nd week of Jan?  Avoid the mad rush and this gives you a bit more time to organise it!
if you in a position of being hurt then you need to leave there are alot of places that will take in woman and children that are victims just look in your yellow pages, local DFS office, or on-line and get help dont think it Will pass because most times it will just get worse
If she suggested a change, she's not happy.  Do the right thing, bow out now before she ends up bitter and resentful.  You can find someone else in college.

I think that you should back away from him. Right now, you're letting him have all the benefits of being with you, while you have to share his affections with another girl.If he really loved you than he would give up the relationship with the other girl and soley be yours. You should give him an ultimatum...either she goes or you do. You definitely deserve better than second rate...which is where he has you now. Also, you should be aware that if you do get with him he could have a secretive relationship with someone else while you two are dating just like he has done with you now.
id say first: give her/him the benefit of the doubt.. second: confront or ask politely.. third: decide if its really bad or forgivable..\n\nassess the situation.. i personally like to forgive but unfortunately not forget :)
you can try www.cakesgalore (located in panama city) and find out if you can do a sampler tray instead this may work better, good luck
have you tried training wheels, let him get a little more confident in his bike riding skills and then it should be a cake walk after that
why the hell are you depressed if he wants you back and you want him back and yet you said no when he wanted you back?

You have a right to be angry.  He is saying he doesn't want to be around you for 24 hours and I understand that but being around you 1-2 days out of the month is just not right or fair. He also said that he is tired of you. Doesn't sound good for a man to say to a woman he's about to marry. Does he plan to keep this up even when you all are married? I applaud him for  working but he needs to balance it out (work and family). Honestly, I think there is something wrong with this picture. He only comes around you 1-2 days out of the month and his mom has your car! That is not your problem that his mom doesn't have a car. Since he is working so much, he should help her get a car and his mom appears to be inconsiderate. Get your car back and maybe work out something where you can take her to where ever she has to go whenever you can. His mom will probably never get a car because she has yours.  If she is going to use your car, she should only use it for places she HAS to go only.  I suggest you seriously think about your plans to marry this guy. I understand you love him and all, but marriage is a lot of work and if he's never around, how do you all plan to spend any time together which is a big part of marriage. I believe I have answered your questions, but yes he (and his mom) is being very inconsiderate and you all need to really talk and figure out if you 2 should marry. Good Luck.
i think the best way is honestly asking him and speaking up about how you feel.....theres really no easy way to do this and its hard to not feel jealous. i hated showing signs of jealousy towards my boyfriend but sometimes you have to.\ni know that in my last relationship i didn't speak up and ask him about other girls and he ended up breaking up with me for this other girl that was always sticking around.\ni was so upset about it, and knew he always had a thing for her too. well the good news was they went out for 2 months and realized she wasn't the same way i was. broke up with her and now is coming back to me. weird isn't it?
That's horrible. You obviously don't care too much about your bf. If you're having any doubts about the two of you after a year, you need to end things. And don't go after the friend. That's a rule I do believe.
naked pillow fights
i would ask why and if it makes sense then i'll leave...sometimes, they are just lost in the situation..\n\nif there's nothing that can be done...i will leave but it will surely break my heart
Tell her the honest truth.\nAfter that you wait to see her response and you have to have enough self esteem to know you are ok no matter how she responds.
i really am too busy! sorry!\nwww
Some girls are b****es and I'm sure she had it coming.\nI mean, I feel really horrid for saying that but no one has the right to treat a kind person like that. Hopefully, she'll change for the better. \nYou were sweet to go with her though
I know that I am considered to be very intelligent, and I know for a fact that my girlfriend is smart.  I love it.  Smart people tend to become smarter when they are paired together.  They learn from each other.  I love smart women.\n\nTo the person who answered first... That was not only uncalled for but offensive.  Shame on you.

Well, it is kind of irritating to be in your situation so don't feel bad, it is frustrating. I suggest that you just keep on writing you irritations down here so when she makes that decision, and she chooses you, all you have left are the nice words and feelings. Keep that written, semi-anonymous rants pouring in here!
"Hopefully he is really into you.  Maybe he thinks that by playing it cool means he has a lot of ""class""( I personally don't think so).  He shouldn't make you wait; but you shouldn't rush into things either.  If you don't feel comfy making the 1st move, don't.  Find out what you can until you feel like he is really into you; he might ask you if you are ""dating"" other people, & then maybe he'll ask you to be being exclusive w/him.  Always leave the ball in his court.  If he's a gentleman or the right guy; he'll let you'll know."
"I think that if you are not fantasizing about your ""crush"" then there is something wrong with you.  it's healthy and completely normal to have fantasies, plus is makes your day so much more interesting!"
Everyone tries to be nice to other people. So i guess you were trying to be nice too. So it's no a wrong thing to let someone think you like them. Anyway who says you must let other pp know you dont like them. So ultimately, the rule of thumb is that you question your very own intention. If you let someone think you like them because of good intentions then its okay.
well yeah it does exist for me...why??r u in love??
If a girl wants more than friendship she will flirt with you. If she just wants a friendship she'll normally do stuff that will kinda hurt you because she know that you will always be there or come around.
you will grow out of this as you start to mature and grow into your self. You still dont know who you are yet. Most 20 year olds dont know who they are yet or where they want to be in life. As time goes on and you start to determine which direction life is taking you, you will begin to make friends like you. give it some time. Be asertive (probably not spelled right) introduce yourself to people make yourself known.
um, let him worry about it. what are you, his mom???
depends on how big and how they carry it...\n\nmo'nique is a hotty...\n\nstar jones (in her big days) was not...
I have had a very successful christian relationship with my girlfriend for 3 1/2 years now. We have actually helped each other strengthen our faith. We attend church services together, discuss our beliefs and questions about religion and faith regularly, and we've even done study books together such as the Purpose Driven Life. Since we are not married yet, we also practice abstinence. Developing our relationship with each other has actually helped us to better develop our individual relationships with God.
"Look, come clean and tell him how u feel. If ur too shy, then just ask him ""do u have any special feelings for me?"" and see his answer. If its positive, then tell him how u feel. If negative, just say ""yeah, ur only a frriend to me"" and then try to get his attention with somethings he likes, but be careful, DONT B TOO OBVIOUS!!"
id say yes he still has feelings for you but your the one who nos what you want and need
its very hard to stop thinking about someone you love eventhough they may not want you anymore! believe me i did the same thing. the reason why we do it is because we want something that we cant have. we as human beings, want what we cant have! that is why you keep thinking about wanting to be with him. trust me, you will get over him and you will stop thinking about him. it just takes time. to keep your mind off of him, try hanging out with friends and do some different activities to keep him off your mind. believe me, you will eventually! good luck!
At least the advantage is you both are in the same country and not bound by boundaries or difference in culture. I believe it can work if you two work on it. Either of you can move when the time comes...\n\nYes, so long as both of you are happy and love one another why not?!
be urself,friendly and outgoing.stop trying 2 find girls just 2 get in there pants woman see that coming a mile away.
You've really gotten yourself in a pickle, huh?\n\nGrass wasn't greener on the other side?  Hell...doesn't even sound like it got MOWED by that lazy bastard.\n\nListen, you've messed up people's LIVES by making the choices you made.  My personal opinion is that you more or less deserve whatever garbage comes your way.\n\nYou should leave that lazy son of a bitch and move on with your life...and think about the decisions you make from now on.  Believe me, there's a whole other world out there beyond the tip of your own nose.
"It would be helpful to know the why's of the break-up. It is possible that she is trying to make you believe that she is happier now than when you were dating, but whether or not it's an act would be hard to know. However it should be noted that IF she had forgotten you, she certainly wouldn't be looking back at you as she left class, now would she? What you did in the past is just that, in the past. It's what you do now, in the present that she's going to notice. If the break-up wasn't due to misbehavior or drugs/alcohol, it would be worth trying to simply talk to her. Whether via e-mail or in person. Just a simple "" So how is everything going?"" would at least start things off. Good luck."
"Sure if you want a girl who will feed ur head full of all your ever want an need to get to your bank acct, (then move on AND LEAVE U WITH MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS WITH NO CONCERN HOW BAD THEY MAY HAVE EMOTIONALLY AFFECTED U.)\n\n When she met a richer man or some idiot who will play her the same way maybe not for money but watever this guy may need her for besides love leaving her too one day saying...\n\n""BUT HE SAID HE LOVED ME HE WAS EVERYTHING I WANTED IN A MAN HE WAS LIKE MY BEST-FRIEND, HOW COULD HE DO THIS TO ME...""

Your question is a bit vague, but I'll try to answer it. Fathers may appear to have less value in our society because they're perceived as the bread winners and not home as much to take care of the child rearing responsibilities. Men can be just as good caretakers as women, but only when equally shared by the mother. It's too bad that in today's society, it's harder and harder for just one parent to work while the other stays home. A dollar just doesn't go as far today as it did in the 50s. My only advice, is live within your means, don't stretch yourself too thin with a huge house and fancy car, if one of you can't stay home while the infant is in the most important development stages of his or her life.
It's probably best not to propose to her unless you really want her to say no.  You should go on a few dates, and progress through the process at a natural pace.
"The fact that you mostly see him at work, that is a great opportunity for you. Please don't be too forward with him - like asking him out on a date or telling him straight that you like him. He could be one of the guys that find it a turn-off. Instead try to show more interest in what he does at work, ask him ""neutral"" questions like: ""What challenges are you currently facing here at work?"", ""What are your future dreams?"" After about a month of chatting with him, start buying him lunch (but not too much) maybe once in two weeks, and say ""I like this dish so much, I just thought of sharing with you."" Be Creative ... good luck!"
I only get it once a month...twice if I'm lucky.  It drives me mad not to be able to get it whenever I want.  Kinda makes me feel like my man isn't attracted to me.  But, there has got to be a good reason behind it.  My man had medical issues.  I can respect that even though it drives me mad.  Besides...there are other ways to please each other without sex!!!  I know this!!!
Many different guys have different ways of showing their affection. Some tease and play, while others approach relationships very seriously. If he pays a ton of attention to you, negative or positive, he probably likes you, but then you may be in the friend zone. \n\nMy advice: if you like him enough to be worth the trouble, confront him carefully. Tell him how you feel. Being desired (but not smothered) is a great turn-on. If he gives you a less than enthused answer, back off and give him room. Mystery and playing it aloof can also be big turn-ons. He may just come around, and if not, at least you've cleared the air and can move forward with someone else. But he might just say he likes you back, and voila - you've got yourself a budding relationship! Congrats! \n\nEither way, take it from someone who knows - life without telling people you like or love them is filled with regrets. Regrets bite. So put yourself out there and hope for the best! (And update so we know how it went). Best of luck!
take her out for a nice meal then talk to each other openly .......... good luck
I told my husband that I loved him 2 min. ago and my son that I loved him 1 min. ago!

It must make you feel angry and hurt that your wife would post a profile on Yahoo! personals.  Perhaps it's something you should sit down and discuss with her?
Get out in public-dont look online
When you find out, let me know. I feel your pain, even though I'm a guy.
I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLE GUILT.  WHY ARE YOU CHEATING ON YOUR WIFE ANYWAY THEN HAVE THE NERVE TO SAY YOU LOVE HER. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED AND CONFESS YOUR MISTAKES. AFTER SHE FINDS OUT WHAT YOU ARE DOING SHE PROBABLY WON'T WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU EITHER!!!!
"ok...this is what you should do...(you might not like it but do it)\nact as if you dont care one bit...always act like your busy doing stuff or whatever...when she calls,tell her you have to call her back later because you are doing ""the whatever""\nand wait a while before you call her back...strike that...make her call you back a couple of times but dont answer,then answer the next day or hell it would be better to wait a few days.and just explain how busy you are...i know you will hate not talking to her,but if she is the true one for you,she will be hounding you constantly and calling or coming over or whatever.   but if she dont then you know that it just isnt gonna happen and you need to start over...i know its not easy...i've been there,trust me i know!   but do these things and if shes the one she will be hounding you all the time...and do not...i repeat,DO NOT GIVE IN!  stick to it and if thinngs dont go your way dont let her know your hurt because she will use it against you later.\nbut i do hope that things will work out for you and i will say a prayer for you.\n\ngood luck"
I DO
yea only thing big that i can think of
The answers where other have stated what is the difference is not far off to what the true answer is.   Initially, most guy has \nthe urge to get laid but as they get older they should start to change.  Remember that me are visual creatures and women are more verbal creaturs.  As you get older men want start to change.  I think your question can not be truely answered due to every man is different and do not all want the same things such as sex (Yes, it is true all men are not male chovanist pigs).  I think the best answer to your question is that if you have a conversation with a guy and he calls and or continues to show interst then your traits are what he is looking for.  I personally enjoy a woman that can have fun and is strong willed due to I do not want a woman whom I have to babysit and reassure her that she has self worth because I do not have time to that but other guys may want to have a girl that they want to baby and to be the provider.
I'm a frog, and I will most certainly let you know the Prince thing happens. Women are so prejudiced against me as it is now. Good Luck my brother !
i am sorry but iam going to be honest--you probably annoy her that is the reason why she doesn't pick up the phone --stop calling her for a while find something to do when you get that urge to call her --is she is truly your best friend she will star to wonder and she will call you back!!
just be yourself be honest and tell her the truth
First off, do you know if she's single or seeing someone right now? She could just miss you as a good friend, what I think you should do is ask her yourself. Either get her number or meet with her if you're in the same area. Do it casually, don't make it seem like a big deal. Just reminisce about old times and casually bring up your relationship back then. Ask her if she ever thought of you as maybe more than a friend or if there was ever a possibility of there being more between you two. The worst that she could say is you're just a friend, and you'll never be satisfied until you find out for sure. Trust me, I'm learning the hard way. Hope this helps a little.
girls feel that other guys  are the best to help  when they are looking at  other guys. I know for sure that  when i was wanting to date  a next  guy  my best friends  where the first  guys that  i went to. so  yeah  it is because over all  guys are not as hopeless as we girls think. they alway  know something more that  we did  not  know to begin with
licking asshole
Ask your heart and you will get the answer
I Think Thats Totally BOGUS...She did you dirty..Best Friends are supposed to watch out for you and be there to support you not to be messing around with the boy you love..I think it would be hard to forgive someone after they did something like that....But if you guys have been friends FOREVER than I guess you can try to put the past behind you.
You should stay and make the best of your marriage ,your feeling bored because things are not exciting and new anymore , learn to take pleasure in the little things in life , as for you and your wife try to plan a weekend once a month for the 2 of you to get away  a change of scenery can make all the difference in the world , I can tell you this , if you go out looking for something new ,it will only be a matter of time before that becomes boring as well , no matter what it is ,car , home , relationships, newness wares off . You have to create moments with your wife that you will always cherish .
She doesn't have that luxury. If she wants money for child support, then she has to prove paternity.
i love your mom !!!
You're having oral sex therefore you are having sex. It's called oral SEX after all. If you don't want to have sex then don't even do the oral. It seems like a tease to me. You're all hot and bothered and oral is normally the lead into the sex. There is no in between so if you're not ready then don't have oral sex either.
The lies, the fact that someone I trusted didn't think they could or wanted to do the work needed to build a great marriage.\n\nI'd say it's either the lies or the death of the your dream of who your spouse was, or the hope that your marriage would get better.\n\nI was angry at myself for my mistakes, and angry at her for her lies, deception and manipulation.\n\nThe blame-shifting angers me too.\n\nSorry, I couldn't nail it down to just one ;)
No, you're not wrong. Unless hers is THE ONLY salon in the radius of 100 miles, he should respect your wishes, and go elsewhere. There's no hard feelings between myself and my ex, but I would never ask him to do a house remodel for my husband and I (he works in construction). This would be in bad taste; there are plenty of other contractors out there.
You don't tell him.  You show him.

you should deffinitly just tell your parents. all of you should sit down and discuss it. as for your getting married, marrige is all about compromising. you both think you are right and  neither of you want to give in. you just have to think what is more important to you- him or you being right? sit down and talk with him about how you feel and dont let it turn into an argument. it wont hurt to listen to him and try to agreeabout some things. tell how much it bothered you what he did,. if you dont tell him he will never know and then how can he change? keep in mind that noone is perfect, and even the best of marriges have these fights. if you guys are engaged chances are you love him, and love is not the easiest thing to come by. every bride has second thoughts, if you didnt, it would just be weird. remember, marrige is a two way street, you both have to meet halfway, and sometimes you have to go a little further, just keep on thinking what is more important. winning a stupid argument or your marrige. i hope this helped you. good luck and congradulations!
If she is really hurting you, leave you mate. I don't think your paranoid. Maybe tell your mate how you  really feel.
It sounds like you want to be with j anyways
Ouch.  Somebody's going to get hurt, especially if you are giving both or either of them the feeling that you're being exclusive with them.  I think there's no real way to avoid letting them both know because word does get around, and unless one of them is living in a cave, there's no way they won't both know.\n\nIf you are lucky, and one of these relationships is a strong one, it might survive this.  It's up to you and her to figure that part out.
Because even though it's a choice on whom you date, you cannot help whom your attracted to.  What a gal wants, and what she is attracted to is often time two very different things.
It seems a bit mean that she's wanting satisfaction while you don't get yours. But is she returning the favour, just short of actual sex? \n\nIt's a bit unfair if you wanting to break off just because of sex. But if it is bothering you so much that it's affecting your relationship, then go for it. Try chatting online to people and start going to pubs and clubs more often to build your own confidence. \n\nYou'll meet someone when you least expect it.

Well, it could be a number of things.  He could be the type of person who wants to keep relationships separate from his friends and family, or it may be a sign that this may not be the relationship that you'd like it to be.  Does he have the means (i.e. does he have a job, money, transportation, etc.) to be able to take you out?  Did he take his previous women out on dates before you?  Are you his first relationship?  He may just be inexperienced in dating and not think to introduce you to his family nor to take you anywhere.  Is it a cultural thing?  Maybe he's from a culture where traditions are different and you don't meet friends and family until it is more serious.\n\nUnfortuantely, I'm not getting a good feeling about your guy.  I've seen other relationships where the person didn't take his woman out on dates and avoided mixing her in with friends and family so that he could say, down the road, that what they had wasn't a relationship.  I can't say for sure that this would happen to you (because I don't know you or him), but I would look at this as something to be concerned about.  If you really want to be with him, you may have to overlook these things about him and find other things to focus on in the relationship.
It is not about balance or not, as long as you and him feel comfortable that will be good.\n\nI email my girlfriend 10 times more than she email me, I send her over 1000 SMS (via mobile) monthly… As long as we are comfortable, that’s OK.\n\nFrankly, I think you both should spend more times on your schoolwork…\n\nGood luck!
infatuation, you think about the person A LOT like ALL the time every second but you dont really care if he's doing fine or not - and u kinda think he'll always be ok and theres nothing to worry about.\n\nlove, you think about the person most times and u REALLY genuinely care how he is doing...hows things at work for him, his family affairs, his health etc.
tell him straight up, besides if he was so sad he wouldn't be thinking about himself by terying to get back w/ u

Your ex is out of the picture or he is not your ex.  Make up your mind and say yes if you want to. Trust your heart and be happy!
"YES!  however, u may need to assess ur life from a different standpoint..what are u doing that maybe u can change? :)  is it ur attitude? is it anything tangible?  perhaps u are a negative person, or u just have ""bad luck""? \n\nthe thing is,  u can change Anything!  tomorrow is truly Another Day. so, if u want to change how u look, fine! if u want to learn more about certain topics, fine! if u want to be ""smarter"", study! if u want to be more attractive, work out!  u know what i mean.. there's always something u can DO.  it's actually extremely easy to sink into the ""negatives""...but if u truly think about it, that is extremely unproductive. try changing ur outlook on life... seek what is Positive, Healthy and Happy and u will see what great things life holds... of course there are always bad things, but that's ok. it's totally ok :)."
If you have tried to contact him twice, but received no reply, I think it's fairly obvious that he is not interested in pursuing anything with you - friendship or otherwise.
well maybe you cant strangle him...........but you sure can make him miserable.....lets see.........whats bad when you have a hangover.......\n\nNOISE!!!!..........get right next to his ear and scream as loud as you can!...........get some pots and pans together and bang them as much as you want....play the songs with the pans if you want...or just mindless banging...........\n\nyou could also put him in a chair and spin him around a few times......this will surely make him dizzy enough to puke 3 or 4 times...............\n\nmake this hangover miserable so he thinks twice about doing it again............
"Well, let's face it--as long as there are ""guys and girls,"" when people see them ""together,"" they're gonna think that there's some hanky-panky going on.  First, ask yourself--why do you care what they think?  If you and your girl ""friend"" are fine with being friends, it doesn't matter that folks link you romantically.  Friends can be very intimate, verbally and physically, so yeah, people might get the wrong idea.  It's as natural as anything else, logically.  However, if the indifferent approach doesn't work, then ask yourself this--do you have ""secret"" feelings about her, or does she have them about you?  If it truly bothers you, for other reasons than ""other people's opinions,"" then you might be doing your friendship a great service by checking in with your gal-pal.  Maybe one or both of your feelings have changed?  Perhaps it's a good idea to check in, just in case.  Otherwise, if you and your friend are happy, who cares what others think?  Life's too short to let other folks' judgments ruin an excellent relationship."

It's not your choice if he carried insurance on you.  Belly button piercings get infected very easily and that will mean a trip to the doctor and medication.  Its not fair to put that on your parents when they said no to begin with.  If my daughter came home with it done anyway she would have to remove it and then be grounded... at least.  When you have your own job and insurance then by all means, have at it.  Pierce whatever you want.

No, do it when you're ready
WOW, That's a hard one. First of all, Don't do anything stupid. You may need to get away for a while and just think about your next step. I have read some of the answers written and I agree with most of them. If you are not positive, find out for sure that you are not the father. If you want a divorce get yourself a good lawyer because you may end up paying child support on kids that aren't yours. Again, if they are not yours, you may never be able to see them again if you don't pay. My mind is kind of going like this........Find out who the father or fathers are, demand child support including back child support. Set this up in accounts for the kids so they will have their schooling or whatever paid for. Then deal with the wife. We are suppose to love our wife as Christ loves the church but we are no where close to what he is. Remember that these kids know you as dad. Don't let this ruin their lives or your relationship with them. Right now they probably need you more than they need anything else. Time to do some heavy thinking man. Email me if you need someone to talk to. There will be life after this and you will make it through.
hey, know what? you sound like me. \nbut i have never come across such guy. \nhe seems like a very good, nice guy eh? great looking? omg. hah!\nbut anyway, being a senior doesn't make it more complicating does it? i just think it's more romantic. aww.\n\nwhat to do?\nthis is such a great chance. it's obvious that you like him and he likes you. what're you waiting for? just ask him..ok. i can understand if your shy because i am too.\nhmm. get a friend to test it out for you? or just wait..\nyeah. but what i think is the problem is that maybe both of you might get the wrong signal, i'll be great great disappointed if i were you and that's the case. \nHOPE NOT!\nXXgood luckXX
Seems like you are blaming everything on yourself girl, and you have gotten into a pattern of apologising everytime, if he thinks you are going to keep doing this he will keep pushing itto see how far he can go with it.  If your away and you are going to be back in two months have fun for yourself, tell him you will see him when you get back and see where it will go from there.  maybe he will realise after no communication for a while just how much he wants you.  I know you love him and it will be hard but give it a go.
You could:\n\n1) Forget him and move on.\n\n2) Talk to him and tell him you would like to try again.\n\nGood luck!!
He can't give you what you want  because he doesn't care enough about you to try. It's not a line, he's telling you the truth. He dates other women, is not emotionally connected to you and is busy with his own life. Why don't you take control of your own life, instead of waiting for him to tell you what to do, and move on. He's just not that into you, but he enjoys the little puppy-dog loyalty you offer. So to answer your question: no, he doesn't want you. That's not how a man in love behaves, it's how a man who doesn't really care behaves.
My friend has lied to me and I have forgiven them. I'm still friends with this person but I don't trust her like I used to. No further than I can see her. I forgave, but I can't seem to forget.
Why worry about something that hasn't happened?
be funny! make her laugh and giggle. i know i just love a funny guy who is also a smart sweet hart
you cant run forever so tell him how you feel
just moment
I am sure you will stay close to your father no matter what the physical distances might be, for you love him so much and so does he. \n\nSometimes divorce is the best answer when two people cannot get along enough to stay together peacefully or lovingly. But that doesn't that they do not love you any less, or that they would not anything for you as they did before. \n\nSo stay put in that place in you where you still know that they love you irrevocably, and yes you have their love forever, already, no doubt about that.
oh well ... during the pregnancy, all the hormonal things, moodiness, bitchiness, a lot of weight gain (which is unhealthy for both you and baby as well as hard to get rid of afterward) ... but it would have been hard to make me leave ... LOL that beautiful increase in breast size and the hormonal increased desire for sex kept me right there with her!  Also, guys sort of like to be the Knight in Shining Armor sometimes, and ride around getting her pickles and stuff ... makes them think they're gallant. Never thought about leaving mine while she was incubating our two shorties, LOL.
If this is a good friend, than you would talk to her. Maybe she is trying to tell you something.
Sounds to me like you have a 6 year old son, and a 2 year old for a  husband. You should have ASKED him? Please, that's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard a grown man say...and he was SERIOUS! I'm not saying you need to get a divorce because of this, but when you get to feeling better, you need to sit Mr man down, and have a long, open talk with him. He had better grow up, and soon, or he is going to be alone! Good Luck!!

You marry someone because you love them - not because they have or haven't done certain things in the past.
I got it last year, aged 25.\nI'm not sure how i managed to get it. It's hard to tell since the incubation period takes up to 20 days :/
I have been through my fair share of emotional/mental hardships, and then some.   Was too young when I got married and I had low self esteem, etc.
i don't hate video games or super heroes i love them

hello Alex.  First of all, calm down.  If somebody is nice to you, then it does not necessarily mean that he fancied you.  some friends feel that they should be good friends to others but not necessary dig deeper into intimacy.  In friendship there exists a relationship of brotherhood, which, believe me, is extremely nice.  It does not involve intimacy at all, but the discussions between the couple are (I would say) deeper, brighter, friendlier, direct to the point, confidential, trustworthy, well I can keep on going for ages.  I do have friends in this brotherhood and I really value their friendship.  \n\nNow if you feel that you have been hurt by this encounter, take your time to brush it off your nerves, so that you will not make any mistakes, approach this friend and make things clear.  However do not lose on this friendship, treasure it in any other way.  Friends can be valuable you know and when chasing them off you might be chucking out more than one (you never know who is around and listening).  \n\nTake your time Alex, don't rush things.  Don't worry I am sure you are a wonderful person and people would understand you.\n\nGood Luck
NO IT IS NOT LIKE THAT.  IN THESE DAYS GIRL KNOWS WHAT IS RIGHT AND WRONG.

i love you for your opinion on this
The vibrator is encouraging....\nExpand on that.  I suspect that she has some kind of mental block - if she's had an orgasm in front of you, she should be able to have another.  And another, and another...\n\nSpeaking as a woman who had trouble with that for a long time, just be patient.  If you like her as much as you say, it'll be worth the wait.  Encourage her to try other things, both together and separately.  Try taking her into the shower, and show her by your touch how much you want for her to feel good.  And how good she feels to you.  She'll come around.\n\nAt least she's being honest... I'm amazed at how many women fake it and then lie about it!
You realize that it is up to you now to make yourself happy. It is up to you to make decisions now and they can be just exactly what you want to do and not have to worry about pleasing anyone else. You realize that you have goals to make and that you are going to start with the easy ones and work your way up, because nothing is going to stand in your way now. You realize that you are stronger than to dwell in self pitty and that making the best of each day will bring you closer to what you really want in life.\n\nWhile separation can be devastating it also needs to be a learning experience. Let yourself blossom form this and come out smelling better because of it. This is your life now.\n\nIt is up to you now. You can do it.

A strong, funny, independent woman is number one in my opinion.

I'm not sure...go to WEB MD and ask!
"Yes, a mistress is bad. Where is the goodness when one is turning away from their partner and not towards them? You absolutely cannot fix a problem inside a relationship by turning outward. All that does is create problems. \n\nA relationship has to meet the needs of the two people involved. One must understand what one’s partner's needs are so they can meet them.  One must figure out what their own needs are and communicate them. So basically, if your needs are not being met, communicate and negotiate. Don't let resentment build.\n\nIf you want to hold hands more, you express that. If you want one night out of the week from the basic traditional sexual up keep, one night of the week to be intimate with your wife in the backseat of your mini-van or on top of the washer machine, you express that. In turn if your wife wants to shave your genital area, you allow her to express that. If she wants you to suck her toes, you allow her to express that and negotiate. \n\nYour relationship must be based on a solid, underlying friendship. Friends talk, laugh, share, and do things they're interested in together. Don't stop being friends just because you're each other's spouse.\n\nAll in all, if you want to have a good partner, be a good partner.\n\npaaatches –You get what you give. When you give better, you get better. And, I don’t think it’s fair, fair to you, fair to your wife, fair to all the parties that are involved. You are intruding upon her turf. On everyone’s turf. You are a trespasser. It is no different than being a thief in the night. It is no different than breaking into their house and stealing their things just so that you can be pleased and feel as though you are number one.  And, why you don’t feel as though you are number one all on your own beats me? Perhaps, you should start there? Perhaps you should start seeing you for you and all the factors that make you number one in your own eyes. Perhaps you should ask yourself or figure out for yourself what makes you feel good, what you want, what you enjoy doing instead of sitting down next to someone with vagina and saying, ""hey my penis goes in there, feels so good! Okay, me bored, again… can you tell me how wonderful I am again, make me feel number one again because I am bored, I am bored!"" Thanks for sharing with us the formula for failure. All hats off to you."
If you have to think bout it... then it is prob not a good idea. Try talkin to her again... i no it might be hard but violationg her privacy is not the answer.. Imagine if she found out

honestly you really just have to find the right girl. The saying goes, date a bad boy, marry a good man. You may be getting screwed now, but you'll eventually find a good woman worthy of you.
why dont u guys just go to a hotel put on a SPECIAL ADULT MOVIE and act it out as it is happening
Hell yes! More guys need to catch  break once in a while and have the girl do the asking. Hook him up! By the way, what is semi?
What are you asking?  The girl is afraid she'll abuse the guy?  Well, if at least she recognizes she has a problem she is just being smart by not getting into a relationship.  Now she needs to be even smarter and get help so she can eventually have a healthy relationship.
Egypt
A girl that is decisive and has an opinion.  I'm okay with some passivity, but not non-assertiveness.  A girl who is assertive is hot.  Whe knows what she wants and goes for it.  I also like a girl who's not afraid to argue with me.
"You have been married for a year or however and you get a call from a stranger asking about your wedding.... Sorry I dont do that. I HATE calls like that, any kind of call that isnt for ME as a person is a call I do not want. I do not give out clients names and numbers. It is not professional at all. It is an invasion of privacy. I have letters I have received and I have albums that I show. \n\nNow on to the good ideas. Talk to the photographer. Find out what he uses/ film, digital / what quality camera? etc.\nTell the photographer if there is anything special about anyone at the wedding. \n\nYOUR child is the ringbearer flowergirl etc. \n\nAs a photographer I take set shots all night long, BUT if you tell me that your grandmother is 101 the day of the wedding Ill make sure to get lots of extra shots of you with her. You get the idea. \n\nLike ANY relationship talking is needed. you MUST communicate your desires to the photographer so they can make things perfect for you. \n\nI also strongly agree with ""dont let a realtive do it"" You want to be able to get mad at someone when things go wrong. \n\nThe number one thing I see happen with photography is people try to skimp on it. \n\nI will not CREATE the wedding in 1 hour for you. IE I will not do shots that LOOK like you are cutting the cake, or look like you are throwing the garter etc. \n\nWhen I do a wedding I stay thru all of the important things. Often the bride and groom are not planning to make a departure so I leave early. but if they plan a departure, im there. \n\nYou should have 3 things left 20 years from the wedding...\n\n1. eachother\n2. your rings\n3. your photographs. \n\nPeople will skimp on the photos, yet pay thru the nose for the food. Think longevity what will you have 20 years from now?\n\nI offer something a lot of other photographers either do not or do not offer as simply as I do . Digital backup of your purchased photos. This means you get a cd or dvd with your photos on it to put away in a safe place. I have been contacted several times about water damage, fire damage etc and I dont keep the photos for that long. Once you send me a completion email I archive the ones I like for future use and delete the rest. I do offer storage for a fee, but it is easier to just let the bride and groom store the disk. \n\nThe last wedding I did, last week, I will be doing a album, a parents album, and 3 DVDs."
"Well if he was abused then he will be shy, and may even have a short temper... these are completely normal. Your parents need to use complete patience. He could be really traumatized, and have a hard time trusting people. Since his own parents abused him. So don't expect to much from him right away (ex. openness, willingness to freely communticate with you, and trust) Just make sure that you go slow. He grew up with abusive parents. And now he is going to live in a family of strangers, as far as he know you are no different. (NOT SAYING YOU WILL ABUSE HIM! IT'S JUST ALL HE'S EVER KNOWN) He will need more attention than other kids. But don't hound him with questions, it's a fresh wound. Take things slowly. Like when you first meet him just sy "" hi my name is _____"" give him time to reply but don't pressure him to. Show him where he will sleep and give him a little more time to register it. Show him around and only take things in little peices. He won't want to run before he can walk. \n\n                  So I hope I helped."
I'm like that sometimes...the truth is the problem is with you and your relationship is probably fine. Don't mess it up !!
both are reallly good, as long as you put time and effort into it
I am in a very similar situation with a guy. We have never talked before, but we are constantly making eye contact every day at each other. It's like, whenever I look over at him, he is looking at me. You cant really tell if a girl LIKES you if you have never talked, but you can tell if a girl is attracted to you. There is a difference. If you catch her looking at you, then quickly turning away or acting shy around you, its a good sign that she is attracted to you.
You shouldnt hate love, its a very important aspect in life for everyone. Just because you dont like someone back it shouldnt make you hate the situation. My best friend is just like you. All the guys she knows have fallen for her and she started to hate love too. Eventually though, a guy came along who she liked back and now shes very happy. You're 15, you have a lot of life left to lead. When the right guy comes along, you'll like him back and be happy. Have patience.
There is Yahoo chat room for each State. Try that.
Shes not worth it. Look if she had the nerve to play her boyfriend, (i mean come on, she had sex with you!) what makes you think shes going to be good to you? I think you should move on and find your self a descent girl. Leave her alone 'cause she only used you for sex.
In my case, bad past events. Also, try to remember, nice guys are few and far between, and then theyre often rather shy, or quiet..
This is so not truth, her pimp would be after you a s s\nto pay for the abortion.
As soon as you start to grow body hair, your mother should wait outside unless you need her to help explain something, in which case you ask her to come in.
you should just stay friends with her. it might work out if you don't get too pushy with things
What's going on with him is guys are WEIRD!lol He isn't sure he wants you but he is sure he doesn't want anyone else to have you. The male ego is a very strange thing. Most guys think once they break up with you that you should never date again. My advice is to tell him you are through playing games. Tell him he had his chance again and again and again it sounds like and he didnt' want to commit. By confusing you he is hoping to keep you alone and available JUST IN CASE he finally grows up. Better to cut you losses now and if you two are meant to be you will find each other again. Time tends to heal all wounds but you obviously haven't had enough time yet. Be nice about it but be clear with him that it is over! GOOD LUCK!
Just laugh at all his jokes, tease him jokingly, touch him when you talk, etc.
Bleh! Im glad tht I am an Indian girl AND NOT living in INDIA! Its disgusting how Indian people claim to be so righteous yet squabble over stupid and insignificant things. \nWhy can't you marry someone you love and who will love you back? Arranged marriages are where the parents just help you out to meet a suitable match. But it looks like all the parents in your so called viillage act like village idiots. If you claim to be educated, go out there and make something of yourself. Dont rely on your or other parents advice. They only seem to be making you more miserable.
A bottle of Bacardi and some coca cola..lol
she's desperate
He pobably wants more than you wish to give namely LOVE.It is nice to have good friends but to some wanting love is more important to them Being without love or the hope of love is down right miserable .Maybe your friend is looking for that hope or someone to love him .Loneliness affects us in different ways and it seems like he is a good man by not trying to break up your love with your real boyfriend .He may talk to you again when he sorts out his problems .Respect his right to privacy for now and wait and see what the future holds .
I would ask them if they can afford the expenses that go along with it.
Coming from a girl's perspective, I wish that men would smile at me, give eye contact, give me a high five, you know that look, that is how you can flirt,
She still wants you but she doesnt want to be all up each others butt all the time.. She wants to make friends and meet new people, and sometimes when you are a couple, you get held back from that...\nGive some time off to the relationship, but I still think you two should talk on the phone like 2ce a week to keep things alive.. \nMeet new people, make new friends, then come back together again.. Thats probably what she is aiming for.. I did the same thing to my man.. except he wouldnt give me the time.. so I had to break up with him completely... we got back together after a month, but it would have been better if he would have just give me some time to make friends.
Sit on it another month. If you still feel that way, do it. Waiting for the guy to say it...you will be waiting forever with most guys.\n\nJust say it.
I dont see what it would hurt to be honest. It would probably make your biological mother happy to have her recognized for who she really is. Plus what if later when you tell your kids about your mother they wish they had known so they could get to know her better but its too late? will they be mad at you for not telling them sooner? its a possibily. Dont over think this just be honest it will be easier in the long run.
I think they use that excuse to look like they are a victim, but who are they fooling?  It's the responsibility of the male and female to protect themselves if they don't desire children.  Why is it that when we give them the news of the new baby they all of a sudden ask, are you sure its mine? and my all time favorite:  Why didnt you protect yourself?  I mean they think that we are the ones that have to use protection , why not them?  And then they think that we want to tie them down by having their kid. Its just an excuse they use to make it seem like we planned that and they shouldnt have to be responsible for the kid and I'm sick of it.  If they dont want kids then they should stop screwing around.
If you feel like you can't be friends with her that's your choice. She obviously broke your heart and she has to understand that it will take time to get to the point that you think you can be friends with her again, if at all. She obviously cares about you still and that's why she still wants you in her life.
..you can talk to me...i'd love to!
coffee or lunch if a first date\n\nor u can work out dinner plans\n\nif not ur first date, go to see a movie, or dancin
that's good u gave urself time to get over ur ex so now give this guy a chance and talk bout wha he likes to do for fun, sports, games, music, maybe hangin out in group dates will help
"No, you are not a bad hostess.  If one has the luxury of hiring a cook and a babysitter for the party, then the hostess can devote herself solely to the guests, but most of us must do as you did--make introductions then try to juggle the cooking and the children.\n\nTo my mind, it's the job of family guests to make friends feel welcome--and I place in-laws in that category of family.  Your in-laws were the ones who failed by acting ""clannish.""  When people are insecure and refuse to interact, they are indeed being rude, but they will never admit it.  \n\nThe remedy takes a lot of time.  The in-laws simply need to see the friends enough times so that they will begin to consider them familiar faces, and hopefully then, they will be willing to accept them into the family ""clan."""
""
Because all men are heartless scum!\n\nNo, I am sorry, that's not fair. It's really hard to say why he would be doing this, it might just be the distance. After all it has been 6 years since you last saw him, and he just might not know how to relate to you anymore.\n\nMy best suggestion to you is to let him go and move on. You are probably way to good for him anyway, and he is in another country.
contact him to find out, or ask a friend who may know or who can ask the guy whether he likes you. \n\nsome guys do flirt with anybody pretty, or even, anybody.
when i was raising children and went thru a divorce ...i had abated all child support and drew up an agreement between the ex an myself. of course thru an attorney. he was to have no contact with the boys until they were 18 yrs. of age. and he had to pay no child support.
"Hi, I personally would not tell my friend.  I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, and sometimes friends don't believe you(don't want to believe it themselves.) You know that old saying, ""kill the messenger""?  What I would do however, is stay away from her boyfriend and not put myself in a situation where the two of you were alone.  If he continues to come on to you, out of loyalty to your friend, I would tell him what he is doing is not acceptable to you.  Your poor girlfriend.  It is just a matter of time before she sees through him."
if we met, i'd say hello
He's prolly more mouth than action since it has been anonymous to this point.\nMeet the guy in a public place and do what you want.\n\nMost of us are big blowhards and chickens in person.\n\nIf he really is this way after meeting him.\nBe afraid. Be very afraid. Have an exit route.\nAnd hey this is comming from a very oversexed guy.\nSex is good but there are an aweful lot of guys out there that are psycho.
You can think but I do not think it is a good idea to act on being with another woman.  It sounds like your energy levels are very different and that is natural...\nI have two very dear friends, married who have two very different energy levels...he is much more physically active than she is but they get along great and have been married for 14 years.  His job is in computers so the job part is not that active but once he gets off from work he is very much into mountain biking, hiking and any very physical activity...if the weather is not good then he goes to the gym.  They make it work because they love each other and are committed to the relationship.  He is one of the most considerate, devoted people I have ever seen...and she is just as devoted to him...they do things together biking and such but her level will never be up to his...\nI guess it depends on what you ultimately want out of life...things will settle down when your child gets a little older.  Til then talk to your wife about your concerns but take into consideration what is going on in her life...tell her how much you appreciate all she does...compliment her on her appearance...arrange to go away on a romantic weekend sometime...send her flowers...remember foreplay begins outside the bedroom...good luck!
how old are you???  thats kind of creepy.
I Cant even answer your question without getting angry at all the self important people having a go at you for what is just a question!!!\n\nIf a bloke can get away with it 100% he is going to do it. Concealing it form your conscience is another thing!
maybe feels guilty on how you will cope if he moves on,\nso therefore yes cares, but at the same time thinks a lot about \nhis  future.  Lack of communication here. You need to talk.
IT DEPENDS ON HOW OLD SHE IS. BUT ANYWAYS PUT A COLD SPOON ON IT IT SHOULD GO AWAY I KNOW THIS SUFF IT'S LIKE DEVU
She sounds very self-centered. Just let her know how you feel and let her know that you believe friendship is base on communication from both sides. If she still doesn't change, next time when she start whining just tell her you have to go and you are busy.
Turn off your computer and go hug them and talk to them until you get sleepy and then go to bed.
Not necessarily.  In Texas there are two way in which you can prove an ‘informal’ marriage (which is what Texas calls a common-law marriage)\n\n1--a declaration of the marriage has been signed (yes, in Texas you can actually record a declaration of informal marriage with the county clerk)\n\nOR \n\n2--the man and woman agreed to be married and after the agreement they lived together in this state as husband and wife and there represented to others that they were married.\n\nSo have you AGREED to be married and REPRESENTED yourselves as married?  Just both of your names being on a loan does not mean you agreed to be married or you've held yourself out to be husband and wife.  Do you or have you referred to each other as husband and wife?  Have you filed your tax returns as 'married’?  \n\nIt sounds like you're still together.  If you intend to remain together then why not file the declaration of informal marriage?  Or just get married?
i would go for it and give him a reason to cum home every day early.
Sorry she gets annoyed, but don't stop.  If you are genuinely saying I love you to your family members, just because you do, the donot stop.  It's a nice thing.
the doctor who prescribes them will tell her how to use them.
"If you have doubts then you probably shouldn't be with him. Just the fact that he has worked only 2 months out of the 1 1/2 years since graduation tells me he isn't very serious about his own life and expects mom or you to take care of him and his every need.\nTo me he sounds like what is known as a ""mama's boy"". A ""mama's boy"" never grows up and will always expect the woman to do everything for him, hence the way he treats his mom. Most likely he will treat you the same way.\nYour guy living at home with mom isn't a bad thing but his not helping her is. I'm grown and still live at home with dad and sister. In my case I work full time, do my own cleaning & laundry, pay my own bills, and help with household expenses. I also help dad with car repairs, house repairs, and yardwork (although he usually doesn't want my help)."
you should tell him before he moves you shouldnt wait because if you do he will be gone and youll be wondering what it would have been like if you asked him even thoughthe relationship he has sucks just show him what a real relationship is but if you dont feel like want to ask him its ok you have to go with your heart not what i think
I look for someone who is atractive and shares the same hobbies. A nice boy who isn't the player. Someone who isn't full of himself. A guy who doesn't want to go to fast and wants to start as friends.
try www.craigslist.com .. they have people donating stuff for free and also some stuff for reasonable prices .. wish you luck with life ...
do as ur heart says. if u r attracted 2 him, then give him another chance. u need 2 believe the 1 u love!\n\nunderstood?
I know what you're going through. There is a certain male friend of mine that I have secretly felt this way about...and dreamt about for a few years now. I've said little things to see what his reaction was, and he just really did not seem interested in me for anything else than a friend. I'm engaged now....and sometimes I wish I would've said something, just to see what would've happened. Although I would never change anything between my fiance and I.\n\nI'm thinking that this girl feels the same way about you. Sit her down and talk to her. Tell her of all your feelings towards her. Ask for hers in return. A few months back, when you guys kissed - was there passion? Or what it just a kiss? Tell her your opinion on this, and ask her for hers. You guys are best friends - there should be no reason why you guys can't talk about this. \n\nLet her know that anything you guys do together isn't just for you. That if you guys end up kissing again or even being intimate, it's not because you're some filthy slob trying to get in her panties. Let her know that you'd only do it because the timing and the person was perfect. It really can't get any simpler than that.\n\nWhatever and however you chose to go about this, please do something. You wouldn't want to go on living the rest of your life wondering what would've happened had you said something, right? \n\nJust sit her down, take her by her hands and take a deep breath - and let the words flow. You guys seem really close, and you seem like an awfully sweet guy. I wish the both of you the best of luck. Don't go for not having your girl. ;)
No way, she is underage. That should be your answer.
"Eventually you'll find a woman where you'll find yourself thinking ""Hey wait just a cotton-pickin minute....she doesn't have all of the traits I want in a woman, and by golly I love her anyway"".  You'll find that with enough time and with the right person your 'laundry list' will lessen and the things that TRULY matter will surface.  (Just be careful to not let them get lost again when you get comfortable in the relationship)\nAnd by the way.....if you don't want more children that isn't selfish, and the right woman won't care and will support your decisions and accept your 6 year old and love him as her own."
tell the you need to know in advance
youve been with your boyfriend for a long time so it sounds like youre trying to get attention from other guys just to kind of prove to yourself that you still have it ad that you CAN get other guys, even though u dont want to. its normal as long as youre not doing anything that would hurt him. even if your boyfried is flirting with other girls like you are, if u think what youre doing is harmless then he probably does too and it most likely is.
It's about a half-hour from Gilbert and not free, but almost. Lost Dutchman State Park, right in front of the Superstition Mountains, is $25 (I think) and available as long as it's not being used. Dunno about tomorrow, but should be good for a fairly short notice as long as you don't hit it Veteran's Day. Throw in a parking fee and you're good to go. 6109 N.

he's paranoid.
I would love to help you but with what you didnt say what you want help with please say
Some do...But they won't notice you as easily.  I bet there are lots of girls who like you, but are, like you too shy to make the first move.  So you have to dig deep inside yourself and muster some confidence...Otherwise wait til college.  There are TONS of girls in college looking for a shy quiet guy because they are all played out on the loud, full of themselves, guys from High School.
I am not funny. I do not have a sense of humor. I am really not trying to be funny by posting this. I'm serious. What? I'm not kidding! I forbid you to smile at this! What was that? I saw that! Do not smile again! ........I said do not smile AGAIN!...No laughing! Not even a chuckle! STOP!.....STOP!
You are really close to stepping in a pile that you won't be able to wipe off...\nIt could cost you your marriage, your job, your house, your paycheck!\n\nThink about that before wondering what that women's intentions are!

Hinder- Lips of An Angel, because it relates to my life too
"Whew, tangled web...first, he is going through a separation with his wife and if you care about him at all, you will be his friend and tell him you are there for him in that capacity but don't want to complicate his ability to sort through by you getting involved on top of it.  You are growing more fond as you daydream about him, because that is always the case, ""absence makes the heart grow fonder"" and that is true, we fantasize about the coulda, woulda, shoulda's in our lives. The best thing you can do is keep going in your world and though you keep a special place in your heart for him, wish him and his family the very best.  If when he works through everything and time goes by, it all works between the two of you, that will be glorious and at least you will know you weren't the reason for his marriage's failure.  Nothing like coming into a relationship on an equal footing for all the right reasons.  Good luck."
Listen slut, just find someone nice and stay with one guy until it is over and then find another like normal people.
Girls are unstable and erratic.  That's just how it is.
You cant stop the new girlfriend from playing with your son if he is visiting dad...Even the courts would say you cant say anything about it unless there is abuse going on...
I am a junior in high school, If he likes you and you like him, then no matter what you do or say it will work out.  just tell him if he ever wants to go to the movies he doesn't have to go alone. that way you aren't asking him out, but you are giving him the opportunity to ask you out, but you are still letting him know how you feel.  Try it, Good Luck!\n\nSavage
Feelings are your fort....\ngo out (vent out) only with the trusted.\n\nIf you have good friends....nothing like talking to them about this.
hey, don't freak out! If I had a penny for every friend of mine that wanted to (or did) experiment with someone of the same sex, I'd have a penny from every friend. Not even kidding.  I'm gay myself, so many people feel comfortable telling me when they want to dip their big toe in the gay pool, so to speak. Sometimes it's because a girl is just sick of men altogether, sometimes they're in your situation, sometimes they just want to try something new... the reasons are limitless and all are totally rational.  I'm guessing that because this is a friend of yours that you are not gay... being attracted to a friend of any sex in normal, even I find myself having temporary attractions for my girlfriends.... but always temporary. If this attraction persists and grows stronger, then I would encourage you to pursue it.. although I'm not sure whether your friend is gay or bi or what. Tell her what you're feeling as long as it wont freak her out. maybe get some advice from your closest friends. If you continue to feel this way about other girls too, then you may be gay and that's okay.. it's a scary thought I know, but once you know who you like you'll learn to love who you are. fact. But if I gave a penny for every friend who wanted to experiment and ended up gay, I'd probably only have to give up a couple, if that. Do what feels right...that's my philosophy. ♡\nI hope I could help!!
sorry to burst your bubble, but barrington is NOT one of the weathliest places in the US.   I used to live in IL and know exactly where you're talking about.
no.....its easy to get attached to a person and develope feelings for them too. It shouldn't matter anymore if it's a girl or a guy. you have to look inside your self and ask if your the one with a problem with it or not. plus girls wind up having a closer connection with ech other anyway. We know what we like and also how to deal with each other. That and we are really good listeners and we are more in touch with our feelings and how to express them. Goodluck i hope you get the answers your looking for and the chance to be happy!
"ask her what are you doing today and whatever she says shes going to do like go to the mall or something go also and ""accidently bump into her"" then later tell her that was you. trust me ive done it and he thought it was meant to be lol"
tell em how u feel about em and then it'll be easier....i hope u 2 end up together.....
Here's your best answer- just tell him your true feelings. He will appreciate you being honest with him.
""
If you don't want to be with her, or if you want to try out other people, break up with her. You'll be hurting her more if you cheat behind her back and she finds out.
Are you gay and who the hell are you talkin about.
It's always a good sign when she reaches into your pants.
ya whwn they both do exactly what the other does
YES its ok to still be friends you shouldn't have to give that up you 2 were there for eachother long before your current partners and they should respect that, and if they don't then they don't trust you and thats not a good thing.
I own 18, but then I'm not normal!
Here are some tips:\n\nA. Reduce your current bills:\n1) Eliminate immediately anything that is not needed.  (i.e. Cable TV, cell phone, a subscription, etc.)\n\n2) Phone bill - switch to a internet based phone.  I used to pay about $100 per month.  I switched to vonage and now only pay $27 flat fee.\n\n3) Call up your gas and electric company and ask for advice on how you can reduce your bills.  They will give you some good advice.  It saved me about $200 per month during the winter.\n\nB. Credit Cards\nGet rid of all the credits except for only one.  Credits cards can get you into trouble fast.\n\nIf you have many, then you should look pay the most to the credit card that has the least balance.  All others you should pay the minimum.   Once it is paid, repeat the same with the remaining cards.\n\nThis also works for any other debts you may have.\n\nC. Spend Less\n1)  Use coupons when you go food shopping.  Buy healthy and natural food for the family.\n\n2) Don't buy anything for yourself personally for a while (i.e. clothes, toys, etc.) until your situation is under control - unless of course you absolutely need to.\n\nD. Saving Money\n1) If you can, have your employer automatically deposit part of your paycheck into a different bank account.  This way you won't see the amount in your checking account.  This is a great way to save money.\n\nE. Stay on top of your finance - stay disciplined\nPay your bills on time and balance your checkbook often.  A great way to do this, is to use online banking.  There is a bill pay service you should sign up for with www.paytrust.com.  All your bills become viewable online and you can setup up automatic payment schedules.  This will ensure all your bills get paid on time.\n\nF. Donate money\nI know this sounds crazy when you are trying to save money, but trust me.   If you lend God money we will give you manifold more.  Do it as often as you can and whatever amount.  Even if it is $1.\n\nBest of luck.\n\nps.  Pray to God for help.  He will answer.
Yes, I want to know like many others, how old are you???

I'd say that's a clear cut case of a girl hanging with a guy after a few drinks he asks if he could kiss her she says no but gives in and they kiss anyways, but then they see eachother again sober, he is all nice and holds hands, hugs her blah blah but no kiss...when saying bye she is ready to walk away but he reaches out for a hug she hugs, he hugs tight and kisses her on the lips but a regular kiss with closed lips so she does the same.\n\nSorry. I couldn't resist. BUT seriously, Sasha, it sounds like chemistry. I hope by saying no you meant yes and not no, thus becoming NOT a doormat.  Sounds like good clean fun, really it does. Be safe. Peace.
(not a man).. I personally would ask if you were a mormon. Mormons practiced polygamy. It is against the law. I feel that if you marry someone that is the only one you should be doing anything with. If I ever found out..wow..money...money...money...lol....\nI would divorce your behind so fast you would not know what hit you.  You got to be a swinger....LOL...LL.
sounds like your typical 14 yr old. They get that age and know it all. This is not always a bad thing. She is rebelling. Try some reverse psychology on her. Try acting like you dont care either. Plus, when she acts like this she is getting lots of attention from everyone telling her she should do it. Have everyone stop doing this and act as if they dont care if she goes or not. Have them talk with her about other aspects of her life. This will take the focus off of this and she will be more willing to go.  good luck
Give him some time to calm down this sounds like a power struggle to see who wins .Your homework was important and he should recognize that after he cools down You can be persistent and just keep sending him messages of love even If he doesn't answer he Will want to read what you say men are like that normally a simple sorry is enough but after 5 years he thinks he owns you so you need to talk to him about this later after he is back with you .We both men and women need some Independence a little not a lot best if you can agree on this time .
r u a girl?

It depends if you like to attend or not. It's your decision~
There is No such word. the only explanation is that you spelled it wrong. otherwise she had to have been making it up, maybe to impress you, but I don't know about that, she didn't seem to like what you said. maybe you should tell her that allot of people don't cry about anything but heartbreak. I don't. its because like the bible says: in the end critical times hard to deal with would be here, so I kind of feel numb to just about anything, except heartbreak. good enough for you?
yes, i am sure she will love it. You seem to be a romantic type of guy and all girls love that. You should give her that!! She will love it!
as hard as it may be, don't argue with them. if you really need someone to argue with, argue with the new on tv (sounds dumb, but it works for me) or even go into a chat room and argue with some random person there.
That depends on size and gentleness of your partner.  Mine was pretty big, but he went really slow, so it didn't hurt as much.  Yeah ur gonna bleed, and sometime times it offsets ur period.  Don't be afraid, just wait until you are ready.
yur making something out of nothing....just call him..ok
yeah! payback's a bi-atch!
"you could tell him that there is someone special that you are hoping will ask you.  That way, he won't think that it is a personal rejection and hopefully, will not ask you out again, thinking that your heart is elsewhere.  If he asks ""who?"", tell him you would rather keep it secret for now."

pretty comes from inside. Do something for yourself. Get a shocking new haircut ! Go get a free makeup makeover somewhere. Do it with your friend. Take it easy on yourself. I bet you are a very nice person. Offer to help around school with different little projects. Someone may need an extra hand. People remember who was nice to them.
I had that issue also, actually asked it on here. But I asked my boyfriend about it, and really... in a guys mind, he knows you know he loves you. He doesnt feel he has to say it all the time. It may actually take the spark and meaning out of the words.\n\nAs to AIM, my boyfriend was like that also. But for he and I, he likes to see when I notice him (which is always immediatly XD ).\n\nDont worry about it hun. If hes lost interest in you he wouldnt still be with you. He loves you, and he knows you know it.\n\nBest of luck.
It all depends on the size of the penis.  The female will definitely have some pain and burning the first time.  It's possible for the male to have a little pain from the vagina being tight on the female.  If the female he has sex with isn't a virgin, then his feelings will be wonderful.
your tool old for her.
By going out of my way to do the little things he likes. Buying and cooking his favorite foods, dressing up for him every now and again, surprising him with evenings out, kisses and cuddles for no reason, and not just in the bedroom, texting him nice thoughts during the day...just keeping him on his toes I suppose!!!
"wear earplugs whenever you get in hearing distance of him and just smile wide, and if you see his lips moving, just say ""I think you are too."", either way it has to be a positive comment or an annoying but powerful comeback.\n\nanother approach is to avoid him & ignore him until he realises that he is not wanted. he will leave you alone, and if he starts calling you names tell him that you have bettter things to do than listen to him time-consuming lectures on your own inferiority. old people get pissed off when you use big words.\n\nalso, you might want to group together with your mom to solve the problem, because she has power in the household, and both of you together might convince your dad to talk to your grandfather. \n\ni hope this advice helps because i have the exact same problem, i don't get what it is but grandfathers on your dad's side are really mean to you some times if you are a girl. Hope this helps! Good Luck!"
"Back off from the girl, give her room, ask someone else out ............ Don't make it look like you're desperate for HER. Find something that you like to do and go at it full-bore. Act  ""As If"" her opinion of you isn't going to stop your world from turning, then come to believe that her attention or approval isn't paramount to you having a good time ..... meaning if the girl notices that's a good thing, if not, someone else will, once they see your drive passion for something you enjoy.\n\n People want to be around other people whose lives go on with the same passion regardless of the circumstances."
"Neither!!!! Maybe that's why I am still single, but I am waiting for the guy that is nice and can rock my world. Settling for Mr. Sex can lead to heartache and Mr. Nice guy probably gets a lot of girls married but it's probably why there is so much cheating going on. Women settle then can't contain themselves when the one they should have waited for comes along. I also think this is why women get accused of being much less interested in sex than their husbands. They settle for Mr. Nice guy but the sex sucks so it's ""honey I got a headache"" when it comes to booty time. I rather be alone than in bad (Mr. sex) or lousy (Mr. Nice guy) company."
EASY, tell your husband you choose your son. You are his mother you have a responsibility to him. Your husband is being unreasonable. Sure this is a problem, but this ultimatum was not the solution. Tell him if the ultimatum stands, he needs to leave. Don't abandon your son just because your husband is an a**hole. You will regret it.\nGet rid of the jerk.

You're learning spanish...ask her in spanish as you hand her an envelope with two passes to the movie of her choice (of which you asked her earlier 'what kind of movies do you like?' and 'Is there anything good playing in theaters lately?')...It's a sweet jestuer, shes' sure to say yes. But if you're not sure if she likes you as well; you can always throw in 'just as friends'. It's always better to be friends first anyway, it'll make your connection stonger for when you decide to make your move for relationship status.
That is terrible!!! Some woman are horrible and bitter. \nWhen u go to court i am sure that they cant mention anything that wasnt repoted to the police at the time like domestic violence. I do hope that u get access to your kid and wish that all fathers where the same. \n\nGood luck
i think 13 years younger is a bit young \nif you are 40 he is 27 & yeah he is far to young \nyou don't know what he is like !\n& if your daughter is upset it is not worth it\nshe is more important  \nwait until your daughter has grown up before you go out with men\njust put your energy into raising your child

When  I first see a guy in the mall I notice his liiks and how he acts in front of his friends and other girls when they walk by. I really like a cute smart and a nice guy that doesn't have to pretend that he is a bad guy in front of his frineds.
After a loss, it sure doesn't seem like it.  Nonetheless, love is one of the best parts of the human experience.  You must also remember that having lost what might have seemed your true love doesn't mean that you will never love again.  Those with such a capacity for love do find love again, and love with the one who really is your one true love.
what is an SO?
You weren't in the middle silly, they were just flirting and making it known that they liked each other to one another.  Just tell them to date already.

I am soooo lucky...  I found a guy that has it all!
yeah, he's not over it either.  if you want to get over him, you have to cut off all contact, at least until you feel like you don't want to see him anymore. it's probably going to be longer since he still has feelings for you too.  and if you were talking about what to do next but you know its not going to work, i wouldn't even put in the effort.  if you think it won't work it won't.  i think you're just sad cuz you hurt his feelings, because you know it wouldn't work out anyway.  just move on.
My understanding is he can't legally give up his parental rights unless a Judge approves it in court.  This is because it's your baby's legal right to have access to both a father and a mother.  Even if the man doesn't want to be a father, your baby has legal rights.  For instance, child support.  Also, if something happened to the dad, and he died say in an accident that wasn't his fault, and his estate received a monetary settlement, your child would be legally entitled to share in that settlement   So, unless another man is willing to step in and adopt your baby and be your baby's legal father, a court will NOT take away the biological father's parental rights UNLESS he's determined by the court to legally be an unfit parent.  In other words, it's not your or his decision, but rather the court's decision, with the court's interest being what's in the best interest of the child.
When you misbehave you give up rights.\n\nThe probation papers overrule what ever you may have assumed.\n\nIf you break probation you will be required to fullfill any alternative sentence, whether it is a fine or time to be served\n\nHowever you may consider discussing options with a probation officer.
Well, if not living a double life means he gets up and goes to work and then comes home, then what behaviors are you seeing that lead you to believe this?  \n\nDoes he disappear on weekends or something?\n\nAre bills not being paid because of mysterious expenses? \n\nSeems to me the signs would be anything beyond him going golfing with the guys every couple of months.
Your husbands parents have some mental problems. Do not allow these losers in your home. They had no right to upset their grandkids like that. That woman walked out on them, she abandoned them, and now it seems shes back because she wants the unconditional love children have to offer. This makes me sick, your husband should tell his parents to go to hell and he should get a lawyer to keep this she demon away from the children.
If Mary Lou's a smelly girl, then it's her fault but if you don't like it, then you may have to stop putting your finger there.
I'm sorry, really sorry, I know that this is hard.  Despite what people may think, when you break up with someone you really care about it is like having to deal with a death of sorts.  Perhaps not the deah of a loved one, but the death of the life you were going to share with this person.  And it hurts, and it hurts, and then when you think it might be okay, it hurts some more.  Grieving takes time, and there isn't much you can do to quicken the process.  The pain you feel is a natural healing process, although I know those words will do near nothing to console you at the present. But I do promise you that eventually your mind will start to forget some of those little painful details, and you will heal.  You will see joy in the world again.  You will be ready to fall in love again.  But it will take time.  \nIn the meantime, the best thing that you can do is focus on yourself.  You are still there for you, and you know what makes you happy.  Build yourself up, do the things you love to do, pursue interests you may not have had time for when you were with him.  Enjoy your freedom.  It may not be easy going at first, but self love is the best healing agent around.  So give yourself some love, get out there and hang out with your friends, and take whatever comfort you can in the fact that time will pass, and so too shall the worst of the heartache.
I think your visit to her is the best and stay there for a few days. You can do some cooking or bake something delicious for her. But its good if your family  would visit also. She would feel great.

it maybe true or it may not.    if you call too often then no shit at some point you have to give him a tad bit of space, if you think he's cheating talk to him about it but don't bs youself or him and make excuses and for god sakes don't go into the arguement saying that he is cheating on you, just ask why he never answer.       OR    you can just stop calling and answer casually when he calls you.

"Yes, it happens.  But I've found the ""cheap"" rings usually mean more than the expensive ones.\n\nWhen my husband and I got married, we were poor college students with no jobs so he couldn't afford an engagement ring.  On our honeymoon, we went to a small antique store and saw a beautiful ring -- it was bright green crystal set in sterling silver -- and it was $10.  The man we bought it from warned it was expensive.  Since my husband had $10, he got me the ring and to this day we refer to it as my ""very expensive ring"".  Although he now has a good job and we are no longer poor, I love that ring and will never get another one.  For me, it is worth more than all the gold and diamonds in the world."

Silly...by Denise Williams
I applaud you for doing the right thing, some other married people/serious couples need to follow your lead.
First of all nothing good ever comes from a lie or a secret, so yes you should tell him. Secondly, people often confuse sex with love. True love goes far beyond sexual gratification and physical attraction. Your opening line addresses the phsyical aspects of your relationship rather then your spiritual connection. My advice to you is to make sure BOTH of you are in Love. For your relationship to truly be successful both of you must feel the same way about each other. If he really loves you, he will choose you over his career. I will keep you in my prayers. Peace and God bless.
If he is worth persuing, he'll be worth persuing after the season. The fact that he follows rules is a good thing. He has the quality of being faithful which should be valued. If he can be true to his team, he'll be more likely to be true to you too.
i would just like play around with him or something and just kinda let him know without actually sayin u like him...just kinda flirt with him.. and dont worry about everyone else..just do wat u think is right...
Yeah you deffintly can, Just be sure you don't really care about this other girl caus youll hurt her pretty bad and such
My goodness!!!  For someone who bemoans 'chicks rights' & says things like 'there are no more virgins' like it's the end of the world.  You sure do love the new system, & how it could work for you. \n\nMost girls that I know who have one night stands are not interested in it going beyond that.  They don't want the guy to call them & in fact go to great lengths to avoid getting called, giving him fake digits & even just flat out saying, 'listen I'm not interested in anything else and this isn't going anywhere beyond tonight.'\n\nI don't think it's right, but hey it's not my place to judge them for what they do.\n\n Stop painting a picture of women like we are all crazy out to get men.  (I will admit there are some crazies out there, Hey they even scare me!  But not all of us are like that!  And I've had more bad experiences with Crazy men out to get me then with crazy women!)
baby girl, this will only force you to grow up faster. many of us had endure the teasing, laughing, and being part of the outcast. kids can be mean. especially if you're different. you have to block them out and do things that would improve yourself. not for them remember, it's for you. and you don't want to be part of their shallow group anyways. be strong for now, until you are sucessful in life, then only then you can say that you'd turned out better than them. so, endure it for awhile, find people who see you beyond your appearance. in the same time you have to have a thicker skin. trust me, if you tell them off now, there are more to come. i'm sorry baby girl, these people will force you to grow up faster.
it means u r in love  but u dont know who is ur lover \nits not clear to u who u love but u think the one in ur colage is that one
""
really everyone's opinion on that is different i mean some people beleive that if u sleep with just two people in your life that u are a whore and for some people they dont think that u are a whore after sleeping with like maybe 200 i mean i think that if u sleep with someone just for a one night stand and do it all the time that way that then people reserve the right to think of you as a whore but otherwise i mean it shouldnt matter
"I guess tell her that there isn't room for another person.  She should understand after you break it down for her.  And let her know, ""That's why it doesn't say 'guest'."""
It means that he thinks you are a cool chick to hang out with, and that he is thinking about seeing you exclusively.  Don't rush things.
Call her and meet somewhere and have a good conversation about it. Before you meet first make sure that she will come alone to the meeting place and not with her husband or bf whatever he is. Durng the conversation I would ask her about the test.
Been there babe, my mother was schizophrenic and my dad left us with her when I was 9. She tried to kill me (tried to strangle me in my bed) because she thought my dad would come back if she killed me and my 2 sisters. It was downhill from there until I was 18 and moved out. It was total survival for me and my sisters until we came of age, and we just survived for each other. We all now have wonderful lives and families, all graduated from college (on our own power) and are happy. Mom finally committed suicide when I was 30, but not without many years in there of attempted mental abuse. Honey, your dad can NOT hurt you mentally unless you let him. Revel in your uniqueness, in your future, in your potential (in which he has NO power). Save your money now for your escape later. You have the power, sweetie, you will survive and conquer.
i agree only if you'll agree that chandel johnson is them most beautiful girl in the whole wide world! and i love her with all my heart and someday in the future im going to marry her and spend the rest of my life with her becuase she is soo special to me and i could never see myself with out her. EVER! i love her so much! if you agree to that ill agree to your statement =]
Be REAL BRAVE one time when you are together and lean over to offer him a kiss.  Wrap your hands around his face and seal the deal.  If he liked you, there will no longer be any question.  If he wasn't sure, the decision will be clear.  If he didn't like you, he would back off and ask what this is all about.  He may even sound upset at this.  In any case, you will have acted on your desire, and your intentions will set the pace of the relationship.  If both of you are fumbling and blushing when you are together than I would think you both like the other, but both of you are unsure of the others feeling.  Give this a shot.  Good luck and best wishes.
why dont they have joint custody? No this will not end untill he gets joint custody. I feel bad for you cause i know you must love this guy and now you cant see him cause then he will not be able to see his kids. That is an awfull spot to be put in . I would hate it . But anyway see if you can get him to go and file for joint custody and then you should be able to see him any time you want. good luck and god bless an dhappy holidays.
no because it hurts like h*ll.
Try to give him a chance. There's always hope. Have faith and be patient. As long as you and he are still alive, there's always something good that will happen.  Kindness begets kindness. Violence begets violence.\n\nIf he hurts you again physically, time to give him another thought. Make sure if you decide to leave him you are physically strong and financially stable to support yourself and your baby.\n\nAlso, a little prayer and asking of help from the MAN UPSTAIRS won't do any harm. And when you are helped, don't forget to THANK the Universe.
Really, why should you care? Its is no concern of yours what he has stored in his computer! You are invading his personal space, if it were me, I would slam the door on your backside, on the way OUT! You are so childish and immature to believe that this man should not have any memory of his previous rendevous' or trysts, before your time! You can only control your actions, and it seems that you cant even do this if you are skimming through your boyfriends personal archives. Maintain you own space and stop disrespecting your mates!
In my experience,YES!
"Your experience is not that uncommon. Many ""young men"" have fantasies about family members. What is important is to keep it as a fantasy and not create a situation which might embarrass you or other family members.\n\nEven married adults have fantasies."
I think you should just move on and get over him cuz he's moved on!!!
it's simple:  corner the guy and proceed to give fellatio.  (A girl like you might need to look that one up, sweetie).  Make sure someone sees you either going into the act (seeing both of you going into the bathroom at a party, for example) or sees the actual act (leave the bathroom door cracked and/or unlocked).  Or just use your camera phone. Click!\n\nWord will get back to the hated one and their relationship will end.  The guy, however, will not fall in love with you.  His interest in you will be limited to wanting to get blown from time to time.
stay at home..you are just arguing more because you are growing up....try chatting with them about houserules.
They've got to be here somewhere.
I would like to say yes get back together, but its really not the answer, first you got to forgive yourself these things happen, and to be honest you can't have been in love with in the first place cos you would't have done it so no going back is not the answer, stop worrying about him he's a big boy now.. You need to look to the future with your kids thats the most important thing, bringing him  back for the kids sake won't work he'll just throw it at you all the time and it will course fights and thats not good for either you or the kids.. You need to move on, let him insult you as much as he likes, it does't matter what he think's  , he's your EX!  Go meet someone who you really LOVE... LEAVE THE PAST WERE IT BELONGS IN THE PAST!!! Being lonely is better than being unhappy and lonely
Some of it has to do with the 'embarassment factor'.  Kids/teens are too ashamed to walk into a pharmacy and grab a box of condoms.  They're afraid that people will give them funny/dirty looks.  A lot of it is lack of education.  The schools need to teach kids properly about sex (as do parents), instead of just saying, don't do it.  That doesn't work, never has, never will.  Education is the key.
looks aren't everything
All I have to say is..JERRY JERRY JERRY....LOL..j/k\n\nI really can't say much about the cousin thing I dated a set of TWINS before without eachof them knowing..unfortunaltey I'm quite proud of that. But anyways, if youre husband isn't ready to commit then dont force him to..I say go ahead with the divorce men will usually change when they are threatened to be left, so your husband knows he's fixing to be (NEXTED) and he's going to be perfect for a while. On to the cousin, who sounds more mature than the husband, the way i see it is..they come from the same TREE..maybe it will be like this for now do you really think he's going to be the same better. I would suggest finding somone of a different last name even..just look around play the fields do be traped in a one huge love triangle..Good luck..
"That's really harsh on his part; you'd think he would at least be discreet about it since you aren't divorced, yet.\n\nI am in your shoes, with one difference...my soon-to-be ex is telling everyone that I am sleeping with ""every guy in town"" and chasing off any potential relationship I may have (but don't have time for) while he is secretly dating multiple women.  And, right now I have 100% custody of our children, am receiving no child support, and he cant even see the kids due to a restraining order.\n\nOne part of me is upset (and a little jealous) that he is living the life of a bachelor, while I have all the responsibility - especially because HE is the one who destroyed our marriage (domestic violence)..........\n\nHowever - and I hope you feel this way too - a much larger part of me feels such pride that I am doing it all on my own; that I get the bath times with my children, and I get to read them books everyday; that I am corresponding with their teachers and helping with homework; that I get to be the one to kiss their boo-boos, and celebrate their milestones (like my littlest learning how to ride a bike without training wheels!), pack their lunches, and sing and dance around the house with them...\n\nAnd I have a full-time job with a lot of responsibility.\n\nI know what he's missing out on, and truth be told, I feel sorry for him.\n\nGood luck to you!  Hang in there, I wish you the best!"
No not all guys are jerks. Some guys do eventually grow up and realize what life is all about. If l was you l wouldn't worry too much he is obviously still young and immature, give him time ( if you want to ofcourse) maybe he will grow up and learn how to treat girls with the respect they deserve. Find yourself another dance partner and friend and leave him be. His loss you will be fine, Trust me !!!!!!!!
Exactly! It's called responsibility, if their parents pay for everything, than they won't learn how to handle living on their own ever.
Give her some space if it is meant then it will be and if not better to find out now than later after some heavy investings.
lol i went throught the same thing. i liked a boy who moved to florida and my friends all told me to get over him and it's been 2 years but i still like him and we still talk lol. it's totally up to your friend to decide, if she'll meet someone new it'll be easier for her to forget him.

Tough love is to discontinue assistance to someone to prevent yourself from enabling someone to continue on a path of dependence and force them to make choices to take a stand on their own behalf.

Theres two possiblities one she just really wants you as a friend or two she likes you know after a while of seeing who you really were just as her, whats ups ,whats her deal...GOOD LUCK1
you are nasty.
you should get him a gift card. it may sound kinda corny but they r great gifts that way he can get anything he wants and u don't have 2 worry about him already having it or him disliking it.

it would be far worse to find out u were cheated on, than your spouse telling u and wanting to reconcile. if my spouse had wanted to go to therapy, or shown me i had a chance i would have given it my all, and tried my best to forgive. but i had no decision in the matter, it was decided by him and the women he had been seeing for over a year. working it out is far better than a divorce, because i believe there is nothing broken that can't be repaired with god's help. divorce is painful, especially when it involves another person. and had it not been for the presence of this other person in my marriage, i do believe he would have come home. if he is truly sincere, and knows he has caused u pain, and takes responsibility than it is always best to make a go of it, and pray for a happy ending.being a sucess is not as important as taking that first step and trying. a hurt heart takes time to heal, one can't go back into being trustful right away. if they want to work it out that means they are remorseful and know a wrong was done, means they have a concience and they aren't just thinking of themselves. does depend on how many times one has had this happen, and how many times you have been injured by someone elses wrong choices, but if it only happened once, than there is hope. the injured spouse must be able to feel safe, and that it is ok to trust again, it can be achieved in time if the cheater is willing to be completely honest, and if no funny business occurs again.
Procreation, brings two people closer together, enjoyment. ♀
"Oh yeah, she definitely likes you!  When they don't like you, they ignore you:  They don't have lunch with you and ""play"" with you like she does.\n\nIt could be that she is being defensive.  She can interact with you all she wants, but never has to risk getting hurt.  You can just enjoy the relationship as it is, or if you want more than you can try finding something you are both interested in that you could do together.  When just the two of you are out together, then even the simplest thing can shift it to a romantic relationship.  Like sincere talk about something you care about, or just holding her hand while walking."
give her a call maybe she forgot from being too busy never know but if u know she will say yes then set it up
"stop her in the hallway oneday and start up a conversation like "" how  are you today?"" get into convo and then as kher for her number. which is the next step, from there im sure you know where to go."
You can't make him do anything.\nIf you push it, he'll be mad at you. He may even break up with you over it.\nIf this is not his baby, it will come out. Then you don't get to gloat, you get to console him.\nJust be there for him and support him. \nThink of it this way...What a wonderful kind of man have you've got that would be willing to love another man's child just so he knows that baby is loved? How lucky are you?\nIt's hard to find a man these days who will take responsibility for there own children, much less someone other guy's or even if there was a chance they could belong to someone else.
I think that your relationship lacked a proper closure.  You were left hanging at that moment when your feelings towards him were still fleeting.\n\nI believe that talking to him and focusing on the reason/s as to why the whole thing did not work out for him would give you that sense of understanding that you lack at the moment.  Ask him to be as honest as possible and don't make him sugarcoat his explanations.  Just make him give you the hard truth about the matter.\n\nIf, after all of his explanations you still don't get where he's coming from, then my suspicion may be true altogether - he is not the kind of man who you should be wasting your time and affection with at all.
You could start with putting them on his neck and play with his hair. Then you could work your way down to wherever they want to go. It's moslty natural.
both must want it to last\nboth must take responsibility for their part in problems

OK I'd send them a card........\n\nI understand your situation my mum divorced a guy I really liked he loved my boys and was great to them I never took advantage of them and basically when it ends like all divorces you stay with who was loyal to you....and blood is thicker.\n\nI am sorry for you....\n\nI am sorry for my ex step dad.... but I would not hurt my mum.\n\nThat's how they feel.\n\nSo send them a card tell them you care even though all this has happened and give them your phone number....Other than that know you made a difference being a part in their lives in some little or big way and try to move forward and make a life for yourself...  Hugs
well i have kissed a girl and i just went for it and i kissed her \nthen i was so excited i ran off (dumb) but i was so young, 11\nthen the next day she kissed me back so i say just go for it and if \nhe likes you it will all work out live a Little and go for it
he will call you. don't worry about it. if he went threw that much trouble to get your number after you gave him the wrong one. then he likes you.
dont go to the beach?? find somewhere more private.
If you are considering a life together with this boyfriend I believe it would be best to be honest with him, or this will be eating away at you forever.
why not try talking to her, tell her how u feel, honestly people do change after they get married, we don't stay the same, try talking to her and telling her u would like to see her do her hair, send her to the beauty shop, get her a membership at the gym. be honest with her, i am sure she is still the same woman u married, and fell in love with. hair dye and makeup are only on the outside of someone. it's what's inside that matters.
Kids are forever, wives are a different story.  With a 70% divorce rate in the nation now, seems he made a wise decision.
I'm sure it is normal - perhaps to prevent this you should masturbate more often so it doesn't need to come out in your sleep. My boyfriend has only ever had one or two wet dreams in his life, and I think this is because he has always masturbated quite often - like once a day. If he knows we won't be able to have sex on a particular day he will 'take care of himself'. It's healthy and necessary for guys to have a regular 'release' and I think wet dreams are the body's way of releasing that pent up sperm.
"take a step back from the ""moving to IST."" bit.  Maybe go visit, after you establish your relationship again.  You should meet and visit there before you just decide to move there.  Talk to him for a while and see where he is really."
life isn't always fair stay in school apply yourself in all you do. do your best to encourage one another just love one another and pray for guidance in your situation
hmm, at 16, your facial hair is most likely not that great, and caterpillar mustaches are not attractive.\nalso, 16 yr old girls are fickle and can be easily turned off by the unfamiliar; ie: kissing a guy w/ facial hair.\nshave, baby. she'll be more into making out w/ you if you do.\n\nand Off topic....if you haven't seen her in a month, give her something small and thoughtful to let her know you have been thinking about her... write her a poem.
That's a tough situation.  The only things I could suggest would be to ask her to try to help him learn english as well, since it's essential for his future schooling.  Obviously you've tried this approach, but it doesn't hurt to continue.  Secondly, whenever you do have him, spend alot of time talking to him.  Try starting with just pointing things out and naming them constantly.  At his age learning in two languages won't be that difficult, but since you don't have him anywhere near as much as she does you need to be extra vigilant.  Point out everything you see, objects, store names, actions, etc.  You may think you sound stupid, but it'll get through to him.  And also I'd suggest getting him some age-appropriate videos (and VCR or DVD player if she doesn't have one) that he can watch at home.  Watching pre-school/toddler programs in english will definitely help.  My son has picked up so much watching these things and we speak english anyway!  Good luck, and just count your blessings that you have your son, and that with your help he will grow up bilingual!
Huh!?
ok I'll answer you, yes me , I think they are soooo sexy the higher the better and they have to be black or red, I like the patent ones too, makes me feel like a bossy woman-pure class. What do you think ? x\n\n\nhey dark _mush I like weirdos they amuse me x
"I think you need to be there for him now. He wouldn't be smoking pot behind you back if you would let him be. If it causes no harm to you nor the family, what's the big deal. He would feel free to do it at his own house and believe me if you would toke up with him, you would be both reallyyyyyyyyyy happy. Unless he uses other stuff, honey, you don't have to worry the least he would get is aggressive on the contrary reallyyyy pasiveeeeeeee! Not that I'm a user, I have friends that do and are married couples and are very happy. Unless he goes further than doing pot, I think it's really not a big issue. He lies because he does not have an alternative. If he tells you the truth, you'll be upset, if he does'nt the same, so I think you should talk. About the ""baby"", make sure it's not your imagination that your husband & the baby look shockingly similar but in any event, go for the DNA test, it's the only way you will ever know and personally, I rather have him do it than live with the doubt. GOOD LUCK"
"I've seen some of the most beautiful women at KSU that happens to be Islamic. And I've always wondered the same thing that you are asking. Do they think that I'm looking at them because they're dressed differently, or do they even realize that they have the most gorgeous eyes that I've ever seen?!  <---This all depends on the onlooker. I tend to smile at women when I look at them (to show that no ill-will is meant by my repeated ""glances"" ;) ), because I have enough confidence to.  I'm assuming women will smile to show their interest in you if they find you attractive as well. The truth is, this will be different for everyone. I'm not religious myself, but I can acknowledge a beautiful person when I see one. ---Additionally, don't be concern with what others think. Just be friendly and try to make friends with them and you'll eventually learn what their demeanor is for yourself.   ; )"
"Don't worry, it will come more naturally than you think.  Often times there is a freshman orientation specifically built for you to get to know other people, group activities etc.  Join a few clubs, and go to the group gathering and campus events, get to know your roomies and people on your floor (assuming you are in a dorm) and you will do just fine.  You could also consider joining a frat/sorority if that is your kind of thing... but then it's kind of like ""paying for your friends"" so that's up to you."

C. Tease and flirt me out of it, then take me to bed and shag me senseless.\n\nBut A if I don't respond to C. \n\nOr D. Just get out of the situation and ignore me and leave me alone until I come to my senses.\n\nNever, never, never B! That would be the worst possible thing to do.

i know this sounds crazy but try ebay i have tried looking up the words to some songs and they have suggested ebay
Honestly it's rare that i have other thoughts!!!!!!
I don't think we should allow society to dictate age restrictions in relationships. There is a 21 year age gap between my boyfriend and I (I'm 27). I have never been happier in my life. Just like with any relationship, it needs to have the essentials like trust, understanding, communication, interests, goals, etc. If those elements are in place, then nothing else matters. Love is the greatest feeling in the world, and age shouldn't stop anyone from experiencing it.

The pay you rare referring to is called Quarters, and Variable Housing Allowance.  Back when I was in the military, I got 465 a month, for Quarters and VHA while I lived in an apartment.  When I moved onto base housing, they took that part off my pay.\n\nThe policy will vary from base to base.  If you are stationed where the housing is very good, then it is likely that the housing will be full.  In that case there will be a waiting list.  In some cases those with kids may get priority, on others they may not.  Usually rank makes a difference as well.\n\nWhen I was in the Air Force, the housing was sub-standard.  So married military members E4 or below where required to take housing, and NCO’s could live off base.  Usually the power went out daily, the roof leaked, and the toilets backed up all the time.  The house was built in the 1940s with no air-conditioning, but were retro-fitted in the 1970’s.  They were in poor condition at best.  They have since been torn down and rebuilt.  Keep in mind that I got out in 1993.

Yes.  True happiness is not contingent upon a partner or family, although they are nice to have in this world, just as inner peace is not contingent on them either.

I think she liked you as more than a friend and you shot her down. The last thing to do in a situation like that is stop talking to the girl because then she thinks that it's all her fault that you aren't talking to her. She's sad because she got her heart kind of broken by the person she considered her best friend. If you don't like her, you don't like her, but let her gently. She isn't the one acting stupid honey, you are. Especially since youcouldn't tell that she really liked you. I think she got embarassed whe you told her no basically, you didn't like her so she hid from you. Then, she thought she was a horrible person because you didn't call her. Then, when she gets up the courage to call you, you guys don't get a chance to talk. Just go up to her and say, I want us to still be friends and you're really important to me so I hope we can start talking and hanging out because I miss you.
Ask her to be your gf? and she will be if she accepts.\nIt doesn't matter how long you are together.  As long as it's not after a day or week er something.
A bottle of wine usually does the trick! Be cautious though if they ask you to put your keys in a bowl!!
Well, I haven't been looking for the past 2 years and it still hasn't come along. I think if it happens, it happens. However, it does seem true that when you're looking thats when it seems to be the hardest to find.
This happened with me and my bf when we had just started dating. We've known eachother over a year now, but apparently he had liked me for months and I didn't know it, and he had finally built up the courage to ask me out (we've only been a couple for 7 months). On one particular day, we were together at a friends house alone watching a movie, and for the past few days leading up to that day, there were several moments where I knew he wanted to kiss me (like your guy), but he was nervous as to how I would react. I knew he would have a hard time kissing me first, so I decided I'd break the ice for him. Do you know those moments where something happens where you get so close to his face and it's the perfect opportunity to kiss, but you just don't? Well that had happened several times in those few days, and once that day already, but he still didn't kiss me. Well, he was massaging my legs, and we had another one of those moments, so I just leaned over, gently grabbed his face, and kissed him.  I could tell; he was so happy about it. After that, it gave him the confidence to kiss me whenever he wanted to, and how... well... let's just say we've come a long way~ *wink*\n\nJust one word of advice: if you want to break the ice, do it in privacy. After the initial kiss, and a few more private sessions,  public display of affection will come much easier.
Its whats inside that counts not how a person looks
"I think he's trying to impress you.  It's not something that just anyone would do...ya know?  And you're being awfully sexually submissive by taking things that he offers you into your mouth.  That would send me a gigantic ""green light"" message if a woman did that."
Breaking trust is like breaking a million dollar vase. It is going to take time, lots of time to repair it. Start now and WORK AT IT. You will eventually earn it back.
You are lucky to have two good and loving parents. Most of all they are lucky to have you. Just the fact that you are thinking of them means more than any gift. I think the ideal way to show them how you really love them is simply plan a day you can all spend a day together doing everyones fav thing.
Sounds like you are being codependent on this guy. I'll bet you sit by the phone and wait for him to call? Life is too short to depend on anyone to make us feel good inside. I'll bet if you where too busy for him one day he would be all over you. LOL......Gotta love the love game! You are young and have a long romantic road ahead of you. Have fun, relax, go out with the girls, read a good book, Shop till you drop. Try to find ways to fill up your time so you are learning new and different things. I hope I'm making sence to you? You are a beautiful person and I hope one day you won't depend on anyone to help you FEEL good inside. It's an inside job that sometimes takes time and age to understand. Good luck.
Because you are young and probably stupid\nIf seriously you are just yoo young. just accept your self as you are and that is it. If you do not you loose a lot in your life

Both - thicker is better, not too long though.  depends on the girl, everyone is different, just like some guys perfer bigger boobs than others.  As long as you can work it good, doesn't matter too much.
If you want full custody of them Use a digital camera and when you pick them up start filming from the time they get in the car and use as evidence

I say it just depends on the couple.  When I met my husband, he was from the Netherlands, I was from the U.S.  We had a long distance relationship for a year and a half before we got married.  Between e-mail and phone calls...even with a 6 hour time difference we were still able to make it work.  We got to see each other about every 3 months.  We've been married for 5 years now!  But my own opinion...I think if you're dedicated enough to the relationship it can work.

"I have seen attractive men with scars. I think this all has to do with you and how you feel about yourself. If it upsets you, fix it. If you're ok with it and like you said ""don't really care about that stuff"" then don't let other people make you care about it either. \n\nConfidence comes from within and if you feel confident, nothing on the outside is gonna stop that."
Go watch the football game with the boys...it will be a lot more fun than you think!!! Plus pretty single girls are always welcome!!
just tell him u like and if u want u can also even ask him out
""
Are you sure he wasn't asking to see your nipple?\n\n\n\nJust kidding, thats a tough one to figure.  He either likes you or he is gay.
I honestly don't believe that one can be in love, with 2 people. I do however believe that she does love one, while she is in lust with the other. For her own benefit and the sake of the others, she needs to figure out which one is which. All your friend is doing right now is being selfish. She's having her cake and eating it too. I don't think she will end this until she's forced to and the only way that is going to happen is if she's caught. You might be her friend and all but this isn't right and someone should tip her husband off, if you know what i mean.
If he was truly just experimenting and he doesn't plan on doing it again, then just let it go. There's no use in being upset over it. It probably got you so mad because you probably connect smoking with the problems that your mom faced, so it's a sensitive subject for you. Just explain how you feel and if he is willing to listen then everything is fine!
You just should have dumped him. I'm also 13. Boys like that are really useless. you must stand up confess what you feel about what he had done. you must believe in yourself and know that there are many other boys out there that are 100 times better than him.
just ask yourself which one do you like more? which one makes you happier?
no,wait do u really like her if u do u shouldnt care about that.
until you think, its cheaper to stay together rather hunting for hotels.. and you sure about you guys wont look around actively for other ppl.. atleast for some time..
Cash is good.
Not really, outa sight, outa mind. If your not constantly interacting, it's kinda hard to keep your feelings for each other, epecially if it's a new relationship.
I completely agree.  I don't believe in love at first sight and I believe it happens in stages.  Lust being the very first one
I think you should talk to him more, to flirt a little bit and see how he responds. You will feel it if he likes you even if he doesn't tell you this (in his eyes, through his behaviour with you, if he wants to spend more time with you, if he finds excuses to meet you...)
Well it depends on how much you wanna enjoy your marriage life alone together. I suppose you can wait for another 2-3 years
EEWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!\nSOME THINGS ARE BETTER KEPT PRIVATE LIKE IN UR SENIOR CENTER!!!

Body language is the most important in these cases. Not only you listen to what he says but also study his body reflex and his gestures and this will give you the answer.
hi, you could say you were visiting a friend or relative who lives near him...make sure you know the name of a street though or you will lookstupid when he asks where/ you could say you were just delivering a parcel for a friend....or if you live really close you could just say you were walking your dog....if you go somewhere you know he will be going for a drink say you are meeting a friend...good luck

G'day Vicki,\nThis is a very sad, (but very familiar) case and I am so sorry to haer that your ex does not want any involvement with his son.\nThe fact that your three year old is asking questions tells me that he is a very bright and intelligent young boy and has obviously learnt(through play group/preschool) that children have both mummies and daddies.\nBecause of his intelligence, I would tell him the story of his father. As much as he may not fully understand yet, it is going to be the beginning of this concept that he DOES have a father - but one, that is (sadly) not around.\nYou may be even surprised to learn that he may understand some of this.  \nThe fact that he has a grandfather(as a role model) is truly wonderful. Some children don't even have that, so that is a real blessing.  \nYou could start by telling him how much grandpa means to him and vice versa and how important Granddad is to you too.\nBecause he is so young, you may need to use analogies(little stories) to  help in his understanding.  Try to make it simple, yet truthful,(if you know what I mean) and be very patient.\nChildren at that age have a very short-attention span(as you may well know) and so he may tire if it is a long-winded story.\nSometimes, just giving him little spurts of the story each day, or once a week will help.  If it is given to him too quickly and too at once, he may not be able to grasp any of it.\n\nYou may find that, once he is old enough to fully understand this, he may chose not to talk about his father.\n\nI really do feel for you but I think he is going to grow up to be a very fine young man seeing that he has a caring mother like yourself and an obviously loving grandpa.  \nBest of Luck! :)
if a guy is smiling, laughing, and helpful to you then he likes you.

You are probably right, we are not in the norm. Yes I am married and I love my husband more than I thought was ever possible to love another human being. We are true and faithful to each other and we have been married for 19 years this past August and have 2 wonderful teens. We love telling people how long we've been married when asked and  hope to have many many more years together. Thanks for asking and I hope you are happy and in love as well. Love is a very precious and wonderful thing, if you have it you are truly blessed!\n\nHope you have a Happy Holiday Season as well!!!

Guys who beat or hurt woman whether the woman is married to the guy or not, is a useless worm who feed on other's pain to make themselves look strong & boost their confident. Woman who are abused by their spouse should seek help from related party. Marriage is not a license to beat up a person, it's a promise to take care of each other no matter how sick or poor the partner are.

Ask him out.
GO AHEAD AND YOU MAKE THE MOVE THIS TIME. I ALSO LIKE IT WHEN THE GUY MAKES THE FIRST MOVE, BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO GET THEM OUT OF THEIR SHYNESS. GOD LUCK !!!
Try a brewery, brew festival, or pub crawl.  They are fun.  A little romance and alchohol!  My wife and I found a map of all of the brewery's in Michigan and hit everyone except for the few in the U.P.
Those are awesome rules. May I add a few?\n\n5. If you think I'm going to give it up to you before I'm ready, move on!\n6. If you think I'm incapable of doing anything but serving you, move on!\n7. If you don't give me my space, I'll get it myself — permanently!\n8. If you think I won't notice if you flirt with other girls, think again!\n\nI don't know why some women go back to guys who don't do those things. Maybe they're just masochists.
What you need to do is simple.  Make yourself the most attractive you can be and start to flirt with him.  And not just him.  Other guys too.  That way, when he sees you...he sees you having fun.  He will become enamored by the prospect of having you just to himself.
start a convo. and then flirt on how pretty and cute she is.\nthen when she leave or u leave say i love you...... it workss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 im not even playin
sounds like everyone else covered all the basics-  you'll probably work this one in best by seeing if he wants to go out drinkin or to see a movie or something

nope\nyou're definately not picky. I think everyone is looking for that perfect one that fits what they are looking for. But its true - you do need to be REALLY patient because my momma said 'you can't hurry love, ooo, you just have to wait, because love don't come easy, its a game of give and take'.
Love comes in so many shapes. \nI love spring, because it announces the start of something new and I know that I love it, because it gives me this wonderful optimistic and happy feeling.\nI love my partner, because he shows me that I am worthy of being loved. \netc.\nThere are so many things and everyone loves individually, there is no set rule on how love feels to each one of us, but when it is there, you know that it is love.
my babes , meet this guy first.. Struggling to sleep at ny8 doesn't mean that u r in real luv. Meet him first n then take things from there. It's always gud to c the person behind the phone . Some pple donn act themselves over the phone . Meet him first and learn a lot abt him b4 u get married. wish u gud luck my friend.

There is nothing to be guilty about. Its not to make you feel better but it is what I really think. You made a wise decision when you broke off a relationship that could have made your life a hell as long as you live. Sometimes, when we become committed to someone, we stick to them by force of habit. There was no reason that you needed to give him another chance after four years. He was already taking you for granted  and there was no reason that he could hit you or be abusive to you and perhaps it is more sort of his ego problem that is leading to his depression. Quit thinking about him and enjoy your life. You were lucky that you found a loving person who saved you from taking a wrong turn, while there are so many other girls who do not get this opportunity and sacrifice theri happiness just because they think that they were being virtuous. They bear ill-use for years and their children have to suffer too and then, finally they do have to divorce or run away but not always with a loving one to help them sort out things. You should instead be happy for yourself for God intervened and saved you from a life full of pain and from the shadow of an unpredictable person.
Wow! I am wondering if we dated the same guy...? I had the same thing happen to me..this is so weird, because,  the events that you referred to in your question are exactly the same! However, my ex had schizophrenia. \n\nAnyhow, the outcome of our battle in small claims court..I won because the judge said that those were gifts. It was a complete waste of time for me.\n\nHe is doing this to you because he is sick and he needs to feel that he can over power you because some stupid voice in his pea brain is telling him this.\n\nSorry that you have to go through this because I know how you feel.

If you are going broke with everything else a single white, pink or red rose to hand her is always nice.And you can never go wrong with chocolate unless she allergies to them. Then don't give it to her..lol.. you can give her strawberries..mm..?? I wish you good luck. :-)
You've got to be kidding me...  (sigh)  Ok look kiddo, here's the thing.  Being overly emotional will only cause you problems and stress.  Dating is normal, and trying to find someone you're compatable with is normal.  You broke up with the guy for a reason, let it go and move on!\n\nDragging this out will only cause you stress...
I'm not telling you any secrets.  You just told your friends' secrets to fifty gazillion people.
"The money is hers and hers to do with as she pleases.  The ""man"" needs to get off his lazy a** and get a job and support himself.  Why should she be supporting him??? Sounds like he thought he was getting a sugar mama."
Absolutely.  I am especially turned on by sweaty stomachs rubbing together.  Just something about it for me.  YOW!
"Easy. Just say ""Hey do you like pizza, i do. I also really like ice-cream but more than that i happen to like you.""\n\nNow you can only say that if you do like her more than ice-cream, you don't wanna break the ice-cream's heart."
I think you should wait a few days and if he doesn't call than you should call and hear his excuse for not calling than deside what to do.
Tell her nicely that you're glad she had a good time but that sometimes you wish she wouldn't talk about it so much. Tell her that you don't mind hearing her talk about the trip but it's getting kind of annoying now.\nIf she's a good friend she'll do her best to understand how you feel.
Take him to court for child support and yes you are going to be involed in this man and his wife for 18  years and make the best out of it.  Make sure you get sole custody, since he did make sure that you were just the score to get sex and no relationship, he can alos try to get your child.  Men are out to get one thing and that is sex,and he does not care about the factors of your feelings or respect.  If women just say no, and stop making it so easy for men to robbed us from our bodies and etc.  We wil get more respect then we got.  Unfortunately to many women are not using thier brains, and keeping the legs close and just say and mean NO!  You were used, just like so many other women.  Don't make it easy for a man to use you just for sex!
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDD...Get over it already
i think you have got the best thing one can ever get! why do u want to lose it? u can be strong and in love at the same time. so u wont get hurt if she does something bad to you. i hope she doesnt but this sounds a very nice and happy friendship! keep it boy!
ummm rofl suck him off u will look him in the eyes then
""
it's hard when you are the only young PERSON there - but, you don't see them everyday - and, if you just have to put up with them occasionally, you'll have to try.  why not bring something to read, listen to music, even bring a friend with you when you go for company.   life is what YOU make it - so bring something along with you that makes you happy.  hang in there, pretty soon the age difference will not seem all that bad - and you'll find that you are catching up to them and you may even have some things in common with them.  make it a happy day for yourself - because YOU are the only one who is ruining HER day.
There could be a million reasons...don't want to be married, haven't found someone that they want to be with, they are shy and don't meet many people, their life circumstances haven't allowed them the luxury of considering marriage.......I could go on and on.....why don't you just ask the person?
"okay, you obviously have not had any children of your own yet.  What exactly is the age difference between you and his children?  15 is pretty old.  a 15 year old is no longer a child and they have already formed opinions of their own and could very possibly support themselves if ever needed.  So a 15 year old is a young adult.  My brother is 15.  Its a very delicate stage where they want their parents undivided attention, and they are old enough to know how to get it....His daughter IS ""HIS daughter"" and has been in his life from day one for 15 years.  He undoughtably loves her, and fathers allow their daughters to manipulate them, even more than their sons for the most part.  This girl may feel as though you are her equal (if you are close in age with her) inturn she will not respect you...@ 15 sometimes you don't even respect your parents let alone the chick your dad's dating.....He is going to take her (and the other children's) side over yours every time, probably forever, if he stays with you....i know this sounds harsh, and it is not meant to offend but I'm just telling you how it is.  And I'm 100% sure it has nothing to do with your race @ all."
""
I like for her to respond to what I am doing to her... tell me what to do too! What really turns me on is knowing that she is not going to tell me to stop and that she has given me control over her body... then it is my joy to get her off as much as possible... as far as facial expressions go, I like it when she bites her lip, trembles, squeals, and even better when she makes a mess!
"Good grief. Sounds like you need someone to TALK with; I don't mean counseling, it's gone way beyond that. I mean someone who knows you, is a good friend, & can give you some input. You have gotten a lot of sincere, & thoughtful answers, however, if he is ""cheating"" on you or not, there are so many more issues with this ""man."" & sweetie, I have to say--while it may seem pragmatic to advise you to split, to kick him out, or whatever--& I AGREE--I don't see how you can continue with the stress he's putting you through, if you choose to, it won't be easy.  He's not supporting your children NOW, & it would take money to get a divorce, & where would the child support come from? All this considered, you DO have to think about YOURSELF. You say you're not sure of what he's REALLY doing. You KNOW what he is NOT doing.  Whether you wake him from sleep or not hardly matters, do you think? This person isn't someone you can ""talk it out"" with.  Please just consider ALL your options, put YOURSELF FIRST; you're of no use to your children in the state you're in--come to the very best conclusion (basically a no win in any case) based on how you truly feel--in a way, it seems you've enabled him far too long. But whatever you choose, based on your emotions, finances, whatever, choose carefully & stick to it. I wish you the best, in a situation that has no ""easy"" solution. OK? It would help--at the moment--to talk to a friend who won't dictate to you, or judge you. You need to get this ""out"" in a forum other than this. I left my second husband after abandoning my profession to take care of his, only because I knew I was losing my autonomy & self respect. It was a long road back to where I'd been. Fortunately, I didn't have any children. I wish I knew more about YOU & perhaps I could be of more help. BE STRONG."
You need to calm down and regroup.You are letting your emotions get the best of u and the good thing is u know it. So take a deep breath and step back and talk this thing out.With us or someone u know. Remember she is only 3 yr old. Tell her when she says this that she can't and it is bad.If she does it again make her go to her room.I wish u all the luck...Your her father so u need to show her right from wrong without violence
what should you do? what do you want to accomplish? do you want to make your ex jealous or did you want to remain friends and feel that if hes jealous, than it could spoil everything? do you want him back in your life, so the new-found interest is welcomed or are you afraid hes going to stalk you and your new guy and the thought is frightening?\n\nthe easiest answer is always the most difficult to do, communication. i have a feeling if you think it might be jealousy, it probably is. though, sometimes theres no way to remain friends after a break-up, if you do.. you need to lay it all out on the table. you probably know the best way to handle this situation.
Go to th calbar and read:\nWhat Should I Know About Divorce And Custody?\nhttp://calbar.ca.gov/
"I (Being female) have been in this situation, but I played the part of your friend.  It was like the whole world came to an end.  I could not think straight for the best part of two months over it, and even to this day it wofts over me.  \nMy friend and I were so close and he had been the closest to me than anyone I had known.  I shared all the prescious secrets that you normally would not tell a soul, least of all a boyfriend (Dating).  I saw him as a brother it never entered in my mind that he would ever look at me any other way than his little sister.\nWhen he declared he was in love with me, it was worse than finding out your partner had cheated/lied.  Suddenly are relationship so far was a lie, I had been betrayed and left open by the closest thing to me..also it is like the thought of kissing your grandfather (Not normal). \nAlot of men can not help but mix up their feelings, show a man abit of kindness and they want to go out with you.  It is a bit like the men not understanding that not all women go out clubbing to find men, but to dance and have fun..unfortunately due to most men going out for that reason they assume it is the same for women.  But my friend was not any man, he was a best friend.  You end up grieving for the friend you have lost.  Unfortunately, things now can never be the same, never will I beable to trust him and open up to him like before.  \nYou worry that you might give out the wrong signals but don't want to loose the friendship side.  It is very uncomfortable situation and you do not know what to say and feel.  But the last thing you want is for them to hurt.  So you distance yourself alittle and give them space but try to reassure him..hard combination..hard situation.\nI believe just like you she does not know what to say or how to feel..but she will never beable to see you any other way then a friend.\nWhy did you ignore her?  (She even made efforts to get hold of you through another party, so she does care, just not in the way you would like her too)  \nAre you so sure your feelings are confused?\nShe probably thinks that because she does not return your feelings, like most guys, you have backed off.  If I were you I would send her a text message saying simply ""Sorry.  I miss you and you are my special friend!"" or something similar.  You two need to talk, do not leave it and stay away as did my friend, that is if you can live with her not feeling the same way as you (Those feelings must be disregarded, you must choose between the two). \nGood luck!"
you just have to try and avoid her, dont reply or send her any txts, emails etc
Stop the madness! There is no such thing. I have heard some say the woman but lets stop for a moment and think. Both parties give. They just give in different ways. So neither the man nor woman is superior in this regard. You can get the whole spectrum from bad to good from both. I am sure you have heard of men that are giving and same applies to women that just take. So just think about things with an open mind and usually you will see that stereotypical ideas hold no water. Its just a lazy way to label people.
cook an awesome dinner, buy a really hot dress, cater to his every whim, sit next to him and feed him, gauranteed to work.
Evidently you have been nurturing this on for some time... even prior to breaking up with your three year fling... It sounds like you want it to happen... Is he aware that you are free to date now... unattached...? If he is, I would do nothing and see if he asks you out in a week or so... if he doesn't, he's just a good office friend with no romantic interest... Some people don't like dating fellow office workers... It's a definite no no... especially when disagreements arise in your private life... I would change my focus and look elsewhere... You are pretty enough to attract a variety of eligible men... so don't worry about that... Just work on that sparkling personality...
"The ""X"" factor, that aura about someone that you can't really put your finger on but you can feel it when you make eye contact."
"First off, in an disagreement, keep hold of your temper.  Try to reason with her without raising your voice.   Try to negotiate a compromise.  Before she can threaten you with taking something away, try saying something like, ""I would really like to move this vanity somewhere else so that I can make room for a desk.  I know you don't want to, so why don't we make a trade? I'll do something you want in exchange for this favor.""  This will demonstrate that you are mature and are considering her feelings and wants too.  It used to work with my mother."
"try meditating on top of a Tibetian mountain... \n\nif the girl gave a firm ""no"", get moving, its no longer worth the while. Otherwise, elope with the girl if its only the parents... if the guy is so ready in love with the girl"
Go sit in a corner and play wit blocks its obvious your not old enough to be on this website. r u like a 4th grader?  (the dumbest question ever no doubt bout that)
Oh yes my friend you are so lucky I have bumped into your question. I have dedicated countless scientific hours to the study of this and I am happy to inform you that I have succeeded.\nTHere are several aproaches you can take but first you need to find out why you want to do this?\na) is it just a sexual thing?\nb) is it that you want to incorporate a second wife into the family dinamycs?\nWhat exactly are you feeling?\nKnow that this is not a quick process, it will take you months if not years to work on her in order to agree to this and even then it may not happen ever.\nWith that said lets get to it.\nIf its the sexual thing then it will be a lot easier than you think, its not that hard to get a woman to agree to it, now the realtionship part that one will be a tought one but let me assure you that it can be done, I have done it and it works out great for all of us. I will tell you buddy that its not an easy life but the rewards are worth it to me.\n1- you need to prepare the grownd. Be very affectionate, be helpfull, you need to give in order to receive, you will have to become a pleaser. ie. breakfast in bed, do dishes, make sure she enjoys sex very much, compliments, flowers, etc.\n2-Avoid fights. dont get into it with her, make problems look like a thing of the past. If there is a disagreement or situation you talk about it in a civil manner, no name calling, no yelling. Be very understanding of the situation and her feelings, make consecions and move on, dont bring up the past no matter what, if you fail to do this you will be taking a few steps back.\n3-connect with her. make sure you reach a transendent connection with her, be more aware of her feelings and thoughts on many topics. Make sure you make time and place to talk to her, to discuss different things other than her job or friends, focus on HER and only HER.\n4-If you have children be more affectionate with the children and more involved with them, dont' dump them on her or expect her to take care of them, cook breakfast for them on a sat morning and take them to the park so she can sleep in and have some alone time.\n\nThis process could take anything between a month and a year tops but you will see some dramatic changes.\nAt some point she will start doing more stuff for you, asking you how you are, cooking you up stuff you like, etc. THis is her way of reciprocating. If she doesn't there will be a point in which you feel like you need to say something because you will feel neglected, ok when this happens RESIST, deal with it and continue doing your part. THen the second time you feel like you are going to explode say something, but remember NO YELLING AND NO FIGHTING ( that is the golden rule here),she will ask you what she could do and just say that you want her to show you as well that she cares and loves you, don't say anything about a 3some, dont even hint it. Then give her a cpl days, she will spend this time thinking what she can do to make it up to you, at this point you have a conversation about things you would like her to do but still don't bring up the other woman thing, wait. She will try to do this things, more than likely she will screw it up so you will have another conversation about it, again remember to be very civil about this, dont fight no matter what.\nNow you are ready to make a move; if its for a simple sexual expirerience ask her during or right after sex: how she would feel about having sex with another woman? and just listen, she will at some point ask you why? or what you think? either way your response will be that she is so sexy and she would look so much sexier having sex with another woman, the kissing, the touching, etc. Reasure her that she is the only woman in your life and you love her so much. THen all of the sudden kiss her and get down dirty to having sex again, but this time it has to be passionate, animal, porno kind of sex. She will make a coment about it and tell her that just picturing it in your 
Well, I'm in my 40's and I can only have sex about 4x a night now, so yeah, I'm slowing down.
maybe  YOU are the problem-I hope that he stays away from you and that everyone stays away from you until you grow up- you put blame on everyone else, you portray yourself as a victim. you are wrong !!
You are beautiful just forget all those jealous people out there.
"This is what you need to know, and do.\n\nRealize that you are not in love with him until he loves you also. It takes two to be in love. So, for now, you just love him and hope to be in love with him. You are in a good place romantically. Your love for him will empower you and provide you courage.\n\nYou need to step outside of your comfort zone and simply call him or arrange a meet with him and say, ""The reason I wanted to talk with you is to tell you that, slight pause,  I love you"". \n\nHe may not know what to say. If he smiles and becomes lightly pleased at your words, you will know that you have just dropped the love bomb. Everything changes now, for the better, no matter what. \n\nBeleive me, you cannot ruin your relationship by confessing your love. You can only make it stronger and more honest. One thing to remember though, don't make him feel as though he has to say it back to you right away. If he says that he doesn't know what to say then tell him he doesn't have to say anything at all. He will appreciate your honest and brave courage if he is worthy.\n\nTell him that you love him and you owe it to the truth to tell him because you think he has a right to know. Leave it at that and consider the seed planted. You will be amazed how great you feel after you tell him. You will become aware of the great feeling of sharing your feelings selflessly. You will discover answers to questions many may live a lifetime and never find. Tell him straight forward. \n\nIf you are not the kind to tell him straight forward, then you may be the kind that lives a lifetime wondering what it feels like to share love with someone you love. You may be very close to the prize. Just reach and crab it. Real love will always survive and the truth is, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain."
Sounds like a great idea, doesn't it?\n\nThe problem is that one person or the other ends up wanting more out of the relationship than just the physical. And then things can get a little sticky...
"I'd say have him on ""probation"" and check out and see if his attitude changed towards you. If he seems more distant now, and wants very little to do with you then the answer might be right there. Belive what you feel in your heart. Also, keep in mind that he might not be. \n\n\nSometimes men can have the most beautiful woman in the world, but they don't appreciate her. Men are very complex, they just like to have their fun. He might LOVE you but still want to sleep with someone else. \n\nHope you find out soon...I myself am questioning my bf's faithfulness.  :["
"Talk to your boyfriend.  This is not ""abnormal"" sex, there are some people who do this on a regular basis so as not to have full intercourse.  It is still ""sex"", and can be very satisfying, it's just not full intercourse.  But talk to him and discuss how you feel.  After 2 years together, you should be able to talk to him about this kinda thing.  If not, what would happen if you marry the guy, and you can't even talk about sex!?  Maybe he doesn't enjoy Vaginal sex, and this you need to find out!"
Sounds like she wants to have  her cake and eat it.\nExplain to her that it goe's both ways , if she can have a guy friend that she hangs out with all the time then why can't you also have a friend?\nAnother way is to just ask her point blank if she likes this new guy more than a friend ,tell her it also looks mighty suspicious to you that she spends all her time with him.\nTell her it upsets you that she spends all her time with this guy , and the only reason you went looking for another friend , is because SHE was the one that went off with someone else.\nAll you can do is lay it all out on the table , and discuss it honestly. Good luck with  everything =)
Time is a healer, I should know. Chin up  sweetheart! x
No I def would not.
I think you and your cousin need to go to therapy because there is something just a little wrong about sleeping together in any manner of the word. You need to go out and find a real love interest and not worry about your cousin, she needs to go look for someone across town, not across the hall. That's just skeezy.
The best place to meet young women are in church. Some churches have singles ministries and young adults ministries.Check it out. Community services.Sports games. At the gym.
Which ever you like go for is the best bet. I like both myself.
First off - this girl is NOT YOUR FRIEND.  OK?  She's on some kind of power trip with you because you let her get away with it.  When she tells you that you can't go out with someone because she likes them, does she actually go out with the guy - ever?  I'm betting she doesn't.  She just doesn't want you to go out with him.  Maybe she's afraid that if you start going with someone then you won't have time for her.  Are you her only friend?  Don't let her do this to you.  If you like a guy and he seems interested in you - go out with him.  Don't let her dictate to you.  If you start out now letting other people run your life it will become a habit and you will be miserable.
stare with your partner....looking with her/his eyes might be a good start for a ROMANCE!!! good luck.

How old are you?\n\nMarriage is about giving yourself to someone emotionally, mentally and physically. If you can seriously and honestly say that you would sacrifice everything for your significant other, make sacrifices even if it grossly inconvenienced you, then you might be mature enough to begin discussing marriage.\n\nIt is a bigger deal than anyone who has never experienced it can imagine.
Getting back at someone is petty stuff that will get you nowhere. It's a waste of time. \n\nAt the age of 13 you should have some better thngs to do with your time. This is the time in your life to develop many life skills. You are too young to be dating anyone. Period!!!
you are doing the right think by doing anything.\nfirst because you don't want you heart broken again and second because you maybe looking for something you don't now for sure.\nnow, if you like him or want to know if is for real, do the same as he does.\nlook ate him ,smile to him ,and don't you  try do do something to make him feel bad for trying something with you.\nmaybe he really want,s you but you don't know that, so play on the defense, and let him do his job.\none advice , if you do this , don't look so desperate on front of him, his job is to conquer you and not the other way around.\nOrbytall
Have you tried using lubricants? Dildo? Shower head? There are alot of different ways to masturbate and everyone has different kind of stimulations. Yours may not be clitoral. As far as sex goes, I promise you that SEX is not all it is cracked up to be, but love is great.
"I don't know how many people I have made happier because someone made me happy, but I do know that I have made myself happy by doing things for others. Even simple things, like loading groceries in a car for an elderly person, and then returning their shopping cart to the collection area, makes me feel happy. It makes me feel like I am putting some good energy out into a world where there's a lot of negativity.\n\nI think what you are doing is living the ""pass it on"" way, and I think the world would be a better place if we could all do it. I try to do it every day, even if it's just the littlest thing, because I think that kindness grows and multiplies and eventually makes the world a better place.\n\nAnd kudos to you. You aren't going overboard as long as you aren't starving yourself to do the things you do. What you are doing is passing on your grandparents legacy of love and service to others, and it's a beautiful way to remember them and honor their memory. Doing something for someone of your choosing trumps taking flowers to a gravesite any day."
I called my ex on his birthday and we broke up over two months ago, I guess it depends on the person.
Lesson to learn...next time when you know someone is attached, he isn't worth your time because he is living a lie. And never get involved with his partner because that makes everything ugly. Yes he does hate you and so does she. Forget about it, they're not the only two people in the world. Leave him alone and move on.
He's feeling you out, he wants to have a threesome with you
people have five senses, one brain and one heart.\n\ni'd use my best features to appeal to the person using different combinations of these 7 things.
Well, there have been many times when I thought I was in love. I realize now that those times were more about infatuation or courtship that was all about what we could get from each other. \n\nI'm with someone now who I feel completely different about. We communicate well, which I think is key in a successful relationship. We are able to talk about difficult subjects without embarrasment or hard feelings. We have many things in common, but also have separate interests. We are very honest with each other and don't keep things from each other that might be im[portant to the other person. \n\nAll these things are important if a relationship is going to last, but you can have a relationship that has all these things without being in love. \n\nI think I am in love now. My siginifigant other makes me feel important, but also makes me feel like I'm able to care for him and be cared for. We are considerate of each other without having to ask. We are able to read each other very well, and are friends before we are lovers. Being lovers is really just a perk. A very good perk. \n\nThe most important thing, I think, of how to tell you are in love is if you really care abouit the person's well-being- if you do things and help them achieve their goals with no thought to how it will benefit yourself and if they do the same for you.
if she has liked you before...she at least somewhat likes you now too.  One idea you could try, is talk to her and tell her you can help her get the guy to ask her out (the one she stares at).  She will probably be happy that you are helping her and will talk to you a lot more.  Ask the guy who he likes and try to hook him up with another girl.  THen when the girl you like is upset from this, you will be there for her.  She will start to like you again because you will become closer and she will see that she can trust you.  IF you feel guilty about doing this though, you can follow through and tell her what you did and say you were so sorry you didnt mean to hurt her but you just liked her so much and would do anything for her.  I dont really have any other advice, but you can also get some friend girls to ask her who she likes and whats going on.  good luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! xo
from your description, i think both of you are couples made in heaven. go for it. this can be the beginning of a beautiful and romantic relationship.\n\ngive the man a chance, develop the relationship, let it grow and when you have a chance, tell him how you feel. If you wish for it to come from his mouth, you may give him hints, show him you are interested.. I wish you all the best..
I would tell him that you want to spend some special time with him focusing on each other.\n\nPlan some romantic activites that let you focus on your relationship.  Some suggestions:\n\n1.  Together .....Write a list of things the 2 of you would like to do together in the future.\n2.  Make a time capsule.\n3.  Make s-mores in the backyard.\n4.  Sit apart and write a letter telling how you feel about each other and/or describing your favorite things about each other.\n5.  Go star gazing.\n\nGood luck!
Why do u go 2 church 2 show off ur sunday best!!!!!! no silly u go 2 church 2 pray so that is what u should do.
"Well, if a girl kissed me, I'd push her away gently because she's too young to be kissing a 52-year-old man.  \n\nIf a woman kissed me and I wanted her to kiss me, I'd lean right up against her and kiss her until she pulled away.  Then, I'd ask, ""What brought that on, and can we do it again soon?"""
"lol... we're all specially unique, which means each of us is a weirdo in some way. You can't define ""normal"" by any standard."
"At last count, there were 2,178 country songs about this very problem.  So, don't feel alone - it happens to just about everyone.\n\nRight now, you are very into the moment.  The breakup has devastated you emotionally and it's dragging everything else down around you, creating, well....a mess.  Things NOT to do:\n\n1)  Drown your sorrows in alcohol or drugs (several of the 2,178 country songs are about this, too)\n2)  Find another girl friend.  This is called the ""Help Me Rhonda"" syndrome and it almost always fails - badly.\n3)  Try to win her back.  Look, she just found a new boyfriend and she's on the rebound from you.  What does that tell you about her?  If there ever is to be anything between you two in the future, let her come back to you.  Don't chase her.\n\nNow, you've had some time to lavish yourself in pure misery.  It's time to pick yourself up and get back to a real life.\n\nHey, maybe you should write a country song about it.  Could bring in some needed money!"
first learn some english then maybe the slut will like you, if your friend had his cock in her why would you want it, let her go
no! i think its fun and cute at the same time were men asked about fashio. hehe. its very rare for men to asked about this kind of stuff..but if i were to be ask for some advice..then i would be overwhelmed and appreciate the guts he have. lol
Some men are just like that. Those men don't respect women and only think of themselves. You should find someone who is more concerned with how you feel. Let him go throw his tantrums on someone else. You deserve better.
sounds like she is being strangly acting.\nMaybe you need to get her to a psychitrist to figure out what is wrong with her
I think that she may be using you....and maybe she feels guilty thats whys shes brushing you off. Sorry buddy but say you cant drive her to work anymore unless she starts paying you gas....but say you would like to see her otherwise. See what she says once the tables are turned.
I'd hazard an answer and say that you're trying to steal your childhood sweetheart back from the one she's currently dating. It's kind of sweet, really, considering that you know you care about her more than you may think you know.\n\nBut consider this saying: there's no time like the present. It's a common term, yeah, but if you think about her position first before your own, how would she feel when you're trying to break her up with her current beau? If I had a chance to be 13 again then I'd definitely would keep close tabs with my childhood sweetheart through phone calls and letter (no emails back in early 90s). Having a long distance relationship (if I could call that one) is tough considering the factors involved like meeting someone close to her. I won't go for the 'there's plenty of fish out there' thing, but before you can catch yourself a swordfish, you know you should catch something small at first.\n\nYou're young, and it is a good thing since you'll have a couple more years to meet new girls out there. What makes reality hard is that friends do come and go with the flow of time. But don't let that circle of friends (especially a gf) thin out all because one 'got away'. But not to dash your hopes, I suggest that you talk to her as a friend, kind of like being the funny guy a girl can confide on. Most girls are serious by nature even if they consider themselves funny or laid-back, but they would want someone to brighten their day even more with a funny guy at their side. Eventually, if fate allows it you and her will be together one day.
Yes there are. And it doesn't have to be because of religious pressure either. A friend of mine got married because she'd had to promise her mother that she would as soon as she could because she was already...26. They aren't happy, but for some it's a ring on the finger that's more important than anything else - even happiness.
sadly there are a lot of stupid people out there they believe nonsense like spirits psychics ghosts and ufos and all other kinds of inane idiocy besides the world needs stupid people who else are we going to make fun of?
NO!  Wanting more and having goals are good and having something to lookforward to.  You dont have to give up your marrage or raising your children, you are setting an example, to have goals and go after them.  There is nothing wrong with wanting more!!\nDreams make life worth living....don't stop dreaming!
Don’t be coming here to get a date or companion, as the ones who are likely to respond are the ones who are perverts. The nice ones know better than to respond to an advertisement like this. Go some place public where you can meet people face to face, preferably at church or some place nice like that. Remember that where you meet a person tells you what kind of person they are. If you meet them in a bar they may have an alcohol problem, in a strip club they may be a sex fiend. I’m sure you get my drift. Meet them at a place you like to go to so you will have something in common but definitely, absolutely, unquestionably, without doubt NOT ON THE WEB. ♠
yeah if you think your going to be together for a while...or else thats a lot of money youll never get back...unless you have a lot of money.
Personally, I think the best match for a scorpio is another scorpio.  Considering the passion and intensity that a scorpio brings to everything, you definitely would have a fiery relationship.\n\nBe careful of mind-games however.  Some scorpios are private and secretive to a fault, while others are blunt and outspoken.  Heaven forbid those two get together and try to change each other.  Doesn't work!
Well, I'm here on this stupid pc answering daft questions cos I have nothing better to do and even if I did I have no-one to do it with - Sad huh!  (Think I might as well go to bed!)
WHY  BUY SOMETHING THEN

They do. Back in the day, they would not have, since the Church was the only place you were allowed to get married, but alas, those days have passed.\nAnyway, nowadays, no matter WHO marries you, as long as they are recognized by the STATE in which you get married, it's considered a legitimate marriage.\nAlthough I think you're asking more along the lines of would they recognize and accept it? Some would, since the person who performed the marriage has to be legally licensed to do so. Some would NOT because they were not married in the eyes of God. They, in my opinion, are wrong. When two people love each other, yes, they can make that love whole by getting married, but if it's not in the Christian church, it shouldn't be a big deal.
Constant discipline, and what I mean is not hitting them all the time, but never letting up, lay ground rules, and punishments for those ground rules, and stick to them, stay firm, I teach parenting classes at church, find a good church, and take a parenting class
You will know when, and there is nothing wrong with asking May i Kiss you?
is there any going on at her house, is she made fun at a lot, or does she have a low self estteem cuz maybe that is why she stopped caring about herself maybe she doesnt find that she is worth it any more give her a present to try to cheer her up, i know what u are talking aout cuz it happened to me except i was the girl in hte grandmas clothes my friends stood by my side like you are and i changed, i applaud you for being such a good friend, if she doesnt change maybe you have outgrown each other.
I dont know you nor her but I suggest you to show her you are rich and famous . It works. At least for one night.
"sounds like he's pretty immature.  But you need to be the bigger person.  If you know he's doing it just to irritate you, then do your best to ignore him, or change the subject... or... in the middle of him being irritating, just ask him ""why?"""
Your dream is very positive. You're lying back watching the clouds just as you are watching the events in your life go by. Everything has clarity and definition, and there is variety as well. You're in a relaxed position indicating that you feel strong and confident about the way things are progressing. The sun feels good and colorful butterflies surround you. These are all the options and opportunities that you have right now, and they are plentiful. They can also signify the people in your life right now. Bright, energetic and beautiful, you are surrounded by positive energy from most every direction. This is a wonderful time for you where you are the one who's in charge of your life, and things are going extremely well. Seize some of those opportunities!
maybe she just doesnt feel the same way u do
Find them!
Tell your parents whats going on. Let them handle this.\nIt's not only bad, and plain wrong, it is disgusting!! \nYou're not suppose to do that...with your...cousin...ok?
yes I would loved to ask a man but I want to be sure if he liked me though , but Im glad to here from a man that you dont mind us girls asking marriage
Call Greenwood County jail. Say, can I speak to my ex-wife please.

flurt hold hands kiss ans hugs  and sex lol
i know people always say this but : BE YOURSELF!\njust lying about the smallest thing might end your relationship later on and he'd like you for the person you say you are not the one you really are (a bit confusing-soz).. just ask him about himself, his background, what he does, why he's doing what he's doing, if he's got siblings.. just questions you'd ask any other person that you'd wanted to get to know.. just maybe dont ask them all on the same  or it might scare him off.. make you appear a stalker.. also LISTEN to him.. most gyus prefer girls who are able to listen to them and are not waiting for them to finish talking sothey can go on about themselves!!!!\nok wow i think the second part of this amswer is more important than the first part so just make sure you LISTEN to him!!!\nGood Luck and all the best ;-)
I would definitely confront him, either that or answer the ad yourself and see if he goes to meet you.  I'm sorry to hear about that by the way.  Good luck on whatever you decide to do.

"You may find this funny, but the very WEEK that I told myself that all the good ones were taken or gay, I found my husband.  \n\nLike you, I had been through liars, cheaters, and abusers...  I thought that all men did it, and that I was going to have to settle.  I would rather be alone.\n\nI wrote a blog that stated that all men could go to hell, and that I was done.  The very next night, I met my husband.  I wasn't looking, either.  I just wanted to sing karaoke, and I ended up meeting an honest man who would NEVER cheat on me, and would die before he hurt me.  I got lucky, too, because he made a great living for himself...  ::winks::  (I'm not at all a gold digger...  I just wanted an honest man who would love me, and ONLY me...  The good living was a bonus.  If I met another man who stayed with his mother at 30, I was going to scream)...\n\nGood men are out there, but I think that you may be looking to hard, and settling on the first thing that you come to for either fear of being alone, or in hopes that this may be ""the one"".\n\nLet him come to you."
I'd print the picture from the website, and take it to the jeweler you KNOW, and see if they can get/make you something similar. Still... $12k is a LOT to spend on a ring! You better be 120% sure the answer is YES before dropping that kind of money! :)
Nelly It is really beginning to annoy me the fact that when ever we go out somewhere you're always bending me over and jumping on me....its so unladylike...so stop will yer xx
U feel so overwhelmed with everything going on.. I understand needing the family and friends by your side, but then again u really just wanna be by yourself for a while huh?  I went through one myself and thats all i really wanted was to be alone.. I had a son involved with this so it was hard for me to do that, but i knew i had to keep movin on.. I had him to care for.. Good luck to u and godbless u
i think being fun and playful is very similiar to flirting, but dont take it the wrong way. If your flirting you will seem to be making more gestures while playing or talking......thats all i know
If you really care about him, then continue the relationship as friends.  This way, it's kind of letting go slowly, and you can leave on good terms, which is always something good to look back on.
I liked my English teacher and well I was 19 and he was 28 and I fell hard for him. I hated his class but went to drool over him. After graduation I emailed him just for laughs and well he didnt deny liking me but he did say he would never cross the teacher student boundries. I suggest you move on. Teachers are off limits to us and we need to realize that. but do enjoy drooling over them and if that is what makes you go to there class keep it up. Good Luck to you.
"As a wedding planner I have a bias view, but I can tell you this much...\n\nA planner does NOT plan the wedding FOR you... a good planner plans it WITH you so that you get your dream wedding, all they do is take the pressure off of your shoulders (dealing with vendors, dealing with family disagreements over what SHOULD be, taking care of the Etiquette issues for you, etc)\n\nA planner will have connections you might not otherwise have, they already know the in's and out's of the business, they know who to contact when and will keep you on track and within your budget (not so many worries about going overboard if someone is always keeping you informed), If you get a REALLY good planner they might possibly be able to guarantee you that they will save you an amount equal to or greater than the fee you are paying for their services (effectively making their help FREE).\n\nThe drawbacks?  Well, our services can be a bit pricey depending on what services you want and where you live. You also might find that wedding planners can be just as ""shifty"" as the next vendor... So DO YOUR HOMEWORK!  Get references and CALL THEM!  Find out how long they have been in business, how many weddings they have done, etc.  Get DETAILS on how they are paid... do they only get paid by you? do they get ""kickbacks"" for using particular vendors? Etc.  If they take kickbacks cross them off your list... this means they will use the vendor who pays them over a better one that doesnt, which causes a conflict of interest!\n\nIt can be daunting, but once you have the right planner..... it will be well worth it.\nIf you choose to go it alone.... GET HELP! Bridesmaids, Mothers, etc. You will need someone to help you keep on top of everything, and you might want to consider hiring a ""Day of"" coordinator anyway... that way it is all covered on your big day and you can rest easy.\n\nAlso, if you are having over 150 people it is a very good idea to have a planner, anything under 150 and its not as hard to Do it yourself.\n\nGood Luck, and if you have any other questions feel free to email me, I will do my best to assist you."
It's a tiny bit akward but don't worry about it. It gets easier, plus if they like u, I bet they won't even notice any little mistakes.\nPS-Don't smile right before u are about to kiss someone, they might kiss ur teeth. lol. I've been there...
beside her blue eyes and blond hair \ni like the girl that \n1) trust herself and dont care what people say about her\n2) think she is the most beautiful girl all over the world  and act as a queeen\n3) love all people and has kind heart\n4) use her mind  and be quiet and sensitive also
I was a  bridesmaid for my girlfriend a few years ago.  At that time my hubby and I had been married for 7 years and had three kids.  The night b4 the wedding all us girls spent the night at the hotel.  I missed hubby so much that night - I wanted him there to share the time with.  My girlfriend looked at me and started to cry - she said she was so glad I was there with her that night - not only for the moral support and the fun - but because I was her only married friend and she enjoyed seeing how after almost 10 years together I missed him when he wasn't around.  \nPhysical attraction is obvious - and a vital part of all relationships - but it is the thoughtfullness and the caring that indicates how you really feel
Sounds like he's interested.  Talk to him when he tries to talk to you and be open to him if you want to work things out with him.

No matter HOW much you get back, it comes NO where near the amount it takes to care for a child properly. \nClothes, food, activities, child care expenses, medical, dental, .. the list goes on and on.
This is just an inkblot question...\n\nWhat it appears is different to each person\n\nWhat do YOU mean by it is the question.\n\nWhen its me, getting a kiss on the first date, Tells me two things. \n\n1. She had a good time\n2. She wants a second date and wants to keep us exclusive at least until that time.\n\nSo far I havent been wrong on those two things.\n\nBUT!!!!!\n\nI have male friends who think a kiss on the first date is a prelude to sex on the first date. \n\nIt will all have to do with who you are kissing.
I can only guess that they're not getting everything that they need at home, we live in a selfish society and if I'm not getting what i want the I'm gonna get it elsewhere.\nOf course some people are just naturally greedy
"Everyone has their reasons. Some people like it, some are infatuated, addicted, some people make fun of it, some are trapped into it by a friend/relative/girlfriend/spouse. Some people are numb to it, and are immune, some study it, some are sexually stimulated by it, some just really, really like the idea, like to live in fantasy, some people are obsessed with sex... It's all kinds of possible reasons... Everyone's different. It just depends on a person's prefrence...\n\nHm, see watch ""Burning Angels"". They're really pretty girls (rare in porn, sorry, but it's true.) Tattooed/Pierced girls... Porn is funny to me..But it can be hot when I watch it with my husband, and we're bored... good times.."

do it. nothing wrong with it.
You should go to the cops. I was in an abusive relationship for many years. If you dont stop it in it's tracks and show him you mean business, it will only get worse!!! Trust me
He likes you. There is no doubt about this. He doesn't show off his feelings to you because he is shy and fear of the possibility of getting rejected by you.\n\nNow, you need to decide whether you wait for him or go after something else. I see a good prospect here because his mom called you to hang out. Its positive that his mother know his son's feeling toward you.\n\nI believe that a guy who rush into things will not lasts. Your shy guy maybe shy at first, but later when he sure of his feelings for you, he will give you the world if he can. In short, its up to you if he worth the wait or not.
Don't think his teacher has the right to say he is gonna die by 21!!! Geez where did this teacher learn her teaching skills!! Tell your son that no-one knows whats gonna happen. Yeh we all should take better care of the enviroment and stuff. I could get run over by a bus rather than get killed by an earthquake etc. No-one knows but no point worrying so much. Enjoy life!
Well, you said she is shy and you said she is talking to you.  It seems that you have a good start already and just don't realize it.\nJust keep talking to her and seeing her when you can.  Things have a way of working themselves out.
Yep,.... its a bit confusing. Is the point that you have blocked fallopian tubes,  is your doctor just whacked, or did you misunderstand what he said? Never in my life heard of having to have fat drilled away from the ovaries,... its stored OUTSIDE the reproductive system, and it only effects blood hormone levels and ovulation. It does not block sperm. You either need hormone therapy, fertility drugs, ect,... or he should be sending you to a fertility specialist. Think its time you switch doctors.

i know how u feel hun
experience it. if you do not love to keep pain out, then you also cannot let love in! it is a risk worth taking; but, use your HEAD and not always YOUR HEART in your decisions. be wise about it!! good luck
its just a phase and you're horny.  it'll pass.  don't let her know about it cause women can't deal with sons looking at them that way and she might not let you forget it.
I think you should be more concerned about your wife's feelings then the feelings of this other woman.
Communication is the power word here.  Talk with the girlfriend and she what their likes and dislikes are, then stay away from the dislikes and make a point to bring up items that interest them.  DO NOT sound rehearsed.  Just be yourself!  You'll do just fine!  Be confident.  Remember first impressions.  Dad will be looking for a confident guy, of course Mom too.  Are you grandchildren material?  That's what they will be looking at.  Oh a nice appearance will be nice, but don't over do it.  Again, be yourself!  Good luck!
"hunny materialistc things arent what holds your memories! he never read them anyway, instead of holding on to that so dearly, write him new ones. my best friend was murdered and thats what i do. i ""send"" him letters. i write them on paper and then burn them... thats my way of sending them. god doesnt give you more than you can handel. eveything that happens in life makes you stronger. suicide is a permanent solution for temporary problems. i believe you go to hell if you take your own life, then you will never see him again... good luck and please be strong. my prayers are with you!"
If you are both Christians that says it all. Both of  you know the lord and to love someone enough in your heart to let them know that you are thinking of them is showing that you are a very unselfish person whom thinks about others and i think you should send it sounds like your a good man.
I'm a college student as well and I dont want to go back home to my mom cuz she is a drug addict who steals everything in sight.

When u need a brief break, get a room for about a week and then come home.\nTry staying on dorm, save up (as much as u can) to get an apartment with some roommates.\nAnd yes u can take a loan for a certain amount of money and apply to an apartment, it's just that loans can be expensive in the long run and it's best to just work and save at least for now.

My heart goes out to you as I am currently in Brazil and my husband is back in the U.S. for work.\nWell... it certainly is hard to be away for such a long time and seems that 3 months aren't enough to catch up with all the time spent apart.\nI don't know what your question was... seems that you want some suggestions on how to make your husband feel welcome back into your home and things you can do to make him happy while he's with you and your family for these 3 months. Well, maybe organize some outdoor activities, or since now up there is getting cold, maybe a cookout or something. Maybe one day invite his friends as well. It's hard to be away, I know. Well, let me ask you: why is he working so far away from home and for such a long time? is he in the military? Is there a way you and your kids could go join him for a few months while he's up there? How does he handle this time being away from you and kids? No doubt you miss him dearly. Could he maybe get transferred back to where you live? I personally find it very stressful to be so far away for such a long time. My personal experience is that is painful and the truth is that when you marry you're supposed to be with your mate and kids (if any). My husband seems to be having a good time by himself, he drives truck over the road. But that's my case. I don't enjoy that at all. Well, I hope you reunite soon. I know your kids are the ones who suffer more. I hope your husband is staying in touch with you and them although he's far. This is very important for the kids, to feel loved by both parents.\n:-)
Hi i too am looking for a Christian mate i think that is nice that you are looking for a Christian man tho i am twice you age but i wanted to let you know i will pray the Lord will lead you to a Godly man i have not thought of asking for a date here on answer tho there is people here also praying for me to find the right person i do not think it matters how much you way or any girl i would be with what is most important to me is that we are Equally yoked i look at a persons soul for that is who we really are i am sure you will find the one man who you will marry and spend your life's loving the Lord together May God always Bless you your Brother in Christ Jim

It's true that the world has totally changed its colour . Now there is no respect left for man or even woman . They are just roming around the world with their own fashion and style . They thinking are beocme too cheap nowdays . The boys and girls of today thinks that fashion is everthing in life , but honestly speking it is not everything in life . first of all we must achieve something in life and then make ourselves look good or fulfil our desires . Pls don't get upset with this small matters . They are just a game of time . Remember what i said to you . Have faith in Allah , He will help you .Allah is always with us . It does not matter how beautiful you are , Face is nothing in life . Everything is your tallent . If you don't mind I want to say somthing . This is that boys don't like u because you are fat and unstylish . Do you ever like a fat and peculiar boy . That's the fact . Try to understand what I wanted to say .

your computer has a virus of sorts, called a trojan horse that is preventing sign in to yahoo...you should get a good virus checking program, load it and clean the system completely...it will fix the problem, I have fixed others computers that users had that had similar problems, the virus uses your sign on/mail account to spam other computers but does not give you access to it so you cant see what it is doing.
i think you are over him.  it's YOU that you need to fix up and change.  get new hobbies, learn new things, meet new people.  fix yourself up and make yourself new.  they say it takes 23 days to make a new habit become part of who you are.  so, starting on Thanksgiving, wake up each day and write down a new thing to learn or do each day and go out and do it.  by Christmas day you the feelings you have will be gone, and you'll have a great New Year with the New You!!!

You might still have a chance.  She is still interested in you.  I don't think she knows what she wants.  Try to talk to her.

I'm sorry but why in the world would you want to be with somebody who told you they had a crush on somebody else. I know this hurts but sounds like either she's playing games with you or she's bringing this up to make you jealous but either way it's playing games. You need to tell her that you don't have time for games either she wants to be with you or she wants to move on because she don't need to be throwing up a crush and y'all just got back together. You need to tell her that life is all kinds of choices and she need to make the choice between you or her crush. Good Luck!
You need professional help if you are going to save your relationship - and more importantly, save yourself.  You are definitely no longer in control of your depression or your drinking. \n\nGo to your pastor/priest and ask him to recommend a therapist and/or support group.  Go to your doctor and tell him/her about your depression.  Take action based upon their recommendations.  Then go to your fiancee and tell him about the steps you are taking, and ask him to attend couples/premarital counseling with you.\n\nDon't wait, don't make excuses, don't put this off.  Get help nnow and get yourself back on the right track.  Good luck!

No, I never realized the connection until after we were married but my now ex-husband looked a lot like a fat Garth Brooks and/or the dude from the King of Queens...lol...
well, look out for signs like the way he behaves around you & everyone else. Does he try to find common interest with you, help you in any manner he can, but the actual deal is if you can feel that he likes you.

I think it is important for parents to display affection to their children. \nI feel open and honest communication is warranted here! Let your mom know what you need from her, this is sad to say but she should already know this.

"Guy walks up to a girl, and he asks her politely, ""May I please have a picture of you?"" She asks, ""Well why do you want a picture?"" He says confidently,""Because I wanna show Santa Claus what I want for Christmas"". She giggles. She says,""Are you serious?"" He smiles and nods his head. So then she tells him,""Well, I will tell you what, I will give you something a bit better.. here is my number."" The guy says,""Your right this is better, I will call you tonight."" He then smiles, winks, and walks away."

if you are questioning his love for you and his motives than you do not trust him for if you truely did,you would not question. Take things one day at a time.
"Move on.  Learn more about guys by being with some other ones.  You may find one you like better than this guy.  And who knows, as you get more mature and more confident around guys, this one might ""rediscover"" you. \n\nHave fun and good luck!!"
your probably a big flirt. and guys will usually say anything to annoy a girl.
No, besides why woud he interview you if he was your friend. :(
The thing about life is, we meet people each day that are there for a reason. I would make a move. What is the absolute worst thing that can happen? You both connect, get to know each other and one of you gets hurt? If you are both honest from the beginning then you can avoid quite a bit of it. You only have one life to live.

Ask your friend first if she wouldn't be too upset about it.  Friendships are more important than dates.  Guys come and go, friends are forever.  Don't ruin a friendship over it.  Chances are she'll be ok with it anyway, but talking to her first will ease your conscience.
Well over the counter your extremely limited.   Condoms are going to be the mainstay.  As someone else correctly said there are ways to make them more effective.  Some condoms have spermicide that essentially kill the sperm this helps increase their effectiveness.   Surprisingly but true women in the 50s used to use Coca-Cola… that may sound pretty strange but sugar of that level kills sperm… however does not do much good for keeping it clean.  \n\nHigh quality lubricated condoms with a spermicide are probably the most effective, high quality because you don't want them to break and lubricated so they not tear or break down easy.    \n\nYou ask can you use two methods at the same time.   Yes…. and it's not a prescription.   Timing….  now this is something you deftly don't want to use by itself. If you have regular periods (some women do some don't).  Try not to have intercourse between the 12th and 16th day before your next period.  Don't miss what I said… you actually have to estimate when you're going to have the next period and plan backwards.   Between that 12th and 16th day will probably be the most likely day you will be fertile.   The combination with a condom used every time and avoiding during this time further increases your odds of not getting pregnant.\n\nYour question about would one method mess up the other method.  Essentially the more methods you use the more “safe” you're going to be.   You might be referring to using something like Vaseline or some other lubricant not compatible with the latex condom.   This part is very true.  Vaseline and even some silicone sexual based lubricants can break down the latex in condoms quickly… essentially causing them to break.   Use water-based lubricants or the lubrication that came with a condom.   \n\nWater-based lubricants and high-quality condoms you can get at places like drugstore.com under the sexual well-being category.   Convenient brown wrapper box…. but always order some shampoo or something with it so if anyone gets suspicious you can say look…. that shampoo I've been wanting.\n\nThe use condoms every time and timing your probably 99.9% not going to get pregnant.  Don't let your boyfriend talk you into using a method called withdrawal.  Before he orgasms he pulls out.  Regardless of how good you are at the timing….its a bad idea.  We can usually call women that use this method one thing…. Mothers !\n\nMoving over to prescription birth control probably increases efficiency somewhat. But it can also opens you to more sexually transmitted diseases.  Because you are having direct contact. Now if your boyfriend and you have never had sex with anyone else your chances of having a sexually transmitted disease is probably about as close to zero as it gets.  But there are plenty of low-level diseases that don't make the paper every day that have a lot of consequences.\n\nBefore you ever have intercourse without a condom I would highly recommend you have your boyfriend pay for a vaccine called GARDASIL.  Let him pay for he's getting the pleasure out of it.   This vaccine just released by the FDA stops HPV (that's the reason women get a Pap smear every year to look for cervical cancer).  The main cause of this cervical cancer is HPV (human papillomavirus).  The FDA has actually recommended this  vaccine from girls age 9 to 26…. yah you heard me 9.   It's not because they're sexually active it's that the vaccine has to take effect before intercourse with the male that's infected with the virus.  Males can carry this around all their lives and never know they have it.  There are usually no outward symptoms in males or females.   But women will develop (if infected) genital warts and or cervical cancer later in life.   The vaccine is effective against 70% of all cervical cancers and 90% of all genital warts.  That's some serious protection   \n\nThe problem is once you've had unp

no i do not beleive it is bad to date someones ex if you think about it each one of us have ex out ther somewhere it does us no good to get mad about it
Let me just tell you that 16 year old girls are a pain in the butt to ANYONE that is close to them......I wouldn't worry about it...Just  don't make a big deal out of it and keep inviting her to do stuff...If she is still difficult then talk to her about it and say....You know I try to be a good brother but you are a pain in the *&^...  Just be honest with her....16 year old girls think they know everything but they know very little about real life....
Gurl sex aint evrything and u shouldnt play yo baby daddy like dat no how...if hes stickin by you u should stiick by him and remember that u aint the only person u got to think about and look after...now u got yo son or daughter and if they was to see u wit some other man wat would they think? Either move out yo baby daddy's house and go wit yo ex or leave him alone and raise the child together...u and the dad...so they dont grow up as another statistic bastard child. Good Luck and i hope u dont put a man above your child
- He shouldn't fancy my sister, or tell me how good looking she is
You should ignore the sod!  He clearly was just using you to try to show you off because he wanted a Victoria Beckham lookalike, but realised he couldn't have you as one.  He's probably angling for another girl who dresses in the over expensive sort of stuf she wears.  That's just sad.  I say guys who take interest in women's fashion are probably poofs, (and want to stay away from them!).  You shouldn't be a slave to fashion, it doesn't make you who you are.  You had every right to dump him, and have every right to dump on him, lol.  Stand tall, he's an idiot with more money than sense!
You could be making yourself too obviously interested for his comfort.  You know, I'm sure, how workplace rumors can crush a persons reputation and perhaps he's trying to avoid anyone witnessing anything that will look bad for the both of you in the long run.
First why are you posting this in the dating category?\n\nA ford Escape is more styllish. Works like a beauty on the beach, I love mine.
"You seem kind of young. So, I am going to try to give you advice for what I am assuming your age group to be... WITHOUT... trying to seem like the other people by lecturing, or demeaning you.\n\nThere is something that you need to realize... at your age most guys are jerks that are mainly trying to scheme on young ladies like yourself. I think you need to realize this because I don't think you will get the answer you are looking for if you decide to confront him and ask him the truth, because he most likely is going to lie.\n\nI know that you seriously don't believe the this young man slapped the girls booty simply to avoid being slapped... I'm not saying that your friend is lying, maybe she just doesn't know the WHOLE story.\n\nIn the event that, that is the truth and he was doing no wrong maybe you should find out if he is just committed to your ""relationship"" as you are, because a week doesn't seem to be enough time for any couple to know if they want to be together or not. In a  week most people are still just getting to know each other.\n\nThe answer is simple. You are young, and there are going to be PLENTY guys for you in your life. So I think you should still be cool with this young man, just don't put so much focus on him and him only :)"
umm, me being a girl my self, i would wait for the person to make the first move. belive me, most girls wait for the guy.

Yeah you tell em Ms Dr phil...lol\n\nIsn't it great when 13 year olds are so concerned with there serious relationships
if it is true that we are what we eat. I must be a Pu$$y!
Restraining orders may not get HIM to mind, but, the law will have authority to lock him away.  Also, if he commits a crime against you, then the penalty will be greater because of the restraining order was violated.\n\nA friend of mine was murdered by her hubby.  He had a restraining order, but violated it many times.  Finally, when it came to sentencing him for murdering her, the judge added 4 extra years to his sentence.\n\nYou may need to video tape his behavior, get statements from friends and family of his behavior, or any other means to document the character of this guy.  He may back off after a while, but in the meantime, you need to be aggressive back.  Carry mace or pepper spray - talk to the police about any self defence courses they have that you can take.  Go to the gym and get strong.  Take dance classes to be light on your feet.  \n\nDon't let him control you thru intimidation or his mere presence.  You need to take your life into your hands and be as strong as you can be - both physically and emotionally.  \n\nI've always thought that if someone was stalking me, I would reverse it and begin stalking him, frightening him to show him how it felt and to back off.  I can't hide in a corner and just wait for the attack.  I can't live my life in a shell.  Fight for your independence from him and make it clear to him that he's messing with the WRONG LADY, and you're not going to let him get away with ANYTHING.
Apologize to her evn thoguh you completely don't know why she was mad at you. Still send her a greeting in her birthday and in christmas to make her forgive you. My Tip: Never ever lose a friend for a reason you don't know. Goodluck Gal!

"OMG i totally know what your going through. yes! keep talking too him. no, dont tell him how you feel, atleast not yet. whenn he keeps talking about ""her"" just listen too him. even tho i know it kills you inside just keep listiening to him. help him out. and in return he may notice how sweet and caring you are just for listening. thats when you tell him how you feel. when hes not talking about ""her"" as much,\nhope this helps a little, good luck!!"
"""right"" means he is acknowledging your message.  That's about it.  If he's not telling you what you want to hear don't disect his simple response into what you wish it was.  If someone misses you and loves you, they will tell you."
Here is some advice. Get more talkative! don't be afraid to talk to someone! There not going to not talk back! Also never hang out with just one group of people! I ran for my class president and I won because I was open to hanging out with new people! Trust me in the long run it helps! And about people calling you quiet make jokes with them! People call me the silent Gangster! lol But you be who you wanna be and if you don't wanna talk than don't. And make sure your friends understand!

I guess it depends on how picky you are...
This is an odd question because every woman has her own way of approaching and seducing men. We each come into this as we grow and mature and gain confidence in ourselves.\n\nI for one am one confident female. I often give stares, and mysterious smiles and when he approaches I shoot him down before he knows what hits him. I'm blunt and brutal and many guys find me a challenge. I can hang with the boys, and I can sit and trade insults with the best of them. Many guys find me intriguing because I am both tomboy and girlie girl. They attempt ot pursue and I laugh them off. Before long he's working towards something he doesn't even know about. Thats how I meet him, grab his attention and once I turn on my charm I've won him. \n\nBut thats MY way, and its taken years to develop. I don't even know why I am how I am, but its the way I behave 24&#92;7 and it makes men flock to me.
no idea what i missed but i will take the 2 pts  thanks
sorry no idea
I think it is time you moved on.   It could have just been a whim for her, but you should maybe find out who the other guy was it could have been a friend.   You should be asking her this question don't leave it up to us.  We don't know her or yourself.  See how you feel about the relationship if you want it to go further than ask her, otherwise move on.
awww thats sooo sweet...\n\ni wish i were herrr...
I wouldnt do it because its my mom and my sister. and if i did i would not be able to look at my mom and sister the same way again
Sounds like you have it bad for her. All i can suggest is as long as it is to be a long distance relationship, write her an email every day...... no more than one, unless she responds.... telling her how your day went, how much you miss her, what you miss about her........ it will help. Then find some guys, and go play basketball, or video games....... anything to take your mind off her. OTherwise, talk to her, see how she feels about you...... make sure your both on the same page, for if she is trying to push away, now would be the time to make the break, no matter how painful! good luck!
Well hello Tea bag me......I thought this was a masturbation question, and I was about to chime in and say at least 3 times per day.
Maybe someone in 5th grade should instead be playing with forts and baseball?
A circle without a centre, a river without water and a tree without fruits. It is an incomplete life which can never experience fulfilment in true sense of the term.
Well...my dear friend, I was very suprised to encounter your question. \nWell, my answer will be this, my dear good friend.\nDon't do it. Whatever will it takes...I advise you not to do it. Why? Well, if you truly loved her, then wait until the right moment (of course after marriage), then you can do it. If she mad at you for not doing it and accuse you for not showing you love to her...ask her what kind of love you two are having if it is only based on sex??? Normally, love based on sex always end up with nothing at all. In other words, both of you gain nothing but only a temporary pleasure. For the rest of your life, either or both of you will feel guilty to yourself, your partner, your family and even worst...to you future wife (whom you may yet to meet in the future). \nTherefore, for the sake of her innocency and of course YOUR INNOCENCY as well as PRIDE, my strict and bold advise to you will be NO. Don't do it. Ignore other people insults such as coward, virgin or so on merely because you 'failed' to take the good 'opportunity'. \nLike I always say to the others, think first and ponder about it before going through it and then regretting it for the rest of your life. ( I guarantee this one to you.) \nAnd again, such is only a temporary pleasure (believe me on this). Once you done with it, you may feel great (no one can deny this) YET...in one moment, you may feel regret about it. Even worst, you may regret about it for the rest of your life (I emphasize on this one before.)\nThus, my friend, you decide properly. The decision is upon yourself and it is for the benefit of many parties (you, your family, your loved one, and so on.).\nOne more thing before I end this advice of mine that I want you to think about...want is the use of having the dignity among men and women for being so 'brave' enough to have pre-intercourse if in the end its' purpose is only for pleasure and 'not-so-genuine-love'? Is it dignity for having sex for fun is more important than saving yourself from committing a sin? You know...the gate to heaven is too narrow. Even the slightest sin could cause one soul to be 'kicked' out from entering God's 'pub' (heaven/kingdom, of course).\nMy friend...it is for you to decide whether to do it or not to do it. \nGood luck.
Lets hope your love can survive education seperation, bouncing hormones that havent yet settled and dreams/aspirations that could be stunted because of it.\n\nIf so, then i guess - why not ? Its all about commitment and maturity i suppose. Even at 30, a person would have to worry about all the thigns i said above and get thru it.
it almost sounds as if he does like you and did like you , but somehow he feels like you arent interested in him, or somehow did something that as hurt his feelings ..... did he ever say hello and you didnt hear him or was there ever a time he was trying to get your attention or say something and you were too busy?? almost sounds like he got scared of rejection for whatever reason and now is totally confused and veaurnable ......give him time or make time to speak just to him ........
"There is nothing difficult about ""love"". To love unconditionally means that there is no strings attached. It sounds like he was just playing games. Having long distance relationships are difficult on the heart, unless one actually moves there. To teach another what ""love"" is....there is no such thing. It happens. Its there. \nYou need to let it go because he doesn't sound like a very caring person. Get on with your own life. There is always someone compatible that comes along. There is more fish in the ocean."
never to fall in love at all...\nand by the way... to fall is an irregular verbs so the forms would be to fall - fell - fallen.
dats is not a good sign...especially if its a girl you are talking about...there is probably something goin on...im not trying to be hurtful but its true...she probably likes him or something...i mean its okay to have friends but when they call them more than you sumthings up

Hi I took my 3 daughters out around the local estate-But before we went out we had a t-party-It was nice cos they didn't know I was doing it for them-\nIt's the first halloween since I separated from my ex-He was violent-And he missed out big style cos we all had loads of fun.\nEven the baby was dressed up !!!!!!!!!
I KNOW HOW  U FEEL.  WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I HAD AN AUNT JUST LIKE THAT.  SHE ACTED AS IF SHE HATED ME FOR NO REASON.  SHE WOULD TREAT MY COUSINS , EVEN MY SISTER BETTER THAN ME.  IT HURT BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHY SHE DISLIKED ME .  WHAT CAN A KID DO THAT WAS SO WRONG?AS I GOT OLDER, SHE STARTED TO RESPECT ME MORE BECAUSE SHE KNEW SHE COULD NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME ANYMORE.  BUT WHEN I HAD MY OWN DAUGHTER , SHE STARTED THE DUMB SHIT AGAIN, BUT I AM NOT LIKE MY MOTHER.I TOLD HER OFF AND SHE WAS VERY INSULTED.  I REALIZED THAT ONLY SICK PEOPLE DO THINGS LIKE THIS AND THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A TARGET SOMETIMES.  SO JUST GO ON AND STOP WORRYING ABOUT PEOPLE WITH ISSUES OF THEIR OWN.  THEY HAVE THE PROBLEM ,NOT U.
GO FOR IT ! you can do it !
"actually yes it does for sum here is why..\nsay you see some chick you would really like to ""get"" well in an open marriage you can and the wife cant get mad. you have some one there with you on those cold lonely nights and to discuss how shitty your day was but you dont have to have sx with just her!"
go back to school....your text type is desperate.
F/O n di...
yes most def ask him out.. he def likes you if he didnt answer his friend... thats wat most shy people do.. if there to shy about that question they wont answer... hope this helps
you didn't mention how long she would be gone n for what ?\n\nanyway, friends come n go but live goes on ! Wishes her all the best n pray for her success at whatever she is going to do ! You two still be able to get in touch with each others through email n phone calls, right ? n the Internet could offer so many way to share whatever things you both likes. initially it might be hard n difficult on you[she too], but eventually you would be able to get over this !
If you are really head or heels with him you should leave him alone.  I know that it sounds crazy but you are so young.  If your parents ever found out that you are making out with a 18 year old man then they will flip out.  Leave him alone or he can wind up in jail.  Besides  lets be honest.  What does he see in a 13 year old girl.    Are you a prize to talk about with his friends?  Give it some thought hon.
wut i think u should do is tell him the truth u have to take a risk. think about it, u would probably waiting a long time wonderin wut if?, and thats the worst thing u can do. and u never know he might lyk u back thats the main reason he gave u the note. always when u lyk a guy maybe wait a week and then tell him the truth cause u never know that he lyks u back.
Maybe she's just not ready or she's afraid of what you might think. I say just keep the conversations going until she's readyor until your ready to move on.
a few books for you to read up on,  How to Win Friends And Influence People by Dale Carnagie & you should read The Five Love Languages by Gary Chapman.  These two books should answer all your relationship questions.
I'M THUPER THANKS FOR ASKING!!!!\nand giggling uncontrollably, but you knew that\n~sashays out of the closet and into the !BODY! of my tall tale~\n\nAs you well know, I can totally relate to this...from a fabulously different angle, however. I, Dr Rich Amblaeu, am both a blessing and a curse to all monogamous, heterosexual relationships....regardless of their stability. I've earned the title 'LadyKiller' and you may rest-assured that I live up to it. The anticipation of ripping a woman's hunk-of-a-man out of her arms, out of her life, and into complete and TOTAL submission causes the sun to shine where the sun shouldn't shine...if you know what I'm saying (and I know you do).\n\nI shall render her powers useless against him, thereby thrusting her into a state of helplessness. Upon doing so, my third leg instantly stands at attention, front and center. I then violate the man from the outside in, then from the inside out...over and again until he curses the day that he was born.\n\nThe various positions, restraints, toys, and locations (physically and geographically) that we use can be seen as the many courses of a single meal. All are vital in satisfying the appetite, however a lingering thirst doth remain. The only remedy that will effectively quench that thirst, is to literally drink the sweet milk of her tears.\n\nOnce I have demeaned and deviled her 'significant other'....demoralized her 'relationship' in every way possible (emotionally, physically, spiritually, mentally, intellectually)\n...only then do the tears begin to flow. Then and only then am I able to consummate MY marriage, one between appetite and thirst.\n\nTo lick the tears from her face, to literally suck them from her eyes....that is what it takes to satisfy my palate. Oh the sweet milk of a relationship gone sour, driven to the brink and forced over the edge by yours truly....\n\nOregon's Biggest Gayest LumberJack\nPresident of the Orgeon Chapter of NAMBLA\nProctologist Extraordinaire\nMary Kay - Customer Disservice MVP\n\n-BIG GAY RICH, MD

Just give the girl some time. That could mean a month or a year. But if she was engaged to this guy than she had to have some real serious feelings for him. If you really like this girl than stay by her and be the friend that she needs you to be right now. Even if you want more just give her the space that she is asking for.  You 2 may slip up every now and then and do something here and there but until she is ready to come out and say that she is ready to take that next step again than it will never work.  Just remember that you can only wait as long as your hart will let you. She is not the only one making the decision. You both have to make that choice and not have had anything to drink. Don't push it unless you want it to fail.
Things change when a husband and wife has a child because both of their lives change. He feels that there is no flame in the relationship and so he looks for someone else instead. He won't leave because of the child, but he wouldn't want his wife anymore.
ur still young. give yourself time. experience life more. expand ur mind first. that's why ur mom wanted to know if u date cuz then if u needed advice she can offer them to u. she's just there to protect u. not trying to ruin ur life or anything.
probably that your not hot
Rule # 1: Never assume.\nLet them meet, check out your parents' reaction and then move from there. You might just be dealing yourselves a raw deal!
"It's all a part of life, friend... Changing & Growing.\n\nSeems like you have a lot of things happening in your life right now; school, a relationship, and personal priorities.\n\nThink of it this way: You have a meal on your plate consisting of meat and 2 side dishes. Do you eat all the meat and then the side dishes? Many people don't. Most sample a bit of each and wash it down with a beverage. Life is like that, too!\n\nWe ""sample"" different experiences at different phases of our lives and enjoy each of them - until they're gone. You have a wonderful friendship with this guy; surely one to savor. But is it the main mean (real love) or an appetizer (a sample of better things to come)? \n\nOnly the two of you will know - in time.\n\nHe is apparently undergoing the same changes right now. Just keep your friendship line open and things will flow as they should.\n\nSometimes, sweethearts become lifelong partners but many times, they don't. Just be there for him as his friend, relax, and see what happens. It appears that right now, love has to take a back seat for some of the other priorities both of you have got going on in each of your lives. Don't consider them as a deterioration of your love but, merely a distraction from it...\n\nKeep being honest and open with yourself and your boyfriend. In the end, it will solidify what truly forms the foundation of your relationship with each other.\n\nThanks for writing, my friend. Good Luck to both of you!"
I did for a while, being a single mom living alone was difficult. But I worked and paid rent, paid my own way. Once I could afford it and my son was old enough I moved on my own and since have gotten married.\n\nI think the circumstances of you living at home would factor in to how I felt about it. If you had your own apartment in your parents house and paid rent, sustained yourself, had a good job and had a car then it would be fine. When I met my husband he was living with his dd, but they split everything like roommates. A man who lives as a man is definitely more attractive then a mamma's boy.
Try and get a photo of him and then print some flyers off detailing what you know about him and put them up in public areas where you live. On the poster put if you know this man keep your children away from him, he is dangerous.\n\nIf he sees it, it will shame him into leaving or maybe if you are lucky he will go down to whitehaven docks and throw himself in!\n\nGood Luck.
Something to unwrap?  A Magellan Roadmate (GPS device).\n\nSomething too big to unwrap would be a kayak.
To make your bf adore you even more than he already does it just to be yourself! Be lovable, goofy, sweet, sexy, and laugh a lot. Guys love a girl with a great sense of humor.
If you love her, dont let her go, you will never know when someone like her will ever come around again. if your mom loves you she will want you to be happy. you need to show her that you have your own life she can not controll

Things I did to my sister,\nPour water in his bed at night. At first your parents will feel sorry for him and then they'll start getting mad.\nPut something smelly in his closet, or in his drawer.
just be honest and let her know that you just want her to be happy and that you feel that you're not the one to make her happy.  have her acknowledge that she could see that the relationship isn't working out.  make it a mutual decision as much as possible.
I say dump your bf and go out with the new guy. All girls deserve their guys' fullest attention.
There is no such thing as a simple relation with any other woman when you are married
I know we were meant to be together.....
you need to tell her from your heart what you want to ,not what strangers tell you to say,you will do just fine , just the fact that you are so concerned that you are asking us ,shows you are a considered caring person, whatever you say it'll be something she'll take with she
What does your fiancé think? - would be my main question here. Unless my fiancé was made of money, I would be extremely disappointed if he spent any significant amount of it on an item of purely symbolic value such as an engagement ring. I was much more impressed with the fact that my husband owned a home and managed his money well. But some women would rather see their husband-to-be in debt, and have a huge rock on their finger; so, it all depends.
TALK TO HIM, JUST DONT MAKE IT SEEM LIKE YOUR FORCING YOURSELF TO TALK TO HIM, JUST LET THE CONVERSATION FLOW
If it makes you uncomfortable then tell him to back away.
"your on a rebound and your needy...try calling your ""girl"" friends and try to have fun without men around"
i think you are smart and on the right track. reaching out is a good, healthy thing to do when you arent feeling so good.\n\ntry to go out or talk to your friends more, find new activities to keep yourself busy and go do a few fun things on your own or with family.\n\nthings will get better in time and with every relationship you have, good or bad, you learn all sorts of good things that make you stronger and wiser.\n\nits a good time to reflect but also to make sure to not let yourself stay too sad for too long. after you have a good cry and let emotions out, tell yourself positive things and start doing things to make yourself happy.\n\ngood luck, \nwishing you the best
It was consensual. What's wrong about that?
As a woman I would love a friendship ring like your talking about. It shows you care and that you are thinking about her when she is not around. Go for it, she should love it.
That would depend on what the info was, and you did not say!
take it from a girl, if we call you when we're upset, we basically trust you with our souls. she obviously trusts you. but you should probably keep things plutonic for now. the whole cross-country relationship thing usually doesnt work.
Most girls are going to expect you to spend some time with them. Its unlikely that they are just going to come knocking on your door looking for you. If you are really serious about finding a girlfriend you're going to have to invest some time and actually date. You could try online like Yahoo Personals or meeting people out and about. If you really can't invest the time then just get yourself a prostitute.

"One of my professors in college stated to me:""if you want to see a change in others...you might start with yourself""\n\nDon't REACT to situations(unless you have to run for your life, etc), but think first. \n\nMaybe ask him why he does not respect what you are watching(but DON'T raise your voice), ask him softly(like a woman). Tell him you want a better relationship with the only father you have, and ask him also what does he think that could be done to bring you closer. Maybe include your mother in on this. Sometimes it is the child who becomes the teacher. Start somewhere with small bites...try to make a joke when adversity strikes, or even smile. It disarms the other person, and calms the situation."
Before giving out your number you need to find out if a guy is taken.

If you think it's time to leave, and you're ready, then It's probably best to break up. But do it nicely. Believe me, Breaking up can be very painful for the other person, and if you wanna remain friends, be nice about it.

Sleazy ought to respect women more if he doesn't want them to get offended. It's very simple. If you absolutely must give a woman money for something, let it be her dinner. (Even though I can't stand it when guys do that.)
not always
I do not know!!!!!!!! For the first time ever I met a man who is just like yours he loves to look at them touch them I guess it is just a personal fetish on their part, like feet turn some men on, but it is weird I thought the whole breast was what was attractive to  them apparently some go for more detail, but now I kinda of like the speacil attn he pays to them now .... at least it is nothing negative just one more thing that makes you sexy :)
Well, i think she likes you ... because no girl will tell your cute after you told her that you had a crush on her... nor she will say your cute in front of your friends... She likes you but can't say anything because she has a boyfriend... so just give her some time... maybe she will give you some clues that she wants to be with you...

This is a hard situation on all accounts, and I know how you feel, because I was the one that initiated the divorce.\nYou are feeling like a failure that you gave up because you took the initiative in the breakup.\nYou feel stupid because you did not want to face the cause of the breakup until it happened, and you feel you have lost time.\nYou feel the hurt, because of the emotional investment that has been lost.\n\nBut, know this.  You know it was a horrible situation.  If there was ever a doubt in your mind regarding anything, you did the brave thing and took the initiative.  The pain is bad, yes, but remember, every rose has thorn, every joy of birth has it's pain of labor, every day off earned at work is sweat on your brown.\n\nThis, too, shall pass, but in the meantime, play the radio, crank it loud, and rent the goofiest guy-bashing movie you can find.\n\nGood luck!

What do you mean, first? We lie to women from day 1, right through to the day of the divorce/funeral. All you New Age twonks out there know I am telling the truth, and it doesn't matter if you don't want it to be true - we men lie to women all day, each day every day. We lie to you because we don't want you to know what we've been up to, of course, but a lot of the time we lie to you because that's what you want. You've decided what you want to hear and we just feed it out to you. We also lie to you with empty flattery because that's the best way of getting your knickers off. We lie to you a lot because it's the line of least resistance - it's easier to come up with some stupid line of bollocks than it is to get into an argument with you about trivia. We lie to you and we are going to keep on lying to you until the end of time. Take it or leave it.

Your husband has made a great step just in the fact that he has shared it with you.  Praise him for that.  He must cut all tires with this woman to protect your marriage. If you dangle your feet in the fire long enough, you will get burned.  A married person should never place them selves in a compromising position.  They should never be alone with the opposite sex if for no other reason than to protect their spouse from what other people might think. And there is always a danger especially for men when they are alone with a woman that has feelings for them.  When you got married you both made a commitment to each other and to God to be faithful and neither should ever do anything no matter how innocent to threaten your union to one another.  The only female he should have a genuine friendship with is YOU.
Perspective.  Women love to play the victim card.  Men just deal with stuff.
Are you a serial killer in mumbai.. \n\ncome and get me...
Seems like the first few answers don't have a clue what metro is!\n\nMetro men are guys who take care of themselves, take pride in looking and smelling good, and have decent manners.  Some other men could learn a lesson or two in this department.\n\nMy experience with metro men is that some of them are hetero (into women) and some homo (into guys),...... as long as he knows which he is, and is not still trying to make up his mind, why would I object to a nicely groomed guy with manners?
Youve stated already.. she has said 'no' on your visit! That should be enough, right there! \n\ntheres a reason why she is not wanting you to come. Have you thought about, this could possibly hurt her even more? She's needing to move on, her distance is part of her healing... let the poor girl go. Let her heal... You wont be helping her!! She needs this distance.......
I would just try to take it slowly and the time will come. I know that it is hard to do but you have to. Once, I asked if this boy liked me and he said no and the now he is flurting with me like all of the time during class! But I made a fool out of myself though. But see he didn't have a gf at the time so that is a totally different story. But do like I did, but make sure the gf doesn't find out or she will be pissed off!!!! LOL

You have to be very careful with long distance or online relationships especially being from two different countries.  If this man you say you love, asks you for any money, or asks you to let him borrow any money...dont do it!!  There are many people both men and women who meet on line from different countries.  They say they love you and would do anything for you, but when it comes to asking for money (what ever reason they give you), it is a scam.\n\nIf this person is a true person, I would suggest that when you have spring break from college, that you invite him to come and visit you.  You are in college so I know you cant afford to spend out extra money to travell to visit him.  This is one way you two can get to know eachother up front and in person.  \n\nPlease do not jump the gun on this one.  You need to make darn sure that this person you have a relationship is a real person.  You can get his name and address and do a search to make sure it checks out.  I would suggest you do a back ground check too.  \n\nI know because I was in a relationship online with a man from a different country for over a year.  I am a victum of being scammed.\n\nGood Luck and I hope this helps :-)

Get real. She just lets you win.
She's not your friend. You're hers.  The difference?  You are at her beck and call, and she could care less about you.  It doesn't even sound like an honest mistake.\n\nShe's not a very nice person and isn't giving you the respect you deserve.  I would suggest that you tell her how you feel.  It may sound aggressive, but your friendship is long gone.  So calmly tell her how you don't like that she doesn't help you, and see what her reaction is.  If she makes a change, she is a true friend.  If she doesn't, hang with nicer people.
get him something small yet nice like a cd  a movie, or something else he would like and have a friend give it to him for you . if you send it through the mail put your name on it for if  you do not he may not open it for now days it is not safe to open things without senders names
ok, if he's looking there has to be a reason. first off check your nose, if there are no boogies, then assume he thinks you are nice to look at. Once that is confirmed, you must get over your shyness. shy is cute but not when it's paralyizing. be coy and be sweet but don't be a stone wall. strike up a conversation with him. when you catch him eye-balling you, ask him what he's looking at. this does two things, one, it puts you in a position of control, two, he has to answer. even if he says he's looking at nothing you can run with it.

I agree with Jen U. And I am sorry, but open marriages is a contradiction in terms, If you want to bang wahtever comes along, stay single. Marriage is aboiut a committed relationship to one person. If you can't hack it get out.... but really, this isn't what you want anyway. It's what he wants and you just gave up and let him do it. \n\nYour children may need thier daddy, but they also need thier mom to be a strong role model, not a door mat. Find your backbone, get a good lawyer and get a divorce. When you are ready, you'll find someone who apreciates you. Be strong. Good luck.

For an interdependent life and spread the family by procreation. It is for fulfillment of life. It is the last experience that a human being learns through his/her own perceptions and judgments as to what the Truth is in life.

I truly believe that you must sit down with your father one-on-one and have a heart-to-heart conversation with him. To do this without making him feel defensive, I would suggest that you ask your dad to try to understand that what you need to discuss with him isn't easy for you and hope that he keeps in mind that you only want what is best for your daughter and for him as well.\n\nIf he has the love for his granddaughter that most grandparents do for their grandchildren, then you might want to focus the conversation on her and her emotional well-being. Express to him the negative and life-long challenges that result from the decisions he has made and continues to make. Perhaps it is best to address the fact that he has put aside any self respect and self worth by deciding to marry a woman that obviously has deep emotional issues that aren't healthy for him, his granddaughter, or anyone else in the family for that matter. Ask him to give these points some serious thought.\n\nThere are several books that can help your dad sort through his emotions, while also helping him to recognize the destructive path he is heading toward if he doesn't do something to take responsibility for his life and his pain.\n\nI hope this was helpful, I pray that all works out for you and your family. If things do not change or get worse... I also believe that it is crucial that you establish a very open and honest relationship with you daughter and that you use the situations that come about to help your daughter feel secure within herself and to help her understand that life isn't always easy and sometimes our lives are turned upside down for many reasons. Unconditional love from mom and dad, while guiding her through life's lessons to always take life's challenges and chose to learn from them and to help others do the same along the way would be my message to my kids.\n\nThe Four Agreements is an excellent book to help with an overall personal fulfillment/development guide. It sometimes can be repetitive and might seem strange in the beginning but it you ask that your dad and your daughter (even yourself) to make a commitment to read the entire book, I think you will all come away with a much more positive outlook on life and love.\n\nMy son would also like to suggest that you remind your daughter that her grandma is always looking down on her from heaven and will always be with her. I think that this was such a great suggestion as I remember when I lost my grandma when I was 6 years old... knowing that she was always there made me feel as though I could get through anything and I never felt alone.
we got to be mean sometimes,he wont leave you alone unless your mean to him, think about if your nice and still talk to him as a friend he still gna bug i had it happen to me and he ant around no more.
yeah,  he is probably gay and just doesn't realize it.  Or he doesn't  want to accept it.

Well, there is a huge difference.  Love for someone is when you respect them, want the best for them, want them in your life, care for them, worry about them, miss them when they're gone, etc.  You can feel those things for anyone, your sisters, your children, your friends, even your pet.  \n\nLust is a strong physical attraction, a craving for someone if you will,  that is hard to control, trust me, lol. \n\nIt is difficult to say which comes.  I think it depends on the situation.  If you're friends with someone and then become attracted to them then it is obvious that love would come first.  It varies certainly.

"Marriage has always been defined as the union between one man and one woman.  Homosexuals who love each other want the same status and standing as heterosexuals.  One of the chief concerns is, if we change the definition of marriage to include same sex couples, then it will also be expanded to include other unions such as:  multiple partners, adults and children, adults and animals, and whatever can be imagined by human beings.  \n\nIt has been suggested that same sex couples be provided the same rights that marriage allows, but it is most often stated in the media that same sex couples not only want the same rights, they want the same standing or respect.  They too want to be called ""married"".  \n\nMany heterosexual couples are troubled by this demand because they believe marriage is a sacred trust and gift from God. They believe that marriage was instituted by God in Genesis and that God will return for his spiritual Bride in Revelation 21.  Those who are opposed to homosexual marriage would state that marriage was created by God to support the family; one man, one woman and children.  They would also state that the heterosexual family is and has been the foundation of society and culture for thousands of years.  \n\nThere are of couse exceptions in history and even presently.  There is also currently a high divorce rate but married heterosexuals would argue that failure in marriage does not justify changing the definition of what marriage is....one man and one woman.  Society often makes moral changes without considering the consequences or justifying the decision by stating what is wrong with the present model.  Abortion started this way, with the declaration that women's lives were in danger and women were killing themselves by attempting abortions at home or in back alleys under the care of unscrupulous doctors.  Abortion has now become a form of birth control with well over one million babies aborted yearly in the U.S. alone.  \n\nMany heterosexual couples see the changing of marriage to include same sex couples as fallling further and further away from what is healthy for society and farther down the road toward a loss of morality and moral standards.  They do not want marriage, which they consider sacred, changed to include other unions.  They would prefer,if same sex couples are permitted to be ""married""  that same sex couples be granted the same rights but not the same name.  A different name such as ""union"" or the invention of a completely new word."

OK, her timing was not good, but if she did not mean it with respect to you, let it go.
It depends on the circumstances of when she pronounced that sentence.  It could be your death sentence.  She could have expressed her deepest inner desires.  Are you a wealthy guy and she is your sole heir or do you have a good insurance policy?  She probably hates your guts and you've never noticed it. SO, BEWARE OF THE MAD WOMAN!
"Ouch... if I were you I would definitely ask about it... just kind of lean ito it with questions like, ""why were you outside talking on the phone?"" ""who were you talking to earlier?"" Or go straight out and ask him who he is going to lunch with next saturday and when he is   at lunch give him a small phone call. You have every right to be concerned I know I would be. Normally when a girl becomes suspicious of her boyfriend she is usually about 60-80% right about what's going on so definitely ask him about it before you drive yourself crazy. Leave him if he is keeping into too much touch with his ex. It'll become a lot of trouble in the end. Good Luck."

"it's not common anymore - but in England, it used to be a tradition to have young boys and/or girls ""carry"" the train in formal weddings. This was generally because they were so long (think Princess Di). \n\nThey could be called page boys, bridal attendants, flower girls, etc. I did attend one wedding were this was done, and the wedidng had an angel theme, so the girls were called Angel Attendants and each wore a small pair of white angel wings."
practice practice practice. \nheres a rundown, buy a bqt of roses, babies breath, greens, and floral tape (stem tape). \nstart with one rose in your hand, surround it with babies breath, surround with four more roses, andd more babies breath, keep adding in roses and babies breath, make it round and even, with even amounts of babies breath between the roses and on each side. surround with greens. use the stem tape to wrap the stems, starting at the top and go about half way down (you kind of have to pull the tape as you wrap it, it makes it stick together) cover the tape wioth pretty ribbon, secure it with straight pins\nand practice this till you like the look

If this lady wants to meet you in the hope of joining your family then you need to see of you are sexually compitable. If you don't have sex with her at the weekend & decide to wait until she moves in & then find out both of you have different sexual tastes then it could lead in heartbreak & relationship difficulties.\nSo yes I think you should have sex with her because you both need to find out whether the relationship will work.
They can all be very hot - it depends on what is going on between the ears more than it does on what's below them.  However, if pushed for an answer, I'd prefer the athletic toned girl without curves - fit is sexy.

I guess the one thing that comes to mind is when I was doing some work for an elderly lady (no kin to me). I was repairing her bathroom and to do the job properly, I had to buy materials that were not in my budget. I had to sacrifice my time and materials that I would have spent on my house (it needs repairs too) so that the little lady could have a nice bathroom without worrying about it leaking, etc.. Of course, the hug that I got for doing the work and the God given heartwarming that I experienced made it feel like there was really no sacrifice at all. I try to help others all of the time, but I get as much blessing out of it as compared to the relative sacrifice. The little lady never knew that I had to purchase additional materials because she had given me the money (collected at her church) to do the work. Anyway, I guess I'll keep on doing what I need to do as God directs me.
You have to go into this new relationship with all of yourself. If you can't do that it's just not fair to the other person.

First of all, do you like any of them. If you do then it might be problematic if the 4 of you dont sit down and discuss whats up. If you dont like them then at some point you will have to tell them how you feel. They certainly have made it obvious to you how they feel. The more important issue is to keep the friendship first; That is what all 4 of you need to look at. Sit down and make sure that the 4 of you understand that at the end of the day you want to be each others best friend. Now there is no guarantee that can happen. What can be said is that by talking it out you know how everyone feels about the situation.

You know you love someone when all you think about his that one person when you get butterflies just wondering what they are doing about. you cant stop talking about them or you just randomly start smiling when you see something that reminds you of her. annd when you guys just sit and talk like nothing in the world matters or no conversation shouldnt be reached. \n\nThere really isnt any advice on how to love someone just make sure that you give that person or tell that person everything you want for them. Be careful not to scare them away but just tend to her when she needs you and be a friend. Listen to her and im sure it will all play out then.
hmmm do you mean forced and arranged?\n\na forced marriage is one where the bride and/or groom have absolutely no choice to whether they want to go ahead with the marriage or not.\nbasically, the bride or grooms family tell them that they're going to get married to each other and they have no choice in it.\nif they disagree, some families go as far as threatening to banish them from their family or kill them.\n\nan arranged marriage is one where say the brides family choose a husband for the bride as they see suitable. The bride can disagree if she wishes, she doesn't need to go ahead with it if she doesn't want to.
no chance in hell brother...you need to be more mature than that
If you are not ready there is nothin wrong with that. The first kiss should be special and if your not ready it wont be special. Others may be kissing already but half of them proubly gave in to pear preasure becuase they figured everyone else was doing it. Dont be afraid to stand your ground. Always listen to your heart. If you do it just to make him happy he will think that anything he wants he will eventually be able to make you give in and thats not the kind of girl you want to be. Be proud of yourself for standing your ground.
awww sara your picture looks so sad and yet so in love.. i dated a guy for four years also and when i kinda got tired with the sex he went to the internet behind my back and was looking at some of the weirdest things and it turned me off so i broke up with him cause it made me not sexually attracted to him anymore.. but to your situation now.. i dont' think asking him would help cause he probably wouldn't tell you.. so maybe you can do a little spying.. ask a friend to use their car while they use yours.. ask someone to go in places that he might be..  i would so go do spytactics' for you if i lived out by you.. not saying i don't live by you, but i'm just assuming that you don't live in indiana.. i would just keep my eyes open for more things that might be hard evidence to comfront him, other then that i would just say spy.. see if his sex last longer then normal on nights he stays out or disappears.. good luck girl i wish nothing but the best for you...
You silly man, you know you're just putting us on! And to you and others here, will you please spell the word correctly! It's clothes!!!
dump him!!!!!!!!! dont settle for less!!!!!! with guys what u see is what u get and if u dont like his immaturity chances are SLIM that he will change it..have u brought it up to him? maybe discuss with him about how his immaturity makes u feel and if he you dont see any changes at all..not even small ones..dump this guy ...

"Dean, to help move this relationship along, as someone has pointed out, just take one step at a time.  You will have to determine, before you proceed, if she ""digs"" you.  She doesn't necessary have to have the ""love"" feeling for you yet but she should like you enough to help work the relationship into the ""love"" stage.\n\nOne way to find out is to communicate with her on a regular basis.  Do you guys have anything in common that will make a first date?  Is there an interest in something that you can share to bring you two to learn about the other - to see if there is a ""fit"" so to speak?\n\nOnce you've determined that you are both on the same path (don't assume - find out; if she likes you, she won't keep it a secret), you can start dating her.  You should definitely hold onto telling her you love her until you feel it is right.  You will know when the moment is right because you will know that she feels the same way or is close to it.  \n\nSo, find out more about her, her likes, her dislikes and find a way to see if her behavior dictates that she has a fancy for you.  Then you can go to the next level: dating her.  \n\nRemember, take your time and don't ""push"" it.  If she likes you, you'll know sooner or later and you won't have wonder what to do next.\n\nGood luck!"

You marry a woman because you love her and want to spend your life with her in a loving, nurturing relationship.\n     Love transcends religion because love supercedes the ""do's and don'ts"" of religion.  This is because love is a spiritual ""element"" and is out-going in its expression to your wife, in this case.  Love is patient - merciful - kind  - is not jealous - doesn't boast  nor is proud or rude - love doesn't tally up ""wrongs"" done against us - love sticks around when everything has run away.  Strict rules are not love but strict rules !  The ideal is to have people want to do things that are right because he or she wants to ... not because he or she HAS to !  This is what I think ."
"Well Smooooooooth (why exactly are you using that name and then bashing your wife publicly...I don't know that I would consider that particularly ""Smooth"") - looks like she's frustrated, and if I were you, I would concentrate on doing those little things she's been askin' you to do. \n\nRemember the one most important rule of a happy marriage:  A happy wife equals a happy life!\n\nMost likely she's not asking for much, but it's just enough to inconvenience you - so you ignore it, and put it off until you just can't avoid it anymore.  That in turn pisses her off and causes a crappy attitude.  It's called give and take.  If she does things for you - you should be doing things for her.\n\nDon't ignore her or try to beat her down- maybe you should listen to why she's so angry.  Maybe you can find a way to HELP her - not ""Shut her up!""\n\nShame on you - stop being to selfish!"
Its sad to me that there are so many selfish people out there thinking that having a child is the answer to fixing there lagging relationship.... She is already selfish thinking only of her self, not the poor innocent baby, not caring about the guy who is clueless to her sheaming, and not caring about the consequences of him as well. WOW.. Tell your friend to get her head out of her ass, get a little dignity and respect for herself before she tries to provide that to a child.....Tell HIM NOW!!!
he should make the first move definatley!!\nif he likes you...you will catch him staring at you, cheeky smiles, trying to laugh with you, buying you drinks if your in a pub, if he opens up to you in conversations, pinching your bum is always an obvious one!!!
how is it better for her to stay with a guy who cheated and gave their child a disease? tell her!
Figure out why you like the other guy and then go through the pros and cons of what each guy has to offer and then choose from there.  Don't rush to break off things b/c a new guy comes along, make sure you truly want to break up this relationship that you have right now for someone you don't know and possibly end up unhappy. Just be careful and honest with yourself and your current boyfriend.
get off of yahoo answers RUN don't walk to the nearest phone and call her and ask her out on a date !
I suggest you put an ad in your local newspaper or penny saver, a Supermarket Bulletin board, or a Church events calendar. This way you can be assured if someone local cares for the kittens you'll get them back in 6 months. Also if you continue to advertise here your going to get more useless comments like the 2 above me that were clearly only posted so the participants could get the points. I hope I offered you some constructive advise. Good luck.

"It is a phrase that was very popular in the hippie cult days.  It was the implication of ownership with out a outward sign of the establishment sanctioned marriage or girl friend.  It was meant to be disrespect full of the social norms of the time, not of the individual in reference. It started out as a symbol of rebellion.\n\nIt has outlived its time.  I think it is disrespectful to the significant other.  I would much rather hear, ""This is the love of my life, the Joy of my soul, my safe harbor in the storm,""  Than ""This is my ol' lady"""
He could be autistic, and not know what it is like, find you attractive, and doesn't know how to handle relationships. I would say to tell him that he is making you uncomfortable, and if he doesn't stop that you will report it, and if he doesn't listen to you, tell someone like a teacher or counselor.

It means he has no boundaries and if you have any boundaries you need to make them clear to him.  If he has a problem with it, that's tough.  Wait for a guy who has a little self discipline who can love you without cheapening the moment.

Yes, I have, she was my best friend for many years, until I started making really good money she became unglued and I could see that underneath it all there was a world of envy and jealousy towards me and left her, when I bought a used luxury car she cursed at me and said, I'll never have anything else, blah, blah, blah, and she envied a lot of people, so I knew it was time to call it quits!\n\nThough I've missed her, I am better off without her, with friends like her who needs enemies, she also called me a b*** I did nothing to her. Just worked very hard, she said you'll never make it, and boy was she wrong and I'm so glad.
Wow that was beautifully romantic. I agree that's why we can't rush love and love is patient!

"My wife and I have been swinging for several years.  We've both had good sex with others and sex between us is great, too.\n\nAnyone who thinks they are the best they're partner has ever been with is fooling themselves.  Anyone who has been with more than two partners has had great sex with other people, too.  Some people mesh well and others don't.  Someone who rocks your world may do nothing for someone else.  The other wife may think your hubby is pretty dang good, too.  ;-)\n\nI know that there have been guys that have done certain things better than I, and I know that I do certain things better than them.  Also, there have been women that do certain things better than my wife.  The key here is that we can talk openly between us (my wife and I) that when this happens we can say something like ""I really liked this thing thing so-and-so did and here is how he/she did it.""  By doing this I have all the tools in my tool box PLUS his, now.  :-D  \n\nYou don't have to tell your hubby or the other folks that this guys is that good for you.  All you have to do is tell your hubby ""Hey, Bill did this thing I really liked, try doing it like this.""  Let him know he is getting it right.\n\nYou don't even have to tell him Bill did it better (if you think this would upset your hubby), but maybe take what Bill did and teach your hubby how to do it.  Kind of ""A little over here.""  ""Move your tongue like this"", etc.\n\nGood lovers are made, not born.\n\nDon't feel guilty for enjoying it.  That's the idea of swinging.  To enjoy it.  Besides, someone may come along that will rock your husband's world and he can return you the favor by teaching you what the other woman did that he liked so much."

I would just be honest in a situation such as you have decsribed; come to think of it I am always honest in every situation, to a fault sometimes.

If he doesnt even want to talk about marriage, then this should be a red flag to you that there is a real good chance this guy will never get married. True, men are afraid of committment, but come on at this age he should be able at least to talk about it. What does he thinks happens when people date for some time? Its time for your sake to have a very serious talk with him about your future together. Tell him your dreams and desires and see what happens. If he avoids the subject, then its probably time to look for more suitable marriage material, because this guy likes his single uncommitted life way too much and you two arent suitable for a long term serious relationship. Remember hes a big boy and he wont melt if youre direct with him. Good luck
u could go online to eharmony.com u could find a lot of girls that share common things with u and when its love its forever baby

You go into answers, then click on the 'vote' tab and then just read through the questions and answers. You then have to click on the option next to the answer you like that says 'vote as best answer'. You get one point every time that you vote. \n\nAnother way to do it is go into your answers, look for any answers that are in voting. Read through and find your answer, and click 'vote as best answer'. you will then earn one point, and give yourself a vote for best answer and you could get a further 10 points. \n\nI hope that this makes sense, I am not very good at explaining things.

If you're concerned about that, doesn't sound like things are quite over yet with your best guy friend.  As far as he's concerned.  You can keep things on the downlow, in reality, this new guy just asked you on a date...not like you're headed into another relationship.\n\nOr you can be upfront, but prepared for a little drama (since it sounds like you ended things pretty recently).\n\nIf things are over, things are over, but I do understand that you need to approach things with a little sensitivity.  I'd be upfront (assuming there is closure to the relationship, if not, close it).  If he's still reeling from your break up, you may need to duck out of his life for a little while (sucks, but it may be for the better).

"Since she is pregnant, she should consider counseling for she and her husband to discuss their relationship. If he is unwilling, or continues to use drugs, this is an unhealthy environment for their child. She could lose the house if he is caught with drugs in the house. She could even lose her child.\n\nAssure her that if she decides to get a divorce, she will not lose everything. I'm not sure what state she is in, but most laws say it must be split 50/50. The laws only count the actual length of the marriage. If she really wants to keep the house, it wouldn't be difficult to have a judge award her the house for she and the child, but she would need to ""buy him out"" by giving him half the value of the house, or other assets to equal it. It sounds like she has a supportive family, hopefully they can help her through this.\n\nI have a sister of a friend who's been through something similar. She divorced her husband because he used drugs, and pushed her while she was holding their baby. She had him sign off all parental rights to the child, so the child could not be used as leverage for money, etc., and also to ensure that he was in a safe environment. Her parents are the legal guardians if anything happens to her.\n\nIf your friend doesn't want him to get profits from the house out of spite, or because he didn't contribute to the upgrades, she will most likely have to accept it so she can move on with her life and find happiness for she and her baby.\n\nA good lawyer may be able to get her more, but she may have more trouble from her husband for custody, visitation, etc. If he is using drugs, he is unfit. If she believes he is, she should prove him unfit to protect her child.\n\nSorry such bad news, but I hope this helps. Best of luck to all of you."
then get one you dont like....either way your going to end up not liking each other anyways....\n\n\n.
Yes, I would stick up for my husband. This is the person who you love and cherish (or supposed to). I would expect the same from the husband too.

Of course there is a reason to be nice, some people are just made that way.  She does probably like you as a friend but sadly if you live that far apart I wouldn't expect anything to come of it.

You go into address book and click the box, then it will say delete address at the bottom, click delete.
I dont think a relationship can work if the girl wants to be with another person - and she obviously does want to be with her bf cos she's gone back to him. AND would you really want to be with someone who is telling you that she loves you when she has a boyfriend! how could you trust her - she could be telling some other guy she loves him when she's with you?!!??
I'd say move on..this person will not be able to commit to you.. if you want to try, take him out on a date and pay for everything.
I'm a big believer in having seperate savings and checking accounts in addition to a joint account.  I've been married for 21 years and most of our fights were about money.  We found very quickly that the best thing to do was put money for household expenses in a joint account, have individual accounts for expenses incurred on our own, and we would put some money in a joint savings account and some in a individual savings.  It sounds like we have a lot of money, we don't.  We learned to budget very carefully, use credit cards sparingly, and to remember that if one of us spent too much money, the pay-off came out of money that was our own and not to depend on each other to bail each other out.  We haven't had a money fight in a long time.  It sounds like your husband is on a power trip and you are there to serve him.  If you work, you have the absolute right to have your own accounts and to have your own money without having to demean yourself by asking to have money THAT YOU EARNED.  If his expenses are incurred by him, for him and had nothing to do with you, your family or your home, they are his and his alone.  Good luck, you are in a tough spot.

"-Perhaps a part of you belives it can still work. Before you were married  did he have this sort of beahavior? \n\n-The question I'm asking myself is, are these recent ambitions, the drugs, gaming and hollywood and lack of sensitivity to elements in your life? Or have the problems with drugs and everything occured before you were married? I\n\n-If they did occcur and he was doing drugs or gaming or had a hollywood ambition maybe these were problems that were not resolved before marriage and were swept under the rug, maybe he did do these things just not in 'full force' like they way he's doing now.  \n\n-Otherwise if these are all new.. what could be stemming this sort of behaviour? Drugs are often used for social reasons, for escapism, for fun, many reasons.\n\n-Now giving other women his number is a completly disrespectful to you.. Unfortunetly with that act alone if brings forth some reasons for his other actions:\n\n.. Basically it sounds like he's avoiding you with his friends, drugs(social/ escapism). With your medical problem he was completly avoiding the issue.. he doesn't want to 'get close to you' and deal with the seriousness of the issue. Along with going to the movies with his friends.. he new full well you wanted it to be 'you and him' alone.. \n\n-With him inviting friends sends a message that 'I don't want to be alone with you'. I want to bring my friends and make it a light hearted event..especially picking out the movie, changing plans by giving the impression "" oh movies with my friends you can come too if you want'.\n\n-He may very well know his relationship is on rocky grounds.. from the escapism with his friends and drugs and with the unfufilled hollywood ambition.. He is living in a fantasy world right now, by running and 'not facing life'- by confronting you with what is bothering him and (frankly communicating would be good), and not persuing his hollywood ambition.\n\nI know I analyzed, his behaviour cause I'm trying to understand him and why..\n\n-Good news- He may himslef 'know' his actions are less then admirable..he's not dumb to his behaviour and may have his own persoanl reasons for his actions.. What you guys need to do is..\n\n--> You need a third party mediatior(counceling even). Judging by his behaviour this may be difficult to sit that boy down.. though.\n\n-The reason why I suggest 3rd party is because with previous attempts I've read, he doesn't listen to you and doesn't respect you.'The third party needs to open that boy up-and get him to explain whats going on, in a non critical non bias way.\n\n-Do your own resarch book an appointment with a local 'pastor' which is usually cheaper..( I know myslef I'm happlily married and I have have had premarriage counceling.. from the pastor who married us.. I know that if I ever need a mediator he's a call away). Book the appointement with a councelor.. \n\n-I've tried in a previous relationship to get my guy in to see a coucelor. he will run and hide and find every good excuse in the book.. speak with the councelor as to how to get him in.. frankly I wasn't sucessful with my previous relationship.. But in the end do you really want to be with someone who doesn't care about your relationship to begin with.. try what you can do.. but he may have already severed the ties already..be strong and prepare yourself for whatever outcome.\n\n-Frankly I despise divorce.. but if he has already cheated on you..(giving out numbers what acts might have already happend I'm sorry to say).. then forgiive and forget and move on..you need to be in a healthy relationship. Unless he turns around and make a 'u turn' in the way he acts."
i think ur letters are kool...lol.. but yea u culd be in love cuz im ur age and i swear im in love too but u know it could be just puppy love but if u truly think that its love and u understand what love means then you really are in love!
If he is annoying you when you have other girls over, have one girl take his hands, and another girl, take his feet and then carry him up to your room and give him a makeover. When you give him a makeover, put girls clothes on him and put some makeup on him. \n\nor \n\ntickle him to the point where he has to go to the bathroom and then have two girls carry him to the bathroom and close the door on him. It will make him stink?
true.  first time there's not much in it for the girl.  the guy gets done too quickly, and there's not much lubrication which means a lot of pain and just overall horridness.
Honey - if I was your wife, I wouldn't want you back after pregnancy .... actually you could leave now.  Hope girlfriend is willing to take in a low-bellied, shallow dog.  \n\nSeems appearances are far too high on your shallow list of standards.
whoa....what is going on.....you broke up with the boyfriend because of something stupid someone said about you and then ended up with another guy right away??  no wonder you are confused....what you did was wrong...at least give youself some time between boyfriends or lovers to sort out your head.  anyway.....i think you should dump both guys and start over....but think about what you are doing before you start your search for a new boyfriend....
some boys are like this but they would do anything with that special girl, this meaning you....you should try to look into some things that he might like, but dont chance to much because this might cause you to loose some friends
This brought tears to my eyes.  No you're definately not obsessive.  You're definately in love.  The kind of love that most people only dream about or see in movies!!!!  This is a tough one to answer or to give advice.  But this is my advice.  Take one day at a time, don't give up on her ever.  Always be there for her through these hard times.  15 is kind of young to marry.  I don't know how old you are.  But you could get engaged to her.  Just appreciate ever moment you have with her.  And if something does happen to her, and I pray for both of you it doesn't.  You then have truly loved and not really lost her because she'll always be in your heart.  It's not like a breakup with someone.  You wouldn't have been able to help the parting of the two of you.  Just pray to God which I'm sure you do everyday that she gets better.  In the mean time just enjoy every moment with her.  And if anything did happen you will find the strength through God to go on.  You seem religious he'll help you through.  And believe it or not a guy like you would find love again someday.  I know you don't want to hear this but I'm just saying if it happened you won't blow away!!!!  I'll pray for both of you and God bless you both hon!!!!!!
If he had a court order to pay support he still owes it to you. It's going to be very hard for him to get support from him. You have to make A LOT more money than he does for that to happen. I would get an attorney.. and discuss it with him.. The support covers the expenses that were involved when you had custody. I would not give him child support...let him know how it feels. If you go to court, more than likely the judge if he wants you to pay (and that's doubtful) will offset your support with what he owes you..Which means if you are ordered to pay 1,000.00 per month, you would not owe for 10 months..However, talking to an attorney would be your best bet...HE STILL owes you back support and unless you are making more than him, chances are he won't get support. Good luck
"I think a lot of teens feel pain due to lack of a father.  I think a lot of them don't even know what is missing.  But a father is very important.  \nI know one boy who had a lot of trouble and was in Juvenal Hall and drug rehab.  He was telling me one time about the ""weird"" thing the therapists were saying in group therapy.  They were saying that a lot of the boys' problems were related to their fathers.  He said to me, ""How can my father have anything to do with my problems, when I hardly ever see him?""  His mother also thought this was a ""weird"" idea.  I said that it was the fact that his father wasn't involved in his life, but spent most of his time drunk instead, that the therapists thought was harming the son.  Not to mention the abusive stepfather.  The boy and his mom just couldn't see that this was a problem.\nI agree that some kids handle the situation better than others, and so do some mothers.\nMy own daughter was raised without a father, and I think this had a negative effect on her despite the best I could do for her.  I think she was always looking for male affection, and would do anything for a guy.  Anything.  I feel so sad that she feels there is only one way to get a man's love.  By the way, she did pretty well until she was fifteen also.  \nBut like you said, everybody's different.  \nThe sister of the boy I mentioned, same mother and father, had her problems but determined to have a better life.  She's in the Navy now and has a nice boyfriend.  She's a very responsible person."

After two years I would say anytime. But make sure it is in a public place or with friends or family. In this world you can never play it too safe. He will be fine with that I am sure.\n\nAnd I know your frustration. I met my current wife on-line. However we were much closer to each other......both in th U.S. and only 350 miles apart...so could get together over a weekend.\n\nIn your case it is much more difficult. Have you really worked out how you may eventually get together. I hope you have as you then have something to look forward to.
Yes of course you should go see the new baby, if she is really a  friend she will understand about your finances. Friendship is not about what or how much money you do or do not have. Have you thought about making a present or card something that comes from the heart will have much more positive energy.
talk to her know her before u ask her out or she'll reject u only if she'll be comfortable with u. I know its hard but if u want to go out with her then just know her a little and let her know u. Good luck
Opposites attact, correct, but there are plenty other factors in the mix. i.e. how you act around him\nhow you talk to him\nhow you treat him AND OTHERS\nhow you carry yourself\nhow you treat and take care of yourself\n70% of human communication is non-verbal\n\nall these and more is what he see first of all.\nIf you act the way he likes, you don't even have to say anything and he'll feel attraction towards you. Now when the conversation begins between you two, it's up to you to keep your relationship going. A good relationship takes to people to work togethr towards the same goal.
You'll never find love if you keep looking for it ...
special in what way?
I guess your not going shopping then...If you have a computer, shop online....No driving, no crowds and no one will attack you...
It all depends sometimes the girl wants it to end fast like if I am really not in the mood or not feeling well , tired.  Your first time should be fast its hard not to for men. Also its OK to end fast as long as you can go for a second in maybe 15 Min's later that's what I do. \n\nStart with quick foreplay let the guy get off.  Then when hes ready for part two take it slower because you will last much longer.  The more often you do it and the more times you do it you will learn to last longer and longer.\n\nDo not fight nature. Monkeys and apes last about 9 seconds so if a girl says anything bad about you throw that at her.  To bad I cannot use that line.
you could do an 80s party because that'd be pretty sweet\nor a dinosaur party or something like that. something that'd have cool decorations and be retro.
Keep a secret from now on. Go to your friend Abigaile and explain to her you let the cat out of the bag and ask her forgiveness. \n\nThen tell you other friend other best friend Brenna your are very upset with her and you expect her to apologize to you and Abigaile.\n\nWhat is your interruption of BEST????????????? to me it means exactly what in implies. The one that means most, the one you trust, the one you can confide in and also the one you like most over all others. There can be only one Best.
What details in particular?   (this is a serious answer)
Coz love is the best and worst feeling all at the same time!
Not necessarily a red flag, some men like it. But it is up to you to decide whether you would like it, or even like to try it. \nHow well do you know the guy? I mean, if you are getting serious you would want to know if you want anal sex or not, as he seems to enjoy it.
Great...

"My responce to girls who did this to me when I was younger was to make sure I was the better person.  I might say a thing or two to a friend standing next to me, like the girl wasn't there, ""Gosh have you ever seen anyone so DESPARATE to prove how jealous they are of me?  I must be better then them if they are that jealous!"" and walk away.  Do not look at her, do not confront her.  Just say it close enough she can hear it and walk away.  I also found it best to not let them get under my skin.  If someone you do not like is trying to make your life miserable, busy yourself with other things and NEVER let yourself be pulled into talking about them.  If you really would like to end this, try walking up to her, when none of her friends are around, and yours are, but out of their hearing distance and say something like ""look, I know we have had some differences in the past, but I think we are more grown up now, maybe we should try and get along, since we seem to have things in common (mention friends, clothes, whatever you might have in common) so lets try and be friends instead.  What do you think?""  If she disses you, just say ""well I tried to be friends with you, but if you don't wnat that at least I know I am the better person""  Walk away.  You'll know you tried to be the grownup, and she will always know she missed an opportunity to have a new friend, instead of an enemy who knows her for the petty, selfish girl she really is."
If your young, you have life choices and I think its time for you too move on and make some new ones. If you have been around the bin a couple of times and your well into your late 30's then you have to re-evaluate the problem, Is he worth working with to get him together or will he be a complete waste of time because time is not on your side. So it depends but it sounds like your young, so I think in order to find the men out there that are marriage material you have to go through all the motions over a period of more then 2yrs and less then 5yrs. They include, sex, living with him, dealing with inlaws and his siblings and his friends and ex's. If all that works out in his favor and yours, he's marrying material, if it doesn't in that time frame, then good riddens and move on. Good Luck young sista in training.
As much as I like to think the best in everyone, I believe that this guy is just playing you, never push a relationship, if it doesn't make you happy than don't EVER think of going back to it...(look at my name) 2+2 = 4, it like the outcome of this relationship, willl never change.
I would rather do a fun activity than eat in a restaurant. For example, play miniature golf, go parasailing, ride a roller coaster, something like that. When you share experiences -- especially ones with an element of fear, like parasailing and roller coasters -- you make a deeper connection and are less stiff and nervous. You can get to know each other better more quickly.\n\nIf you want to eat afterward, probably somewhere a little nicer than usual. But it's probably better to cut the date short and leave her wanting more!
it's not some think i would do, but if that's what he likes and your happy to do it then that's up to you. I'm pretty lucky because my partner and i are into the same things in the bedroom dept.

No it isn't bad at all.  And quite normal.
Depends on the religion, depends on if the couple has written their own vows,
Don't. Dreams are where you work out internal struggles and unwanted emotions. If he is boinking her in his dreams and you while he's awake, you're fine. The fact that he told you about it should go to say something about his character. If he was going to dump you so he could go back and have a fling with her, he wouldn't tell you about the dream. \n\nHowever, if he is trying to destroy you emotionally so he can make you feel so insecure that you will do anything for him then maybe he's telling you for a different reason. It all depends on what kind of a guy he is, and you will know that better than any of us ever could. \n\nWhen you post a question like this you have to take these answers with a grain of salt. I mean you got a guy up there telling you he's cheating and then advertising a dating website, can you see that dichotomy? \n\nTrust your instincts. If you are insecure about it, why is that? Is it because you don't want him to dream about certain things. Well that's just silly, you aren't going to be able to control his dreams, as a matter of fact, HE can't even do that! If you are insecure because you don't feel like you can match up to his dreams then you either have a low self esteem or he has some really, really wild dreams.\n\nYour insecurity must have been present long before you started dating this guy, that's evident in your inability to create a unique username...HollyBarry08. This is just a guy and that chick was just his ex. These relationships exist between every single person on earth. Before you can move forward with a relationship you have to leave the past behind you.
It sounds to me like yes,he dose like you as more then friends and he HAS liked you for a long time-if u were close friends in college n when u found e/other again he wanted to hook up with you that definitly means more then a friend....if he didn't want to date u he would not have wanted to meet up with you-i don't think this has anything to do with the job i think he really loves u when he says he dose-so take him seriously.Thats great u will be working together it will grow the bonds between you two even stronger.\nI hope it all works out for ya!\ntake care\n~Ally

"That all depends on what part of Healthcare management you'll be going for.  Alot of websites say what the average that someone makes in a certain field, but do more research and compare how long it will take you to pay back your loans.\n\nTry looking on http://www.craigslist.com  under the jobs section, and type in the specific job you'll be applying for after college, make sure to check out what type of schooling they desire to be an applicant.  In the healthcare field, stay away from the ""assistant"" jobs, if you look around, they go through the same time amount of school as more specific programs, and get paid less than half. \n\nExample, look up ""Medical Assistant"" vs. ""RN"" and also ""Dental Assistant"" vs. ""Dental Hygienist""\n\nIf you're already married, i'd definatly recommend going for a specific program like DHY, or RN.  You'll make more money, in the same amount of time."
I think both are important ... it's important that you are attracted to his personality, but there also needs to be some kind of physical attraction otherwise the relationship is not going to move forward very well.
smile more. That all it takes.

Off course not cutey
Is there a serious possibility of running the company together? A valid question...you need to have a straightforward talk about how you both feel. Is this going to turn into something serious? Good Luck
I'm going to co-sign on you girl. I feel the same way! I just think its awesome u'd get on here and say that, I think that's just the kind of support and encouragement they need from us. Love.
So you know this is comeing from a 22 year old girl. and the best thing i can tell you is find out something she really likes if you dont already know and get that for her. or get her something that means something to the both of you. Like something from when you frist met  or something from a place that the 2 of you went to and get something from there...or just go to a mall and hang out and see what she sees that she really likes...
Tell her how u feel.
wild bills on sunday,mall,
invite who?
I have a similar situation.  My ex agrees that our son has attention problems but doesn't agree he should be medicated.  You have several options, one have your ex meet with your child's teachers and have him go along to the next Doctor appointment.  That is what I did.  My ex wanted to feel like he was being heard and that his opinion mattered.  \n\nSecond, you could take your child to a different doctor for a second opinion, one of your ex choosing and get the diagnosis confirmed.\n\nThird, ignore the ex.  Most kids don't take ADD meds on weekends anyways.  Just make sure he has it for school and that your ex knows he takes it on school days.\n\nGood Luck
You are 100% normal and (I presume) rather young.  This being the case, and you may not like my answer, forget him and move on!\n\n1.  You will have many more folk in your life that you will feelings for.\n\n2.  He's a Dweeb for not respecting YOUR feelings.  You don't need someone like this in your life!\n\n3.  While he is likely living some difficult moments due to the anniversary of his dad's death, he should still have told you outright that; the timing is bad; He's not interested; He's gay!  Whatever the reason.\n\nIMHO - You lucked out this time and maybe your gardian angel is keeping watch over you.\n\nRegards and Good Luck with Your Life!\n\nThe Ol' Sasquatch Ü
Leave both of them alone.  Let them grow up first. I wouldn't answer the phone if it is restricted.  She is only feeding off of you every time you answer.

I felt exactly as you do prior to leaving my husband.  I cared for him, but was not deep in love with him any longer due to the trouble in our marriage for such a long time that didn't seem to be changing.  He resented me terribly for leaving and then just continues to try to punish me through the kids.  But I've never been happier outside of the deceitful, devious things my ex does, to be apart from him.  I have dated since my marriage ended and am not dating currently and again I have never been happier.  My point... that you don't have to be with someone to be happy.  I understand how you feel when you say it bothers you to see her cry, but if you are not going to be able to reciprocate the love she has for you, better to let her go and find someone that will.  Her crying and pain will eventually stop.  If you have kids, think about them if you decide to split.  Do not use them as pawns to get to your spouse.  If they do, know there is nothing you can do, but to tell your kids the truth, depending on the age, and continue to let them know you love them.  In the long run they will know the truth.  My children are starting to move away from their father as when they go to visit him, he constantly says bad things about me.  I do not talk of him.  And hey he is the one with the live in girlfriend.  Ironic don't you think.  In that he is with someone, I don't care, and he is the one that pushes the kids away because he can't stop saying nasty things about me.  Good Luck to you in whatever you decide to do, it may take time, but everything will be ok.

Black people talk about us people being racists because they use that as an excuse not to move up in life, if you notice, a lot of them do not have an education, and they are part of gangs and stuff, and they have nothing good to offer to society, and that's the truth, there are counted black people who are doing something positive towards society and the world, but even some of them have done something negative in their past. They spend more time talking about others being racist against them, but instead of talking, they should be in a class room, learning history, and getting and education.

You need to quit giving him anything.  He doesn't deserve your heart.  You need to feel like the queen of the world if you are carrying his unborn child.  He should have the deepest kind of love and respect for you.  If he wants to cheat on you, go to your family and friends for help and support.  You do not need the stress and heartache in your condition.  I wish you and your baby all the best in life.  You will find someone who will be a real man to you.
If you really like the guy, and feel you a had a connection worth taking further, then you need to go there and talk to him in person - these types of conversations are never well suited to phone-calls or emails.\n\nKeep in mind that a three-way deal such as this can be tricky at times, and Brian probably feels caught in the middle - possibly even feels a little guilty for getting so close to his best mates ex. Just don't feel like it is something wrong with you - these are never easy situations. \n\nThe only thing you can do is talk to him face to face - if your friendship is worth anything to him, he'll open up and talk top you about how he is feeling. If he doesn't then simply chalk it up to experience and move forward.\n\nJust don't let this stop you from being true to yourself or allow it to close over your heart - then you really have lost something precious.\n\n*EDIT* - scandalous my butt! That's just worrying about what other people think - the one thing which usually does more harm than good. Be true to YOURSELF not to what other people think you should be like
make him something...seriously sounds cheesy and whatever but for example a picture frame with all ur little sayings u have together and funny and cute pictures of the two of you in it...THE BEST. and he will keep it forever. for a guy who has everything.

How much should you pay for a car?\n\nHow much experience?  What is the market?  What is the competition?  Film or digital?  Med format or 35mm?   Prints?  Full resolution files?   Extensive retouching?  Albums?   How many?  What size?   DVD?  Slide shows?  Coffee table books?\nAll of the above?\n\nExpect to pay anywhere from $400 to $25,000.

Both my son and my daughter look just like their dad.  I'm only here to change their diapers apparently :-)
Tough love may hurt you, but it'll certainly help your son.\nHats off to you.
well trying to make her jelous and acting like you are interested in a bunch of other girls is immature and mean.  If you truly love her, you won't do things like that.  Just keep going slow.  At least she has morals and isn't trying to sleep with you and marry you on  the first date.  Just keep talking to her, getting to know her, make her feel comfortable.  Ask her to study and have a nice picnic or nice dinner while you study.  Be romantic and take your time.  IF you love her she is worth it.  BUT quit acting immature and palying games.
It's possible. I'm dealing with it right now. Just reassure your husband that he's the one your with and there is nothing beyond a friendship with the other person. My guy had a problem with it in the beginning, but is fine with it now that he knows there is absolutely nothing to worry about.
pray.\nit always helps.\nyou really do love him.\nyou are able to forgive him\nfor his flaws his mistakes even though they hurt you deeply.\nit doesn't matter wat ur sister or ur mom thinks its wat you think.\nask ur self.\nwat do you want the most.\nand wat do you want right now.\nlove is confusing\n i don't even know about my situation.\nbut does he love you?\nits not you that has the problem its him\nis he willing to commit to you.\nyou've shown ur love. \nhis there to listen.. ppl make mistakes and thats a part oflife but...\nhe has to be willing to sacrifce his flaws and try to be better to you.oh and the virginity thing.\nyou'll know when the time is right.

He keeps going when things are bad, money is tight, and he doesn't remember why he married. Honors his commitment
Wake her up to breakfast in bed and a buch of flowers (simple breakfast is good - cereal and toast with fresh orange juice and tea/coffee) Then take a long bath or shower together, nothing needs to happen but just having that intimate time together can often bring you closer. Put some music on and talk. Have a nice relaxing day together. Followed by a meal out for tea, doesnt have to be expensive, but that way she doesnt have to cook, and you dont have to fret over trying to cook. And drinks in a quiet pub that you are both comfortable in. Taxi home of course and a snugle in bed to finish the day.
i'd wait if he's a good guy and i love him very much, i'm not GAY just for example. well just see how it goes and continue with your life, if you meet someone better follow your heart and see how it lead you, but you need to remember one thing, before you start a new relationship you need to cut the previous one or any promises with other guys else you might suffer and hurt someone accidentally

f*** her hard
"I do not know either of you personally, so please don't take this personally.  I speak to you as I would a family member and it is only my opinion.\n\nWhat you are describing sounds like a typical green card marriage.  It has all the symptoms, 10-15 year age difference between the parties, usually the party from another country wants to get married soon as possible.  There is also a requirement that in order to get your green card that the person brings back their bride or groom to their own countries embassy, therefore the ""Christmas family trip. \n\nWhat is particularly ugly about these situations is that many times the parents of the foreigner are complicit in the marriage scam and encourage their children to marry Americans so they can get the green card and find jobs.\n\nBut of course this is probably not your scenario.  I'm sure the person your marrying already has their green card.  If they don't, I would tell you if you were my family member to tell him, you love him but not interested in getting married any time soon.  If he really loves you and it's not green card game he will stick.\n\nIf it is green card game, he will do everything in his power to get you to marry him and make it your responsibility to get his green card.  It ain't.  They will eventually turn abusive and leave.\n\nthink...you have a good brain."
me too thank for 2 points
yup, most of them are true...but if a girl smiles at  you it doesnt necessary means she's interested in you, she might just be polite...also if she laugh at everything you say, even though it's not funny, hmmm, she might be a bit cuckoo..

"Is he in Arizona?\n\nUsually somebody has to be a resident.  If you move somewhere else, you're no longer a resident.\n\nAre there children involved or property?  \n\nYou need to ask an attorney.  I'm going to guess the answer will be ""no"", if neither of you are residents of the state.  However, I could be wrong."
for someone to do that to you why look for ways to earn his friendship back. you have been hurt. it is best if you move on in your life and find someone new that will love you for who you are . not what you are . take care

"Sexual relations decreasing after marriage has been the butt of all marriage jokes for decades.  The truth of the matter is, once you get married, you gain a handful of new responsibilities.  After kids, you get even more.  So eventually, when you're a family unit your responsibilities will override your sexual relationship.  Life gets busy.  And for women, between your son's football practice, and your daughter's ballet classes, and cleaning the house, doing the laundry, and preparing a meal for the family, we get tired.  When men often forget though, is it doesn't take much to get us in the mood.  \n\nBased on your question, I am going to presume that you are having this issue in your marriage.  We had it in ours as well.  When you and your wife turn in for the night, try offering to rub her back.  If you caress her a bit, and show her how much you appreciate what she does, she will warm up to you.  Women identify themselves with their family and home.  So after a long day of perfecting those two things, it can be emotionally tiring.  And emotional fatigue is a bigger factor in their sex drive, than physical fatigue is.  \n\nOh and by the way...I asked my husband your question, and his answer was ""yes""."
There should be compromise,and if you guys are thinking that the relationship could possibly be a marriage thing, think long and hard cause right now it seems as if you are on   a one way street to separation if the arguments dont stop and the understanding and listening dont kick in. But ask yourself this also, are you yourself being a good listener, non-confrontational, and reasonable in your answers and conversations with him. If you arent then you have found one problem and once you solve that  things will definitely be easier.
Yup!  Just wanted a piece from this girl in school.  5 years of dating and 27 years of faithfull marriage and we are still going strong.  The ZAP is... more like a zip!

When you realize that it's more than just having someone to cling too.  Or someone to have sex with.  You know, when you hurt when they hurt.  You are happy when they are happy.  They are your partner on a mental, physical, and spiritual level.  And you know that you would sacrifice everything you have for them without thinking about it.  That's when you know it's love.

You messed up but its not worth ending a 3 year relationship over.  Buy her something nice, explain to her what happened and how you feel.  If she can't accept it she is just being difficult and its not worth the effort.

You have parental responsibility until they reach the age of 18, but a child can give their own consent to treatment at the age of 16. Now if the child under 16 makes its own appointment because they did not want the parent involved I am sure that they would be seen but the GP should have a chaperone present...(a nurse) for their own protection and that of the child.\n\n\nAnything discussed between the child and GP alone is confidential, however I am sure that the GP would advise the child of the need for the parents involvement..but this will occur only upon the invitation of the child.\n\nOf course if however the GP feels that the child is at risk he would be obliged to contact Social Services.\n\nI am intrigued by this question...
No sweety, you are not over-reacting at all. We all do it. Just be more friendly to him. And show him ( don't tell him ) that you still like him. I know girls have ways of showing it. so use that girly magic. I hope he ends up to be the man of your dreams.\n\nGood luck!!!

its not wrong i mean if your comfortable with it..i guess\n\nyou should really see wut you want to do. who do you like better? \ngo with the one you like better
Emily, if you like Chase so much, go for him. Don't mind your friend, she's just jealous. Good luck, okay?
"How about this, I""ll shut my computer down for 1 day and you pick me as the best answer and I'll get back on in a day and tell you if I got it or not?  Deal?"
You are not doing anything wrong. It sounds to me as if your BF is a little jealous and upset because you are doing something with someone other then her. Don't let her get to you, just let her know that if she can not control herself and act like a BF and be supportive then you don't need her to be at your party. Not trying to be mean but the purpose of a party is to have fun and you can't do that if you are constantly defending yourself and your other friends to her.
Could be and yes people get reductions because their frame cannot support the weigh from their breasts. Go to the doc and ask about getting a reduction.\n-NmD!
I doubt I am on the nice list this year.\nI think I just got on the naughty list so I dont expect anything from him at all unless it is a lump of coal.
You need to stop dating for awhile.  Just tell guys that you're not dating right now and suggest to just be friends and hang out.\n\nLook at it this way.  If I jab you in the arm with a pencil, it would hurt but it wouldn't be horrible.  But if I jab you in the arm with a pencil into an open wound, then it would hurt 10 times worse.\n\nRight now your emotions are an open wound.  They need time to heal.  As long as guys keep poking your emotions, they will never heal up.  You need to stop dating, and enjoy life on your own while your emotions heal up.  You'll  know when the time is right to get back into the dating thing.  Until then, just say, 'Can we just hang out and be friends?'
look down at his pants lol that's a dead giveaway...
well you could talk to him and see what the real problem is. if it has anything to do with their relationship then you could try to work it out between them and if not then just tell them they weren't meant to be together. when my best friend and cousin were dating i was ok with it. we went to a camp-out with a bunch of different churches and they argued the whole time. an old friend of my friend was there and she spent a lot of time with him. my cousin got mad and said that she was cheating on him when she wasn't. i talked about it to both of them and found out that they weren't really happy with each other and they eventually broke-up.
how old r u
Sex, sports, cars, beer, sex, money, fishing, sex, beating up the boss, random statistics and sex.\n\nDid I mention sex?
Go to the toy store, buy a few *things, let him catch you, then he will get jealous, let him fuss (or drool excitedly as I would), but either way he will get the message. Or if you have a particular girl to spice things up (at least for yourself)...
It depends on the man! If he has always been there for u through thick and thin and never cheated on u or anything then maybe yeah!
For me fortunately I was given another chance for it and I am able to do what I have should have done years ago.  But I know that the road I did take was much harder that just trusting my instincts and intuition.  I am glad that I still have the chance but now I can help to think that where would I have been now if I did what I was supposed to do then.  Your question was pretty broad and I am not sure if this is something that you are personally going through now, but if you are I would say follow your heart and open yourself up to what you know what is right and trust what you be live.  I know people who have not had the chance to do the things they should have done when the they had the chance and they regret it for the rest of their lives.  You don't want to fall into that category. Try not to get stick singing a shoulda coulda woulda...
For starters, please use spell check so it's easier for people to read your problem in order to help you. \nIt sounds like you need to expand your circle of friends. Time changes things. Friends come and go. Your friends took in a new friend. You didn't say why you don't want to hang with this new kid but you probably have your reasons. Just the same, have you tried being friends with her too?\nDon't hold yourself down to just that one group of friends. If you feel like the fifth wheel in this group, maybe it's time to find some new friends to hang with. I'm not saying to leave your old friends, but just to expand the number of people to hang with.
I don't want it so much, but again, this goes back to that other question I answered on why people aren't hooking up after they're married, and I think much of the answer is contingent on what people are, and are not, bringing into the bedroom to begin with.  For so long I did want to do stuff, and then I did, and now I'm sort of over that, and really challenged to want to get back into it again.\n\nI'm not quite so sure what it is that I want anymore from that aspect of it, if anything.  Yeah you could spend time with him in other ways and build up those other aspects of the relationship but quite honestly if it just isn't there one would have to ask if there aren't deeper issues plaguing the relationship. Perhaps I should ask myself that question ...
Go for the Rambo method. Proper Gung-ho, all guns blazing. Deeply satisfying for you and top quality entertainment for all onlookers. Don't wait til they're at their weakest though, thats not sporting. You want to make a proper battle of it, show everyone your big brass bollocks.

"Hi!  I'm the mom of identical twins and have read alot on the subject.\n\n1. If you are identical twins then there is a thing called mirror image identical twins.  This means that one is right handed and the other is left handed.  Other things that could happen would be if one has a dimple on the right then the other would have a dimple on the left.  It's pretty rare.\n\n2. If you are fraternal twins then you came from two different eggs that were fertilized at the same time.  This means that you are as similiar or disimiliar as any other brothers/sisters out there.  It's not uncommon for families to have children where one is right handed and the other is left handed.\n\n3. The ""photo"" in the corner is a default shadow.  It will be there unless you add an avatar or picture of your own.

I have and I must say that all these guys saying never will they take it from a woman are missing out on some SERIOUS fun!!  I generally can't get enough (and no, I'm not gay or bi for liking it)\n\nI agre with you that anything a man and woman does together makes it non-gay.  By the way, have you tried giving it to a guy before???
Hmmmmm --- any potential for it being stalking.  If not, then they just enjoy you and your company and take pleasure in thinking of you when you are not there.
Hey..I just left but I can come back if you want me too.

I should pick all of the above but what I like the most is breast.  I agree with you 100% breast is the best thing girls could ever have.
You know what? I've been trying to figure that out for over a year now. Just when I think I've picked myself up & got over him, something comes & bites me on the bum & I'm all emotional about it again. I've dated other really nice men, gone out & tried to have fun, everything I could think of but every now & then I still feel that heart ache. All you can do is try & move on, time is the greatest healer we have.
Talk about stuff she wants to talk about.
No one should be treated as disrespectfully as that ... With a TEXT msg? Saying he was now single?. He sounds colossally immature and doesn't know what he wants or what he had with you. The way you are feeling now will subside and new and more exciting things will come to you. If he loves you, he will find you and be all that he should be and more, but he is not going to do it while you sit there and wait on him, allowing him to treat you like a part time pal/gf. Move on, make your own decisions and stop letting someone like that control your heart, head and choices!! This too shall pass my dear! :) \nGood luck and thinking of you!
""
leave him alone. if he was having sex with these women then you'd have a problem.
The safest bet is to choose a nice item from her registry. Since she is a co-worker, you can pick an inexpensive item. A saute pan or a dutch oven is always a safe bet too, you can do so much with them! Other easy options: an interesting vase, a gift card to a local resturant, a nice framed mirror, or a gift card to a local electronics store. For a co-worker, I would say about $50 is appropriate

Glamor Magazine this month described the seven levels of love...1)infatuation 2)Free-fallin' 3)Getting emotionally naked 4)Call it ESP 5)Breathing room 6) the second fall 7)as good as it gets.  It's actually a pretty good article but I won't clog up answers with the whole thing.  Pick up a copy its on pages 188-190.  There's a lot of other good articles and beauty advice too.
Never...They deserve more respect than that...And its wrong.
I believe you have answered the question yourself. When you say that you don't like the second guy and you don't want to know him then he is basically not a choice anymore.\nHowever, since the first guy is not ready for marriage, a good way to test him would be to tell him that you have been proposed by someone else and since he is not ready for marriage so you are confused about this relationship and ask him for a definite answer.\nIn the meanwhile, I would suggest to at least meet the other guy once. As far as I know seeing is believing. You never know what good may be waiting for you there. No need to give him your contact number or anything else in the first meeting just keep it to the introduction and to general topics. If he tries to advance too fast then obviously he just trying to get into your pants.\nThink I have written enough. Will be good to know your decision and progress.\nTake care
First you have to be good looking cause it's not the only important thing but it is one of the most important.\n\nThen you habe to be a gentelman, eventhough some girls like ''bad boys'', it's always better when a guy is well manered and polite.\n\nAlso, tou have to be cool, don't act like a stupid around girls\njust be natural and take it easy\n\nLast but not least, have confidance in yourself, show her that you know what you are doing \n\nPS: There is a girl for everyone, I'm sure you ll find one
If that picture is of you then the only reason I wouldn't go out with you is because I would go to jail for messing around with a 15 year old.  Your looks are going to continue to chance over the next 4 or 5 years and it looks like you are off to a good start.
I have 3 sons.  The two older ones had 'girlfriends' from about age 5!  The younger one got to 21 and had never had a girlfriend (but lots of pinups on his bedroom wall).  He has now been in a committed relationship for about 4 years and has two littlies.  When you're ready, you'll be ready
not sure about email. you might try yahoo ppl search (it has an email option, but i think its only for ppl w/yahoo mail) also u can attempt myspace or facebook (but the searches are often difficult and useless) to find address or phone go to www.whitepages.com
Duh, he must like u but hes shy thats all!!
Relocated Texan, I could be but I am probablely not MATURE enough:(\n\nXOXO\nSinful smile, I can spread my legs wide & open my mouth wide... is that what your looking for?\n\n~I have a very sweet, deep, tight throat.
"First off, I think it is great you are trying to help him out. Second, this may not be a good time for him right now having two girls fight over him...His house just burned down. Approach him first...maybe say, ""I was wondering if you wanted to go to a movie or something."" Or, ""would you like to come over to dinner."" Don't flirt with him too much because it might scare him away. As for your best friend, if you two fight over the same guy, and quit being friends over it, then you probably don't need to be friends. But think about this: What if doesn't like either one of you, but just as friends?? It would be pretty stupid to lose your best friend over. Say you and this guy go to a movie together and things develop and your friend gets jealous over that, the she really doesn't need to be your friend. Friends shouldn't be jealous of each other...especially over a guy. Good luck, and follow your heart to make the right decisions."
Well, we look at it and consider it a lot. Fortunately, there are still girls willing to look away from a guy's financial difficulties. Take note, this happens when a girl is already decided that she loves the guy. Just try to take it slow before confronting the long term issue. That way, she would have seen a lot of good character from you and it would be easier to put the money thing aside. Show her that you can compensate for that with something else :)
I found out that my man was cheating through one of his friends wives, who overheard them talking.  So she came back with details for me, and I put his butt out!  And it didn't help that about 2 weeks later, I got a std.

Get on yahoo answers and answer some bloody questions!

You're sooo sweet!! If she really loves you as much as you think then she'll soon realise she's made a terrible mistake and come back to you. You dont need to do anything than be yourself! It wont take long for her to realise. Dont be too needy though! Good luck!

Yes there are girls like that. I want to do that to a couple of people right now.
Personally I think the Outerbanks are nicer than the beaches other people have listed.  Duck is my favorite town.  There are great places there to get married and great officiant.  Carolina Designs is good company to rent a house from because you don't have to bring your own sheets, just your own towels.  Plus I know their houses are clean because I used to own one.
thats really cute, and from what i have heard it sounds like you have a little crush . = ]  if you feel that way she probly does to . i mean its too easy for girls to start thinking about someone. just  ask her out on a date and see what happens. good luck ; )
probally, i have asked a few that were specifically about him.\nya, hed definitly be pissed.
there is no time frame.\nI asked my ex to marry me after only three months.\nThat lasted ten years\ni moved in with my man after only three weeks\nit's been five years.\nIts what ever your heart feel\njust make sure it doesn't cloud your mind
"I don't think there is anything wrong with guy friends.  But, you must always be respectful of your relationship.  Put yourself in his place would you be bothered if he were doing what you do.  If so then it probably is not right.  I am not a jealous person but I would not want my boyfriend spending time with girl friends without me.  I would not spend time with guy friends without him.  Our friends have become mutual friends.  If they are only ""friends"" then an appropriate relationship with them should not be a problem.  It is all a matter of respect."
I don't think any girl is going to let her relationship with you depend on the length of your hair.  Wear it how you like, but too long it starts looking like a mop.
"Maybe he felt toyed with as well?  This will of iron he puts on around is you is rooted somewhere in jealousy.  Can you see yourself taking down the ""just friends"" sign if he's nice with you again, or do you have a wall you're determined to keep him out of.  I'm nicer to my single female friends and talk longer not because I'm an ambitious pig, but because the 'happier' girls have set their parameters, there's nothing new to really explore.  It's a hard, mean question to ask yourself, but ""how am I worth his time and energy? What can I do to calm his stress, not add to it?"""
Do you really want to be with a woman who you think is 'offended by your looks'?
"alright, I'm not ""adult"" yet, give me a year, but I bloody agree. Isn't that what blogs are for? this is important stuff, like asking people for advise on business moves, politics, the wealth of knowledge people can get from others' experiences about education, traveling... That is the way to use this when anyone in the world can answer!\nNice question."
"Actually, it sounds like sexual harrassment.  I teach this stuff in middle school.  It is called quid pro quo and he could ask you to do him a ""favor"" because he knows you like him and will do things to keep him interested.  Stay with friends. Please don't be alone with him and if it gets weird (which it will) tell him to stop or tell a friend to help you talk to Josh.  Sounds just like a situation at my school with a boy named Josh who is older because he was ledt back and I know, he'd use the power of ""the crush"" to get sexual favors from a girl and not feel bad about it at all.  If you are my student at VSM, figure out who I am and we'll talk privately.  I promise.  If not, be careful and go with your gut instinct.  he does NOT have a crush on you."
""
Just talk to him:)
Stop arguing with him.  You did it, you got caught, you pay the price.  Whining and nagging him is only going to annoy him, and it makes you look even more immature.  Smashing pumpkins is stupid and destructive - that's why you do it when you're a teenager - and getting grounded is part of being a teenager, too.\n\nDon't worry - time will pass quicker than you think.  Just remain calm and let it lie.
Let me see . . . you've been with him for 5 years and you have 2 kids together . . .\n\nI don't think he just wants to marry you to spite your parents.\n\nMarry him already.
l you must be married along time lol
I once saw a Saturday Night Live sketch where a lady goes to see a psychologist and runs off for a full five minutes about all the things in her life that went wrong and all the areas that are now out of control. The psychologist told her to pay him $500 up front and he would tell her what she needed to do to solve all her problems. She reluctantly paid him and after a few seconds of staring at her, he simply said two words... 'stop it'.\n\nI offer the same advise to you, for free. \nThis relationship is not healthy because it has no outlet. If you give something, ANYTHING, it must be returned. If not, you must show enough respect for yourself to seek it elsewhere. I don't mean that in a bad way, but you must demand respect for every thing you have to offer, for if you don't. No one else can be expected to. \n\nIf you want things to get better, make better choices.
Dreams are a form of subconscious stress relief.  You are either worried that he could some day cheat or leave you, or as much as you feel that you wouldn't cheat on him, you have a hidden wild side that hasn't been explored.  You might need to get that out of your system before you can become truly satisfied in a committed relationship.  Make sense?
dump your friend(s)...
i dont know what to tell you, just always remember this: you will always have your friends, but you and your boyfriends might not ever talk again, who helped you through the hard times and is still going to help you through? your friends do, boys dont always understand your feelings and what your going through
Parents sometimes say things that they really don't mean. I use to yell at my mom because i felt like at times she didnt' care for me. Long story short I just lost my mom this year. I'm the only child and both of my parents are deceased. Just love your parents and talk to them. Let them know how you really feel and just be open with them. NO harsh feelings, be humble and respectful, but caring and understanding. I wish my mom was still here. Just be greatful for your blessings.
"definitely. it's actually the ""in"" thing these days. I have seen people carrying these huge suitcases around to starbucks and plopping them down on the table, setting up their huge computer and monitor, plugging everything in, even getting their laser printer ready.  the problem is that there is no place to put your coffee. In the car you might have a problem with getting electricity. but I suggest you invest in a 100 mile long electrical cord to solve that problem. in the plane you can tap  into their main electrical supply, which will divert all the power from the engine into your computer. you will also have to buy an extra ticket for your desktop computer to sit in the seat next to you, so  it might actually be cheaper to buy a laptop."
Don't get yourself involved in the mixed relationship - in some aspects where you are a couple and others where you are not, especially if it is confusing your emotions.\n\nIt sounds like she does not want the responsibilities of a full relationship but is hoping for the benefits. This sort of split relationship doesn't work unless both parties know what is involved. \n\nIf she called it off, then she doesn't need to be reaping the benefits without the other. \n\nMiss Cris\nhttp://lendinganear.wordpress.com
YES YES YES \n You need to tell someone what's happenning\nIt is the worst possible emotional trama to a young girl to be sexually abused by a parent    Someone who is only supposed to protect you from harm not cause it\n\n Do everything possible to stop all contact   NOW  I'm sorry for you sweety
try to flirt by sitting near her and kick her leg (LIGHTLEY) and say sorry if she kicks back or crosses her legs towards you she likes you!
no that was 7 years ago i moved on with my life years ago
umm...I think you maybe over thinking your current prospect.
Wow I can't tell u how many times this question has been asked before.  I think it should always be down.  I don't understand why men can't aim with the toilet seat down in the first place.  It's not like the stream is 2 ft wide or anything.
My parents did that. I'm still mad at them for it, but their overprotectiveness is probably why I'm best freinds with my brother now, cause I never had anyone else to hang out with. You didn't mention how old you are. If you are 18+, they really can't stop you. But I hate going against my parents wishes (even though I am over 18). \n\nI would maybe invite your freinds over to your place a few times so your parents could get to know them. Then, if you want to go to dinner, tell them that and tell them you'll be home at a resonable time, even if they want you back at 9, agree to it. Gradually, they will learn to loosen up. Mine did.
The reeason why we end up hurt more then what guys do is because we put are ALL into the relationships that we have so when they smash you into it wall badly it hurts!!!  So thats why we cry all the time and find ourselves loocked up in a room wishing we never dated that person when in reality we need to honestly not worry about it much.  And before getting into a relationship take things realllllllllllly slow and feel them out a little bit then date someone.....but you'll be fine I mean stay single for a while and when you do find that guy you think is cute then let him know about the past guys and that your not having it this time around (not in a mean way)...
babe she wants you and who could blame her x
"Now.  Immediately.  You're wasting every day of your life that you stay together.\n\nBy the way, has your partner always and consistently said that ""Marriage isn't for me?""  Then you haven't been listening and a lot of this wastage of time is your fault!"
It tends to be once they are secure in themselves.  People can also want to do this because they are NOT secure.  If that makes sense....Men tend to be the first option (waiting tl they're secure in themselves) and women tend to be the latter.  In case you're wondering I am a woman, ready to settle down because I want stability (I'm only 21 but I know what I want).  It also depends on the maturity of th individual, I would imagine.
yep, it's not illegal. may be weird, but not wrong. If you are happy, then so be it.
i wouldn't poke you with a sh.itty stick
I would just ignore whats being said...You trying to fix this is only going to keep this alive, let it die...Time fixes things, just give it a little more and be yourself....
Guys need to keep the romance up.  Once you are married, it's like the game's over and all the chasing and passion and romance fall away to the real world.  Keep the passion alive like when they were dating.  Also, I heard on the radio this morning that it's frequently because women feel unattractive, so men need to let their wives know they are still hot and that they still desire their wives and it's not just something they want to do and get over with.  Oh and obviously it has to be passionate, and something the woman will enjoy.  If it's just going to be fast and routine with no foreplay, any woman would rather pass.
First of all you two should install a camera on your PC respectively. Make sure you see him first on the other side of the line , then if he is ((as young as you are)) , single ,unattached , and both of you are attracted to each other , maybe a meeting could be arranged preferably with a friend or older person as a strart .............then you can take it from there .\nTake heed and be very careful always double check at first before jumping to conclusions.
"i agree with what u did! your her child ......and she trashed you! i would move on but.......id never open up to her again....never trust her again! what you went thru is awful!!!! you told her in ""confidence""....not ""audiance"".......she was so wrong for this,,,,your dad should have been FURIOUSwith her for this...some things you dont discuss outside the family!!!!!!!!!! but use this as a lesson learned.........now you see that she cant be trusted......but you must love her and be her daughter........as you have been....only now you need not to share personal things .dont be bitter......just cautious! respect them as you have ...both your parents.........have you given any thought to you and your boyfriend living together.......?out on your own....?this may help you cope with what your parents did....and help you to not hate so much....some time away.........im sorry but your also supposed to be DADDYS littlePRINCESS,,,,,,his little girl...why was he not furious!!!!!! ill never understand that? i wish you peace....and the very best life has to offer,,.your situation at home pisses me off....sorry. but  your his little girl!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Make eye contact, then BLUSH.\n\nWhen he comes over...Invite him to go out w/you & your friends....very nonchalant.

WOW! sloooow down there cowboy!.. \n- first off... treat your little lady with some respect.  she's young. if she doesnt want to give you her number it could be a number of things.. \n1. her parents keep track of who she talks to.. and she tries to hide that.. \n2.  she's not that interested.. \n3. Maybe she's just not sure about you. and how far she wants to let you go.\n\n- i mean.. you did say middle school, so its not like the world is over.\n\n\n- but... being one who went through this kind of thing, you have to learn to accept what comes at you.  you will find that it will be dissapointing. and one day.. she may jjust say, look pal- your cool and all but back off.  just accept that.\n\n= a good way to talk to her, is leave a little note with one of her friends.  dont let any juicy details out.. and say something like this.. \n\n - hey, i've really enjoyed talking to you... your a sweet girl.  id like to have your number so we could talk some more.  You know? get to chit chat about random things.  so.. when you can, just throw me a note back and attatch your number! - be good!!\n_--- your name... \n\n\n- or maybe an e-mail.\n\neither way... be cool about it... dont ..whatever you do.. obssess.... it will FREAK a girl out!

'Cause they can't help themselves?\nPlus new age laws invite it.  They don't need to compromise anymore, when they become unhappy, as they invariable get, the law allows them a split from their comfort provider and he is forced to continue supporting them as if they still lived together, until he drops dead.\nNow they can play the field and have a state mandated 'pension'.\nWhat a deal!\nI see women complaining about 'men hurting' them.  How about the men who get hurt by women, badly!?
They just haters girl hold ur head up high and do ur thang. You got to learn how to be rude and bitchy towards these jerks. If you intimidate them they will stop.
O my goodness ...Guess we are in the same boat huh.....I found a new great guy but I cant get my old one of my mind...I asked this ? about a few days ago and I got an anwser back saying to for get the memories and focus on the new guy dont do the same to the new guy as  you are doing to yourself..I dont know if thats any help to you but,It kinda made me think that I am bring my new boyfriend down wit me and its not fair to him...Just think about it ...Take some time out for your self think let  everything lose erase your memories with the old guy and start with the new guy...I am not saying it is going to be easy but,As I learned if you really love the new guy then the old guy should not really matter ...Memories are hard to let go and you dont have to let them all go just the ones that are standing in the way of the new guy and you......I mean common if you are like me and dated your old guy for 2 years.you would have memories to... Anyway I hope I helped a lil bit considering that I am in the same possition....Good luck to ya girly......\nMack

Charro029,\nI guess you don't know what the term goldigger means. Goldogger is a term used to describe a women who is out to get your money. They usually are free spirits when it comes to love for a man. They may seem very sincere, but the end result is all they want is your money and when they get that, adious, there done with you.\nTDCWH
Nope, if it's not what you want for YOU, don't get married or have children.  Doing it because it's expected or normal is a terrible reason.  Marriage or kids are huge commitments.
I suspect these guys are intimidated by your good looks.  Sometimes, a guy looks at a girl who is extremely attractive, and assumes she would never give him the time of day.  He then approaches the girl who is less attractive, but less threatening.\n\nIf you tend to dress in a way that is very provocative, simply toning it down a bit, and dressing more conservatively, might help.  You could also experiment with different hairstyles, and see if that affects the way guys react to you.\n\nAlternatively, you could look at this thing as a blessing.  We all need some way of filtering out the people we don't want to meet, and you might simply decide that the men who aren't intimidated by your good looks are the only ones you're really after anyway.

"The one I love the most out of everyone?  He's 5'9"" with a sturdy build.  A strong back (which is my favorite feature) and strong legs.  He has really short hair (due to serving in the military), and bright blue/green eyes.  He has the most perfect smile you can ever imagine, and every time he grins it makes me felt.  As far as personality, he's funny, goofy, stern (when the time calls for it), forgiving, beautiful, smart...I could go on forever.  But, I'll leave you with this: he's the only one for me."

Darn - i had my answer written last time and you deleted the question!!  LOL!!\n\nI think it would freak him out to ask after only a couple of weeks.  I doubt if he has a clue yet where it is going.  \n\nHold off a little longer.  Next time he brings up some event in the future, then I would ask where he sees your relationship going.  But, you know, people change their minds at anytime in a relationship - no guarantees.\n\nI definitely understand your wanting to know if it's long term.  And the more time you spend together the faster you'll know.  In the meantime, there are lots of things you can do to get closer.....it will just enhance the anticipation when you finally do feel ready for sex!!
It is more up to her to do anything about it. If she doesnt want to be with him and he is threatening her, then that is police issue. You have no issue against her actual boyfriend, but seems as if he might make it against you. You should not do anything about it until she makes some first step. Each step she makes toward you, you should grab and hold it as your sacred territory, as it is. If you have layed your heart upon a girl who goes out with tough guys (!!!! and !!!! for her sister) and you want to undertake the risk of such foolishness, then you should either be wise or tough enough, or a movie scenario writer. But, the reward could be plentiful. Be sure that she is not into gaming.
I notice that people who don't have friends anymore when they are married or serious with someone are not very happy.
Good question. In many relationships, after a while they loose their 'spark'. How do you fix it? Easy! Find something new to say/do! Go to a theme park, so snowboarding. Talk about school memories, talk about parties. Talk about anything! Find something new to do, and do it!! Good Luck!
"I am not really sure what the lady's deal is other than maybe she is just comfortable around him and doesn't see it as a big deal.\n\nAs for your question, I am wondering how you managed to get all of that out without a single capital letter, other than ""WTF"", or punctuation mark."
"Today in this world, women in general have proven that they are able to anything when they put their mind to it. That can match the work force of a man. But what aslo now comes with this is now a telling to guys you are no longer dependent... a guys mind works to help those who need help. If you can do everthing yourself we have nothing to feel good about ourselves. We like being able to fix the car, mow the lawn, sharpen the blades for the mower, fix plumming, and etc. If you have no need for that then it makes it hard to break the ice. So do to culture shock of women takeing a little more control in this world the roles have now become even. There for It would be safe to say as well you might want to think about why is it that you aren't approaching them, and asking them. Most girls say well a girl wants to be picked up by a knight. wisked off her feet. Well If you your self make your self in to a ""independent"" woman you now need to except you may need to be the knight. Obviously you can't do this your entire life it is not want you want to do because you you were not hard wired like that, But what is one time stepping up and saying I like you. Start it off, just let him continue with it."

No need to worry.  Many people feel pressured into thinking they have to have lots of relationships and date just like everybody else...but you don't!  If you don't trust the guys, then you are totally justified in not staying with them.
It severely messes up their ability to trust.  As adults, they often never trust.  They say love, love, love, but never trust the other person.  This causes very difficult situations for their future partners.

try going back to the place you took her on your first date, maybe recreating it by doing all the things you did that night. Its very romantic.
FIND HER!!! If you love her take action do SOMETHING! You will regret it forever if you dont find her, if you are sure you love each other get married forget what her parents think.

Only if you can still give them a chance to earn back your trust.  You can never use the fact that they were unfaithful out of spite.  It would be hard to do, but only you know if it can be done.  You have to except them and their faults.  Can you live with it?

"There is so much ""wrong"" going on here.  First of all I was one of those women who was contacting her ""boyfriend"" who was married.  His wife didn't know either and he kept it that way for a reason.  He was cheating on her.  Your husband is hiding something whether it is just cheating by phone or possibly more.  You already knew this though didn't you because you are becoming obsessed over this and for good reason.  Your answer is not to call his ex but to confront him.  How are you going to do this without telling him about how you found out?  I am not sure but there is so much distrust in this relationship and rightly so.  Trust me on this because I was the one calling and I am not proud of this but you really need to handle this now. Good luck."

I think you are too young if you think thats how you spell friend
Yeah, what is it?
Not so complicated. You like your BF, but you are atrracted to this other guy.\n\nSharing humor is SO IMPORTANT I can't even describe to you.\n\nIf you have that, things will tend to go farther.\n\nYour BF seems to be an understanding guy, just figure out what you want and go for it. The way I see it, you and your BF don't really have a chance, the genie's out of the bottle. If you go with him, you will alwasy wonder what it would be like to go for Mr. SmartSexyDangerous. Also, will he ever really trust you again, since he knows that you might be attracted to other men?\n\nDo your best to break it gently but cleanly with you BF. Don't hop into a relationship right away. Give you guys both some time... then let yourself free.
Wow that's a tough one since I love all 3!!!!  I guess I would probaly pick sex with my husband but the other 2 are very tempting!!! LOL

Many people are uncomfortable with things they do not understand. Your father is still family and may calm down after you explain to him how you feel. You may find it difficult to gain his understanding, but if you approach the situation with respect and love for your father and keep in mind that he may be afraid to accept this revelation of yours, you will be more likely to get him to open his mind and accept you for who you are.
Do what

Its about time your mum acted her age and actually adressed any issues with you!  Tell your mum you want to know what is going on...;
he probably wants to kiss you, but he's afraid because he doesn't know how. make sure he's in a good mood, try cuddling with him in the dark (being in the dark may make him feel more comfortable), ease him into it by getting close, softly rub the tip of your nose on his, then on his lips, then you can rub your lips on his, then kiss him. remember--do all of this slow and gentle (it will make hom feel more relaxed).\nGood Luck!!!
You have to make it clear to her that it is because of her psychotic behavior that you're breaking up with her.  Cite specific moments in your relationship that she has crossed the line of sanity and tell her you can't have her in your life anymore...then watch your back, pretty much forever...never get mixed up with psychos, no matter how cute they seem!  \nFurthermore, don't start seeing someone else immediately if that is your plan, it will be torture for the new girl if the ex is truly crazy and wants to make her life miserable.  The psycho is going to try and get back in your good graces in some demented way...stay strong!

the old head of of my old college would up marrying a sixth former he taught.\n\nnumerous people (one or two that I know) wind up in some kind of relationship during the five to seven years that people are in school. It's human and statistics dictate that out of all the kids and teachers and all the time they spend together you will get relationships blooming... it's inevitable.\n\nthe results too can be disastrous or really beautiful.\n\nthe teacher has a unique power over their partner because of how the relationship is likely to have developed. that's why it's frowned upon, because that kind of influence can wreck someone's life. I think the situation might be moot because you don't know what they teacher thinks about the girl as opposed to what he thinks about his job and his reputation.. there are just too many variables to give a sensible suggestion about what to do.\n\ngirls have crushes and crushes come and go. she will embarrass herself or not as the case may be. she might succeed in snaring him....\n\ngood luck to all parties concerned! :-)
His affection is nice, but I can see it's unwanted. It must be hard for him to move on after a long relationship like that. It's not bad to keep talking to him, but if he's being pushy about getting back together you need to say something about it. Especially since you have a new guy and he's with someone else. He needs to focus on that new relationship before she finds out that hes still focused on you.
warm big hug...i want!!!
i dont lift him..i push him =]
he is probley intrested in u and u should make a move beacause that signals that he wants to get to know u BUT if ur young dont get all serious with it like a marriage cuz that is very stupid(previous bf) if does that like waves and smile he probley likes u or he is a super nice guy.....good luck
""
Definitely just give him stronger signals and he'll respond.  Trust me, I'm a guy and if I am that close to a girl where I promise to change a habit, it means I'd do it because I am interested in the girl.  Guys cannot go out on limbs all the time and ask the girl out, it just doesn't work like that.  Girls need to be stronger in their signals.
"It's bad for everyone. Bad for her, even if you don't like her you should have some basic human decency.\n\nIt's bad for him because he's a cheater and cheapening himself & the two of you.\n\nIt's bad for you because you're the other woman, you're a cheater along with him. & you could never trust him. The saying ""If they'll do it with you, they'll do it to you"" is true. If someone lacks integrity then you can never count on them to be honest or faithful. Do you really want to be with someone like that? Quite frankly you don't have much integrity if you're wiling to be in this situation either. So why would he want to be with you? Or maybe you're both a-holes & you deserve each other...\n\nSorry I get angry about infidelity. It's wrong. It's cowardly. Tell him if he doesn't love his girlfriend & wants to be with you then grow a set of balls & dump her BEFORE he starts seeing you. That's the proper way to do it, for those of us who have a conscience.\n\nGood luck.\n\nThis attack of conscience & morals has been brought to you by amp, girl campaigning for an honest tomorrow!..."
You cant break them up. If she isnt into him, she will leave him, or they will break up on their own. I hate to tell you this, but you should move on. \n\nThere are lots and lots of really great women in the world. Get out there, and meet them!
Wow, it has to be so interesting to find out about family, especially since they don't feel like family. However in response to your question about the honesty, she may not be 100% sure who your dad is.  But if she is saying that he is a red headed Italian, that is totally possible, and he is most likely from Northern Italy.\n\nHere is a clip from a study done on the decent of Italians...  \n\n. . . we should not neglect the researches of Woltmann (1905). Woltmann studied portrait paintings, busts and written descriptions, to ascertain the physical features of the great men of the Italian Renaissance. He revealed that many of the individuals in question, such as Leonardo da Vinci, Tasso, Galileo, etc., were of Germanic descent, and that they possessed Nordic racial characteristics. The results of his investigations, were as follows: of the 125 men whose eye colour could be discerned, 102 had blue, blue-grey or blue-green eyes; 18 had brown or brown-grey eyes; and 5 had eyes of mixed pigmentation. Of the 108 men whose hair colour could be accurately determined, 68 had blond or red hair; 26 had brown hair; and 14 had black hair. [Woltmann (1905) 143-144.] Woltmann also discovered that most of the noble families who ruled over much of Northern Italy, produced blond individuals throughout their generations. Such families as the d’Este of Ferrara, the Bentivoglia of Bologna and the Sforza of Milan, were all largely blond-haired and blue-eyed. [Woltmann (1905) 42-49.]

Apart from 'angry' and 'hungry', what other common English word ends in '-gry'? Printer Friendly Version \n\n\nYou are told wrong! There isn't one!\n\nThis 'riddle' has been circulating in email for years now, in various forms of words, and had appeared in print media before that. Dictionary and reference departments the world over have been plagued by questions about it. It seems to have originated as a trick question, but the wording has become so garbled in subsequent transmission that it is hard to tell what was originally intended.\n\nThe most probable answer is that, in the original wording, the question was phrased something like this: \n\nThink of words ending in -gry. 'Angry' and 'hungry' are two of them. What is the third word in the English language? You use it every day, and if you were listening carefully, I've just told you what it is.\nThe answer, of course, is 'language' (the third word in 'the English language').\n\nThere are several other English words ending in -gry which are listed in the complete Oxford English Dictionary, but none of them could be described as common. They include the trivial oddities un-angry and a-hungry, and \n\naggry: aggry beads, according to various 19th-century writers, are coloured glass beads found buried in the ground in parts of Africa. \nbegry: a 15th-century spelling of beggary. \nconyngry: a 17th-century spelling of the obsolete word conynger, meaning 'rabbit warren', which survives in old English field names such as 'Conery' and 'Coneygar'. \ngry: the name for a hundredth of an inch in a long-forgotten decimal system of measurement devised by the philosopher John Locke (and presumably pronounced to rhyme with 'cry'). \nhigry-pigry: an 18th-century rendition of the drug hiera picra. \niggry: an old army slang word meaning 'hurry up', borrowed from Arabic. \nmeagry: a rare obsolete word meaning 'meagre-looking'. \nmenagry: an 18th-century spelling of menagerie. \nnangry: a rare 17th-century spelling of angry. \npodagry: a 17th-century spelling of podagra, a medical term for gout. \npuggry: a 19th-century spelling of the Hindi word pagri (in English usually puggaree or puggree), referring either to a turban or to a piece of cloth worn around a sun-helmet. \nskugry: 16th-century spelling of the dialect word scuggery meaning 'secrecy' (the faint echo of 'skulduggery' is quite accidental!).

I was with my man for almost a year before he told me he loved me. I tild him like 3 months into the relationship and yes I did want him to say it back, but I didn't push him. I still told him everyday that I love him but I didn't push him to say it back. Just give him time I am sure he will figure it out that you aren't going to burn him and he will decide when it is right for him to say it back.
depends on the guy and HOW good you were? But this is a gift from you and should be shared only when YOU feel the time is right!
The man is just going to tell you whatever he thinks you want to hear. But  you can ask.
"Okay, let's see... I was 13 when I had my first ""non-car"" date - my mom drove us to the movies with some other kids. At 16, I had my first ""car"" date - he took me out to dinner. I was married at 21, and I'm still married 20+ years later (happily, thanks).\n\nShould? Hmm. I think it worked out about right, for me - but it's a matter of how mature the parties are (some kids are old enough for a group date at 13, others you can't trust to be sensible until later).  Marriage - well, I'd say teenagers are almost always not ready, but after 20, again, it depends on the couple - how mature, how committed, how ready to do what it takes to have a successful, lasting relationship."

Oh, the racing hormones of youth!  Ordinarily, I would say the guy is too immature for a relationship and not to waste any more time on him.  He sounds like a nice guy but it seems to me you are not who he really wants to be with.  If you REALLY want to continue going after him, it sounds like you need to back off a bit.  Are there other boys you are friendly with?  If so, try paying more attention to one of them, and less attention to the one you like.  Probably a good idea if this boy sees you paying more attention to someone else also.  Give it some time.  He may rethink his feelings for you.  And if you still don't get a reaction out of him, say, in about a week or so, then approach him and ask him why he hasn't been hanging paying attention to you much.  This is a bit manipulative, but if there is anything there at all, hopefully this may bring it out.  What you don't want to do is spend a long time waiting for something that isn't going to happen.
My fiance is not an athesist but she claims not be believe in a God.  She is the most spiritual person that I have ever known.  I am a member of A.A. and as such have come to believe in a power greater than me, and I know for a fact that she sees things in a very similar manner.
Got to keep practicing!
personally and this is just me.....I think that people in general are WAY TO SHALLOW and always judge people by their outsides... when in actuality it is the insides that really matter..... face it when you are attracted tot he outside and that is it all the person is thinking about is sex...... but sex alone can not keep a real relationship alive.....it's what is on the inside that really matters.

Well coming from a country that is nothing but muslims well my parents are anyways I was raised in spain but my parents and granparents and so on are from Iran. Here is the low down on those people who don't know let me educate you.\n\nThe only way a man can get a second or third wife *which by the way they can only hae 3* is if the first wife consents it because she can not provide him with a boy to carry the name. Sometimes they only have a marriage that last however long it takes to get a boy and then they divorce or whatever not usually though. ANyways the first wife is really incontrol if she wants to do it or not, the other way a man can go abouts doing that is if the wife leaves. FOr example my grandma was visiting my family in Spain and she stayed for like 4 years or something long time and my grandpa got this his secertary pregnant so he had to marry him by the muslim law. So he married her because  A. THe wife technically left him and B. she was pregnant.\n\nNot that he does not love you some females are okay with not having the man around and all they want out of life is children and a nice house and money right and some sex every now and then. But there is more to it than most westerns know anyways I dont know the rest of the details cause I am Christian and I know very limitted information about muslims *how ironic I know* BUt yeah there u go.
She likes the fact that you like her but she doesn't want a relationship. She just likes the attention.

You might find what you're looking for through one of these sites:\nThat's a beautiful area and I'm sure you'll find something.\n\nhttp://www.swmichigan.org/\nhttp://www.harborcountry.org/\nhttp://www.harborcountry.org/sawyer/...\nhttp://www.holland.org/\nhttp://www.michigan.org/travel/index.asp...\nhttp://www.emichigancity.com/travel/index.htm\n\nYou might also want to consider checking with the area parks and preserves, sometimes they have places you can host events at.\nhttp://www.harborcountry.org/warren_dunes.html\nhttp://www.goswm.com/go_htm/southwest_michigan_parks/warren_dunes_state_park/warren_dunes_state_park.htm\n\nHere's a link to the State of Michigan's DNR website that has a map of the counties of Michigan, if you click on the county you're interested in it should give you info on any state parks in the area that might be able to accomodate you.\nhttp://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/parkmap.aspx\n(for example I clicked on Van Buren County and chose the Van Buren State park and it gave info that there are park picnic shelter areas that can be reserved for events.  It also provides contact info for the park so you could get more details.\n\nYou can also try the chamber of commerce in whichever area you're looking in, if they don't have info online then give them a call and they should be able to get you brochures or contact info on local places for weddings and other events.\nhttp://www.southhavenmi.com/\nhttp://www.southhaven.org/\nhttp://www.southhaven.org/weddings.asp\nhttp://www.south-haven.com/csh%20folder/csh/index.html\nhttp://www.michamber.com/ The statewide Chamber of Commerce Website, they should have links to the chambers in the areas you're interested in.\n\nHope this helps.  Good luck!  Enjoy!  And congrats on your upcoming wedding too!
let them discover that for themselves
Let him stew in jail.  He got into trouble and you aren't responsible to get him out of it.  What if you did bail him out and he skipped or didn't show up for court??  You would lose whatever you put up for bail.  Dump him, he's not worth the trouble.  He's just been using you and your family up to now and will take advantage of you more if you don't put a stop to it now.\n\nI suggest you attend a Bible believing church and find a nice guy who will treat you right.  Most of the guys there won't be winding up in jail and you just might find the prince you have been looking for all your life.

"Girls do this all the time. When she tells you she ""preferred"" the sedan she meant ""we are getting the sedan, ur choice is irrelavent."" and when she said she didn't want to ride in a truck, alarms should have went off in your head, she meant ""you better not get that truck, or so help me God...""\n\nMasters at understatement. They think it's giving us ""polite hints"" that will steer our train of thought. You will never be able to change this in women if they are like that.\n\nBest thing for you to do is when they give you ""hints"" just take the ""hint"" as a in your face statement. Then again as soon as we do that, they'll say that it was just a suggestion and that we took it all wrong... go figure."
NOPE!!!! it's 1st cousin...once removed. it's the same as the first cousin only in a different generation. NOT 2nd cousin, sorry!
"he likes you, but is a little shy. he's probably used to being the one who ""hunts"" down the girl and then workd s up the nerve to ask them out and is not used to being told yea i like you. why don't you walk up to him one day and strick a conversation, if things start going then hey you never know if not then it's not the end of the world. but he definately likes you if he still is staring at you. he's now playing hard to get. make the first advance some guys really like that."
Um, yes - she's listed on the Electoral Register.  \nNot hard to find by any stretch of the imagination....
"If you find him sexy and ugly at the same time, look i between those reaction. Ever heard of the ugly duckling? Most people see the outside of someone and say, "" (S)he is not attractive, I will move on."" But what if that person was the very best of what you were looking for? A soul and heart that will beat and care for you till the end of time. You will never know. Most ""Handsome"" guys think that they are all that.... and they will think that way, and look at the woman they are dating and see that, i look better than her and i can do better. Someone like this person that you are drawn to might be better than you ""See""... Be friends first, if there is truly something you dont like, hey after all, you made a friend that one day you can cry on their shoulder or even talk to you about your problems."
drug him with truth syrum
First of all dating someone who has been your froiend is tough. As for how to let him down and still be friends....Dealing with heartbreak allways hurts someone and is very difficult to do, but if you do not be honest with him now...it will go on and on and the next thing you know..he will hear it from someone else and all of a sudden you are using him...at least that is what he will think. Just be upfront and honest with him. This way he knows the truth before someone else can distort it.\n\n\n\nCB
You haven't really given enough information, but there is nothing wrong with being straight.  In fact it is the true normal.
*** i'm w/ her ^^^^^^^^.  move on.  if he's lying about this what else might he be lying about?  if not now then in the future?
Hon, I am extremely proud of you.  You deserve to be treated with at least respect, and you were not even given that.  You find someone who is worthy of you!
First things first, don't be dieting unless you are obese. If you're just overweight, it is a very bad time in your life to be doing that to your growing body.\n\nSecond, since you're 14, you're probably a freshman. I have to say, you really don't need to be going out with guys right now. Not only is it just too young, but guys are really not finding themselves yet, and until guys find themselves, they won't be able to see the beautiful, true you. I hate how it works, but I also strongly dislike shallow people and avoid them.\n\nSo basically, it is unlikely that there are many guys your age who can actually see behind the mask, which I know is a travesty but it's just what media does to us.\n\nPlus, having a boyfriend at this age, although is scattered with good times, is wrought with bad times and hurt feelings. Just wait for a little while, and when the right guy comes along you'll know.\n\nBest of luck to you!
Thanks for stopping by.
"At first I wanted to ask ""who broke up with who"", but I realized that it's not that important.  The fact is, she has problems dealing with reality.  You're better off without her, but you should still be friends with her."
maybe he is a creep
The way he calls just to say hi...how he holds my hand...and leaves me little notes with a rose every now and then. Or just the way that when he sees me his eyes light up like he is really happy to see me.
Well, I'm a mother and my son has never dated a girl (seriously) that is of the same race as him.  And honestly, I could careless.  As long as she treats him with respect, honest and kindness, she is fine with me.  It's a person's attitide and behavior that matters.  The degreee of melanin in your skin does not necessarily determin that .....
"From a guys perspective and also one that is going through the same thing, be harsh, be rude, and most of all be upfront. I made that mistake of being the ""nice guy"" with my ex-wife and found that in the end I gained nothing and lost everything. After you tell him like it is, then change your number, for me it was the best thing I could have done. And if he continues to call you then you may need to take the next step and take legal action. Good luck, be strong, and don't let some bonehead get you down."

"OK, here's my secret.  I look at her eyes.  Then I make believe she has something on her cheek.  I reach my hand up and gently remove the so called item on her cheek. ""must have been a speck of perfection - sorry but it won't come off""\n\nIf she is receptive, you're in!, if not - move on.\n\nWorks EVERY time."
If enough is enough and you absolutely want to move on then.. yes move out  or make him move back home. \nIf he made a choice to move in with you then he should do his part. Id suggest talking to him, finding out whats the deal, telling him he needs to do more around the place or get a better job. Why is he uncapable of being the guy he once was...? Motivation can be really rough of an issue but its something that can absolutely change a relationship...\nWhat are his goals? what does he want for you two? does he plan to be their like he is in 5years... whats he doing to not be their?\nAttempt to set goals (realistic ones) with him and let him know that its important.. write them down.. things you want to change and where you want to be at. If he doesnt work towards them forcem out!\n\nLook up some ways to motivate a boyfriend/husband.. its pretty common that people fall into an unhappy state. \n\nand ultimately never stay with someone becuase you fear hurting them, its unhealthy for you and him.
Go with the money first:)
Obviously he is feeling something if he invited you and then made an effort to talk to you. Give it time and don't rush it. He will start to feel comfortable around you and let you know exactly how he feels. If he is still shy, then you come out and ask him. Don't be scared of what he might say because it is better to know than to never know.

"A couple of things stood out in your question.....you said , ""does he realize that I don't love him anymore?"" You do still love him! You're hurt, and angry for the way he treated you, but you still love him anyway....just not his actions toward you. Second, you said"" at what point does he realize he has lost her?"" Do you think he cares? If he cared , he would not have left you in the first place and broke your heart! It does not matter to him. He is only thinking of himself....not you. I'm not being mean, I actually hurt for you...but stop worrying about what he thinks, and start looking out for yourself. You need to move on, and heal. Good Luck!!"

Show up were he likes to skate. Just watch, he'll probable ignore you, but like most guys---he'll notice you.
Well let me start by saying that I could have written your questions. I have the same feelings as you that pertain to my parents and I am in my 40's. It is unhealthy to pretend that nothing is wrong and that your feelings dont matter, because they do!! The only advice that I can share with you is what I do myself. Since talking never gets you anywhere, stop wasting your breath....but start keeping your distance from your parents, It really will benefit you to not be around negative people and if you are questioned as to why you dont come around be honest with them and tell them exactly the reason why and until they are ready to listen to your concerns that this is the way it has to be. As for you , you might want to think about seeing a councelor to help you deal with the feelings that you have concerning your parents reactions about discussing problems. I hope one day your parents will open thier minds and listen to you but if they dont then you just have to accept the way they are and just do whats right for you, I dont suggest keeping your feelings to yourself, that only does harm to you. Good luck with this.
Show her who's boss, cheekymonkey.
Seems to me she has someone else or is on some bad anxiety medicine that would diminish the sex drive. If she isn't on the meds move on very quickly.
The POLITE thing to do is to INVITE Them to the wedding.  They are family no matter what -- and family needs to be a part of the joyous occasion.
Your the mother of the child right?? If you decide to leave there is nothing he can do about it.. No matter what he says about knowing the judges.. If you move to a different state before the divorce and petition divorce after you set up residency in that state you can try to have the divorce hearing in the state you live in.. In most cases the divorce will be held in the petitioners county of residency..I don't think you have much to fear with this though.. ln most cases unless you are proven (and l mean real hard physical evidence) unfit as a parent you will get full custody anyway...
This is a horrible situation to be in and believe it or not there are a lot of girls out there so jealous of a guys good relationship with his family that they do everything in their power to put a stop to that. Your brother will get over this infatuation, because thats alll it is, and when he comes to his senses he will realise that this girls jealousy and possessive, manipulative, self obsessed but insecure nature is coming between him and the people that have supported and cared for him his whole life. Blood is thicker than water. If he truly loves this girl however he will want yer acceptance, life is nothing without a secure loving family unit which ye seem to have.  Until he realises this however ye have to make the first move. No matter how much ye despise this girl ye muct accept that for now, they are together. Arrange a family meal and invite her. Show her that the concept of a loving family does exist as it seems that she doesn't understand that. Be open and friendly towards her and make her feel wanted, your brother will respect this and if he feels that she is accepted then hopefully ye will become close again. I wish you the best of luck and hope that my advice is of some help.
I just dont know when we are really in love ..most of the times we think we are but we are really not......i think it takes more than just getting used to a guy ...Its something going in ur heart like you have a feeling that hes a part of u..
"Yes, it is as normal for a guy to have emotional baggage as it is for a girl.  If he really cared for her, he is probably still dealing with those feelings.  As for his past relationship being in a ""destructive,"" just remember that love is often blind.  He probably didn't see it that way if, in fact, he was truly ""in love"" with her.  \n\nNow, as for your comment about starting up some sort of a ""lover"" situation with him, here is my suggestion:  Just go slowly, it may take him a little time to put the last one behind him.  So, be there as a friend...albeit a friend with occasional benefits...and wait for him to come around.  He will eventually, though it may take longer than a few weeks.  Just remember, the quickest way to get over a past lover is to find a new lover.  So, it sounds like you are in the perfect position to achieve what you are hoping to start up.  \n\nBest of luck!"

I think it depends on the terms of the prenup. What are you trying to protect or insure does or doesn't happen. Those are important factors to consider. Also i'm assuming she wasn't present for the construction of this agreement so were her interests considered? I would approach the subject openly and honestly, expect that feelings will get hurt so choose your words carefully and be considerate of her feelings and the fact that you are springing this on her, how would you feel is the situation was reversed?
don't do anything with him, call the police or your parents. and get him to stop
Once Again...You Rule!
well you have to question your self what am i  doing? Are you pouring your feelings out to them? are you just that cool girl they like to kick it with? How do i look when i am around them? Am i attracted to them? Dress a little different but don't change your self just to please others maybe it is not time for a relationship and the best relationships start as friends and last longer. So just be patient and if you believe in God ask him to send you someone and be specific in what you want when asking him
I think that he is torn between 2 different women and he had to decide to choose--- unfortunately he did not choose you.  The other women is probably controlling and has talked him into getting married.  I would say he does not want to talk to you any more b/c of the simple fact that he is ashamed, doesn't want to hurt you anymore and because he probably b/c he also doesn't want to hurt this other girl.  Just give it sometime and see what pans out more than likely if there wedding is a ways off she will probably leave him like she did before... at that point in time if he truly loved you he will come back to you b/c he will have realized what he lost.  I would say even though he is saying hurtful and mean things more than likely he isn't mad at you and is only doing what he is doing b/c he is ashamed of what he did or the crazy other women could have his cell phone and is texting it without his knowledge.  Anyways good luck and if you do happen to find another great guy in the mean time at least give them a chance maybe all of this just happened for a reason.

looks like she was an idiot and signed divorce papers without a lawyer. They probably said that he had full custody and she got nothing. Otherwise she needs to take him to court. But is she already signed everything away good luck.\n\nNever sign any important papers without a lawyer.
"He always treats you nice?  And now he's talking of marriage?  Just because the family doesn't like you (why should they, in this day and age.  And if they do, that doesn't have anything to do with him) doesn't mean you should break up!  If he asks you to marry him, and then the family expresses a dislike for you, deal with it then.  If he's willing to look past race, so should you be.  Don't worry about the family.  If they're reasonable, they will get past their prejudice, and if they aren't, you have him.  He will want you whether his family does or not. \nIf there is another reason you want to break up with him, think about that.  Why do you really want to break up with him?  And if it is because you're afraid the family won't like you, tell him!  Ask if they won't, and ask how that will affect your and his relationship.  If he feels its a problem, then marriage obviously isn't an option.  But if it isn't, then you can work things out with the family.\nLove will find a way!\nGive him a chance.  \nIf you disagree with his religion, get it out in the open.  If he insists he isnt religious, you need to think about how it will affect your relationship.  If you can't deal with that influence in your life, you need to seriously reconsider.\n""Sometimes I wish we had never met."" Why?  What is it about him?  Is it his race, religion?  You say he is nice... but...\nIt really does seem like you're ready to break up, but these seem to be rather physical reasons.  Not very deep.  If you worry about these kinds of things now, are you really ready for marriage anyway?\nThese things you have to discuss with him.  Look deeper for the reasons you wish you'd never met.  I'll bet it's something more than your race or his family or religion.\nGood luck!"

When he asks you out again.  He looks at you with intrest while you're talking to him.  When he wants to hear about you.  I remember my boyfriend, now husband of 7yrs, asked me if I wanted to go to the movies with him.  I said yes.  1 hr later, he called me and asked me if I had a boyfriend or if I was married.  He just wanted to make sure he wouldn't be causing any problems.
Yes he is using you and playing you.He also is used to everyone else paying his way.He needs to be taught how to manage his fi\nnances and fend for himself and become responsible like you sound\nyou are.Try talking to him and offering to help him.if that fails then do yourself a favor and dump him and move-things will only get worse  and not better\nGood Luck to you-you sound like a very decent person.

""" Hanging Tough""\n\nAlso, you could purchase already made album with all the fancy paper in it, a little expensive ($9.99-$14.99), but all you have to do is paste the pictures and voila!\n\nHere is a great scrapbook website: scrapbooking.com"
Some places that's true; some it isn't.  Not much of an answer, I know, but them's the facts.
She likes/fancies you.  She was asking you/your teacher because she was concerned about you.  Its time to take the next step and ask her to be your girlfriend.
Gosh I grew up with this friend.  I still am her only friend and whenever I got friends she would make it difficult for me to keep them.  Luckily I live 2000 miles away now.  \nANYWAY...I think your going to just have to bite the bullet and say Look Jane everytime I ask them to come they are always busy...so I am just not going to ask them anymore...if you want you can ask them.  \nThat way you get off the hook and she will have you stop asking, and if she really wants them to come she can call them up and invite them herselves.  Right?
......surprisingly, quite a few of them do, and it often applie's vice/versa with girls to father's as well.......
I think you should talk this over with Cali directly.  Anything we say might just make matters worse, but I have a feeling that she is looking for someone who might be a little older or at least more mature.
guys like having more than one gf , you should not be selfish - you should be his gf and not get in the way with his other gfs - i hope this helps you
You should sit her down and talk to her.  Tell her that she needs to show respect for you and your husband, and that she needs to do her share of chores.\n\nShe may be jealous of losing you to him, so try to spend some alone time with her to let her know that you do still love her.
A scrapbook of his life - gather pictures, newspaper articles and other things that have significance. For example, my grandfater turned 90 last year and spent much of World War II as a Navy doc on Alcatraz - we gathered pictures from his life, even ones with my Gma who passed away about 10 years ago - all leading up to current times. He totally loved it! We found articles in old newspapers that were relevant to him and life as he remembers it. He took it around to all of his friends at the senior center.\n\nIt doesn't have to be complicated - you can find all of the supplies you need at a local hobby shop.\n\nThat'll be a gift that you created and put effort into and when he passes, will be returned to your family as a great remembrance of his life!
Some men will do that but not all and it's do to the fact that if we don't do exactly what the women want they will probably leave or argue or something and to prevent that they will act like slaves. Some just have to put thier foot down!

He's using you.  You're giving him everything he wants with ZERO expectations in return.

Well...after a guy and I started dating for a couple of weeks, I slept with a previous boyfriend.  That was the last time I ever slept with another person.  I told the guy because I didn't want him finding out from someone else, and I felt the need to be completely honest with him because I really respected him.  Everything worked out, and the guy and I have been married for 15 years.
From a guys point of view, I would say to tell him the truth and don't hold back anything.  Anything not told will eventually end up hurting the both of you.  Depending on how he accepts the facts you tell him, will determine whether there is a future for you two.  Telling in person is better because you can tell if that person is lying or how he accepts the news by body language.
definetly. but make sure you make it clear ***if he doesnt want to that u must stay friends.**
even though i am surrounded by my family and friends i feel all alone my mother died exactly four weeks ago today and i am having some difficultly getting in the holiday spirit it just isn't the same without her she was the center piece of our family i miss my mother she was so young only forty but only the good die young they say alone isn't necessarily bad is it there are like twenty people here and i wish they would all just go away

Stop all contact with him/her; when you find your mind wandering to him/her, stop and think of something else; focus on your family and your marriage.\n\nFind something good about your spouse that attracted you to him/her in the first place.\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\nHave you done everything you can think of to salvage what's left of your marriage?\n\nDo you have any feelings at all left for your spouse, be they negative or positive?\n\nIf you answer ""yes"" to either of those questions, there is still something left, and you should work on it and give all your energy to it. Good luck."

HE LOVED IT \nHE WANTS MORE
I'm 13 too. and sometimes feel the same way when I'm stuck with my 5 y/o brother and 7 y/o sister\nI know it sucks
i have loved a lot of people trully. may be uncountable, my mum, dad, sibblings, cousin , uncles, schoolmates, neighbours and even friends i meet. and my heart has never gotten filled up. i still have room for more and more. remember Jesus loved us all and we can still love other people. this is a beautiful question.
i would probably feel jealous and competitive towards her, but then i'd get over it....it wasn't meant to be
No, smile wait for her to swing again (and she will) then catch her hand.....it will really piss her off.....kill them with kindness...you were getting slapped for being a smart ass anyway

"OMG, if you go by what the gurls say you'll NOT do the right thing at the right time and in the right place. S'ppose I tell you, in all affirmation, that she wanted a kiss from you - oh! you're surprised cos you've not really understood women. One big mistake you're making is that you're revealing your plan for her ahead before making a decision. Women like to be taken unawares. And that's the time they respect you as a ""real guy"". Let me tell you this (please don't forget), the next time you're with her move close and touch her hair and tell her she's got a fine hair. While doing that, be looking straight into her eyes while talking about some other things but still caressing her hair. The next time she looks at you straight into your eyes, give her a kiss on her lips. You'll be surprised that she'll move close and subconsciously demanding for a deeper one - trust me, it works like magic."

18 cms is about the average size.(actually 15 cms is) The function of the penis as far as sex is concerned is to deposit the sperm into a woman for fertilization. For that even a 75 cm Length is enough. So don't worry, you are absolutely normal.\n\nAll the best.\nst
just for him to love me, and show that he cares for me and always will thats all i could really ask from him, and all i could dream of him giving me (^_^)

"i know what you mean. It could be that you are more mature than them or either just not into the things that they are.\nThis has always happened to me so I ended up being a loner because I'd rather do my own thing.

Guys who are secure and confident in themselves will ask out girls they are truely attracted too. So the answer is not, definitely, yes. If he hasn't asked you out, he may just want to be your friend but, more likely, he might really be interested in you but not sure enough of himself to ask you out. If he wants too but doesn't, then you don't want him anyway. He sounds afraid, confused and frustrated to me because he is sending you mixed signals. This would suggest that he want's to ask you out but doesn't know how to, or is afraid of rejection. He probably is intimidated by your age. Sounds like an infatuation and he's trying different approaches to feel out the best way to grab your attention. I could be wrong but he doesn't sound very mature or experienced.
Go with your gut feeling, our body tells us more then we care to notice. If you feel like there's someone else there just may be, also a girl can ususally tell.
♀ hmm.....try to find out the problem tat coz you to fight with her...or not to see her when you're mad,try to cool down and talk to her nicely everytime you see her.♀
hold on... how is this suppose to get BEST ANSWERS ? lol =)\n\nto tell you the truth... \nI never had loved someone in my life. But I have been loved. But instead of havin that person love me cause I don't like him... I end up havin him hate me. (that's stupid)\nBut I really feel better without stress. And that stress is~ being loved from the person you hate.
A relationship is not built around sex.  Some people go into a relationship purely for companionship, and are still loving and happy.  It's more or less finding that woman who feels the same way about sex as you do, because otherwise sexual frustration will occur and then no one will be happy :)

How about whatever nationality the MOM is. Nanies are just another way for a child to be handed off and the parents not taking responsibility for raising thier own child(ren). The Mom could home school, and could learn another language herself at the same time.
cause they are bad boys and every girl want to say that they dated a bad boy no matter wat!!!

"The next time she says something insulting, look her right in the eye and ask ""did that make you feel better, because you just made me feel like crap""!!  Hopefully there are people around to witness it.  She'll look like the ass that she is.  Hopefully after that you can work things out together and keep the friendship."
But it is not, so why worry about that
I felt your pain a year ago...but it's going to involve lots of pain in order to get where you want to be.  \n\nRunning is the fastest way to lose fat...there is no faster way.  Now if you're anything like me...its hard to run - everything hurts afterwards.  But let me tell you how to do it.  Find a track (high schools usually have tracks); run for 30 seconds, stop and then walk for 30 seconds, do this over and over for 25 minutes. Rest on day #2.  Day #3 & #4 go back and do this over again; Day #5 Rest. Day #6 & #7 go again.  Week 2 run 40 seconds and walk 20.  Do you see a pattern here?  When you have ran 25 minutes without stopping you will see results.  When you get to 25 minutes - upper your minutes by 2 to 27.  \n\nLast year all I wanted to do is lose 20 pounds...I wound up losing 35 by running.  Remember you are only doing this 25 minutes every so often - you can allocate this short time to your health.  My resting heart beat went down to 57bpm;  my cholestrol down to 148 (something my doctor couldn't believe).\n\nI am 44 and I wear size 6 and even some 4's - this from a size 10.  Once you start running and enjoying it...your body will crave the running - you'll want to do it more.  When you start to run without stopping your side will start to hurt...keep running (just slow down) - you gotta run past that side pain...trust me it will go away.  It's your lungs expanding, this pain will subside, and your body will get use to it.\n\nOn my way home I would drive by this track that was 3.0 miles long (it's more like a running loop), and I would see so many runners and I wanted to just stop my car and run.   \n\nThere are sacrifices you must eat heathy - replace your snacks with fruit - lots of it.  And if you must eat bread - only eat one slice a day.  I ate baked potates with only a small amount of butter, and salt.  You do have to incorporate some carbs - you need this if you're going to be a runner.  The more you run, the more carbs you need - so build up to it.  \n\nI now can eat whatever I want (cookies, cakes, sodas, mexican food)...and I don't really gain weight.  However, I am now up to 6 miles and I run 4 times a week.\n\nYou gotta make the decision to do this and it looks like you're ready by just seeking advice. \n\nDon't invest in tread mills (it attacts dust and becomes a place to hang your clothes on) or any other home machine - you must get out of your comfort zone, out of your home...and exercise.  \n\nI know this is a lot - but trust me...I was NOT a runner, and I absolutely love it now.  My goal is to run a marathon (26.1 miles) before my 46 birthday.  \n\nGood Luck.

32 for another few days.  I'm glad to be over 25, but would appreciate if the clock would stop now!
What is love to me ? I think love is something that can be good and bad, and should abuse as often, when someone love you they shoul always be willing to understand and know the what is it to love. Love can also be hurtful and not used the way is should be...........
"You can't expect to have your cake and eat it to. The reason you feel tempted to lie is because you're not sure what you want, so you're trying to both keep her and cheat on her in order to indulge both your sexual desire for others and your need for security. You know in your heart that that's not really fair to her. You must decide which is more important to you: the freedom to explore the dating scene or commitment to a long-term relationship with someone you earnestly care about. Both are equally valid choices, but you can't expect someone to commit to you if you can't commit to them. So you have to choose.\n\nI would recommend talking to a therapist about this if possible. Why do you feel like moving beyond this relationship at this time? Is it simply a matter of fading physical attraction? If so, perhaps you could honestly (but tactfully) express a concern about that and suggest a mutual diet and exercize program that you two could engage in together. Is it a matter of things having grown stagnant? Maybe you both need some time to yourselves to develop separate interests while simultaneously pursuing a few new mutual interests together as well. \n\nSometimes it's as simple as spicing things up a little. A couple's massage and a weekend retreat alone could give you two time to be intimate without the stress of daily life killing the mood. Try to remember what made you attracted to her in the first place. What interests do you share together? How could you rekindle that curiosity and desire again?\n\nIn the meantime, a little white lie about some of your doubts wouldn't hurt. In other words, don't tell the woman that you've been drooling over other women. But you should be honest about feelings you're having within the relationship, such as a need for more variety and a lack of sexual desire on your part (if that's the case). As long as you approach the issue with optimism and empathy, there are ways to be honest about your feelings without hurting her unnecessarily. If, however, you decide that you really need something else, then perhaps you should suggest a temporarily separation. But give the other method a try first.\n\nOf course, there are some women who have no problem with open relationships and might let you date around on the side if you were honest about it, but I suspect that this woman probably isn't like that. Most likely she will perceive your ""dating around"" as cheating."
Why don't you tell her how you feel about her and see what she says...you never know she may like you but she is too afraid to tell you
"Well, I would just give him a note. And sumboy said on my Valentines card in Feb.......""Do you like me?"" then i knew he liked me!"
First 1.your bf tell straight up tell are we still going out if he says no then you meet your friend and tell her about the  boy that she likes and tell her that you like him and you want to go out with him(should not risk friendship over a boy)if she says yes then go out with the boy
How many times are you going to post this same stupid question???  You are up to 4 at last count.
Horny as hell, happy as ever,  and always in the mood for showing off my boobs...
u should kno if u stay that long whit him in the first place
Wish I could speak with my Dad.  He passed away 9/11/02.  I miss him very much.  He was one of a kind.  A great man.  I wished I had appreciated him more when he was alive.  \n\nHappy Father's Day, Dad.  I will always love you.
i am  a lesbian, Is a sexual and pohysicall thing..yes, is it a mental and emotional thing? YES its everything about the woman i fell in love with..who she is as a person, mentally, emotionally, physically. We have a connection i cannot even put into words.
Nope
Are you cheating,if you are you are a big jerk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Be happy you are in love and enjoy the relationship.  Any stress over it, or over thinking it will hurt the relationship if not kill it.
Go to the Gap. I am not being sarcastic. Go to Gay clubs and hair salons.
same jewlery as u would want...\nnice stuff lol
well, they don't cause either u find urself much beautiful than u are or uglier than u are just try to see urself through the eyes of others and u will find ur answer
Baby there are a few but they really wont give much help! If by any chance ur friend dosnt want to be found they can fly under the radar!! I wish U all the luck!!
Just talk to him clamly... Tell him exactly how you feel. I'm sure you did't do anything wrong guys just seem to think there gonna lose you. Good luck...
I'll definitely slap as hard as I can... :-)\nJust ask her if she is open minded about sex and if she likes some pain with pleasure. Good luck!
Uh, are you able to lean on him while he's doing the other chick?\nuh, I think not.\n\nSo you need to get a grip and realize once and for all the person you need to be leaning on is your own self !!!\nLearn to be strong for yourself.  No one is going ot make you happy better than you.\n\nTake a deep breath, and then start down a new path to independence, and loving yourself in the right way, before you are ready to love someone else.\n\nMake TWO lists.  I mean it...do this.\nList One:  What Do I Want for My Whole Life &\nWhere do I want to be exactly 10 years from now &\nMY plans to make that happen under MY OWN POWER.\n\nList Two:\nThis list is two sided > draw a line down the middle of the page\nLeft side:   What I Really Want in a Man\nRight side:  What I absolutlely will not tolerate in a man.\nKEEP THE LIST, the best place is in your bible if that is where you turn when your heart hurts... the list will remind you what you REALLY wanted.\nOn the Left side include these traits \na.  a best friend,  \nb.  someone I can really trust,  \nc.  someone I laught and have fun with, d.  someone\nd.  someone that I'm sure is honest with me\ne.  someone that turns me on, BUT I'd stay with if for some reason we couln't have sex.\n\nOn the right side ya wanna put things like \nno drugs, little alcohol, no emotional or physical abuse,\n\nOther things you want on your list somewhere is about him and his friends, him with your family, you with his family and things that are really important to you.\n\nDump this guy...he doesn't meet the TRUST test, and he doesn't meet the HONESTY test, and I'm sure he fails some other tests if you think about it.\n\nGet smart.  Know what you want, and don't accept less, or you will never have the KIND OF LOVE that will make your heart really happy.\n\nI wish you Love\nSTW
Hmmm thats a good question.....I would have to say mine is the charm of Mr Big but he has that sweet, caring value of Aidon. So its a combo of both, best of both worlds I would say.

Well, pretty much all you have to do is obtain a marriage license to get married in England. You don't have to be a citizen, but you still need the valid license.  Go here:  http://www.vs.gov.bc.ca/marriage/howto.html?SMSESSION=NO\n\nKeep any information that  you have on hand about your visits to see each other.  In case you ever want him to get a green card for the U.S., the immigration offices like to see that you have actually met and known each other for a while and that it isn't just a ploy to gain citizenship. Believe me, I know this from experience and have been in almost the exact same situation you are in.  It can be difficult, but if you love each other, hang in there and it'll work itself out:)  \n\nAs for your pets, go to this website:  http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/quarantine/index.htm\nYou shouldn't have any problems, but you will probably need statements or certificates from a vet saying the animals are in good health, no diseases, etc.  \n\nI wish you the best of luck.
"I like a girl with a nice complexion and smile, first. Then I like clean above the shoulder hair tucked just a little behind her ears. She has to have nice teeth, the whiter the better. She does not smoke, or if she does it is rarely, maybe with a beer. She drinks occasionally but does not get drunk and make a fool of herself. She has tried drugs and will not do them again because she knows herself too well to need them now. She has a nice figure, is about 5'7"" tall and weighs about 120#. She has well proportioned breasts with nice nipples that she sometimes lets show through her tops. She never dresses like a slut, she dresses just a little preppie. She never has sex until she really knows somebody but when she does she likes to get on top and fuck the hell out of her man."
Hmmm!!! That is tough. Did he give you a reason why?? I really have trouble with someone who will cheat. Then again there maybe a time that things can be worked out. I just do not see how the trust can ever be the same. What ever you choose, I wish you the very best.
stop aiming so high then and APPRECIATE wat u got!!
Hi there.  Well it goes something like this, honestly\nWe all guys want 2 kinds of woman.\nWoman #1.  A cute, sexy,slut for a girl friend who we can bang anytime and anywhere and anyway.  We are like dogs always looking and always hopeing one will jump into our lap from on where and make all our dreams come true.  This however is still a dream.  When we see a cute pretty thing 9like yo0urself0 we are intermidated first by you cuties and 2nd we are thinking that someone so cute and pretty MUST be already taken and i am just to UGLY for her to consider me. We thus think oh darn, she is taken, must be a slut and is high maintance (we go ino the sour grape mode).  Another reason why men musterbate so often and not admit it.  \nWoman #2.  A nice homely girl for a wife who we think will not walk out on us but satisfy our needs, be low maintance and give us kids and a woman who we can train in every way we want.  (the woman # 1 is out of the question because we think is a slut for a wife thus we cant order and train her our way)\n\nSummary:.  \n- You cant change or stop being cute and pretty so take matters into your own hand.  If you see a cute guy, approch him and just talk, make him drool and want to go out with you because if you talk to  him he will think his good for you otherwise you wouldnt approach him in the first place (build his self confideance before you refuse him sex...... ha ha ha).\nHope this helps.
"Well, you've got to make a decision and stick by it.  Ever heard of ""tough love"".   This sounds like my daughter at 17.  From experience, let her go.  If that's what she really wants.  What you are allowing her to do is called legal blackmail and you are not teaching her any values at all by allowing her to get away with this.  She's smart.  She knows how to work you and push all the right buttons.  You better for her own good stop using your heart to make your decisions and use your brain and do what's right for her..........  Give her a deadline to get a job.  If she is so bent on moving out,  LET HER GO!  You want her to be a viable adult, then she needs to learn.  SInce she thinks she's grown, let her be grown.   She needs to get a job and pay you rent. Or, get a job and get her own place and move out.  This will teach her some responsibility which is what she is lacking at the moment.  You have contributed to this.  You need to help her and yourself.  As long as you continue to go the way you are going, nothing is going to change.  One more thing, how did you put yourself in the position of her not having any respect for you?  Do you have a husband.  Where is her father or does he not help. I had no one and I made the same mistakes you are making.  It was a disaster. \n There is way more going on here than meets the eye with you.  Continue to make yourself the door mat and life will do nothing except get worse as you will have taught her nothing; or stop it and make the change no matter how much it hurts to do it.\nYou will help yourself and most especially your daughter."
TELL HIM.... I was in the same boat with a girl I knew many years ago.... I fell in love with her as a friend..... then, as we got closer and closer... I fell in love with her completely... and I knew she cared about me but, neither of us every told each other how we truly felt....  though we stayed friends.. I ended up moving away and we didn't keep in touch often enough.. next thing I knew.. she met a guy and they got married... I told her several years later after she'd had two children...  she told me she was in love with me but didn't think I liked her that way.\nShe would have married me... I would have married her... but we didn't tell each other how we felt until it was too late.  We're still friends.. but we don't see each other now because I think we both know what would happen.\n\nDon't wait until it's completely too late... tell him now....  if your friendship is powerful.... it'll remain that way regardless... if he feels the same way... maybe his 'current' relationship will end and he'll be with you....  but if you don't tell him, you'll regret it for the rest of your life and will always want to know.....\n\nI hope it works out for you!
im 16
Well really they dont forget they just choose to not think about it and but it out of their minds. Us women tend to hold on to things that we feel we will need to know at a later date. Men never forget they just choose not to think really.
it doesn't happen bye its self \nyou have to make it happen \nhave some effort
if it feels right for you, dont let him push you into anything you dont want to do or are not ready to do.

can you post a pic of her so we can all see how nice that is>???
There's not much you can do about it this time, but maybe next time you can see if your mom can give them directly to you so you can take them to your room.  Or maybe see if she'll buy your step-dad his own bag.  My husband and kids do it to me all the time.  It really sucks.
get a life
someone that  doenst  notice  you for  the  way you  look  he  notices  you for  your  persanality  someone  that  always wants to  be  by  your  side and  never let you go  someone  that  will  protect  you nomatter the  setuation someone  that  only  worships  and adores  you someonethat  only  thinks your  buetiful.
Of course it can and it did happen to me.

I dont think there are really stages to love......I dont think you are to young.....the first time i ever fell in love was at 13....he was my highschool sweet heart and we stayed together till I graduated highschool at 17.......Im not going to be one of those people who say you dont know what love is because i really believe you do....I know how i felt at that age about my boyfriend, and love does exsist at such a young age.....the only thing i can tell you is that people grow so much...im 24 now and i feel like everyday im growing and changing as a person........sometimes people will change in the same directions and sometimes the changes lead them apart.......just remember you are young and have so much learning to do.....Im happy you have found love, but dont forget about all the other important things in life.....good luck to you.
Losing someone you love anyway is sad,
Set a time limit for him to get it taken care of this time and if he doesn't kick him to the curb.
i really dont agree with you\n\nbeing an indian living in fiji m still holding on to my culture and all people here are doing that as well\n\ni think its a personal thing for each individual to chose what they want
Ok confused here.  If there is a guy telling you he can't be just friends then he is just trying to get into your pants.
"First of all - BLACK MEN ARE NOT ""LARGER"" than any other men. IT IS A MYTH.  I know people who've had small black coc, and had asians who had big meat. So what!!\n\nAverage size flacid is about 5 or 6 inches.  Average size erect is near 9, but men all have different sizes when erect. Some are tiny and then become huge when erect.  As for the vagina - women have different depth inside. Less than 10 inches to reach her cervex.\n\nNot too many people care that much about this stuff.  If you can't FU*K, it really doesn't matter how much meat you're packing."
shut ur mouth
well like i said to some one before all they want is ur money so they are jus gold diggers but not all girls are like that just keep lookin u will find one that wants you for you
its a good thing it would be bad if u didnt like hearing that but its obvious u like it! but if its that way with every chic then yea its weird but just from your woman its a good thing!
stress reduction, especially if it is free.
um...repeat the question plz.
Yes! It's non-threatening, an activity to do, time to walk & talk in-between rides and eating, and you get to spend time together and get to know each other.

The 52 year old is profoundly wise.\n\nBeing afraid of getting sick is no reason to pretend to fall in love.\n\nAn addictive Jones for having the attention of other people does not add meaning to your life.\n\nThere's an old, powerfully important Greek story about Diogenes.

I am in the most amazing relationship of my life right now!! I had been in a bad relationship for the past 20 years. When I finally left for good and divorced him, I met the most amazing man ever. We are now living together and engaged.\n\nHe really knows how to treat a woman like a woman, rather than a piece of meat or crap. He treats me with kindness, love, and respect, cherishes me, treas me like a God and has me on a pedestal, like I do him. We have soooooooo many things in common it still amazes me. We have just enough not in common to keep things interesting. He works long hours on a farm; I am currently unemployed but looking for a job. He has no problem supporting me during this time. We have great communication and the sex is totally awesome, amazing, fantastic, and all that--just like the whole relationship. I have never had anyone like this in my life, or treat me so great. I am sooooooooooo happy now and plan to stay that way.
Hey...gather up the girlfriends and head to the beauty school. Most beauty schools offer birthday party packages. They may include an up do, mani, pedi, facial etc. (How much damage can students do without scissors?) Anyway...my daughter and her friends LOVE it! The schools where I live call it a princess party and it usually cost $5.00 per person. Of course when you are all glammed up...go out and show cute selves off to the city. (ice cream, dinner, etc.)  Happy Birthday to you!
He has to understand that you weren't ready to say the I love you thing yet.  A lot of times real love is just understood you don't have to say it constantly.  For some reason he isn't comfortable unless he's told by you that you love him (maybe from his past mistake relationships)...  Hopefully you'll figure out what you need to do shortly.
"Well, I'm a girl and the only way that a person can improve an orgasm is to spend more time on the foreplay.  That is the build-up and the orgasm is the release.  So if the peak is higher the fall will be father and longer.\n\nAlso, make sure that the person that you are with is going to spend time with you and do all the things that you like and you do the same.  If all else fails, bring in some ""aids"" to help you out.  Not only can you have one, you can have more.  And how can that be any better?"

No, just like there are no perfect girls.  Life is an imperfect experiment and no one in it is perfect.  The perfect guy is the one you love and loves you back and together you create a relationship that is more than the sum of the two of you.

Ask her mum and sister if you think she wants to talk to you.  Ask the sister to ask her to call you.\n\nDo something really big and nice for her.  Like organise a romantic night out.  buy her flowers.  \n\nWrite her a letter that tells her how you feel.  Take your time and think about what you want to say. \n\nGood luck
You know, I have always thought that weddings and funerals were hand in hand. They are both something that I would rather not be a part of. People look at me crazy when I say that because of course there is the myth that we all want a fairytale wedding but not me...I'd rather just get married in Vegas and that be the end of it.\nI don't look at weddings being like funerals because everyone is crying. I just think it's like a funeral because everyone is gathered there and it's time out of my day when I would rather be at home and not with the people I'm with.

IF HE RELE LOVE U... U WOULD NO...IF HE STUTTERS WEN HE TALKS...IF HE SAYS HI TO U CONSTANTLY...OR IF HE LOVES EVERYTHING ABOUT U
you must be like 12.  no he shouldn't, that's retarded.  don't let some little boy control you like that.
my older brothers are fraternal twins, and, my family is friends with some one that has frtenal boy/girl twins. i babysit a set of identicle 2 year old boys.and i've known 3 sets of girl twins, 2 identicle and 1 fraternal.
It's not all about the first night!! If you are  both virgins, take it slow...it's about love, not sex, and do what comes natural, as well as communicate to each other.\n\nSex is not a magical thing that you get right the first time. A loving relationship works because sex changes and grows as your relationship does. It won't always be great, and as long as you are OK with that, it gets better with time and communication!! You have to talk to each other to learn what you like and don't like. \n\nThe best sex is when each partner focuses on pleasing the other - NOT being focused on pleasing yourself.. and great sex will come as you learn how to make each other happy.
tell him to go to \nrealdoll.com they have these dolls that look real and he can make her do what he likes with out hurting anyone...only problem is they are like $7000.00...but hey over the years a real girl will be a lot more expensive...they look so real,it's trippy...
Obviously one has deeply hurt u as is always the case. But in all honesty from experience I can say it's HARD!!!! All I can say is u can't judge them all by what one has done to you. If u must keep your distance until u feel safe but try not to push them completely away and most important give yourself time to heal.
ok i understand where ur coming from i had the same problem. i first met my dude in 6th grade and from there we became very good friends we had everything in common and had fun with each other then when we were n 11th grade. we decided to date and it was good at first but then he started acting different just like u explained with ur gf but i think u should just break off the relationship because u need to explore other options in dating... i know u love her and i know she loves u too but i think shes not ready for that commitment like u are so thats y shes pushing u away...but i know 1 thing if u 2 r meant to be then u guys will get back together in the future and it will be when ur older and ready to settle down from all the other relationships that dont work out...but for now just enjoy ur teenage life because ur too young for serious relationships because there might be other girls that u think is the one for u but not so just chill  continue being friends...GOOD LUCK
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahha\nhahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahha\nhahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahha\nhahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahha\nhahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahha\nhahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahha\nhahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahha\nhahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahha\nhahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahha\nhahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahha\nhahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahha\nhahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahha\nhahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahha\n\nThat is the funniest thing I ever heard!!!!!!!!
awe a first timer!! well iwas there once lol. like in april. the best way is to drink  A LOT of water and it takes about 30 days... so yeah i mean i was blood test and i thought they would find out but they didn;t cas thats not what they were  looking for lol.. but what ever its for i wish you the best.
just tell your bf to be him self and if your parents don't like him well that's their problem because all that matters is that you like him for who he is. I know that if i brought my gf my parents wouldn't hate her or find her weird.  you could tell your parents that they should try to get along with him. Just a suggestion
big and natural
People are trained from birth to feel that they are not worthy to have what they really want and that they are selfish if they go after it, so they tend to settle for what they think they deserve and live thier lives in misery.\n\nIt takes a lot of self confidence to say 'I want a great guy' and then turn down the guys who are not up to scratch. 'What if I really deserve a loser?' 'What if no great guy will have me or I never find him?'  is what people are thinking.
You should know by now, how dense we men are at those things. Sad to say it's one of our many failings.\nAt least he didn't forget the Birthday entirely, just the actual date,  so it could have been worse.\nAnd you do mean  a lot to him, he did remember the week of your birthday, and called you to make sure, he got the right date.\nIf he didn't care for you, would he have even bothered to ask.\nMen can remember who won the world series, in 1902  or whatever year, but birthday's anniversaries, etc, just don't stick.\nSadly as I said, that is just a guy thing.\nSo cut him some slack for forgetting the actual day, and making sure, he didn't miss it all together. \nI'm sure he'll get you a great gift and give you a great night to go along with it.

wow thats really hard. i would probably tell her in a way so she couldnt find out who i was. i would have to. how whould see feel if she kept this up and found out after she really fell for him? she needs to know before she is hurt.
You know i had a man like that too.I thought he was one of a kind guess not after hearing your story.He done the same thing but on the net .Buy porn mags and hide them in his truck or closet.I would find them and be like wtf?I liked watching porn and i had mags too and he knew i didn't care he watches it and i would love if he did it more with me not him alone how weird.And he would just keep on and eventually our sex life was nil to none.we would fight all the time over this,i would ask him why does he do this his answers were always stupid like ..(here was his fave one)...I DUNNO.....omg please!!I finally had enough i mean this man was beating his meat to a mag instead of having sex with me i just thought that was drawing the line .I told him to have his mags cook for him clean the house and take care of him i was done.And when ever he finally would want sex i told him here's a mag and i swear id throw him a bottle of lotion.hahahaha its funny now cause i dumped his crazy paper loving ass,so don't feel guilty be Glad you did it he wont stop, my ex done this for 2 years promising every time he was busted he would quit..like hell he did so i quit it for him i left and Ive never regretted since.So go on find another man your pretty enough have fun and good luck!!!
Check out these two sites ,  www.merchant-navy.net    ,  . . .  or . . .  www.allatsea.cx   .   These are both excellent sites for seafaring types and very helpull in finding info on anything nautical and could probably tell you who invented the oar . . . Good Luck .

Who is he? ill kick his a** 4 u if u want me to. just tell me who.ill do it or have josh do it. I LULAS JAS!!!
humph... well that's because sometimes a man and a woman get together and have REALLY STUPID KIDS. Like xvivaladorkx!
i think if she seems very upset about the crumbling of her previous relationship , u might want to give her a bit, but if i looks like shes gonna be just fine, go for it. ask her out, and the worst that could happen is that she says no. and thats not that bad. most likely she will say yes though, right after an ended relationships girls are pretty emotional, so just be careful with her.
Well done\n\nExcellent\n\nThant's super
I can see how that would make you feel. It's not your fault that he's here. He made the decision to move. He can't make you feel guilty about that. Maybe he's just homesick and struggling to settle in. You were here first and have an established routine. He probably feels as though he's fitting in around your life, rather than living his own. I think you're right about him getting a job though. He should get a bar job or some other sociable type of job and make some friends of his own.He can still look for other work and even attend interviews if he works evenings. He needs some structure to his life, and you both need some space from eachother. Good luck.
Thats insulting to dogs! lol..
mmm... might teach them some humility... I think that everyone should spend a whole day naked a month though. it would be fun, sometimes scarey, but interesting. it wouldbe monthly nudists day!
it depends on how both of you together tackle situations before you. anyone of you want to runaway or hide from the consequences, then the problem of breaking up of relationship sprouts.
Well it really dosen't take much to make some girls happy. Just keep in touch with her and send her different little gifts when she least expect it.
Well, depends. If he's at my bachelorette party, yes. But, if it's the man I'm going to spend the rest of my life with, no. Muscular guys tend to be a little into themselves and very cocky. They tend to be the pricks. I've experienced this and they just think they are too much. My fiance was nice and built when I met him, but now he's got a little belly, but I lOVE that belly! I really do! I am so attracted to him, without the six pack and muscular body!\n\nLooks only last while you're young anyway. Everyone ends up wrinkly and grey. Therefore, I prefer a guy who I love spending time with, and makes me laugh, because that is what will last forever, not his muscles. ;)
try telling your hus u need some time off ..maybe distance =will make the urge grow stronger
Before doing it at your wedding, he really should have come up to you both for permission. That way you could have figured out how you could make the announcement in a way that would still make it your day, but rejoice in love and committment in the room. You could have arranged them to do the asking in private and announce it at the end of the reception in a very nice way. He was out of line, but on the other hand your wedding is now special since you were a part of the history of another marriage. He did a thoughtless thing, but didn't he mean well? Did he really do it to steal your limelight, or was he just clueless and meant well?\n\nIf you really want to make announcement at his wedding, why not ask if there would be a way to do so without detracting from their big day. If you just want to do it out of spite, I would argue against it, especially if they didn't propose to spite you. It is never a good thing to do the wrong thing, even if you think you were wronged. \nThe fantasy of revenge rare holds up in reality. \n\nYou can choose to hold a grudge, or let it go and just be happy that they felt comfortable enough to share their joy on your day (ie. spin it to something positive). Life is too damn short.

Your boyfriend is who he is. If you don't like him that way--unromantic--then perhaps you two aren't a good match. It's not likely you are going to change him, and if you feel a need to change him in order for you to be happy, your future promises to be a disaster.\n\nDate and love men who are acceptable to you as they ARE, because it's just unreasonable to expect someone to change their personality for you.

Neither will giving him ""hints"" that you don't like him.  Guys don't get hints.  If he asks you, use the direct approach.  Good luck."

That's great!  Think about it.....let them all look...stare and wish they were with her.  But there is only one guy going home with her and that is YOU!  You da man!  I think you need some confidence in yourself too.  You are crazy about this girl and you know she looks hot...that's why you get jealous for others staring at the samething that you thought was hot.  But, don't forget.....if you got this hot girl....surely there are other girls that think you are a good catch too.  Guys just go to the extreme when checking out girls.  So...if you two trust each other....let it go.  Don't let that ruin what you have with her.  Enjoy what you have with her.  You got her...if she wanted to be with those other guys, she wouldn't be with you.  Let them stare...that's all their getting...a look.
I think you should...
Your question seem not just about male alone, but it is rather an universal issue.\n\nThe truth is, that every individuals makes mistakes. If one can step back a bit and see their mistake in a objective manner, having know the need of changing and developing which is good. It is possible to repair what is damaged or broken. All we need to do is to develop our empathic ability, and use it in a constructive way. And yes, one can change. It is just matter of time.
i like these 3 girls like u like those 3 guys. so id know u just need to wait a little but not to long and find the one thats right for you. dont play all 3 of them though. you'll end up with nobody.\n\ni know because i just got off phone wit my new gf! woohooooooooo\n\nbest of luck cheerios wooo hooooo
I would say that he is not wanting to commit to a relationship, all out.  Telling you how he feels about your relationship may, in his mind be committing himself for the rest of his life.  There are some guys out there like that.  If you truly love him, time will tell.  He will open up to you.  Good Luck!

nope, not really, esp if you're with the right guy, who understand how to handle 'the first time' very well. a good foreplay might be very useful.
"Define ""addicted"".  Are they looking at it every day for hours on end, or is it more of a preference (i.e., they're choosing the porn over you)?  \n\nIf they're looking at it for hours every day, then he/she has a serious problem and should probably seek therapy.  If they refuse, say goodbye and don't look back.\n\nHowever, if it's the latter, then this is a problem you could potentially work out on your own.  Rather than condemning your significant other for looking at porn, why not try to get involved?  How about initiating a fun night of porn surfing together?  Odds are they'd much prefer have someone else pleasure them than pleasure themselves."
"Can you just try to be friends and see if he feels the same way without scaring him off by saying ""I love you""?  Perhaps if he gets to know you, he'll like you, too!"
Sex cause it's not everything.... No really it's not!
what!!! I though you people only existed in porn films... don't cantact me unless you get rid of your man!
Gotta get back to you on this.\nI have always loved to be around men,\ncan't stand to  be around women and their foo foo.  or whatever....\nbe you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yes - hello!
If you are still sensitive to what your ex is doing and what his intentions are, you need to explain to him that you are not comfortable with him at this time.  Whether he is genuinely trying to be cordial and remain friends or he actually has ill intentions, this course of action should keep the two of you civil.  \n\nIf he is trying to be friends, you explain to him your position, with severe honesty, that you arent comfortable.  As a friend, he should grant you your distance until you are ready to begin a friendship type relationship.  If he has ill intentions, he will feel 'spotted' when you ask for time and should lay off.

Just take your time and do what feels right. I know it sounds simple but there is no perfect way to kiss. Think about it, when you kiss someone do you want them to think that you are just like everyone else?

Divyank, marriage should be a commitment of ones love for each other...it sounds like your chosen partner is sincere but for the wrong reasons, she needs someone that can support her, that would be you, but her heart belongs to another...I understand in some cultures marriages are arranged based on who can be the best provider, but what I hear your words speak is that you also want a loving relationship too...and thats the part that I understand...I do not feel your going to get this from your partner...her accepting without loving you is one thing, that may develop later, however, accepting your proposal and already loving someone else may not ever change...you will live with a broken heart that she can not truly mend...everyone deserves to be happy...look for a partner who loves you...and allow her to seek her own happiness elsewhere...good luck.
I lost my mom 2 years ago in july, you will regret saying what you are saying she is your mom , she kept you till you moved on , you should keep her forever till shes gone , and just enjoy her while you have her... when she passes you will be then on here asking how do i live without my mom ??
UH YES !! :)
I didnt read your question it was too long. But if you realize no one on earth is truthful all the time.
I'm on myspace, and I agree it is very popular and addicting. I believe this is b/c you can reconnect with old friends and associates, and chat with new people. Plus you can create a nice page, truly expressing the kind of person you are.

Instead of adding additional problems, why not give him a couple more days and then call him and ask if there is any thing you could do to help him out with his problem.  Don't push him away by asking him to make decisions about your relationship with him when you know he is going through a hard time.  Doing this will only push him away and is very selfish on your part.

being successful has many meanings but to me is not money but raising a family with values that will keep them on the straght and narrow.......have a heart not be so selfish.....be caring .......am 46 and  married 25 yrs with five children what more is there to life..Family is what it is all about.
yeah i do like to hide it, i like to test the guy too
it all depends on how well you know him. find out everything about him, but do it discretely. only then will you what to do, and it wouldn't hurt to find out from his friends if he likes you as well. cuz there is no point to baring your heart to him, if he doesn't feel the same way about you, now is there? just sit back and relax and do your homework on the guy, it will be that much better, trust me.

"Not enough info to answer this question.  If he is your son, why aren't you asking him?

If you are divorced from her, he might feel that he needs to protect her since the world isn't always safe for women.\n\nHe probably pays rent and helps her to afford the place.

Well i also have seen this kind of thing happening. But everyone has their own way. One can hav something else in their mind but that doesnt mean that boyz and galz cant be friends.
This will take time. You have past issues and baggage and pain to deal with and heal from. Take it slow and don't rush into anything. Get counseling if you need it too! Be friends with a person and get to know them very well before ever commiting in marriage again. Make sure to learn from the mistakes you made in your first marriage and vow in your heart to not repeat them!
For me.... Smart = good looking. When I can carry on intelligent, interesting conversation, with a man, they seem to become better looking all the time. I also like to be the better looking one of the couple...   :))
"Though generally,people think a relationship is losing its charm when your partner says they want a break, but i beg to differ.It's true that too much nearness can be killing for the relationship,even for those who love each other too much to be without their partner.Sometime one needs to be with oneself only,to be in solace for some time..so to maintain their freedom some people like to take a break now and then.But it does only revive their relationships,when they come back.A break doesn't necessarily means a ""break-up""."

"story from little box:-\n\nIt's meaningful....\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a teacher and his student lying down under a big tree near a big grass area. Then, suddenly, the student asked the teacher,\n\nStudent : Teacher, I'm confused, how can we find our soul-mate? Could you please help me?\n\nTeacher : (Silent for few second, than he answered)\n\nWell, it's a pretty hard and easy question.\n\nStudent : (Thinking hard) Huh???\n\nTeacher : Look on that way, there are a lot of grass there, why don't you walk there but please never walk backward, just walk straight ahead. On your way, try to find a beautiful grass and pick it up then give it to me. But just one.\n\nStudent : Well, ok then... wait for me... (walked straight ahead to the grass field).\n\nA few minutes later...\n\nStudent : I'm back.\n\nTeacher : Em, well I don't see any beautiful grass on your hand.\n\nStudent : On my journey, I found few beautiful grass, but I thought that I would find a better one, so I didn't pick it up. But I didn't realize that I'm at the end of the field, and I hadn't picked up any. Because you told me not to go back, so I didn't go back.\n\nTeacher : That's what happened in real life.\n\nWhat is the message of this story?\n\n* Grass - is people around you\n* Beautiful Grass - is people that attract you\n* Grass Field - is time\n* In looking for your soulmate, please don't always\ncompare and hope that there will be a better one. By\ndoing that, you'll waste your lifetime, cause remember\n\n""Time Never Goes Back"".\n\nIt applies the same in finding your ideal life partner, your suitable career or business, therefore the morale is LOVE & grab hold of the opportunity that you have now, don't waste time!"

It's BDSM, and it's the abbreviation for 'bondage domination submission masochism'. Basically, if it;s a story and some one gets tied up in a sexual way or spanked, it's BDSM. But this isn't a family topic...
It's really your decision, but consider the following:\n\n1. Do not let your parents manipulate you by telling you that by being yourself and being happy, you are making them ill. Be considerate, of course, but they have to deal with their own feelings and mature in life still at their age.\n\n2. Introspect, and make sure that you are not doing this just to be a little rebel. Perhaps your parents have such a tight leash on you that you feel that you have to do something drastic in order to assert your independence as an adult. If this is a large part of your case, you would marry for the wrong reason, and very well have problems down the road.\n\n3. Are you sure that the fact that you are told not to marry her does not make you more interested in her than you would otherwise be? Introspect.\n\n4. If you not marry her, how do you honestly think that you would feel about that decision many years from now? Do you think that you would deeply regret it, or do you think that you would have warm feelings for her but be nonetheless more or less happy with another sweet girl? Be honest with yourself; you are best able to make a good and honest decision.
ok if u want to talk to the guy talk to him but the best thing to do is wait for him to talk to u because if you wait for him to talk to u then u will kno if he likes u or not because if he likes u then he will talk to u first but if he dosnt like u then he wont talk to u at all but if u like the guy and u want to talk to him then u go right ahead and talk to him but i would wait for him to talk to u and if he says hi to u then ya say hi back and smile
Well... some guys are lazy and new to romance. Plus, only girly guys are romantic.
No not at all. If you got the promotion your boss probably thought that you were better for it. I mean don't go rubbing it in her face but be happy about it. It's a step up for you. Maybe this wasn't the right move for her. But encourage her an let her know that she will probably get a promotion of some sort soon enough. Hope I helped.
"Your friend may need to talk to a professional to help with her mood.  \nI do have to question why she would think this guy is perfect when she believes he was cheating on her?\nTell her you're worried about her, don't trash the boyfriend, she will only feel the need to defend him.  If she feels like talking about him tell her you're willing, but only so much, be careful of ""poor baby syndrome"".  Try finding something fun to do that will lift her mood."
Not all parents accept what their kids want.  You friend has to do what HE wants.  If he keeps following what his parents want, he'll never be happy.  You just be there for him, as it seems you have been.  Sounds like you're a very good friend, and that's exactly what he needs right now!
Because *not to be sexist* women are very paranoid about EVERYTHING.
"Yes, the eyes are the window to the soul. Could it be possible that you are mis-reading their eyes? Get a guy friend and talk to him one on one about it. See what he says....even have him do some things with his eyes, and see if you can ""read"" him correctly.....just for practice. Best of Luck to you!"
No one can steal your boyfriend unless he wants to be stolen. If he does, you are better off without him. Question: why would he be interested in your cousin? Ans. He has unmet needs. You need to have this discussion soon. Is this relationship--you and he--balanced, mutually fulfilling and exciting? If not, then, you must decide if you are willing and capable of meeting those needs. He must also determine if he's willing and capable of meeting your needs, too.\nAs for your cousin and her jealousy; just remember that envy is one of the most effective ways to self-destruct.
patience, gentleness, kindness, thoughtfulness, but also be willing and able to fight for the girl (not literally), and be her warrior.\n\nGirls want a guy that will love them even with all of their faults and shortcomings. A guy that will take care of them when they are throwing up sick with puffy eyes, and he'll still tell her she looks beautiful.\n\nYep...I got my guy.
First of all Congrats! I am celebrating my sons next month! I'd pick a theme...which you said you have...check either some party shops or online stores like birthdayinabox.com and see what is out there to go with your theme...then buy some things to decorate, order a cake and use plain cheaper plates, napkins ect that color coordinate with your theme. Mail out some invitations...of course it will mostly be family probably...and even send them to people who are out of state...even if they cannot come they will most likely send gifts, esp for a 1st Birthday. Then the day of the party, set up, lay out some snacks (oh-plan the time for when your child is in a good mood and not around a meal that way you can just provide finger foods rather than a meal). Make a timeline for the party to keep it flowing...and SMILE! It'll be a blast no matter what...oh-another thing I'm doing...if you either don't mind the mess, or plan it for outdoors...make you child a special cake for them to devour and play in :-) Have fun!
a weekend away.. enjoying each others company!
It is his choice to buy cigarettes, light up and smoke them. No one is holding a gun to his head and forcing him to do this. He keeps that smoking up and it will be the death of him yet. He is not immune to lung cancer or emphysema, these diseases are not prejudice.  He has his top priorites all wrong and he needs to decide what's more important...his smoking or his own health and his family.
this is very fair not greedy
Usually you can tell if the woman is really turned on or not by noticing her body reactions.  When a woman is about to orgasm she may get a red flush on her chest just below her neck.  Her breasts increase in size.   The muscles of her body tense up and when the orgasm come they are suddenly released.   You should also be able to feel the contractions of her vagina if her vaginal muscles are strong enough.   Of course she can fake that by squeezing them, but she has to really be trying to fake if she can remember to squeeze her vaginal muscles too.
oh hunnn thats something you really should talk about to her even if your putting your friendship on the line because if you don't your more likely to lose her and the jelous thing happens with all friends you have really got to let her knows whats going on inside and ahh amanda didn't help much sorry
"I don't think it has anything to do with your height as you're almost 5'2"" tall and that's not so unusual for women. You're young and you're committed to your values in life and I suspect these are the two main contributors to having yet met the right man to date. There are literally thousands of men in the world who would be thrilled to meet a young woman with your views, beliefs and outlook on life and I feel certain that if you hold onto these things then you will meet the right man someday. Possibly the fact that you live where you do could be limiting your exposure to the right kind of men for you. I'm sure you're a wonderfully sweet and articulate young woman so continue to believe in yourself and let the right man find you.\n\nBest Wishes !"
i totally believe in fate that everything happens for a reason..atleast in my life it just seems to work out that way..it sounds crazy and alot of ppl dont believe in it but i sure do and i encourage others to believe it!
yes.

Well go back to him and be honest. Tell him you said Yes but you felt bad but you know your just not that into him. It's better to be honest then lead somone on.
If you're living with your aunt, and under her roof and care, then you have a responsibility to follow her rules.  Period.
I sorta get what you are trying to ask here?well,that friend,isn,t a true and real friend do to their actions,that sister,saying blood thicker then water,cool(family but there are limits in self when it comes down to choices in our life,i,d break it down to them how you feel about,and if don,t correct,well then you will know clearer the next step!in dealing with the two at a distance or when  you can.The changes has to come from them?
"You can go to Yahoo ""Romance"" rooms. Under ""Romance"" categroy, you will find plenty of specific rooms which specialises in Adult categories. You may visit those specific chat rooms. But i would warn you, you are more likely to meet some freaks who would invite you to their web links where they promise to go nude...but its a dirty trick. You would be lucky if you really find someone who is equally eager to have cyber sex with you"
Just talk to him a lot and get to know him.  Once you know him a bit better then ask him if he wants to go do something with you that you know he enjoys.
Trains, Buses and Ferry's if that is what it takes to keep it together.  Distance is just space, Love closes gaps as long as both people are moving towards each other in Love.
VanWinkle is correct.\n\nEach nation has their own rules for immigration and you must comply with those rules. Your desire has nothing to do with it if you do not meet their requirements.

ive had this happen to me a couple of time but i dont think its a huge problem it can be triggered by change of eating pattern if you arent getting enough or if you have an infection but sometimes it just happens...\n\ngive it a couple more weeks but if you are really worried about it now go to the doc and see if you could have an infection
You have to show her your junk.  If its really big then definitely offer to let her see it if she wants.

There is a James Dewight Patterson B/D 05/04/1949 living in Pasadena Texas I have the address and phone number if that was his middle name. He is married though. You can e-mail me for the address and phone number.
"Cease conversing with this person immediately. It does indeed sound like she is fixin' to try to take you for financial a ride. I don't know if there is a phone number to report this to, but I think it could be a good life experience for you. I DO know that if you send her any $ you will never get rid of her. I don't think you really want to become her ""rich benefactor"". But you need to get out now. No explanations are necessary.....you can just be conveniently too busy to talk. It may take a little time, but she will eventually get the message that you've moved on and she will too."
my mum is very sick with lung cancer  i am very upset
I dont understand why people are saying no.. its not like he moved away cause he doesnt love you right? he dumped you cause hes moving... If thats the case then try to make it work!! nothing wrong with giving it a shot... I lived over an hour away from my bf and we made it work until last november whe nwe decided to move in together... Just becuase he is busy doesnt mean that he doesnt think about you.. And if you remained together in the past.. you already kno what will happen emotional wise.. Yeah your phone bill might get a bit higher... If thats the case, switch phone plans or talk online (voice chat is the way to go baby!).. if you really love him.. tell him you dont want to break up and that you still wanna be with him even tho he is a bit far off.. If your willing to put that much into it the first time... why give up now! he might be the one!
"I had a '72 Ford Torino back in the day. I was out on a date with my future wife. We were sitting in the car talking, and I had to fart SO BAD. So I told her I had to go outside and get some ""fresh air"". I was stupid enough to sit on the hood of my car, and let 'er rip. Those old cars have solid metal hoods...well, the fart was strong enough to rattle the hood. I turned around and my wife was doubled over in the car laughing...quite embarrassing."
"What difference does it make? All girls (over 14) have a ""boyfriend.""\n\nI don't recall ever meeting a woman that did not claim to have a ""boyfriend.""\n\nIf you are going to let that stop you, you might want to buy one of those blow-up dolls, you'll need it."
depending on her age and personality, you basically can't.  she will find her own way eventually anyway and learn to reserve her opinions until she has all the facts.  in the meantime you could always encourage her to join a debate team-or consider law school! :-)
Number one, you have to make a decision, is your boyfriend worth having your parents mad at you. If he is then stay with him. You should talk to your parents and see if they will tell you why they don't like him, maybe there is a really good reason. I wish you luck. Be careful of your decisions.
Not yucky, but like crack it is very addicting. Once you start doing it you will just want to do it all the time.  ok.. so I'm bored and just saying any old thing. I still get 2 points! \n\nKiss away.. you'll be fine.
I feel like that sometimes. The best thing for you to do is to set some goals for your self and try to achieve them. Try your best to be happy for your friends and remind your self that they will be happy for you when you suceed.
wats to complain about? its so much fun!!
"Love is . . .not having to ask.  Of course you will never know if you don't ask.  What? you think she is going to just act like she is not interested, and then BAM say, ""I love you?""  You could get sneaky and have someone else ask her.  Of course, that's not a good way to start a relationship.   You want open honest communication in your marriage?  Then you better start practicing now - tell her how you feel and ask her how she feels - you probably would even have to ask!"
hopefully not,go away with your stupid @$$ questions about your boyfriend, i hope they keep his butt in there
get on the Pa website. PApowerport and look up divorce or free legal services. Call them and talk to them. If it is a no fault divorce it will go quicker..good luck

You know what, Flowergirl?\n\nWho cares?  The way I see it, if you have a brotha that acts like this, you don't want him anyway!  Tell him to keep it moving so you can see your way clearly to the well-adjusted brothas that will honor and treat you like a queen.\n\nDon't rule out other races either.  Yes, I married a wonderful Black man, but good men are hard to find in any race, so do not limit yourself!
Both men and women change as a relationship ages.  It's human nature.  Sometimes the changes are for the best, often not.  Have you ever heard that familiarity breeds contempt?  What you are describing is something like that.

There is nothing wrong with explaining the situation to him and asking him if he would like to join you some evening.  This tells him that you care enough to not only explain what is going on in your life but to include him.
"Questions like yours make me want to run outside and hang my American flag...{hang on..be right back}.......OK. Your 25, Good job, ???? Move out!!  Be with your 28yr old broke guy who doesn't speak your language..I know plenty of people that get married with less going for them than that.  It's your life you poor sweet thing. Your parents will get over it...And if they don't.. You will. Be happy!! Good Luck!!!         Or, listen to your parents..marry some idiot you don't love, and be miserable the rest of your life and wonder...What if? The choice is easy.   Oh, and one more thing..You'll get over that ""Money doesn't matter, Love matters""  thing...Maybe that's why his parents like you so much... They want the bum out of the house! {just kidding}."
Physically....hips, eyes and smile. Personality wise, sense of humor and confidence are the sexiest in a woman to me
Hey, I'm a tall female too. I'm 5'11 and I get the same reaction when I walk into a room.  Don't feel uncomfortable, tall women are intimidating to others. Not freakish. Just walk with your back straight and stride those long sexy legs across the floor. Hell, make eye contact with everyone who stares you. (Little secret..if they don't look away, they are NOT thinking anything bad about you)\n\nAs for men being attracted to taller women.....men don't give a damn as long you're hot.(Remember beauty is in the eye of the beholder) I've had quite a few boyfriends that were shorter than me. They told me it made them feel like a pimp to have some sexy eye candy on their arm. Most people will be like how in the hell did he get her???\n\nBut in the end its your choice...if you feel uncomfortable having a boyfriend shorter than you....don't settle. Because there are some damn fine tall men out there. A couple of years ago I just got tired of dating men shorter than me....I swore them off. \n\nHoney, I have NO problems finding someone taller than me. My man now is about 6'1.\n\nRemember tall is BEAUTIFUL
You have to do research on her likes and dislikes and just talk about the things she likes or is involved in. Just go ahead and speak out!!
because cheating is wrong and it hurt ppl. maybe you should write an letter and mail it to him and not sign it. wouldn't you want to know if it was you/

"Of course.  Why would you want to miss out on a great time.  Just call him up and say ""Hey whats crackalackin?  What to go out and have some fun with me?""  If he says no then just say okay, well if ya change your mind holler at me.   Good luck"
It's just hormones and natural to have the urge for sexual gradification. Don't give in to it if you don't love this guy. Wait for the right time with the person you love.

While there are some girls who truly do like the feeling of a really giant penis inside of them, the vast majority do not.\n\nMen are FAR more concerned with penis size than women are, on the whole.\n\nThe truth is that very few women can reach orgasm from penetration alone, regardless of the size of the penis doing the penetration.  In fact, because a penis that is too large can be painful, a larger penis can sometimes prevent a girl who ordinarily CAN reach orgasm from penetration alone from being able to with the larger penis inside of her.\n\nThe truth is that as long as your penis is adequate to get the job done, you will be able to keep most women as satisfied as any larger man could.  And for the rare girl who would truly like to be stretched, you can always bring out a toy of some kind – that can be LOTS of fun.\n\nThe truth is that most women require direct clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm, which most men are not going to do with their penis anyway.  Most of the time direct clitoral stimulation comes from a finger, or a tongue, or a toy.  If you can learn how to properly stimulate a girl’s clitoris, you will be able to satisfy her MUCH more than you can through penetration.\n\nBesides – a smaller penis is always easier to swallow than a bigger one.
Tell her you are not interested in her. Could you be sending her mixed signals? If not then you will have to make it clear to her that you have moved on with your life. Can you speak to one of her Friends and ask them to explain to her? Good luck!
Yes you're a weirdo. Happy now?
all that it means is that you my friend are a fine looking girl \ndont even worry about it i swear from a man perspective its a natural reaction\ntake it as a complement
How did you mess it up? Theres a way to fix it just have to think of where you will be and then make your decision.
Women have always been more affectionate to each other. It is accepted if two women are touchy and feelly with each other  its  never  questioned. Guys are not naturally physically close with other men. No touching, no way. For instance a girl can easily sit on a (girl)friends lap if there are no seats but hey, a guy will stand until the end of time before he plops down on his buddy. So with all that freedom, women don't think it is wrong on the same level men do. So they get closer and closer then slap! Hey, I'm not complaining. I say give women all the freedom they want just as long as they don't turn dikish and grow a mullet and leave the men out in the cold.
"You should start to communicate with her.Take one day at a time and see what the furture will bring you both. Don""t let a day go by without knowing that a relationship could have blossom.Take one step at a time.You still have your life ahead of you.so go make the best of it.The reason so many relationship fail is because of communication.."
no. just because i know that they are doing it doesn't mean that i have to allow it or condone it, especially in my own home. some people think that if you know that they are going to do it anyway, why not let them do it where you know they will be safe. this is an absentee parent point of view. just because you let them do it in your home, it doesn't mean that they are going to be safe, or not do it outside of the home. as long as my children live under my roof, they will abide by my rules. they are not difficult, but they are set to protect them. if they don't like it, they can pray that their 18th birthday comes sooner.
Boy likes girl.  Wrong?  NO!
you didn't mention how old you were, I'm in the same situation I'm 27 and I think my ex-gf gave up on me by saying she just wants to be friends, that's the easiest way out for you, think about your future, do you have a future with him? Does he have goals? Could he be a good father? If you can picture yourself with him and happy in the future then stay with him, if not then just tell him you want to be friends that way he won't be let down hard
He just wants to have a sexual experience with you. If you want a serious relationship, you might have to drop him now. If he's still around, the good guys attracted to you will freak out. You will loose your best opportunity. As a rule, you can't go out with more than a guy at one time. So you have to choose the best guy and spend time with him.
sounds like your mom is either going through a lot of stress or she is so hard on you because she doesn't want you to make  the mistakes she might of made.Maybe its not that she doesn't trust you,maybe she doesn't trust other people with you.There are some hateful people in the world,thats bad to say,but true.It could be that your mom is trying so hard to protect you from that part.Don't take it so hard.But the first step to finding out what the problem is,is the source.Ask your mom what is wrong or if there is something that you can do to help.Does she take care of you alone?She may be a little bit bitter at having to do that.Talk to her and help her out around the house as much as possible.
so.... whats the big deal? did you know that she's supposed to be your fiance because of love, not blonde/brunette/black or lipstick? if you did, you wouldn't ask such a kiddish question. or maybe you're just joking, right??
i have messanger.. its way better than msn by far and aol i heard wrecks ur computer so yea... and i love it... u should get it...trust me, its worth it.. but make sure u get the new version where u can call the computer and all that cool stuff.. its way way way better than the old version trust me..... :-)
I don't know.
I don't think his being goth has anything to do with his supposed lack of emotions. For whatever reason some guys have a super hard time showing emotion... period.. and some guys go complete drama queen about it (aka emo)\n\nTalk to your guy. Tell him that you care about him and that you feel like maybe he is shutting you out when he doesn't speak to you or let you see emotion from him.\n\nCommunication's the key to a good relationship. Maybe he doesn't realize that the way he acts bothers you.
no, not really
I was 16 an he was 23. Big mistake too! You would have thought with him being older he would have known more. He better be glad he was the first or he might have gotten embarrassed.
No
Be honest and straightforward. If they don't feel the same way move on....
if he loves you and doesn't want anyother why did he leave you???
validation is a big part of it - they want to think that they are attractive, especially to younger women.\nusually in marriage, sex declines in frequency and intensity over the years, especially when there are children to take care of. men may look elsewhere to re-experience the excitement and passion that they had earlier in their relationship.
The knowledge that that person is controlling is the first step.  If they are your parents, you should obey them- they are probably just wanting to protect you.  If it is a sibling, don't let them- you have just as much rights as they do- you don't have to argue with them, but don't let them manipulate you either.  If anyone is abusing you however, you need to get away from them and tell someone you can talk to.
I know this is a joke........................to marry ...........the other party has to say I do.....................do you think a fox can understand.........I want you to think over the question you ask ..........and get real with life...............................and that is not a joke
I have met a few with great luck!   Remember to always meet in a public place and don't give out too much information!

Using protection doesn't always work so first off, take him/her to a nursery (maybe a church nursery so she can help out) and have babysit actually babies.  Let him/her see what it's like to be a young mom/dad.  Also show him/her pictures of what STD's can do to you and educate him/her on it.  Then try the religious route.  Yes, if you ask for forgiveness, and are sincere, you'll be forgiven but what if, Heaven forbid, you got hit by a car and passed on before you could ask God to forgive you?  Do you want to spend eternity in Hell for having sex?!?\nIf none of that works, lock him/her in his/her room until he/she is eighteen.
"This is an example of the pot calling the kettle black (no pun intended).\n\nIn order to take the attention away from himself (the lazy white man), he will put down someone else or another race and this helps him to look ""better"" though in reality, he is not.\nIt is a cheap shot at best.\n\nSounds like a person who would not be worth my time."
Haha....all this talk of girls being better in bed made me laugh.  Most guys are the dominant ones, which means we have to do most of the work (which is fine).  So until women do more of the work in bed, I will stick with saying guys are better in the sack!
check out stacey smile you can see the ginger hairs in the gaps of her teeth.
About 2 in a half years into my marriage, I thought it was over! My husband had no respect for me, was constantly jealous and controlling. I became mean, and stopped caring about us. We both started saying hateful harsh words, and almost gave up. We split up for a short time, and realized what a mistake it was. I truly think, sometimes is takes something big to wake a marriage up! It didn't take long for the both of us to realize what we were doing. Learn to respect each other, listen to each other, and fight fair. If you need to make the first move on talking about saving the marriage, please do it. It's not worth it to be stubborn, and hold grudges. Life is too short. If you feel that knot in your stomach, and deep pain in your heart when things aren't right between you and your spouse, then it's true love. It's probably your soul mate. Love is worth fighting for, it gets better as time goes on. Sometimes you have to go through some rough times to get there. Good luck hun....:)
Chicks like you ruin good guy. Ladies here is the reason why some guys that were nice turn into jerks\n\nYou know what dump your bf, less stress on him, then go to a batchleor party and get your knees and snob every knob there casue then you'll be what you sound like a big s(ut.
"A little discipline??  \n\nWe always put ours in time out.  We also don't mind a good old fashioned spanking either.  We take our 5 year olds nintendo and put it in time out when he is being unreasonable.  This seems to make him really upset.  Whichever method you use, be consistent.  I find that my two walk all over me when I start making threats and not following through.  So they get me back on track every now and again.\n\nSomething we do for good behavior is a ""Star Jar""\nWhen they do something good they get a ball in their jar.  But, if they do something bad they have to take the ball out (they hate this).  When the jar is full, I take them to the dollar store and let them purchase something for a dollar."

"I live in Miami.  I am involved with a Cuban that is already here.  \n\n\nI think that your answer has more to do with marrying an immigrant from a country that sucks instead of specifically ""Cuban.""   \n\nIn general, such people may be more inclined to do what they have to do to get out of their sucky country.  Will the person be grateful?  Maybe.   Can people learn to love?  Maybe.\n\nThe biggest problem is that they were raised in horrible, communist dictatorship.  Their value system and perspective on life is very different from you or at least what your question suggests -- a romantic, love based value system.   \n\nThe United States is very wealthy and we are very soft. We dont know about survival in the United States - try living in Albania, Afganistan, Rwanda, or Cuba.  \n\nHope that this helps."

you want to use waht's called dental dam when having oral sex on a female. it's like a flavored comdom , but cut into a sheet. its kinda harder to find then a flavored condom, but if you can't find one you can use cerran-wrap...will work just as well and still protect you from STD'S
You can't force forgiveness.  In time, she'll realize what she's lost and that she is the one that should be asking for forgiveness.   \n\nYou have already put up with a lot, and as long as you have done the right thing by seeking forgiveness for your wrong doings, then you shouldn't be too concerned if she has or hasn't forgiven you.   \n\nShe may have already forgiven you, but is too embarassed to admit it to you.... OR  she could be a VERY bitter person and talk herslef into not forgiving you..ever...  But it's not up to you.

Wait until he asks you out. In the mean time try to intise him and play hard to get.

"She is sadistic and heartless.  She's lying if she's telling you that she didn't realize what she had in her hand was a living, breathing, struggling animal.  Cats don't lie inert while people pick them up and carry them to a window and throw them out.  The cat would've moved around in her hand(s).  She's a liar and cruel.  If she will treat a helpless animal like that, how do you think she'll eventually treat you?\n\nThat being said, ""Accidentally"" sleeping with her sister?  Come on!  She should've thrown YOU out the window."
no no and no
I thinkt that it's at least normal that it hurts - if a little or a lot differs from person to person and from situation to situation.\n\nBut for me, the most important thing is, that it has to be the right person you're with and that you are as relaxed as you can be.\n\nI was very afraid, too - but my partner was so nice and grateful for what I was giving him, that even *if* I was in a lot of pain - and it hurt a lot - I was *proud* that I could give it to him and even enjoyed it because I *wanted* to be with him.\n\nSo it hurt - for me, it hurt a lot even though he was very gentle - but the pain didn't really matter to me because what mattered was that we had this special moment of closeness - and that was, what mattered, not the pain, that I knew would go away soon. \n\nAnd what is physical pain when you love someone for the first time!\n\nDon't be too afraid. Just don't hurry things. Wait for the right boy /man and than, take a lot of time. \n\nSex can be wonderful even if you are in pain (!) \n\nWhen it is the right person and when you know that he loves you and that he knows what you are giving to him in this moments.
What should you do? Forget her?\n\nHell yes forget her.  She's with someone else. You need to learn now, that there are going to be times when you meet someone that you just can't be with. Either they're involved or you may be.  Get over it.\n\nSounds like you're still in school.  Guess what!  In ten years she won't matter anyway. You should give you friend the same advice.  Move on!
clearly there is only one appropriate course of action - set up a menage a trois.
I knew a guy called robin duggan back in primary school in dublin.\n(if you're related to him, dont bother finding him, he bullied me)
"I'll give anyone a chance. Usually, the guys who at first I'm like ""eh.."" with are the ones who I am eventually extremely attracted to. A lot of it is in the personality and the way that they talk, carry themselves, act, etc. For example, when I first saw my boyfriend, I didn't think he was that attractive. 3 months later after I got to know him, I became very attracted to him and now I think he's the handsomest man in the world."
go to a chat room
There is much more to a relationship than affection.  Personally i love affection, but there are those that are affectionate, and they lead healthy strong relationship. The key is the connection between the two in the relationship.  If one person lives for affection and the other hates it well then that's a recipe for disaster. \n\nThen on the other hand if the person feels other things are important in the relationship like kindness or emotional support or even financial support. They the relationship will be fine.. \n\nIt really boils down to the individuals in the relationship. There dozens of things that make people compatible and incompatible. Affection is just one aspect... Good luck.
We need to know what information you want.\nBasically, guys are much more simple than women give us credit for. Food, sex and respect is what we want. We need some peace and quiet after work and are sometimes at our worst at that time.

"You can't make the hurt go away, so don't try.,  \n\nTell your friend that you knows she is hurting, that you won't say anything cliche'd, like ""I know how you feel,"" because in fact you DON'T know how she feels.  So tell her you are there for her.  She can talk to you if she wants.  She can be bitchy if she wants.  She can ignore you if she wants.  Whatever it takes, you are okay with that.  \n\nLet her know that the one thing she can count on, no matter what, is that you will be her friend."
keep looking at her for sometime and then just go and give her a smile. and tell her about ur feelings.\nsimple!
no not really personally i think you shouldget out 7 meet someone in person not on the internet its better for the relationship good luck though
i dont know both of my exwives stole everything from me.
being in love is like throwing qall your feelings in a big bowl and mixing them up together and then experiencing them all at once.......people think being in love is one big happy feeling and thats justg not true it is a wide mixture of feelings from being happy to being sad, from being secure to bering anxious, from being hurt to being ecstatic, if someone can move you to all these extremes , then theres a good chance your in love
Masturbation isn't the bad thing to practice. On contrary, it helps. I just don't know why it bothers you so much. It should bother you if he's doing that in front of you - then you might tell him not to..But he doesn't do anything wrong in general..
pune.
When your birthday comes around, tell them your birthday wish........that is for them to stop calling you annoying nicknames.  That would be the best birthday gifts from them.
can you handle long distance relationships. do you like this person enough to hold on. if the answer is yes you will maybe have to pc or txt and see each other just now and then.
Just like guys can tell if a girl is 'needy', girls can tell if a guy is 'needy'.  It's just the way things are.  Have you ever gone out?  Did you ever do homework at the library together?  Go somewhere with a group so she would feel comfortable going out?  One-on-one can get intense, especially if one is 'needy'.\n\nLandslide has it correct.  If she just won't be more than friends, hang out with her to meet her friends.  Good way of making contacts.  If her friends like you, she just may look at you from a different perspective.\n\nDON'T STALK HER.  That's bad news these days.
it could be anything
What are your feelings for him? why did he do it? There are many different situations. If you both love each other you can work it out. If it happens again then you should definately leave him.\n\nGood Luck
People dont want to set their friends up because if it doesnt work out you cant put the two people in the same room together and not feel akward. They dont want to have to tiptoe around both of the people and hear about it all later. It all comes down to avoiding the conflict of the situation.
yes, it could... but it totally depends on u guys... in the time of business u may be lovy-dowey or flirty with each other... if there is an issue of voting u guys will say the same thing to make the other person happy.. if u break up, then it would be so hard to keep the band together....
Don't go around her anymore. I realize that she is family, though I don't quite understand how she is related unless she is your brother's wife or your husbands' brother's wife. \n\nAs far as her flirting, there isn't much you can do. If she knows it bothers you, she will do it more often. When there are family things going on, stay close to your husband or just let him deal with her if she comes onto him. If it's his brother's wife, maybe your husband can talk to his brother. I doubt she is really after your husband, she is just out to make you mad. Sounds like she is doing a good job too.\n\nLike you would tell a kid when someone is bugging them, ignore her. After she sees you aren't going to take the bait, she should stop. \n\nGood Luck
if he really loved you in the meaning of what believe love to be... he would do whatever it took to be with you - that is my belief.  And if he doesn't do that, then he never really loved you at all.
you can love your parents\nyou can love your siblings\nyou can love your puppy\nyou can love a certain kind of food\nyou can love a man/woman\n\ni think these are all different types of loves one person can have.
NO YOU SHOULD never HIT anyone.\nHe told you the truth and that's amazing.  God why would you want to hit a kid for telling the truth.  I have a seven year old to, if he told me i wold be proud that he told me.  Now in my head I would be pissed off.  I would talk to him about it.  Ask him how it tasted.  \nMy grandfather made my smoke a cigar and that turned her off for sure.\n\ngood luck
Well let him go to this 'girl' Once he finds out he doesn't like her.....he will crawl his way back into your good books.......use him good as your slave and tease the shite out of him.  Make him to your errands on promise you will let him get with you later that day then break that promise..........hahah what a loser......use him as the slave he should be.
he will get over his shyness and i think thats agreat quality.
"working at a hair shop, everyone had to have a nick, they made mine ""kiwi"". at another job they called me scrappy, after scrappy do."
I think there is no other way than talking to your boyfriend about it. Tell him that you want to talk honestly, and ask what he expects from a relationship with you. Tell him also what you expect from him. Maybe he is talking in a funny way because of his type of character. Talk to him about it
"tell her just that. ""look (name) I love you and you know it. I believe you when you say you love me and I hate seeing you hurt yourself like this. Please come back to me."""
what r u doing?
No, but I do fantasize about  it when I'm having sex, it turns me on, although I don't' think I could ever actually do it.
hell no............
"It's because they don't care.\n\nAt least when they're with their guy friends.  Guys don't talk like ""Oh, I miss my girlfriend"" or, ""Oh, I gotta call and see how my girl's doing"" when they're hanging out together.  When guys say something like this, his friends call him ""P**sy whipped"".\nSo they simply forget about you during those times and act all tough or at least unconcerned about you, the girlfriend.\n\nAnd when they're with you, oh yes, they really care about you.  It's just something young guys do.  Being male requires a lot of pretending to be respected.  It's really tough on guys, so give him a break."
As a woman, I know the answer is generally yes. The difference is that women use more self control than men do. We also tend to prefer an emotional commitment first, whereas most men don't find that necessary. I truly believe it's biological, however. A man can reproduce until he dies, but a woman's reproductive years come to an end (menopause). I understand this to mean that perhaps people were not biologically intended to mate for life, as we assume. Marriage is actually a manmade concept enforced by religions (also manmade). So it would make sense for a man to have a roving eye, although that doesn't necessarily make it acceptable in today's society.
"Many people, men and women alike,  are shallow.  You have a handful out there who can't see beyond an outter shell to the beauty within.  I have known men,  who upon initial meeting were very attractive but after opening their mouth became less than desireable.  I have also known men who may not be ""Mr. Perfect"" from other's point of view won me over because of who they are and what they stand for...but most importantly,  how they were with me.  ""Ugly"" people can become beautiful once their heart is seen.  ""Beautiful"" people can become ugly the same way.    \n\nFor me it isn't about what a man drives,  where he works,  where he lives,  how much money he has, what he looks like, etc, etc.  It's about who he is,  what he stands for,  how I feel when I am with him,  how I feel when I am away from him...and most importantly, ABOVE AND BEYOND everything else,  how they treat me.   I said this before in one of my answers on here, but I believe it in need of repeating in this answer:  I do not mind struggling WITH someone,  but I will NOT carry someone who is capable of carrying themselves.  \n\nAs for why the ""less than perfect"" guys ""can't find"" a good woman,  perhaps you are looking too hard or looking in the wrong places.  Sit down and evaluate what you find yourself attracted to.  Does she have to be runway material?  Do you find yourself never looking twice at the ""homely"" looking woman in the corner?  Just remember,  there is beauty in every ugly duckling,  just takes that special person to see beyond the outter shell.  Good luck."
guilt her into it. keep saying how much you love her and how great it is that you two are completly honest with each other.  Then tell your friend how great he is and ask if your girlfriend is cheating with someone because she's been acting weird. (DO NOT ACT LIKE YOU THINK ITS HIM) then after he denies that shes been acting odd tell him how great he is again. eventually one of them will crack.
always voice your opinion and unfortunately you have to let her learn on her own.
i am 16 and come from New  York ( not the city)
I can relate to shy...I am shy...however her behavior seems a bit odd and is this something you would be willing to deal with throughout a relationship with her (assuming she's for real)? I'd back off and let her take things at her pace at this point. Leave the door open for her if you like, but don't pass up other opportunities that you feel may have potential. If she's REALLY interested in you, she'll suck up her shyness and join you in taking the steps to meet and explore a 'live' relationship.
no. But i realize I got 2points for answer this stupid,dumb,moron and nonsense question.And by the way, u can even give me 10 points for pick my answer.
Okay future single parent I was 33  when I got custody of My child and men can do this 12 years has passed. I'm going strong and so can you.\n\n Its real hard but your goals will be rewarded with the love of the children [ child ] you raise. \n\nKids we help bring into this world deserve the love of a parent.
Decide how much you like him.  Nobody is beyond redemption, if you think its worth another shot lay down the rules and give him that chance. \n\nPeople make mistakes reading your short paragraph I can see his angst.  You have been together for 2 years its a safe bet you had invested romance into things so his proably felt lost about the correct thing to do (believe me it happens a lot!)  Without you being close he really did have his cake and eat it too type situation.  He had a great on line friend and a girlfriend he saw everyday.  Without you being close he had no compelling reason to ruin that by telling you he had a girlfriend.  (This is a crappy thing to do but thats human nature people just don't deal with stuff till they have to)\n\nNo way has he had 3 years of lies with you players don't invest like that...no return for them you know?  So its a safe bet a good deal of what he has told you is true about him.\n\nI'd suggest letting him work it out without you pressuring him.  If he chooses you while your scarce you know its what you share between you that made him choose you.

first of there is no quick fix, and you prob. dont want to here this but the only way to lose the weight the right way is eat right (no candy or fast food) and excersis this doesnt  mean u have to get an excersis machine or anything like that your young and its summer, go swimming whenever you can walk or ride your bike when u go anywhere, play basketball etc... with your friends just do a lot of out door stuff and try not to spend your summer on the couch in fornt of the TV and I bet those extra pounds will come off in no time. Good luck
it means she is feeling alone and left out, pay attention to all angles, because we tend to hurt the one we love the most
???????
she's obsessed with you honey- i wouldn't be surprised if she was outside your window right now
What do you mean by message boards?  If you mean groups, then yes, there are thousands of them.  Go to the groups section and type in whatever you're interested in.  Chances are there's a group for it.
if you think you want to get close to your own kind and think they are sexy and same to the opposite sex,then yes you are.
I haven't started yet, but I checked my list twice and you were naughty.\n\nSeriously, I do mine all year long.  If I find something, I'll buy it, hide it, and hope I don't forget where I put it.

"Where to meet girls?\n\n\nShopping Malls. Try to remember the last time you went to a mall. Can you possibly look in a direction and not spot a beautiful girl that you would like to seduce? I'd venture a guess and say no.\n\nThe malls are always full of girls. Girls who work at various stores and shops within the mall, but also a lot of girls who go shopping or just hang out. Girls love shopping. Though it is harder to seduce a girl if she is surrounded by her friends, it is not always the case.\n\nWalk up and down the halls and look inside stores for beautiful clerks or shoppers. If it is a women's clothing store or something feminine, even better. You can easily walk up to a girl (clerk or shopper) and ask her:\n\n""Excuse me. Would you be so kind to hold this up in front of you for a moment? It's my sister's birthday next week and you are about the same size as her and from what I can tell you have the same excellent fashion sense.""\n\nBetter yet, after the initial approach you can even ask her if she sees anything else that she really likes in the store that your sister might like too because of the similar tastes in fashion. Probe for keywords why she likes certain things over the others etc.\n\nOnce you have sufficient information of not only what she likes but also why she likes it you can start your charm. Expand the conversation to likes and dislikes in other areas of her life to get her view on things and so on. If she's a shopper you might want to act very quickly to finding ways for you to continue your conversation somewhere else, but if she works there she won't mind spending the time with you especially if it's not very busy.\n\nLibraries. If there is one place that girls almost always outnumber guys, it has to be the library. Whether it's a public library or a college/university library, you will always find young girls trying to do research for a project or homework.\n\nThese girls are usually very intelligent and dedicated to their work, but the plain truth is the fact that everybody can use a break once in a while. If you provide a bit of a pleasant distraction they'll be more than happy to talk to you. You could be asking them for some help to locate a specific section or specialty book. Even if they can't help you out they will at least have to tell you that they don't know where you can find your book. But guess what? That is a conversation taking place right there. Ask them about their own work, interests, etc. Show interest, and let them talk about it for a while.\n\nThese girls like to show off their knowledge so they'll tell you more than you need to know about the subject. But if you develop good rapport at this stage you can easily continue this fascinating conversation elsewhere. Get my drift? You can start asking why they're interested in this particular subject, what's the most fascinating thing about it, what are the challenges and so on. Once you move to answering this type of questions then you will be able to get an insight as to what type of girl she is, what she holds dear and so on.\n\nGourmet Coffee Shops. Before work, at lunch and after work these places are packed with girls. Sometimes the more packed the place, the better because you may have to share a table with ""someone"". If it's not very busy you can still ask to sit next to a beautiful girl. Just tell her that you don't like to sit alone and if she'd mind you sitting with her till you're done with your drink.\n\nIf you're sitting together might as well talk about something. And remember this is a gourmet coffee shop. These girls don't come here for the coffee, they come here for the specialty coffee, and they come for the frills and sometimes even the prestige associated with a particular specialty coffee shop.\n\nSo what do you talk about?\n\nHer favorite drink and why she likes it over regular coffee, how does it make her feel and "
"sure that sounds cool, but by ""relaxing"" i hope you mean doing something fun with me.\ngood luck cutie!"
I dunno. i am addicted, though. maybe we like to see we arent the only one with questions/problems. and it makes us feel like we actually know saomething by contributing and answer.
I'm an attorney, so I'll try to give you an intelligent answer, unlike some of these others. From what you've stated it seems that your being placed into her will as a beneficiary, or other things. \n\nIts mainly used to help identify people after your mother has passed away. If its bothering you go speak to her about it.

Is it really your friend that did?
easy, write down all your expense and your income of the month. see where you can cut corner & cost.
Out of most peoples opinions around me, as gay means something pleasent, it actually used to express the unhappy and unpleasent thing they are doing, to denote abnormal activity they are doing most people called them in that way.
I know what you mean. They show us just how old we are getting. I wouldn't trade it for the world.
First of all why do some men marry ? To celebrate their relationship , to belong to the woman they love , to have a friend , to have a family of their own .\nI guess the others refuse because of fear of taking responsibility (once you are committed/married, all major decision of life are influenced by it e.g., changing job, moving to new location etc. ) or fear of confiding in other person so much as to make them a part of your life and become theirs . Some do not believe in the institution of marriage because for their own reasons . \nWomen generally want to stay in a relationship & work on it even if it is not going on the right track with the hope that it might work . Guys dont . They know if its not a correct choice , its not worth giving life for .\n And for some , variety is the spice of life :))
If you could see some of the guys I've dated, you would know that isn't important to me! LOL What is important is the way they treat you.
Married at 25, child at 29(almost 30), and still married after 11 years.  But don't follow my example, make sure you are getting married for the right reasons.  Have a honest conversation together about what you want in life, if you want children or not, and how you'll spend your money in the marriage.  If you don't have these types of conversations early on, you might regret it later.  Best wishes!
If she hasn't married yet,..you still have an apportunity. Just catch her anywhere she is even you have sacrifice many things for her. it is still worthy to have someone you falling in love with than you have manything without her.\n\nBut if you already lost her in her marriage,..please do not blame your self..let the past be the past and you make that most expensive experience that you hv to paid in your life as your teacher. please forget her even it is very hard.\ni know...i can feel what you feel...i have same experience with you that i lost him forever. i love him for many years....9 years!!\ni have been thru very hard..very hard life facing my days without him...knowing he married to someone else.\n\nBut...i realize i can not be stupid that i would waste my rest life in unusefull things..you know...life still goes on....\n\ni try a single hard days with many positive things to forget him...and i didn't want to do anything that would memorize me to him...after...2 years...i found somebody who loves me..and i happy with my marriage even i don't love him at first but time already proved and his love healed me from hurts and make me like this man and this like feeling already changed into deep love now. i love my hubby.\n\nSo...even you hurt very deep...and very heard to forget her..please try.\nGive chance to time to help you make it. and give your heart open and chance to have another love. you will find someone better. believe me. blame your self just make your self and situation worst. \n\nok, you cannot forget her...so let she is be your someone very special in your past...but give space to your future...\nGood luck!!
NO!!!!!!!!
only you can judge this...good luck! on 2nd thought, she may be dating, but that doesn't mean she's screwing all the guys...what else do you know about her?
no

Unless any of us are a legitimate fortune teller we can only speculate. But being a woman, myself, and from a woman's point of view, if your wife has told you she is going to come home, then try and relax. Have faith in what she is saying. Maybe this is a flaw in your marriage that needs to get worked out. You are going to run your self mentally crazy, if you can't believe your mate. Quit wasting precious energy being suspicious. Channel this energy into thinking what you are going to do differently when she comes home to work out the original problem. Tell yourself, you have nothing to fear, but your own suspicions. I promise you, that most break ups are caused by one or the other, accusing them of doing something. They figure if they are going to be accused,  they might as well do it. Not good logic, but we are talking about love, and there is no logic in this emotion. Keep faith!!!

My lover. He is my husband and ultimate friend! I can't think of anyone who has ever or would ever sacrifice as much as he has for me. I have so much more respect for him than most of the people I know, and the love we have runs so incredibly deep, I couldn't put him 2nd if I tried!
the wang of course! what could be sexier?
If you want unconditional love, get a dog.  Real people are not perfect, and they often fail in giving love in an open, unselfish way.  The important thing is that you try to be realistic in your expectations (even when starry-eyed), and sensitive to the needs of your partner.  They want to be loved just as much as you do, and even flawed human love is pretty darn good when it works.  Nobody is destined to end up alone unless he/she gives up.
if you have to ask the answer on here you have problems work it out let it come from YOUR heart not someones you dont know
screaming befor i walked into the guys bathroom
OK i Know exactly what you are going through im going through it too ,and what i have learned is-  if you two find yourselves in the begining of an argument STOP before YOU say anything think to yourself if its a big something or a little something if its something your not even going to be disscussing the next day from the argument then simply  LET IT GO if you love him enough you will ,because if you dont all the little things your fussin about will one day eventually lead to a BIG something fight and could possibly jepordise the whole relationship. If hes the one fussin and it aint nothin big, let him finish throwing his fit and soon he'll get over it. Try not to involve your parents in your relationship keep it personal the more they know whats going on with you two the worst it is for you because then they will forever have an opinion DONT GIVE THEM ANYTHING TO TALK ABOUT. Hopefullly things will get better for you two mabey all you guys need is a little vacation from eachother. hope i was of some help just try it>

nope. meat eater, Leeds, 30's!!! :D
if there not cheating on u then you dont need to be thinking about it. If they are cheating on you look for signs like reading emails so you chat see them, making phone calls late at night, all of a sudden working lots of overtime, or you getting lots of dead calls from someone who calls and hang-ups.

"If your grl i s acting different then she used to, then she might be, but that doesn't mean she is. you might want to look for changes like, she doesn't call you as often as she used to, (if you are having sex) if she doesn't ""feel"" like it. It just depends on how long you guys have been dating. you shouldn't jump to conclusions if your not sure."
sounds like you just get nervous and don't know what else to say. try just being normal and talk to girls like you would your buddies... or at least sort of. sarcasm is funny and ok sometimes, but don't overdo it. watch the news, read a book, or something.. think of something interesting to say without sounding like a dork. try doing things that don't involve talking :)
I used to be that way.\n\nYou just need to start being friendly with more people,and then you'll realize that getting that kind of attention is not so bad. And you can try something like a fun public speaking class, or hang around friends who bring out the best in you. Others will see you shine, and pretty soon, you'll be able to be yourself around a lot more people! It just takes time. :)
they just come alone u never know when
i never could quite figure out why any woman would want two men at the same time? i would never want to be obligated to have to please two men  at the same time! so that said ...iv never done it? and are you looking for them to have sex with eatchother also? now thats hot!  lol... im bi-sexual and i find the two girls one guy way more exciting!
her on top is my favorite -- but any will be  just fine!
you can have one as many times as you like it can't hurt you
She just made what most guys imagine a reality and he is just excited. She should talk to him and explain that she wants to do it, but not with every woman out there. He should be patient.
because some people like getting their as9 kicked
The best advice I can give you is: Let it go! When you mess with trash , you get dirty. You are better than that! She will get hers in due time, trust me. Don't dirty up your hands with trash like her! Good Luck!!

"...maybe he ain't depressed from that... \n\nFirst, try to find out what he's depressed about. Ask him different things. Chances are, he'll either say ""no,"" or nothing if you are correct. Or give that ol' ""naawww"" if you're right. After you find out, just help him the best you can!\n\nHowever, in general, some physical contact should always make him feel better... well if he really likes you. Just hold his hand, lean on him, etc. \n\nGood luck."
If you really like her then just accept it. It's her body and she can do what she likes with it.
If you are exclusive then she might be cheating...or she might be dead...that's kinda weird if you guys are exclusive. If you just went on a couple dates and its not serious then whatever she is doing is not of your concern and she obviously doesn't want to be with you. Sorry, dude! =)
The first thing, as a female...she's probably incredibly insecure about his, even though it's not her fault.  No doubt she misses a healthy sex life, but because you are so important to one another, she's probably feeling a little scared that this is going to ruin one of the greatest things in her life.  So while it's important, you have to make sure she knows that it's not AS important as the relationship the two of you have.  And don't just say it once, remind her.  We girls like to be reassured, because doubt tends to get the better of us.  And don't just say it, make sure your actions support what you say.  Once she's feeling better about herself, explore a temporary non-vaginal-intercourse alternative to abstinence - by talking about it together, being positive and enthusiastic, and by experimenting, which can be loads of fun for a change of pace.  Don't make it about the problem, make it about how fun it can be finding a solution.  You may even find that it makes your sex life better in the long-term by having variety there.
yes. What I do is speaker louder but speak faster as well just to anoy them, then they lose it. It's quite funny
"Don't think I would like the ex-gf hanging with my man late at night.  Tell your bf if he want's to hang with his ex, go on and hit the road.  It's almost impossible to just be ""friends"" with someone who was once your lover.....OR  she wants him back.  Let him decide what he wants and if he choses her, let him go and find a faithful guy."
"Most every prepubescent and blossoming darling fancies a teacher at some point...just know that it is fantasy. If the teacher has his ducks in a row, he will know how to deflect her. My favorite teacher from prep school later told me as an adult, that ""I wasn't easy to teach..."" Just watch your vibes and how you send it out...because a bad teacher just may take you up on it, and then you'll be out of your league, babe. And he'll be out of a job."
Go with what they call an updo, all stylist know what this is.  LOOKS GREAT and very sexy too !
Why should she have a problem with that? She should be glad your not going outside the relationship to have sex.
Tellin him what u know is different .. will only make him more alert to make his moves.. he'll be more comfortable liein  later since he'll find ways from lettin u know what u now know...( the site thing) \n\n  Go out and meet his other pals.. may be some of his old net pals too .. ask him to give his password to u .. so that u can access his account .. see for how long does he allow u access his accounts.. see how he reacts and u'll know what to do.. \n \n If u need to get over him ... jst do it once and for all... u'll definately find the one for u !

When you see a really hot woman walk by, check to see if she's watching her. Rent a movie with girl/girl scenes. You'll be able to see if she gets turned on by it.
get her laid
You are amazing - she's really lucky.

"You date them both, get to know them better, and see where things go. Ya don't have to pick right now. Besides, they are online. You can't be sure either is ""right"" for you until you've actually met them and dated them in the real world. It's really easy to hide our unattractive qualities when we're online."
"I have a very similar situation happening to me in August as well, only i am not as fortunate because my girlfriend is moving across the country, whereby i will not be able to see her nearly as often. My plan consists of keeping the romance alive.  I will never bring up any issues, and i will never allow myself or her to go to bed upset/mad. (these are in case there are any problems.)  Other things i will do is to visit her as often as i can, talk to her on the phone whenever her schedule will allow me to (i will make time and sacrifice my own schedule just to talk to her) even if it is only to say ""hello, i love you, goodbye."" I will e-mail her, and send her e-cards, poems that i have written, just little reminders that i love and am thinking of her.  I will send her letters randomly, so that she never knows when to expect the next one (allows for some surprise), and i will randomly send gifts and flowers for no reason at all.  Sometimes, i will just show up without telling her (surprise again).  I have a good many other ideas that i could share, if you would like, but i will leave you with my most important idea to keep it alive: I will trust her completely.  I will never allow myself to become jealous or untrusting because she really does not need that; college will be stressful enough without me adding to that burden.  I will let her grow as a person, adapt to her, and be her ""backbone"" in all decisions which she chooses; i will support her and be there for her. This i believe is truly important.  Good luck to you, and I hope that things work out for you!"
some lies are done in attempt not to hurt someones feelings, but most of the time people lie in order not to get into trouble or get out of something that they obviously were involved in. human nature unfortunately.

No.  Just marriage.
Only you know what kind of man your husband is, did he feel bad when he was cheating on his first wife with you? Did he have any feelings off remorse? Yes I do believe 100% that people can change and no not once a cheater always a cheater, people make mistakes we are all human. Believe in your man and have trust in him or that will be the downfall of your marriage. Good Luck
Let go of the love you have to that person and find the one love that will love you back..

You're exhibiting the lack of the #1 quality that us men devour; confidence.  It's hard being a woman I would imagine when you're constantly bombarded with what society thinks is attractive and desirable; and even that changes year-to-year so even Eva Longoria will be plain in a couple of years.\n\nConfidence does not come with make-up, clothing, or other earthy trappings.  It's something you build up over time when you get to understand who you are.\n\nThe quickest path to getting confidence is to stop wasting energy on what the world thinks of you and spend time on caring about what you think of you.  Once you love yourself, it will exude in a way that convinces other people they should be confident about you as well.
If you can't learn to let it go, then the relationship is as good as dead.  Either talk to him about it and tell him ways to rebuild the lost trust, or just move on.  If you're not willing to fix it, don't draw out the inevitable.
It's up to you. I'm 30. I think I'm old.

Lust is when you 'love' him because you have to - because your hormones are making you do it - and only after that start finding excuses to do loving things.\n\nLust is when you want to take without giving at least as much in return.\n\nLust is when you calculate how much you're going to give by how much you're getting.\n\nLust is when you marry him because he's giving you what you want, and you just 'have to have it'.\n\nLust is when you move on because you're not getting what you want from the relationship (even though there are good reasons, having nothing to do with feelings, that a permanent relationship between you would make sense).\n\nLust is when you move on just because someone else is giving you what you want, while the one you're with isn't (and there's no other, better reason).\n\nLust is when you can't live without him, and are just devastated when he breaks up with you or says difficult things to you.\n\n***************************************\n\nLove is when you have made all those little choices to 'love your neighbor as yourself', and all of a sudden after a while you find you've got a huge soft spot for him in your heart, and you suddenly notice he's handsome, and then...\n\nLove is when you wait until you're ready for a permanent relationship before doing anything that will bind you together permanently.\n\nLove is when you give for the joy of giving. Period.\n\nLove is when you marry because you believe that there's something you will be able to do together, and maybe already are doing it, and you'll be able to do it better if you marry.\n\nLove is when he's rejected your marriage proposal, you sometimes don't even dare dream of 'being with him' anymore - and you don't feel the need to 'make yourself move on'. You are happy with your life.\n\nLove is when, when you're with him, you're so happy to be with the one you love that you forget the hard things he's said to you.\n\nIn other words, love is when he's in your heart, but you don't 'have to have him' - but neither do you 'have to move on'. You love him because you choose to.
aww sweetie! that's adorable! =) yes tell her you love her and that she deserves so much better (as in a nice guy like you) but dont be defensive. good luck mate!
Do it!!!  Not only do you need them but they need you -- you don't sound like there is a lot keeping you where you are at and you have a real chance to make a difference in that 4-year olds life.  Husband and I faced similar decision and opted for the family and have never regretted it.
some do some dont depends on the person  if i like a girl i ussaly ask her out first but it is a intresting felling wene the girl asks you first  but somtimes it can be annoying depending on how  they do it  wene they send a letter or a message it pisses me off but if they say it to my face ime ok with it cause they have taken to time to approch me and ask me and i have alot of respect for people like that but some people are shy so you might wanna aproch them outside school/work were ever and talk to them but some are that shy they will feel embarrest and try to get out the convo so sit down  and make it feel like a good convosation not a interagation  and make sure your to the point but in a nice way cause if your hinting it on they could get scared and not know what your getting at but the best advice i can give is observe who they are first if there shy approch him sepperate  or if hes ok with thing just see him straight up but it depends on the person look and think before you act i hope this helps  same goes wene asking chicks out if you got any more questions just email me at mrbisket@hotmail.com
Are you being grounded ?  Or, do they not know your friends or don't like you friends ?  If  it because your parents don't know that you're having a girls night out, then tell them that it's just the girls.  If they still say no, then tell the friends that you have a cousin who is getting married.  Go window shopping for the outfit with them.
Drop your hymnal!
well, how long have you been with the guy? if a week or two, then you fall head over heels way too fast. if months and months have gone by and you're sure that you love him, go for it. the worst that can happen is him leaving if he doesn't love you back and if he does then he's not worth your time. you need to be with someone that you love and that loves you back.

He's probably remembering all the good times you had together, and like the song says, the first cut is the deepest. He probably has mixed feelings about the break up now. It's possible he's remembering those strong feelings, and is just confused by it all. You could always talk to him about it and see if he still has feelings for you.
yes it is
You mean she's spreading a rumor about you? I would first contact the dean of students, let them know that this girl is doing this, and she even admitted it to you. This is a bully tactic and would land her in mediation. That's what they did in my school when they were cracking down on school violence.  Mediation is a session where you, a counselor and the bully engage in 'peace talks' to get to the root of the problem. Most people who went to mediation came out best of friends. If your school doesn't do this, maybe you can emplore your school's dean for such a program because this is really distracting you from your education.
I think you should pray very hard for God to send you more christian friends without using the net. There are all kinds of nuts out there. I know how you feel, though. It's hard to find christian friends when you are a twenty something and  especially if you don't attend a Christian school. \nKeep posting. God will use you to minister to others.
"Below is a link to a news article about a Cornell University study on interracial marriages.  ""Since 1960 the number has jumped tenfold"".  Older Americans are less likely to choose another race to marry.\n\nPersonally, I married in my same race because he was looking for the same things out of life & religous beliefs I have.  I've dated outside of my race and I wouldn't care if my daughter ever dated outside her race as long as the guy treats her right and has good morals."
If I know the BBW brigade, that're far 2 fussy for their own good.\nKeep trying, don't give up.

I have often fined my self  asking this question. will I fined true love will I fined the one with whom I’m meant to be? though I am alone now the answer is simple and clear love is out there its all around us in the air we breath the water we drink its an invisible force the binds the world and no mater who you are or what you do there is some one out there just waiting to fined you waiting to hold you in there arms to look in your eyes and say I love you. Yes you will fined your love I am as cretin of this as I am that some day it will come to me there is some one for every one though we may be lonely now we just need to wait hold in a little longer for you never know what waits for you behind that corner up ahead
actually it depends on your feelings for each other,if you were truly in love then you shouldnt have many problems if you get back together.
different idea's it's good
Because you don't have on any pants.
i love to have sex right after i get done having an argument....also, it's great when you know that you are somewhere having sex and you are risking being caught
two people who are blood related, Father,Mother etc, involving themself sexually with another close family member, son daughter etc, absolutely sick and disgusting
No one wants to date you because of your shitty attitude. Never give a guy money (there is a difference if you are seriously dating someone and you pay for a date or two) and try not to sleep with a guy right off the bat. You need to find yourself and love you whether you have a boyfriend or not. And I seriously hope you are not over 30 and saying these things. I hope you are a teenager and know nothing about life yet. Cause the right person will come along one day and it might not be for a long time. Enjoy life and when that person comes along you will really be able to love them back since you love yourself. You need to cheer up, take care of yourself, and do something right now that makes you happy. Good luck.
"Forget the books, you need to get rid of this guy.  I don't neccessarily perscribe to the idea of ""once a cheater always a cheater,"" but in this case your husband is still talking to this other woman.  It really doesn't matter if they're arguing when they talk..point is..he's not respecting you and your relationship enough to let this other woman go.  Instead of reading books on how to make him stop cheating, start reading books on how to love and respect yourself.  You may find your eyes open quite a bit when you realize how much you're worth!"
Ooooh.  You mean he wants to go steady?\n\nOh please.  Neither one of you obviously have any idea of what it means to be in a relationship, which includes communications, and understanding each others feelings.\n\nGo back to the playground, and stay off this adult site.

I think the flirting is the least of the problems here.
I thought about getting married there.  I did attend a wedding there though.  It was a small wedding so I guess the advice would differ greatly dependent upon what your plans are.  The wedding I attended the family rented two houses on the beach.  This way they had private beach access and a place to have the reception.  The wedding party and close family stayed in the houses.  The reception was self-catered, but depending on what you are looking for there are lots of great places to have cater in the Outer Banks.  I really like the Black Pelican.  You can search online for rental property companies which have tons of houses.  The prices increase significantly from June through August.  If you get married in May or September you can still enjoy beautiful weather and save a little money.  I used to live in the Outer Banks so I'm sure there is more information I could give, but without knowing more details about what you want it's hard to say.  I hope this helps some.
If he never takes you any where and he only calls you in the middle of the night that is all he wants. trust me.
my boyfriend was in the same situation so he sent me pink roses with white Lillys and tulips in this really pretty vase with a card.
Unfortunately I was one of those poor girls in school who was blessed with C cups at a young age.  Actually when I left 6th grade I was like a 32C.  Along with that a females period begins...I think it has something to do with the larger mammory glands.  My daughter is the same way, and I just talked to her and told her what to expect.  You have to guide her thru highschool.....because the kids now are relentless.  Really have to be there for her.
Iwould say that personality is more important because a guy can be hot as hell but be abusive or something.to me a guy can be bad looking but if its someione you can talk to then he's a good person.a girl wants some one to talk to and has a personality if ur all looks and thats all thatn u may not be the best person to be with.
Not ALL men are that way. You're dealing with a controlling, selfish, insecure, baby that acts like this because his self-worth is rock bottom. If he still loved you, he would trust you. Even if he is a little shaken, he would tell you what is bothering him. Maybe it was something he saw? Maybe it was something he heard? Maybe he had a horrible dream about something that happened in the past? Maybe he got hit with a brick and it knocked all of the good sense out of his head?\n\nIf you still want to be with him, maybe you should be the bigger person and sit him down and confront this situation.\n\nThat's if you still love him enough to want to work it out. Do something to make him remember that you are the queen of the castle and he is still the king.\n\nIf it doesn't work, then find someone who will act like an adult and love you like you deserve to be loved.
to your question a honest loving man who cares for u shows responsibility  respect and loves to do it anywhere i ask him to and how i want him to

Your wife comes first.  Moms are wonderful and we should respect them but at the point you marry someone they become number one in your world.  You make it clear to your mom that while she may not care for your wife she will treat her with respect if she wants to continue to be a part of your future life.
The only chance she has to ruin your relationship is if she can turn your bf against you - and that is up to him.  You need to discuss this with him and see what he thinks of her or if he has any desire to be with her or listen to her opinions.  Once you find out what his story is, you can decide to do one of 3 things:\n\nA. Ignore her and don't worry about her at all.\n\nB. Talk to her and try to find out why she wants to ruin your rel. or take your bf, then do whatever it takes to keep your bf and show her up.\n\nC. Decide your bf isn't the man you thought he was - he's just a boy who doesn't deserve you.  Then focus on getting over him and enjoying life as a single till you meet a much better man.
well i mainly think it means that he likes u and u shouldnt try 2 make the 1st move!!!
can you tell me how can you turn on when the one whom you are going to do is not in love with you \n\ndoes that mean that you can do it to anyone \n\niam just curios
"My wife and I, when we first dated, went on 5 dates before we kissed. She was dating me to have something to do at first. She was in a ""I hate all men."" mode when I met her. Many people thought 5 dates was a lot before a kiss. We talked about it and I said I thought it was great to have time to talk and get to know each other before we clouded things with a physical relationship. \n\nI guess you need to talk these things over with the person. \n\nRemember, Daddy's Girl, women attach more significance to a physical relationship than men do. Each base for a woman is a deeper commitment for a woman, but not so for a man, so if you want that commitment to go with the physical milestones, establish the commitment with the guy in advance of doing the deeds."
Please don't be angry but has it ever crossed your mind that maybe he doesn't want to go in that direction. he may be just trying to spare your feelings. My advice is to let it go for awhile and maybe just maybe he'll come around. If not then just be thankful for the friendship
"Worrying about what other people thought of me.\n\nNow I realize that there will be some people in the world that are naturally JERKS, and I will meet them, from time to time, as I go thru life.

""" Most marriages are another form of prostitution"". - Nicholas Fourier.\n\nI am sadden by your situation, horrified actually. I think what your family is doing to you is nothing short of prostitution. It is cruel for your family to want or require you to marry a man for their benefit, especially someone who may hurt you.\n\nYou have a choice in this matter as with everything in life. The decision to have sex should be yours to make, I think the same is true of marriage. If you are forced to do any of these things, especially have to sex I am quite sure you will regret it.\n\nDon't cave in to external pressures. \nTalk to your family explain that your aren't comfortable with the situation. Let them know why you are uncomfortable.\nIf you have other family members you can stay with for a while who don't feel the same way your parent[s] do then see if you can stay with them for a while.\n\nI honestly think you need to get out of this situation.\n\nI sounds like you don't know a whole lot about this person, well not enough anyway. You have mentioned that he is a foreigner. Wel,l do you know where he is from anything about his culture, his family, his past? These are important incites into the type of person he is or is likely to be. I am not saying this to scare you but for all you know he maybe  abusive or already married.\n \nI can't answer any of your other questions since I'm a female and still a virgin. \n\nI wish you the best.\n\nIf you need someone to talk to you can IM through MSN or e-mail me at life_love_law@hotmail.com."
13 is to young to have sex. If your scared your not ready. Besides you want your first time to be with someone you love not someone you like alot.
"At first, hormones. When you are young it is hard to control. But later in life, love becomes different. You start recognizing what's right for you and what you can really call ""Love"".  Then, I think, your love develops gradually and it is much more stronger and true, because it's based on very complex feelings."

WELL ITHINK YOU HAVE FALLEN OUT OF LOVE.BECAUSE IF LOVE WAS THERE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO MAKE THE OTHER FEEL GOOD.HE ISNT THINKING ABOUT YOU AT ALL.DUMP HIM AND GET A REAL MAN THAT WANTS HIS WOMAN TO FEEL GOOD FIRST BEFORE HIMSELF..
if you are ready and you are with the person that you love and the person that you would want to give that gift to. You can only give that to one person and you can never get it back. just make sure that he is th right person because that is the person that you are going to remember for the rest of your life. It don't matter how good or bad he will be, you are going to remember it for the rest of your life. so you should want to remember the person that you love. Right? I lost my virginity when i was 17. I loved him alot and still i wish that i would have waited. there is nothing to rush into because the first time is not much fun anyways. Well just think about it,  its a decision that you have to make and as long as you make the one that you are comfortable with, that is all that matters. Make sure you use protection and if you are going to go along with it don't regret doing it. Make him make your first time perfect and memorable. Well congratulations on making it to 16 because most girls start at 12 and 13.
No.  And I am married.
NOTHING COMPARES\n\nI could be world famous\nI could win the lottery\nBut it wouldn't compare to holding you...\n\nI could be a movie start\nI could write a top novel\nBut it wouldn't compare to holding you...\n\nI could strike oil\nI could land on the moon\nBut it wouldn't compare to holding you...\n\nI could fly to the stars\nI could stand at heavens gate\nBut it wouldn't compare to holding you...\n\nNo matter where I go\nNo matter what I do\nNothing will ever compare to holdin you...
That's totally cool. If I could give you ten points just for being cool like that, I would. \n\nYou shouldn't sit on feelings like that, nor should you play games and all that 11-yr old crap. Unless, that is, you are 11.
yeah they do
You can do one of two things, follow your heart and let him know how you feel, or don't say anything and allow things to continue the way they are. I mean how would you know if he feels the same way? Maybe he is beating himself up over the fact that yall agreed to be friends and he doesn't know how you would react when he says he wants more? Who knows? Try suggesting it indirectly see how he reacts....that way you will know what you are up against.\n\nGood luck!
BE TRUE TO YOURSELF, DO WHAT YOU NEED TO BE HAPPY BUT REMEMBER , ONCE ITS GONE IT AINT COMMIN BACK AND HE COULD DROP YOU LIKE A 2 DOLLAR WHORE IF THATS ALL HE WANTS. YOU KNOW HIM AND YOURSELF BETTER THAN ANYONE , ASK YOURSELF WHERE YOU WANT TO BE IN 5 YEARS AND IS THERE A PLACE FOR HIM BY YOUR SIDE. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND DONT DO ANYTHING WITHOUT PROTECTION, YOU WONT GO ANYWERE WITH A BABY ON YOUR HIP OR AIDS.
dude, men are always only thinking about it, women just wanna feel close and loved, men want sex, women like the mushy kissing and stuff, guys like the humping\nmen are the ones who have to carry on the species so biologically men have to have the higher drive\n95% of guys brains are dedicated to thinking thought that orginate between the legs

I think you need to speak with the guy.. open your mind to him. Also tell him about u'r friends situation. Take time.. to show others tht u r involved.. but say to the guy as early as possible..\n\nTime'll help u.. it'll be reducing the intensity of u'r friends thoughts.. & u'r luvin guy can also help u..\n\nGud luck..
I think it's because sex calms them down so that they have enough patience to actually sit and talk with us like we like them to do!

I think I better get out of here before my wife catches me.
dont keep asking stupid question!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm the master listener.....and talker........drop me a line.......I'll make ya laugh if nothing else.........
i dont understand the question.
i think it is fine but sometimes having kida is bad. i have mulatta friends and mixed friends and alot of times they are confused on who they are. they are afraid to be black or white. ya know? sometimes they don't know who to hang out with or who to date and they might get picked on. i would have a talk about kids before gettin too serious.
it shows respect and that you are really interested and not distracted in your conversation

Sure go on dates but I wouldnt get to serious with a boyfriend.  \n\nGuys are way too much trouble.  \n\nIf I could go back I would wait.  Its hard though I know.  \n\nI think 16 is probably the right age.
I would never sign one.nor would I expect the one I marry to sign one, either.

I'm going to put their Full Name, I don't care if somebody who knows them and read my answer will tell them.\n\nThe Girl is Lovely Joyce Cruz\nThe Boy is Raven De Leon\n\nEeeeeewwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!\n\nYuckyyyyyyy!!!!!!!\n\nThose who are eating, please, this is an excuse....\n\nEeeeewwww, yyyyuuucckkss!!!! Duhhhhhhhhhhh!!!
well i would think his feelings r strong and if u camed wit hhim u now what each other looks like witch seems t obe most important now a days and just chating brings out your qalitys and likes and dislikes. so i think he would really like u.
Certain anthropological discoveries revealed that in those earlier times of human evolution, mothers used to feed their infants mouth to mouth by chewing food, the same way birds feed their own. This act seem to have been slowly took form in kissing lip to lip. I believe this particular act is so sensual as it combines all five senses in to a singular activity. closer proximity of the person's face fill our vision, their moaning are heard by ears, nose smells the partner's aroma and taste and touch are with the lips and tongues entangled with each other.... I hope this is the right answer that will quench your curiosity
you sound like a whore! Your going to get AIDS
Did you talk about abortion before you married?  If so and he didn't agree with it then the is going to change on you and you need to get away.  But that should be your decision too.  Do whatever you want to do because if you don't you will always regret it.  If he loves you then it won't bother him to have a child with you.  Good luck in your journey.
My gosh, I SO know what you mean!!  You are completely entitled to your opinion.  I'm going to share something with you.  I worked with a girl for a long time whom I just despised because she did the same thing.  I'd buy a certain type of shirt, the next day, she had one, I'd buy knee high boots, the following week she'd have brand new knee high boots, I'd bought a Honda, she bought a Honda,  this went on for 7 years.  The last year we worked together, her husband left her for the third time and she befriended me.  I was much wiser than her so I helped her (even though part of me despised her, I tried very hard to look beyond it).   In that time, I realized how screwed up her whole life had been even though she excelled a lot at work and was a very dominant figure-at work.  At home, however, she was a coward who had no identity of her own because her mother had been so controlling.   I put all the pieces of the puzzle together and realized that in copying me in everything, she was jealous of the fact that I was grounded and centered and she wasn't.  She essentially was copying to try and find her own identity but couldn't.  I was finally able to pity her as opposed to hating her and having to waste time and money in a therapist's office talking about it!!\n\nMy point is that you are totally centered and grounded.  It is more than evident in your question and the way you ask it.  You have your (*&^ together.   They are completely lame for doing what they're doing and yes, they are classless.  Totally classless.  That is pretty much as low as you can go.  \n\nAnd with it being your B-I-L, it's not like you can avoid them knowing because obviously your husband tells them.  So I guess the only thing you can do is understand why (and that's why this comment is so long-sorry).  And hopefully that will help you.   Just know that people that do that are followers, not leaders.   you are a leader, they are followers who know not where they're going.  How sad.  \n\nEven though that girl excelled at work more than I did because I didn't have it in me to backstab, suck up to the point of no dignity and what have you, I realized that my personal life was going to reward me so much more than work and that was all she had was work.   All your b-i-l has is a directionless life with a wife who has no identity of her own.  Can you just imagine what that thought process is like?  It's not much!!!!   Imagine what it's like to live your life with absolutely NO passion?   You on the other hand have tons of passion, I can see it in your question!!!  You're full of passion.  So rest in comfort knowing that he and she are passionless people walking around looking for how they should exist.  Looking for a way to fit in.  \n\nFollowers never really lead.  They always follow.
"YES it is really love!  I believe he really does love you, but is deeply afraid of commitment.  Has he ever lost anyone who was very close to him, like someone in his family?  If so, this may be his source of a deep-seated fear.  He is most likely afraid of messing up a full-fledged relationship with you and is why he ""stays close to you"" but will not commit all the way.  \n\n     If he only remains ""friends w/ benefits"" and you reject him he can convince himself ""No Big Deal"" we were just friends anyway.  But if you two are an exclusive item and you reject him for what ever reason, I think that the rejection would be far to devastating for him to bare.  So he plays it safe.  Many men have the same fear of rejection we just don't show it."
It takes time to move into new circles.  Be yourself and try not to let the little things bother you.

well if shes truly your friend she will be happy with whatever decision you make..she should be happy for you..it sounds like all your friend cares about is herself and it thats the case i would ditch her and she will eventually realize how stupid she is.
It depends on the relationship you have with your boyfriend, are you both open to see other people. How would you feel if your boyfriend kissed another female? I don't know about you but I have zero tolerance for that stuff.
i don't know what grade your in but u seem young ... (don't take that the wrong way) but talk to him or get over it , there is one other opp for you become his really good friend and see what happens from there ... the only thing that can go wrong is that you can get left in the friend corner ... but the friend thing work for me and my hubby plus i'm his best friend but it dosen't work that way for every one .....
I'd try and look for them on Yahoo! People Search. It's pretty good at finding people and it's free of charge. As long as you know thier last and first name then it'll be pretty easy to find them.\n\nhttp://www.people.yahoo.com/

Korean parents are typically old-fashioned, very traditional. More often the Korean son or daughter will bend to the will of his or her parents. \n\nIt's a cultural aspect. \n\nThe only thing I can say is patience and time. Try embracing more of his culture. Find ways to connect with his parents. They need to realize your beauty and what you provide for their son.\n\nIt will be hard, but if you really want this relationship and love this person, mountains are simple hills. Keep strong and stay on course. Support your love. Don't disrespect his parents. If you do, you will more than likely drive him away.
From what I see the dream, I could see that you are totally in lack of security or just sense of security.\n\nI don't know your background.  My guess is that your parents were divorced??  You didn't mention about your mom.  \n\nYou are married and you dreamt about being Raped by your father and your husband.. That could only means that you do not trust men or just lose sense of security. You don't see any protection from your father (due to divorce?)  and you don't see trust your hubby.  To you, being raped is the in a way of protection.  (notice you were only raped by love ones in your dream)\n\ni can not do much analyzing due to lack of info of your family background... but that's the best I can do so far.... hope that helps...\n\n-your dream doctor
Sometimes people avoid things that they don't know how to deal with. My guess is that your boyfriend is personally shocked by the idea of cutting oneself, that he doesn't really understand it, so he isn't quite sure how he feels about it. Therefore he avoids it. \n\nSome people are so worried about saying the wrong thing that they don't say anything at all. If otherwise your boyfriend is a wonderful person and a supportive boyfriend, I doubt it has anything to do with you. But if he is always disinterested and genuinely shows no concern for you in any aspect, dump that loser and get yourself someone better.\n\nObviously your boyfriend cannot be relied upon as a source of support in terms of SI/suicide. Therefore, you'll have to find someone else. Consider why you told him. Were you looking for support to recover? Psychologists and such can be great resources. Or if you simply want someone to talk to (you personally have to want to stop if you're going to), other friends/close associates can make great listeners. Or call a hotline: 1-800-DONT-CUT. \n\nGood Luck!
Talk to your doctor.\n\nFirst, s/he will give you this information, and a whole lot more information that you need if you're trying to get pregnant, including dietary information that can improve your chances of conceiving and carrying a child without much inconvenience.\n\nSecond, these days there are lots of genetic tests that can be performed to ensure that your boyfriend and you are genetically compatible -- that is, unlikely to produce a child with a genetic disease. For some ethnicities this is a crucial step, but it's really something that everyone should do, BEFORE you get pregnant.

"Sorry to say - Its not sex education at fault (well abit) Its the general level of education...\n\nLook at the level of teenage pregnancies within the lower levels of inteligence & higher...\n\nThe lower levels expect less, require less & are content with less - hence child at 12 - 17 - no asperations, another child with different father next year, etc...  by now sex education is a moot point - but being given money to help ""Support"" the ""Child"" - well - they may be thick - but not that thick..  Being given money for each child you produce - great motivation.....\n\nChildren arn't stupid - but sex, coupled with lower inteligence = children at a young age when they can't really support them.\n\nI know its drastic - but reversable sterilisation at 12 is a good idea.."

Start doing things for the less fortunate. Go to a soup kitchen and help serve people who don't know where their next meal is coming from.

I don't know where you got this information, but it is NOT TRUE>\n\nConverting is NOT a requirement, and NEVER has been!\n\nNow, 40 years ago, you would get married in the rectory, or in a vows- only ceremony if one party wasn't catholic.\n\nI married a Presbyterian in 1985. We had a full Nuptial Mass- which is a thing of absolute beauty and holiness, by the way. He converted in 1996 by his own decision...in fact, I told him I didn't WANT him to convert, because I knew he didn't believe everything....but Grace has its way, and he is a faithful Catholic now.\n\nThe only 'conditions' for a Catholic to marry a non- Catholic are:\n1. The non Catholic must agree not to hinder the Catholic spouses practice of the faith.\n\n2. The CATHOLIC must sign a statement that children of the union will e raised in the faith.\n\n3. the NON CATHOLIC must acknowledge that the Catholic signed the satement in #2, and they understand it.\n\n4. The couple must be marries by a priest or deacon in a Catholic Church unless permission is obtained to do otherwise.\n\nIt really is quite fair.
Alexis.  It's more original.
sounds like this friend really needs you now. stay with her but gently tell her how you fell about her additude.

"First I'd have to examine the similarities. They are all, most likely, what was once simply the instinct to procreate.  \n\nThese words are symbols like all words, the concepts they represent to us are broad and almost undefinable.  For instance, there are many different ""flavors"" of love.  This really means that the word ""love"" actually covers many different concepts that have similarities but are not identical (brotherly love, a mother's love, romantic love).  Likewise when one is ""infatuated"" with a new band, it means something quite different from when one is ""infatuated"" with a person.\n\nHow they have become different would perhaps be related to the varying stages of a romantic relationship.   At first there is lust, it is strongly driven by hormones making it feel like raw primal desire.  If you continue to see the person you may become infatuated with them, meaning that thinking about the person consumes most of your attention, all day.  This phase is terribly distracting, every other second you find the person popping into your head.  Finally, if you keep spending time with the person you may develop love, a deep caring for their wellbeing and an emotional attachment that would hurt you if it were broken.  At this point it becomes more similar to familiar love like a mother and child, but retains a certain amount of lustiness and infatuation.  In a good relationship, the partners both work to keep love, infatuation and lust strong."
"If a man knows what to do with his hands, fingers and tongue then 5"" is more than enough. I have been with guys before I was married that had 8"" or more and couldn't do anything with it! They thought that all they had to do was put it inside and I would go crazy! They were wrong! Give me a man with talented hands and tongue and I don't care what size his penis is!"
It sounds like he might still be hung up on his ex, but that isn't necessarily a death sentence for your relationship.  It is a cause for concern, however.  You should talk to him about it, tell him it concerns you because you wonder if he's still in love with her.  Approach the matter cautiously and without being judgmental, as it's a sensitive topic.  And don't worry about how pretty she is.  In the long run, a lasting relationship needs mutual attraction, but even being a supermodel isn't enough to hold a relationship together all by itself.  And remember, there's a reason they broke up!
you tell your parents they will solve your problem
"It's like announcing to the world, ""hey I'm desperate"". Most girls are already insecure. Pointing out their desperation on yahoo just makes them even more insecure. \n\nWhen you recognize a girl in person, don't embarrass her. Instead be smart and use the info to realize she is out looking as well. So if she starts giving you some lame excuse about her boyfriend, etc. then you know she is lying and is not interested in you."
I don't think that age matters in a relationship, especially in your case. You are an adult, and as long as you both have feelings for each other, let them flow, and see what develops.
well what country are you from and what is your age and sex
That is a decision u will have to make on your own. Many ppl see things from many different point of views.
take a plane
Can't answer for others but myself\n I don't think that having sex outside of marriage is bad because you know what you like when you get married\n if you have never had sex before marriage then you may hate it or at least hate it with that person and think this is not worth it stop having sex with them which will end up in divorce more than likely \nwhere if you had had sex prior then you know what it is all about\nthat's just my point of view on it
I think it very much depends on how long you have been going out.  both of you are from a relationship, and my worry is that the possible raison you want to move in together is because you both miss sex. Once a week is not too bad for a relationship!  My advice is to take some time before moving in together and I'm sure you would want to balance your religion with your personal life.  If you don't at the end you will get hurt and loose the confidence of your friends.
My babies Backside    MMMMMM
Because you don't have a very trusting relationship with your boyfriend!  You have to trust each other completly to be happy.  My man & I will sit at some places & he'll look at beautiful women & say wow she's hot & I'll agree with him (no, I'm not bi)...or I'll say wow he's amazing & he'll agree with me.  It's all about trust.

Sweetie, my finace and I were only together for 3 months when we got engaged.  We are getting married next month, and only 5 months of being together and yet, I know this man's every move, every though.  I love him and he loves me.  So, if you feel you are doing this because you want to spend the rest of your life with her then by all means ask.  If you are only doing this to be with her then tis best not to ask.
call me!!!!!!!
It would depend if it turns her on, can be very sexy.\nsame as for a guy who doesnt smoke when french kissing a girl who is a heavy smoker, can be very sexy indeed
I dont think so he choose you to make a big step with, if I think of all the lads I fancied most of them turn my belly now, peoples feelings change. Try not to think of it and go be happy!!!!

No, we aren't all looking for the next best thing, just scared to hell, we might make a mistake, and end up divorced.\nIt's also being commintment phobic. Nothing to do with the girl you are dating at the time. But when she starts to talk about marriage, it can scare the hell out of a guy, if he isn't ready to commit.
I have a dream, that wont end!
they will ask you on a second date

hey stop thinking like that
Whether or not you two can be friends depends on many factors: how long you two dated, whether or not you were friends before or not, and how bad the break-up was. If you two think you can be friends, wait a few weeks and then do something casually in a group and see how it is. Just take things slowly, and you'll figure it out.
i think u're falling in love with her n u might just b having very strong feelings for her since u're missing her so much... stop denying the truth n ask urself these questions...\n\nwould u leave ur present gf to b with her? in any given situation, whom would u like to b with.... \n\nat this moment r u dying to see her or get her attention?\n\nr u thinking that she is the person that u'd like to love n take care of thruout ur life?\n\nif the answers to this r yes then u have some serious thinking to do... in the end the decision will b urs but what i want to say is.. dont deny or suppress ur feelings... u'll ruin ur life as well as others'.... that wont make u happy...

he may just like you as a friend. it depends on a few things. does he have a different way of looking at you than other girls? does he always seem to find time to talk to you? (it sounds like he does) does he flirt with you when you talk? does he do this to a lot of people, or just you? \nits not impossible!! i think he may actually like you! good luck with him!

No you havn't. I probably would have done the same thing.

i've been through this myself n i noe thats its easy to just say TELL HIM...........................but i can be harder than that................since the attraction is already there, if the guy really loves Lanie as well then he would appreciate if she just took him out on a slow stroll n told him in the eyes how she truly adored him n wanted him to be hers.........................being a little possesive will really aid n he'll fall......................................but mostly tell her to be truthfull n ask for mostly trust in return........................i hope i could help!!!!

For my parents 25th we held a small barbeque for the family, about 15 people were there(not counting the young kids) and the big surprise of the night was when the wedding party showed up, they had not seen the maid of honour or the best man in years. It was great. \nAnything you do or get them will be treasured by them, just make it personalized, don't get them something they could easily pick up themselves.
Call the real father, child services, and welfare enforcement. This family is one deranged group and EVERYONE is suffering, especially the children. You were 100% correct in demanding that he stop drinking; it is your home, you make the rules. And it was very kind of you to rescue that girl for two weeks... now take a stand for her!
depends on if it's all of a sudden or if its always been that way.. if it's always been that way.. and it bothers you.. maybe you need to reconsider being with him.
You should really talk about your sister like that my friend and especially not on the internet, then again something tells me it's not your sister you are talking about really is it?
Nope, I dont either
Girls probably throw themselves at you BECAUSE you're in a band!! Especially if your the singer! Girls love it!

keep it between the two of you, who needs to know that you two are already married. just enjoy the first moments as husband and wife and let your worries just fade away all will be just fine.
First off, don't even think about sex unless you're both gonna be in a relationship. If he's a virgin, you should cherish that and and really to connect with him emotionally and spiritually and not only will the sex be OUTSTANDING but your relationship will last. When the talk of sex comes up between you just make sure he's ready and discuss protection and because you're more experienced try not to scare him with advanced techniques ;) if you know what I mean! Just be true to yourself and make sure he does the same because the worst feeling in the world is to regret your first time and have bad feelings towards the person who took your virginity, trust me, I'm speaking from experience!! Have fun!
You could wait it out and see how and if your relationship gets better. Talk to him about it and find out what really is happening. It might turn out to be something that could be fixed.
go to a bar
i know its not the answer which u wants but acc. to me dont try anything to attract him\nif he really interested in u he will come ur way automatically and if u keep trying to attract him but if he still is not noticing what u r doing for him u will hurt urself and so dotn do anything just be as u r\nmay be someone else much better is waiting for u and need u as u are ...

Don't plan into it too deeply; most first kisses suck.  Mine was like a nasty wet surprise that I totally didnt see coming, and that was like years ago.  I never liked kissing from that point until now that I have a boyfriend I really love and kisses well.
it feels so good and make you Horne
There is no real answer to this question but what I have learned of what love is to me is...\n\n(L)isten: and Validate them by hearing and empathizing.\n(O)verlook: their minor character flaws as they will overlook yours.\n(V)alue: who they are and what they mean to you.\n(E)xpress: how you love them not just with words but with actions.

YES! I fell in love instantly with a man I was talking to on the net. He was dating someone at the time and said that he would only talk to me as a friend. I thought that a friend was better than nothing, so I agreed. Obviously we were meant to be together, because the other woman decided to stop seeing him and he asked to meet with me. I met him and 2 days later, moved 4 hours away to be with him. We are now engaged and have a 2 month old daughter!
Hmmm... a lady that was a good friend opened up to me one day and tearfully confessed that she was in love with me and had been for a long time. She thought that would be the end of our friendship.\n\nIt was only the beginning of a deeper one. We're very happily married now.\n\nSometimes you have to speak from the heart. You may get hurt, but you may also realize your dreams.
Well, when I first read this I thought that she didn't do anything wrong because she told you that she liked him.  Well, I think she's a crappy best friend for lying to you about how she would never date him.  However, when you both found out that you liked him you should have a mature discussion, and told each other that you should both just get to know him better, and see who has the better chemistry.  I know best friends that dated the same guys (not at the same time) but it never bugged them because they were never real long-time relationships.  But if he hurts her or he tries to cheat on her with you, and you decide to go out with him then that would be really crappy on your part.  Even if you guys stopped being friends you'd be stupid to date a guy that was a jerk.  If you really think she's a good person then I would just talk to her about how next time she should just tell you, and don't be a bitch to her and let this ruin your friendship.  I wouldn't want her or that guy thinking you still like him so, if I were you I'd act like I already had a new crush.  On the other hand, if you question her character on a regular basis and she's just the best friend of the moment and not someone that you really connect with on a deep level then I would just expect things like this from her.  I would try to hang out with someone I trust more.
I have been with my wife for 14 years.  We will be married 12 years this August.  We have had our share of problems, but what I love about her most is her conviction and desire to keep our marriage alive and strong.  It has not been easy for her at times during the years dealing with me, but she loves me very much and perseveres knowing that our love is a good one.  \n   Even though i do not tell her enough, she really is a beautiful woman, and my best friend, knows everything about me, and yet, she still loves me.  I almost lost her at one point and i hope that I can work out my problems so i never chance that again.
Talk to him.
If you question it then you're not, I know that sounds fruity but when you have been in love you will understand that it is true.
hope yu concentrate in yur studies well n  get d highest marks in BIO,physics, chem. maths I & II n other subjects as well\nbest luck\nGOD bless\nT.
for me, definitely better since we got married. we're more open with each other. we're willing to try new things. before we were married, we were always rushed. now we have time to enjoy each other. falling asleep and waking up together sometimes is the best part, just knowing that he's still there.
You and him are both married.  There should be no questions about the issue.  When u got married, u agreed to love and honor your husband til death do you part.  So if you want to be an adultress then go ahead but i think thats shady.  The other guy also is being shady.
Because they are perverts

Request that they move out and get their own place like adults.
No one knows about their relationships with their parents better than the kids, so who better to decide? I'd say go with the kids. If the parents are good friends, that's wonderful. They can accommodate extra visits, or even switch for a while, IF THE CHILD ASKS FOR THAT. It should be all about the child,not the parents. They've messed up the kids life enough as it is.
People change, it sucks :(
you are dealing with a woman
i agree with kitttylisa, and if you think this site is so dumb, why don't you get the hell off here then??????????????? and it only took her 2 seconds to post the question, so it's hardly gonna take up the 90 minutes they are playing. you are such a joke.

if both are ballanced they can compliment eachother.  the fun loving working wife with emotions can help the husband see things in a different light.  neither partner should expect to change the other's attitudes but if they accept eachother as they are and love eachother it can work quite well.

"See if she keeps looking at your lips as you talk. See if she gets physically comfortable with you, like, does she like to tickle you. She'll show signs that she's physically comfortable with you.\n\nOr, if you can be really direct, just ask her ""Don't you wanna kiss me?"""

I would have to say that hopefully everyone can find an attractive and nice person in their life.\n\nDiseases? What kind are we talking about?
girl or guy? if your a girl email me and I'll be happy to explain in great detail what I'd do.
Your bf is hiding something and if you want to know then ask the other guy yourself about not sending mail to you,but he sends it to everyone else on the team!!
I hope that this special person is already your bf, and he is interested in taking your relationship to the next level, I mention this because your head over heels for him and I could see you being blinded by love, or at least infatuation prior to really getting to know this person...I am just wanting you to realize you see something that you have been missing in him but don't overlook other important character flaws because he has the missing piece to complete your life....just be you...he can see the connection in your eyes...good luck.
you can't make anyone love you but if you be honest and up front with him then is a good chance he will be the same back to you and love can grow from there
I'm in love with someone of the other side of the globe literally. If it's 10am here, it's 10pm on her side of the globe.  it's damn hard.\n\nSince you've got more options than I do and I wish I'm in your shoes right now. If I'm in your shoes right now, I'd call. \n\nLet me see, I'm a guy and you're a girl. We have a different position but the same case.  If I'm the guy, whatever you do doesn't really matter if I don't like you.  If I like you, I'd enjoy getting in touch with you. \n\nHow long have you been friends or acquaintance? It really depends how you know each other.
yeah, its gross, once i give it , i dont want it back,hehehe
I'm glad for you to have survived it\nI'm sure you'll find a nice girl who will love you and want to marry you
Hope and courage.
Its not easy. Time is the only real way. Although memories stay with us forever, their effects diminish with time.\nYou could try to meditate whenever you feel like thinking about the person who broke your heart and try to be alone as little as possible, always have people around to talk to you.\nYou will feel better eventually but like I say, it will take time...

Men and women both play mind games, some more than others, depending on the person.  But, dating always has games, it's an unfortunate fact of life.\nIf he knows you are really interested, you are no longer a challenge to him and he will lose interest in you.  With nothing to lose, he will just mess with your head with stupid little games.  It's not good to be in a one-sided relationship like that.  Get out, or don't act so interested.  Also don't be afraid to stand up to him or call him on his crap, because you're afraid he'll lose interest in you.  He'll likely become more interested in you, plus you won't have to deal with as many petty games from him.
This is a hard one. I agree with Nefeco, the allknowing and Rax... at the end of the day you have to think about your happiness.\n\nWeigh up the pros and cons - you must've got with him for a reason right? try and remember why that was. Also, try and remember that the spark most relationships begin with - rarely lasts. You become friends - share your lives with each other - trust - it is then up to you to put the spark back in.\n\nYou genuinely sound confused and he sounds like a nice, stable, depepndable guy... could that be it? cold feet? how long have you been with him? could it be that his 'planning' has scared you a bit and you are latching onto some fantasy ( you may well be bisexual ).\n\nTake everything into consideration, then sit down with him - admitting that you were bisexual couldnt have been an easy experience - but he didnt freak out did he ? (im guessing you wouldve put that on here otherwise) that means he really wants it to work - and from the sound of him, you must be some catch yourself!... meaning? im guessing what you are mainly worried about is hurting him - if you left him, im guessing your the sort of girl that wouldnt find it hard to get another boyfriend... or a girlfriend for that matter - but that isnt the problem is it? it is losing the stable environment he will provide and hurting his feelings. BUT ashley, staying may cause you both ore damage.\n\nMy advice... (and i dont know if you have or how easy it will be) - is experiement. make sure you are definately gay first. This may anger some people, as it could be construde as cheating - but you have to be sure! this is your happiness at stake!\n\nIf you are, break it off. Say you were confused, but you cant lie to him any longer. You will both be happier in the long run.\n\nGood luck, i hope everything works out for you.
relax.........just come up to the guy and meet him........guys like it when the girl makes the first move.......What if he likes you but hes too scared to ask you out????   just be cool.....good luck   \n\np.s im going throu the same thing .....but the thing is i dont even know this girl
your looks, keep on growing old & make u weaker.....\nbut your character keeps u young & strong......\nso it is now upto us..... to decide which is Important.....
Show him that your interested in him and his hobbies.\nAvoid asking questions that could be percieved as nagging questions.\nWhere are you going?\nWhen will you be back?\nWho was on the phone?
gurl it has happened to me b4.... if this person truly loves u they will eventually forgive u and will forget about it. the best u canm do is say sorry and try to make up. and tell them how u feel and how sorry u are. \nhopefully itll pass soon\ngood luck!
"It doesn't sound like he really wants to be in a committed relationship with you. If he was serious he wouldn't have cheated. He cheated on you not once but twice, according to him. It's probably more than that like when a cop pulls over a drunk driver and they say ""oh, i only had two beers"". I'd say goodbye and move on. As far as going back to being platonic friends it would probably be too awkward and painful and it won't be the same as before."

So, how long have you had these feelings of wanting to have relations with other people? This is clearly a voice screaming out for some attention. You need to stop before you do some serious damage to your relationship with your husband. When you start making assumptions, this leads to accusations. Or worse, you actually believe he is capable of / and having, an affair. So you go have an affair. STOP. He's married to you. Still. Don't be a fool. Just Love him back and don't worry about his past.
I just start my day in the company and I'm boring I have problem with my husband and I'm really depressed.
they are looking for a FREE ride, buddy.  As long as you know that and are okay with it, go for it.  Just go into it with your eyes WIDE open and honest with yourself!
"Why did you break up?\n\nA lot of times after you break up you remember all the good and forget about all the bad they did.  People rarely change.  I've had to learn that no matter how much you love someone, the bad never goes away, and you always will break up for the same stupid reasons.  Hence the ""we dated off and on again for 4 years"" statement people always use."
Red heads are RED HOT!!!!!AY CARUMBA!!!!!!!
i like it and i hate it\ni like it only if they arnt too obnoctious about it \ni dont like it if they make a big huge scene about it or if they do stupid things
No.  Why have sex with one girl when you can have sex with two?\n\nQuit having sex with him.  ASAP.  And watch how quickly he stops hanging out with you.  That's your answer.
YOU WANT O SLOW DOWN BUT YOU ARE GOING OUT WITH HIS PARENTS THIS WEEKEND. THATS DOENT MAKE SENSE. SLOW DOWN MEANS GOING OUT ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK, TALKING ON THE PHONE, HANGING OUT WITHOUT THE KIDS
He really likes you but he also sees that you like his friend. He is not sure about your feelings and he plays games so as to understand what happens. If you reassure him, that you now feel nothing abou his friend, you give him the ''green light'' to move on. He also hesitates to talk about his feekings, because he has a girlfriend. This mean that his first prioority is to do something with his relationship. Maybe he is not sure if he wants to break up with his girlfriend! The only thing you have to do is tell him that YOU NO MORE LIKE HIS FRIEND. Then, you will understand by his moves if he really likes you or not!

Most of the time yes; but my cousin ended up marrying a guy who kept asking her out for like a year and she finally gave in to him. You never know, that may be you.
Take it slow. You don't have to ask her out immediately. She obviously wants you so you should keep complimenting her on her looks. Don't be formal with it. Just let her know you think she looks good. Call her every night and ask lots of question. Girls just like talking so she will appreciate it. When you think it is appropriate to ask her sexual questions ask alot. Let her know your interested. When you both feel sexually comfortable with eachother it won't be akward to touch her where  ever she lets you. When you know you can feel on her just about whenever you want, get close to her and kiss her. It is important to get all of that out the way before you are officially dating her. That way it won't be an akward relationship.
All of the above.
I think it is just an innocent dance. If they comunicate a lot more then something is going on.
like.....choke - em while you poke - em ???
get a life-she's engaged to keith urban!
your still his little girl and he is scared of loosing you. Its hard for a parent to let go he is in denial sit down and tell him instead of loosing you he will be gaining a son in law.
I think that this would be a mistake.  I know that my husband occasionaly says things about a 3-way, but in the end he would have a problem with it.  He would hate knowing that another man has touched me that way.  I don't think he would be able to look at me the same way.
"Of course not, you can like who you want.  It's called free will.  I hate to see people so young cut off options that could make them happy for life.  It didn't work out with your ex--so what!  Just make sure you guys are always open and up front and don't do the ""sneaking around thing"" it will cheapen the relationship.  Love First!"
This is why it makes me so mad to be a woman!!!!!\nFortunately we are not all like this! (just 98% of us)\nScrew all this crap where these chicks are saying money equals security and blah blah blah. \nWhen they find out you have money they see things like shopping, spas, expensive resturants, diamonds, big houses and gifts flowing til no end.\nMoney shouldn't mean anything to a woman if she is actually into YOU and not your bank account. \nNext time a girl shows no interest in you and than changes because they know you have money do this:them that you changed your mind because you would rather not be involved with a gold digger just as she would rather not be involved with a guy with a normal bank account. Than tell her your gonna go buy a big screen and laugh. \nIf you really wanna meet an actual nice woman (we do exsist in small numbers) than never disclose how much money you make until the realtionship is established.\nGood luck..\nI'm sorry most of us are b*tches.
Absolutely! And I would love to kiss her the way she is. Seeing that she likes to keep things 'natural' I would be so turned on to think what else she likes to do naturally ;-) If we hit it off, start to date and her bleached hair above the lips start to bother me I'll introduce her to the joys of waxing.

Simone... there is an old saying. If you straddle a fence, all you get is a sore crotch! Step over to one side or the other! By the sounds of it, if your b/f makes you feel like crap, then you should be looking to move on and find someone that won't. A man worth having lets you know AND FEEL that you are special, and important to them. So, if your current b/f makes you feel like crap, then take your dump and move off the fence. Good luck!
The same thing happened to me, however, the answer is pretty much one thing.  Your presence was required.  She needed and wanted you there to be there for her on a daily basis.  I know the whole ordeal and situation with money, but just as money can't buy you love, you can't survive without money.  Unfortunately, the presence of a person on a daily basis is really and very important, and I think she's hurt because neither one of you two has managed to be together for about 8 years and that's a long time.  It's not your fault and it's not her fault, but why so long is a good question to ask.  \n\nThis is what distance and time apart does to people.  Sometimes people have too much time to think and their imagination runs wild.  She is angry, but more at the separation and distance than at you.  Everything has a time and place and in her own way she is saying and telling you that you can't deal with the pain of being apart so long and any longer.  Once again, it's not your fault, it's just the way things are when two people are apart for such a long time.  The bottom line is and was that your presence was required and you couldn't be there for economic reasons.  Trust me, love doesn't care about money.  \n\nYou didn't hurt her, but she was definitely hurt by your absence.  It is just another way of saying that she really, really missed you.  Unfortunately, people can only wait so long to have somebody at their side regardless of how responsible and caring you might have been at a distance.  I know it's hard and it doesn't make sense, but keep in mind that she is blaming you for not being there for her when she physically needed your presence.  Remember, it's not your fault, but those are some of the consequences of time apart and distance.

Sleep with your best friend's husband, don't use protection, get pregnant, lose the best friend, have the baby, the husband ends the affair, reconciles with the best friend, he sues you for custody, wins, he and the best friend raise the baby, you get visitation every other weekend and one month in the summer, the child calls best friend mommie.\n\nThis hasn't happened to me, I just thought it up, but that would be one hell of a mess, no?

Your a nice girl,  he doesnt want that. So screw him,  never change for a man.  Yourself who you are is always best.  They never really aprreciate it,  and men basically think with their dicks. so the trick to finding a good boyfriend is to look for someone with class who uses his brains and has a heart. without those qualities you will get your heart broken and maybe your life ruined.  I mean this meja with all my heart. Good luck and God bless.
All of them ... lick, suck, nibble, feel, rub, penetrate, blow, kiss, and anything I missed !\n\nI like it best with a vibrator .. but that's just me !
you cant you just have to respect the fact that she's just not ready for that yet and wait until she is. and if sex is that important to you go to another girl.
Maybe you should have one party that lasts all day. One half of the party can come in the morning and the other half can come in the afternoon. You can also make it a pot luck so you don't have to supply all the food. Good Luck!
I always notice the way a woman conducts herself from the first step. The way she moves her feet and the hips, if the shoulders stay parallel or do the slump and sway, where she has her hands when she is walking towards you, is her lips smiling as if she likes you or are they over exaggerated and she wants something from you, eye contact is probably the most important. when she first says anything to you if the eye contact stays during that first conversation, normally she speaks truth and that's a good start. \nHer style of clothes, the make up she wears and her physical condition tells you how in control of herself she is. \nOnce all of that is annualized, then its the sensuality. \nI saw a woman just today that everything about her said sexy ... Except for her eyes. I soon learned she had a small problem with her car and needed someone to help her. The eyes will always give it away.
There will always be someone better, someone prettier, someone smarter...whatever it is....\n\nIf you look inside yourself, you will find the answer.  Learn who you are....and learn to appreciate yourself for being you.  True happiness only comes when you learn to love yourself, and when you do, you will no longer feel jealousy...or guilt...or shame.  It might seem like a lot, buts its easier than pretending to be something youre not.
You never underestand if they like you or not. men easily lie.
i hope so, i love my friends
I'm in the same situation. I'm not obsessed.You only need the dating tips if you can't funtion because of thinking about this person.That would be obsession. If you can't express how you feel to this person and be with them,then literally get yourself a life.No disrespect.You just have to refocus.This person isn't spending (or waisting) their every waking hr thinking about you.Remember then fondly & love them from afar.

i think you defined it perfectly!  \n\ni would only clarify attention as physical or thoughts.
I think interracial relationships of any kind are perfectly normal. Why can't you like/love another person if they are not the same gender or race as you? These aren't the old days anymore and with the children coming up today, they are being exposed to more at a younger age (Depending where in the country you live). Here in Providence, RI you see interracial couples ALOT! Asian and black, Asian and White, Black and White, Spanish/Latin and White, Spanish/Latin and Asian, Spanish/Latin and Black, etc. It's so common here, what is there to say about it?! It's beautiful! And there is nothing more awesome than a world with love and peace!!! So accept love in whatever color it comes in. You never know, you may be into something GOOD. And I know this because I have experienced love from a different race. And if your in doubt of what others may think about it, think to yourself. If your were madly in love with a girl/boy from a different gender/race, would you let people pull the two of you down? Hopefully not... ... ...~Kay
I hate to tell you this but I think so.  You should contact a lawyer and find out what your rights are.

My experience with this is that she is insecure about herself. Looking at her longer than 5 seconds might give her the idea that you're picking out her flaws, even when you're just admiring her beauty.

That depends on the personalities of the people in your family. Age is a key factor.

I THINK THAT IF A QUESTION WAS ASKED AND ANSWER WAS GIVEN AND IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE PRIVATE. YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSE TO TELL ANYONE. MY HUSBAND SOMETIMES COMES AND TELLS ME STUFF THAT HIS FREINDS TELL HIM IN COFIDNECE THAT HE WONT TELL. I WONT LISTEN NOR RETAIN THAT INFO. CAUSE IN MY OPINION IF HIS FRIEND WANTED TO TELL ME HE WOULD. AND IT'S JUST SOMETHING PRIVATE. THAT SHOULD BE KEPT PRIVAITE IF REQUESTED.

"The one major lesson I've learned in life - ""TRUST NO ONE"""
Go and find out how she's doing. She needs as much assurance and caring as possible. Just like in the recent movie 'War of the the Worlds', only here it's a socially accepted 'divorce'. I believe that an ex-girlfriend is still a human after all. Of course, if the spark wasn't there in the previous relationship, it won't be there a second time either, so a reunion is out of the question.

Do nothing. Your sister is young she will figure out what she wants eventually. She has to grow up and make her own choices.
you're already doing your best. You cant bring his mother back......  But, you love him, and by being with him every time he breaks down, by listening to him....and by all these things you do for him you're helping him!!   You're great  :-)
it feels out of the question!!!
i kinda am having that same problem right now. but you know what. if someone is going to do you that dirty and you really didn't even do anything wrong in the first place, then you don't need them and they were really never a true friend to begin with. there are other people out there that have a better heart than that, and that REALLY care...trust me. i can tell you this much though. you ask an 80 year old woman or even a man, how many true friends they had in their lifetime, and i can guarantee that they can count them all on one hand. and they probably wont even need all 5 fingers...thats just a part of life..
i pushed someone away that i really loved and cared about and i still do..but i realized that i cant be friends with someone i love and care about because i dont want to be his friend i want to be his girl..his everything..sometimes things arnt meant to be..there someone else for you..i know its harder said then done trust me for that...because i know i could never wake up tommorrow and just forget all about him and everything him &I did or went through together..everything i was doing i thought it was right at the time but in the end it was pushing him farther away when all i wanted to do was bring him closer.you shoudl re evaluate yourself and see all the things you did that made the relationship sour..WHEN A MANS MIND IS MADE UP A MANS MIND IS MADE UP..he can only make the decisions to be with you..to be your friend or to leave it alone..maybe what you need is space between the two and see how that unfolds..you could call him and let him know how you feel just like i did...just because i felt as though i needed some closure..i felt like i needed to tell him what was on my mind and after i got enough guts to let him know how i felt it felt soooo good to talk to him and tell him what i was thinking..just to hear his voice and have us laugh and talk again made me feel like the million bucks that i needed to feel like..but dont push too hard and dont sweat him too much just have that one phone call and thats it..let him know how you feel and then let him take it from there..just put it into the air..now what he does with that information is up to him..my ex knows how i feel and what he does with that information is up to him....you see what im saying? if he comes back he comes back? IF YOU LOVE HIM SET HIM FREE..IF HE COMES BACK HES YOURS FOREVER..just sit back..whats meant to be is meant to be..everybody is not meant for you..your time will come..good luck hope i helped!
ok u need to go to a bar or a club and find yourself a chick not on the web...lol seriously if ur that desperate get a prostitute
You play it cool and dont gush your feelings to the guy very two seconds....guys tend to be very quiet about their feelings and it is usually pretty hard to tell what he is truly thinking...so just wait it out and dont try to force his emotions out of him

"depends on your sister.  she will probably be well taken care of and a lot of women would prefer that over any deep relationship.  women do want ""security"" to feel comfortable in a relationship.\n\nthe guy has been in school for a whole 8 years longer than most people so he is probably emotionally 8 to 10 years younger anyway.  \n\nhe gets a trophy wife and she gets the much sought after ""security""."

How about a sexy devil and sexy angel - make one side of the cake red and do the little naughty devil theme, then the other side white for the angel - how fun - have a great time!!
"have you  ever heard the expresion""You have to be a friend to have a friend"". Women can tell when a guy is seeking to find someone. I know that is hard to find someone in this day and time. Try to find someone that interest you. Don't always base your preference on looks. Start out by being friends.Spend time together with no pressure to date.That is a good way to get to know someone. No sexual contact or pressure.Sex always changes your relationship. If you can be friends then you have found someone to try and bring your relationship up one level with them.Do you know a girl that has the same interest in sports or art or what ever you like. And try to be honest in a relationship.Always speak your mind with love not sarcasm. I my self always found love when I wasn't looking for it!"
Probably you should ask her what would she like to do may be she is'nt into barbies 9 year old girls and up they are going to a stage where they are fragile and want to be spoiled, loved and have the attention take her somewhere fun or just maybe she likes to read take her to a book store buy her a book but dont let her get the best of you
oh yes.....of course i do...who doesn't....
It is what it is.It's hard to control who your going to fall in love with.Do you just love him or is it physical?If your truly in love with him it's your life live it.
There is no magic foruma for getting over it, and there is NO set amount of time for the grieving to end. The pain of your loss will become less and less sharp as time goes by. But you will never foget, and you don't want to do that.  Everybody grieves in their own way, so just let it happen. You haven't really lost them, they will always be in your heart. They may not be here, with you, but you now have a brand new Guaradian Angel.
Hey where did u get the wierd Idea?
""
Not at all. Relationships at such a young age tend to be difficult and end in heartbreak and tragedy. People at that age just are not mature enough to form lasting relationships and often get themselves hurt. Wait until you feel ready to be in a relationship and dont just do it because you think you are supposed to. It is so much better that way.
yeah... LOL
They want you to tell u that.. :)
likes you as in... a boyfriend.. if so.. thats kinda weird...\n\nand.. actually now i think of it.. its kind of odd for her to be calling at all.. expecially since you just 'broke her daughers heart' [ its what all moms think guys do to their daughters... whether thats what happend or not ]... \n\nyeah.. i think you should ask her to stop calling you.
I am one that likes to mind his own business on stuff like that.  These things have a way of coming out anyway.  Plus if you tell, things have a way of making you look like the bad guy and you are only trying to help.
First, learn to speak English and your possibilities for love are boundless!
Listen, only you can know if it is right or not. I would talk to him and ask if he like you, trust me, in the long run you don't want to get hurt. Only you can make a good decision in the long run, but you need all the info.  Its the safest way to know.
so do i!!!!!!!!!!!
well all you could do is tell her that you dont smoke, and if she could please not smoke before you get intamate with her. After is one thing:)! But, If she cant respect you because you dont smoke, then tell her that you are not interested and keep it movin.\n If she agrees to not smoke around you when you are there with her (whether both of you are doin' it or hanging out) then she has respect for you. Dont ever let anyone make you feel that being a non-smoker is a bad thing. There aint nothing wrong with not smoking. At least you wont have to worry about coughing up a lung or something...LOL...\ni smoke, but i dont do it around people who dont smoke. I respect other's wishes, and im pretty sure you respect her and in turn she should respect you.

I used to have a sister and it was cool. so I would imagine having a bro would be the same.
I'm a guy and I'm going to answer this anyway.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with it. A lot of people have fetishes. Personally I love women's feet (nice ones of course). I know another guy that finds pregnant women sexy. There is nothing weird about that. The only downside to the pregnant thing is most pregnant women will not have sex with you unless you got them that way so you'll just be looking and wishing.\n\nWow reading all these answers I had to come back and comment more. What idiots! Don't listen to them. They have no idea what fun is. They're too uptight. My girlfriend loves that I love her feet and gets very turned on when I rub them. And Brainyguy has no brains. F'em!

put an announce at newspapers with your dad's pic and ask any one your dad slept with in past and have a kids call me and don't forget to put a reward. you will have million brothers and sisters.
Just to let you know.. Parents tend to do that a lot when your growing up, because they love you and don't want you to have a hard life. Your dad probably does that because he wants you to grow up to be a responsible, outstanding human being. If it hurts you let him know what you feel, and he will understand... He has to when you tell him how you honestly feel, let him know you are a kid and your not perfect! Tell him you out of all people deserve RESPECT!!!

It was right to tell your friend he was flirting.  You also could have told him to stop or you would tell his girl and if it stopped then not have said anything  Either way what's done is done.  Don't blame yourself for their break up but I definitely would advise against going out with him.  A friends ex is always off limits unless you want to lose a friend.  Boyfriends may come and go but a true friend will always be there and you don't want to jeopardize your friendship over a man.
You should try and talk to him more and just become really good friends again until he is ready to open up and then you can have a relationship with him again.
10th through 12th grade...finally gave it up when I graduated. And that's when we shockingly became really close friends. That was 8 years ago, and next year I'm attending her wedding....to ANOTHER guy named Chris. Haha, C'est la vie!

I know how you feel.  Woman are so beautful.  I am a bi female.  Woman are much better kissers than men.  I can give you suggestions from my personal experinces.  Never invite a woman into your bedroom that is involed in your personal life.  You want someone that has no connection on a daily basis w/ the both of you.  Because this is all new to you it would help if the woman you invite has had some kind of experence.  It is hard to find a female.  So if this is the first time for you and her go for it.  You and your boyfriend need to talk openly and honestly about this.  Leave no dought or confussion between you guys. How far are you willing to let your boyfrined go?  2 woman together should be about the 2 woman. Not what the man wants.  A lot of times another female joining a couple will not want to have sex w/ the male. Sometimes a bi female will put up with a man just because she wants to enjoy his girl.  Your wanting to enjoy a females body and touch.  Try a strip club that has a lot of contact dancing or nude dancing.  If this excites you both then your both on the same path.  Not all 3 somes work out.  You might do more sexualy to the other woman then she is willing to do to you.  If you find out at some point during a 3 some you just can't do this, stop.   A lot of woman will not speak up.  If you feel that you are being pushed aside by your boyfriend and this other woman. Another words they are enjoying each other not you don't hang around for that. It may take 3, 4 ,5 times before you have a 3 some expierance that is even worth remembering. It ia all about what you and the female want to enjoy.  Most men will agree to just watch, because they want in on it. Check out a escort bussiness. Escorts are on a different level then eveyday people. You get what you want. She wont steal your man.  And she never has to see the both of you again. Escorts also know how to take charge and will.  Try kissing another female and if you are left wanting more than you are ready.
well looks like your just going to have to get over urself. If she is stayin in touch with you and is coming to see you well then you need to stop worryin for nothing. Long distance relationships are hard and this is one of the reasons they dont make it cause of the trust issue. If you love her then dont worry about it. Your only thinkin of things that will ruin it. And accusing her will only end it for you. Unless she stops talkin to you or gettin mad at you for no reason things like that then really stop worrying it's just distance.
This is a hard one for many,your gut wants you to stand up and say something and call them out on their name calling. But like you said 'they can fight' and you don't want a bunch of girls jumping you just cause you didn't like the things they are saying.Rumors can be very cruel in school and your peers seem to listen to them other then see the real YOU. Just remember those words are only words. Don't let them get to you or make your day bad. Only YOU can make your day bad by allowing them to get to you. Show others you are better then that and step tall with your head held high rumors will go away with more rumors, your pride will always remain in your heart don't step to their level. You cant change people only your reaction to them. ;-)
rumor.\nhttp://www.ashleytisdale.com/interviews/bop/bop-june06.asp\nlooks like the friendship could turn into romance though.
In some cases, escort services are nothing more than a nicer way of saying sex for money.  There are some legitimate escort services because remember, prostitution is illegal in the United States, however, I believe most escort services are nothing more than a different way of marketing prostitution with or without sexual intercourse.  It is also more discreet.  Always remember, that as long as the male population is willing to pay for sex, there will always be some form of marketing for prostitution.  Like anything else, it is a business, and the women don't make money if the men aren't willing to pay whatever price for the sex, conversation, and company.

Nice guys rule! It doesn't matter what your friends think; just what you think. Maybe they are just jealous that you have a nice boyfriend?
You have the right to evict her, any time. She might be jelaous of your gf.

I'm not a man. I have 5 tattoos on my body. They are in places where they can't be seen, except for the one on my ankle. Someone here called them tramp stamps. I'll have you know I am not a tramp, have never been one & never will. You people are all wet when it comes to some issues. Why should a woman be branded a tramp just because of tattoos. What if someone wanted her to get them, like her husband. I suppose he wanted her to be classified as a tramp. Grow up penis breath.........

It depends what you are looking for.  There are legal aid attorneys available in just about every state and county to aid with domestic violence, divorce and family situations. Get in touch with your local family court or district attorneys office and ask them about a public defender or a list of local attorneys that do pro bono work for your county/state.
Yes it is, if you have you money you gonna have fun

Blow them off, their obviously not making the effort to keep the friendship going, so put it in their hands.  If they want to contact you they will.
go to their house..and dump all the shampoo outta the bottle, and replace it with yogurt. Yup...I always wanted to do that. Let me know how it works out...haha!
Perfect ,,,lmao....  uuummm no one is Perfect. And think about it, how much fun would it be if  he was Perfect. You couldn't be Grumpy at him, ( A WOMEN'S JOB LOL ) You couldn't Fight an Argue,that means no Fun making up, ( which is the best part). What you really need to look for in all honesty, is a Man that is good in the bad parts you have, and your good in the bad parts he has.

on a first date with a guy the movies is a good idea..the guy should pay or maybe im just old fashioned..my boyfriend always pays for everything if we go out to eat or to the movies i have never paid anything..but its accordint to the guy really..so i think maybe you should take money just in case he doesnt pay..just test the waters to see if hes going to plan on paying or not..when you talk to him just say something like how much is the movie and see what he says...
as long as youre still attracted to your spouse i dont see why it has to be a problem.  everyone gets turned on by others after they're married, its not just you!
the most simple and obvious answer is you can't....but you can control your actions!!!\nwhen you feel that you are falling for someone you shouldn't be falling for, then simply stop meeting him, don't call or recieve his phonecalls...just cut off all sorts of communications with him....\nwe can't control our feelings, but we can stop them from growing...\nGood luck
So, didnt you like the answers she got?
Look at guys as at someone who could be your friend instead of as potential boyfriends.  That usually helps.  \n\nTry to talk about things you like, like music, sports, whatever.\n\nDon't be afraid.  Most of them are just as scared as you are.....
Everything is okay.  He is 37, and he's correct.  A man just can't last as long as he get's older... and the sexual drive isn't there like it used to be.  You on the other hand are just coming down out of your sexual peak and are still wanting it ALL THE TIME.  Be a little bit more understanding for your man... if it's a real concern find a local health food store and look for some herbal suplements that will help build up his libido.  There's also Enzyte... the happy pill.
"oh yeah.  been married 20 yrs w/ 2 kids.  I really trusted the ****.  And like a fool, i forgave him and thought everything was fine, then come to find out almost a year later, he's still doin it and her. in the process of getting divorced. man am i goin to screw him royally, just like he did me. as for how did i know, i felt it in the pit of my stomache and used some detective skills i've learned over the years.  If you think he's cheatin and you get a knot in your gut, then he's cheating.  and as much as i hate to say it "" once a cheater, always a cheater."""

Yes!  Absolutely try it again.  But don't look for any particular type of man--I mean, don't seek divorced men just because you are divorced.  \n\nRemember this:  Everyone has a past--that's what makes us who we are.  You have learned from your mistakes, you've grown up and now you're ready to settle down.  And yes, you are deserving.  \n\nIf I could only give you one piece of advice it would be to seek out a mate in your circle of interest.  Bars are not the best place to seek out someone to spend your whole life with.  But on the other hand, if you like to read, join a book club.  If you like church, join a singles group at  your church.  And don't be overly anxious.  When the right person comes a long, you will know it.\n\nI wish you the best of luck, my friend.  There are good men out there, you just have to be patient.\n\nGod bless!

every long term relationship goes through ups and downs in the sex department, just like in everything else.\n\nYou need to tell him how your feeling. But be carefull not to make him feel bad about not giving you orgasms.. just ask him if there is something wrong.. or if he has any ideas for spicing up your love life. Who konws.. he may be thinking the same thing you are.. \n\nGood luck.. ive been there and back and there and back.. lol
i get the same thing girl and it all boils down to one thing, one word...JEALOUSY. girls like to be the most attractive girl in the crowd and when we come around we make them self consious and take the atention off of them. I am also not vain, but i realize this situation ALL OF THE TIME, and i am not the only one, my guy friends notice it also.
excuse the other folks' rude answers.  it sounds like you are very worried about this.  do yourself a favor and relax.  do  you think maybe he's just telling you that to see if you'll tell him how much you care about him?  or do you  know for a fact his family may be planning to move there?  could be just a head game, i don't k now you guys' ages.  so many things we worry about never even happen, relax.  if in fact he does move, and  you find yourself with a broken heart, just try to keep really busy with your friends and family.  if you two are meant to be together it will happen t hat way.  and if not, you will fall in love with someone else and forget all about him if it'snot meant to be.  good luck
No, that's hella childish. If she is a ex friend , what did you expect? Of course she had something to say...Didn't you? I am almost sure you have talked about her to your other friends too. Let the shit go and prove your a bigger woman. If she approach you with bull shit, thats different. You need to ask yourself ,why would someone tell you she was talking about you? Probably to see a fight or to start the drama. Stay drama free and grow up....

nothing wrong with that. I have had sex with some woman that want to be watched by there husbands as well and it's gratifying forall involved.
"The first rule is to not let him do anything to you that you do not approve of. It's fine if you accomodate him at times, but only if you are comfortable with it. If he tries anything that makes you uncomfortable, do not let him get away with it.\n\nConcerning his ""addiction"", it sounds like it's fueling his interest instead of satiating it. With that said, it does sound like there is a rough road ahead. Obviously this is something that needs to come out into the open and soon. (I mean a real serious talk, maybe in a consuling session.)\n\nFinally, I'm glad that you are not perceiving this as something amoral in him, because it's not. The urges are there and that will change over time. As long as you are comfortable with what he does with those urges, things should be fine. It sounds like you're afraid that you may be uncomfortable at some point in the near future. That's what consuling and openness will have to work on."
I have had almost the same problem except it was my own brother. His wife was a bitch on wheels. Rude and unsociable to anyone. We tried to be nice, invited her on vacations you name it. We even tried to talk to my brother about the way she was but he didn't want to hear it, even though he knew we were right. After being married for 7 years he came to his senses and divorced her. Yeah! It was a great day. So my advice to you is, let him be for now. He will come to his senses; hopefully in less than 7 years. Its better to let him figure it out on his own then lose a brother over an argument about it.
Yes. Girls love to be kissed by people that care for them and treat them right.
Check out events for single parents in your area--they don't even need to be advertised as mixers or dating events--they could be ways to meet other potential friends who have the same situation as you (need social friends and also to meet men to date.) \n\nDepending on where you live and what you're into, these events could be things like wine tasting parties, white water rafting or nature hikes, guided tours/walks, art gallery openings, game nights, etc. A lot of places have open houses where you can take a free class or a sampling of free classes. At the very least, you might find new interests and new friends.
Because guys values in a relationship are not the same as girls.  When girls are selecting a mate they are thinking ahead will he be a good provider.  Guys usually think shes hot testosterone really rules men.

Because you let him.  I make sure a guy does what I want, and to hell with him if he acts selfish.  Just take control. You have what he wants, so don't give it to him if he doesn't play nice.  I am only 16, and I don't take that attitude from anybody, even college guys.
I don't know, except the first step is finding a good familya nd conveyancing lawyer and asking them.
"Try to just talk about things you guys are doing together. Almost reminise you relationship so far and the casual ask ""so what are we?"" Almost like you don't know. Don't ask questions like where is the going or the seriousness of the relationship. Make sure you're willing to put yourself out their with your wishes even if they might not see the relationship in the same spot."

Well I don't know if this constitutes as an actual date but it's so far the closest thing I have to a worst date. \nThis past New Years' weekend I was sick with the flu. The guy I was dating at the time came up to see me and take care of me. He had brought me medicines, made me soup and had even washed my dishes and cleaned up my kitchen a bit. After a bit I was starting to feel tired and was just about to fall asleep when he started begging me to have sex with him. He begged for like a half hour. Now needless to say that sex was the last thing I wanted to do even if it had been Brad Pitt next to my bed. \nNeedless to say that not long after that, I dumped him.
It all depends on the type of Books he is into. The Oath is a book I'm currently reading at it is really good. You could also go for a classic like Moby Dick, Tom Sawyer, or How to Kill a Mockingbird.
Blackpeoplemeet.com its a dating site where you can meet people from all around.  Good Luck  :)
I am not Gay and I believe that they SHOULD be able to marry. I am glad you were able to grow up and realize that it doesn't effect you, or me or any other straight person. I just wish the rest of the world you see logic instead of religious ideation.

love has no judgements\n\n love does not take into account colour, race, religion etc\n\n love is beyond all our control, that's why it's so special
Ethically you cannot tell him unless it is a business relationship you are looking for (eg he's a dr. you are a nurse)... \n\nIf you are looking for any other type of relationship (ie friendship or more) you will have to wait until he has been released and then have some time pass (at least a few months) before you can give him the message...

because they see it as a way to become popular by intimidating people and making others afraid of them. if there is no resistance, they win. either that or maybe, they're just scared people. they're afraid they'll be rejected for who they are.

"You weren't ""robbed"" of a wedding. You chose not to have a large wedding and reception. Giving yourself a wedding now -- after a year and a child -- is just tacky. Why not give yourself a first anniversary party instead?"
"I don't know what you mean by ""dirty"" but once you put it out there you can't take it back. He can't possibly unhear what you've told him. If it's to much for him he'll move on.

"The boy's and girl's name Shiloh is pronounced SHY-loh. It is of Hebrew origin, and its meaning is ""His gift."" Biblical place name. Shiloh is also the site of a crucial battle in the American Civil War. Actor Brad Pitt and actress Angelina Jolie named their daughter Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt.\n\nShiloh has 3 variant forms: Shilo, Shylo and Shyloh.\n\nShiloh is a rather uncommon female first name, ranking 4105 out of 4275 for females of all ages in the 1990 U.S. Census. Shiloh is a common surname, ranking 54257 out of 88799 for people of all ages in the 1990 U.S. Census.\n\nAlso:\n\nShiloh (shī'lō) , town, central ancient Palestine, the modern Khirbet Seilun, the West Bank, NNE of Jerusalem. In biblical times it lay in the territory of Ephraim. The Hebrews were, apparently, the first to build extensively on the site. Shiloh was home to the priests Eli and Ahijah, boyhood home of Samuel, and the place where the Ark rested after the conquest of Canaan. It was the sanctuary and meeting place of the Levites until the Philistines captured the Ark of the Covenant. References to it in the Bible are numerous."

The unknown is always scary. Something took a wrong turn 15 years ago, and you haven't been on track since then. You  probably feel like your all alone in the woods now. So prepare yourself mentally to leave so you can physically leave or fix this! You have 2 choices. 38 years is a long time. I believe the magic that brought you two together is still alive, although it may seem like a candle in the sun. If either one of you had wanted to really end this, one of you would be long gone. But your both still co-excisting in the same home.  First, find yourselve again. If your job can't support you if you should decide to leave, use this time to find another job. Keep in mind, he is going to have to 1/2 things with you. So your probably going to be alright financially from the divorce settlement, if you go this route. Next you need friends. Don't sit at that house wondering what he is doing 8 to 10 hours on a daily basis. That is 8 to 10 hours that you have, to do anything you want. This is all about you now. You can't make him be happy. You can't make him come home after work, and probably really don't want to at this point. Stop doing the norm!!! Never ask him again, where he has been. You no longer care. You are  mentally prepping yourself for a better life. Now, keep in mind, once you are centered, he is going to notice the difference. They always do. At this point, you can try and rekindle or you continue to move ahead with your mental plan. What ever it is you decide to do, just get started on it as soon as possible. Woman, you are in the prime of your life! You have a lot to offer someone that will appreciate you. People live so much longer these days, and happy people make living longer even better. You come out of that house, re-enter the world of the living, get with friends, go to dinner, shopping, or take a singles vacation. Whatever it is, just do it! After about 6 months from now, you are going to be a new person. You are going to be a happier person. You are going to be alive and enjoying new things. You just refocus from who you where, and turn it around to who you want to be. You are going to be living each day for you. And if your husband wants to be apart of all this wonderful stuff, he can mentally change just like you are going to. If he is not a part of this plan, that is OK to, because in time you will mentally know you can carry on with out him. Good Luck, and God bless you and your determination.
You shouldve stayed with pussy....What the fuck are thinking? And you have kids. You want your kids exposed to that shit? The only thing better then pussy is new pussy!
No I think you are totally right.  I agree....I think we are the test rats
Depends on if you are reformed to society or not. Since you've been more than once, I assume you didn't reform yourself the first time. I think people that have been incarcerated have the ability to reform their lives and be productive people in society, but it has to be a concious effort on the persons part to wanna change. I wouldn't hold it against you unless you repeatedly made the same mistakes again. Like the above comment, it also depends on the crime.
i haven't talked to mine in over a year... just ignore them, they'll come around...in a few years....
"Express your concerns and tell him if he is tickling you too much.  He may need to adjust the touch a little so it is very satisfying and not to ticklish to you.\n\nHaving said that, you might also want to explore another wonderful form of extended foreplay which I call ""ticklish orgasm denial"".  Have him restrain you to the bed so you cannot block.  While he is treating you to oral and you feel the orgasms developing, he will suddenly tickle you on your feet or stomach or sides or armpits for 15 - 30 seconds and then he will immediately return to the oral stimulation.  After 30 - 60 minutes of ticklish orgasm denial, he will treat you to one of the most satisfying orgasms you will ever have.  \n\nThis will only work if there is a strong trust and respect there so he will not abuse you or take advantage of you.  He really needs to want to please you for this to work."

well i did on purpose once because it was after school and no one was there... it was a dare. i was like in the 4th grade? in our little-kid school, girls bathrooms have pink stalls and floors... and boys have green stalls and floors. \nisn't that kinda strange? lol.

"There are two or three kinds of cheaters. The worst kind, and I know several, are the immature selfish type who seem to need to prove to themselves over and over that they ""still have it"" or somehting like that. Then there is the guy who loses it once or twice. Men who travel a lot, and women, get very lonely at night. Hard to describe but I've been there. The porn industry makes a killing by selling all kinds of adult programs to hotel travellers. They really miss home ... the wrong situation, the wrong time, perhaps there was an angry exchange with the wife ... some hot babe walks into the bar and sits next to him ... it happens. \n\nThe third kind is the guy or woman who has been in a loveless marriage for years. There is a nice house, kids, community life and all kinds of great things that came from the marriage. But somewhere along the way the romance died. Husbands and wives spend so much time battling over emotional territory, work so hard to get what they want out of the marriage ... lots of wives offer sex as a reward for good behavior. It seems to work so well that they never give it away for free, lest they lose that leverage. Husbands may in turn stop doing anything unless they get a reward for it. Sick, I know, but those of you who've been married for a long while know what I'm talking about. The husband or wife who ""cheats"" on that marriage is usually desperate for genuine intimacy. Love that doesn't require a high score on the report card. The women who use the vagina as a wrench aren't terribly happy, either, and are just as likely to be seduced into the ""cheat.""\n\nIt is a sad state of affairs. Unfortunately, the young immature guy or gal who cheats early on for selfish reasons pretty much destroys the trust needed to find real intimacy. He or she will wind up at an early age in the third kind of loveless marriage. \n\nThe key, I think, is to never use sex for leverage. Never!!! It is a shared intimacy that only the two can share. If you want a new car or tennis bracelet, just ask. Amaze him with your passion and give him a place of emotional refuge at home. He will be so grateful that he'll bring home gifts on his own. Those are the best kind."
No you are not wrong to be upset!  Those are your feelings!
"""Just a joke"" often means somebody covering themselves. In this case it doesn't sound like a joke.  \n\nBut covering themselves doesn't necessarily mean she stole it.  She may have felt that she had your permission to borrow things, as you implied.  So if somebody confronted her about something she borrowed, her automatic response may well have been to become defensive and conver herself.  \n\nI'm a little confused about her not returning, though.  You share a bedroom.  Do you share dressers and closets?  If she has her own set of clothes and stores it there, why not just take it back?  Surely she hasn't been WEARING it for the past two weeks.  \n\nTalk to her about it, but don't accuse her.  If she felt she was allowed to borrow your stuff freely, it's not fair to accuse her of stealing simply because you hadn't worn the skirt yet, especially if she didn't know it was brand new or special.\n\nGood luck."
Call your local child and family services office, the requirements vary by state.. They usually have classes to become a foster parent. Good luck. My husband and I were foster parents for 10 years. We have adopted two girls that we received as foster children as infants.
If the girl thinks your cute or nice she will probably flirt with you. Also if the girl looks at you alot she is probably attracted to you. If she gets nervous or bashful when you talk to her well then she has a major crush on you!
I think u should go with some nice slacks, dockers or polo or something, but loose. Not baggy just loose. Then go with a button down. Usually plaid looks best. Don't buy the ones in a package those are old man shirts. Look on the racks. Usually Kohls (if u have one in your area)  has nice clothes.
"Hi. I am an adoptive mom and know the day will come when I'll be asked the same thing. First of all, not to be rude to you, but please eliminate the words ""REAL MOTHER"" from your vocabulary. Use birthmother instead. Yes, she has been a real mom to you by entrusting you to your adoptive parents. But your adoptive parents have been real parents by raising you till now. If you say ""real mom"" about your birthmother, then is your mom your ""fake mom""? I'm sure you didn't mean anything negative by it, but trust me it will hurt your adoptive parents to hear it.\n\nHere’s a link  to search resources\n\nhttp://www.adopteerights.org/search/internetresources.htm\n\nbest wishes and God bless"
well yes,my fiancee is on here.
Have kids?\nIf yes, give then time, take care of them.\nIf no, be engaged with some charitable works.
as much as i hate to admit.... my parents have always been right about every girl i have dated.
you have to get down on 1 knee. Go to a NICE dinner, then to a place special to the two of you get down on 1 knee with the ring and ask\n\ngood luck!!!
People backstab for lots of reasons.  Like the previous young lady mentioned...sometimes it's jelousy.  Other reasons is because that person has no respect for you or anybody else.  People backstab because they're selfish and want something for themselves and don't care who they have to hurt to get it.  It's best not to associate with those people.  They cary bad Karma and that's something nobody wants.  People that do that kind of thing are toxic and you should stay away.\nBest of luck.
People continue to fight, knowing it is bad because people are different. They want others to see things their way, and it upsets them when thy don't. They fight to try to prove that they are right and the other person is wrong. It is silly but that is how society is.
you are to used to others waiting on you in time it will be reality he will want a rea; spouse who can be there where you wasnt . as far as guilt you ought to have thought before you messed up with that other person
Sure, it's just a mans right to be sexually satisfied, i'm not sure about the shoes, though.
Body language can say a lot. Is she smiling at you? Looking you in the eye? Does she laugh a lot or touch her hair or her face or you? These are all good signs.\nIf she seems uncomfortable, won't look at you, is looking down, or stays a good distance away from you, chances are she's not really interested.\nAnd if a girl says no, ALWAYS take it as no. If she meant yes, she'll come back and let you know.
follow your heart, if it means that they don't want to be friends with you anymore that's up to them you can't really control that.
You can love me anyday, sweetie ;)
hey u r fun
movies, talk a walk, the beach, have a pic nic,go to the park and play on the swings and have him push u, it depends on whats in ur area u can go horse back riding, an amusementpark, a zoo, mini golf, etc there is tons of things to do!
kissing is a personal thing that is between you and the one you kissed. if you denyed it, i could see her being mad,but if you said nothing (to anyone) i do not see a problem. if you had told others and not her,then she would feel let down. you are not required to tell your friend EVERYTHING. even if she tells you. do tell her why you had not mentioned it though. like you were thinking of your feelings after the kiss and trying to decide if it was worth talking about. she most likely feels since others knew that you don't find her opinion worthy of notice. reassure her that was not a factor.
Your body releases chemicals that are very similar to tweak (as in speed or crystal meth).  So you lose your apatite and feel a bit jittery.  \nBut then when that all wears off, if the girl is still as great as when you first started falling in love with her, the magic happens.  You feel like you are only really complete when you are together.  Like part of you is missing when she isn't there.  You know you would do anything to save her from a burning building (or any other threatening situation) even if you know it would kill you.  \nI have done lots of things like rock climbing, jumping out of airplanes and driving 140 mph in a 65 zone, but nothing compares to the feeling I get when I look at my wife.
become intersting in the things that she is and she should do the same. if you have common interests you should not have a problem finding things to talk about....the thing is, it's not a good sign that you have problems finding things to talk about.  i talk to my gf for 8 hours on the phone and we never run out of things to talk about....maybe you just need to get to know each other better and get closer.
"Friendship? A friendship between a man and a woman is not what you girls call a friendship. It is a mild attraction, based purely on a future date in which you will have sex with them when you are totally desperate, that is masked by a mild interest in what the other is saying. If you have a ""friendship"" with a guy, it just means that you are using him or he is using you and one/both of you expects sex and/or money at some future date.\n\nSo don't worry about it and let him know. You might find that he will give you your payment early. Either way you will get what you deserve."

"okay, check out my profile on the questions asked section.  i know the feeling.  however, in my situation, we have crossed that line over 2 years ago.  As for being my Best friend, He has been my best friend for 6 years.  It doesn't start off as ""oh, yea, i am want to steal this man from his wife"", or visa versa.  It is a connection.

If you ever need to talk, feel free to e-mail me @ ammutdevour@comcast.net. - i read your other asked question.  please e-mail, i might be able to give you advice. consequences, benefits, etc."
probably, cuz people aren't always who you think they are. hope you find somebody.
i agree single man looking for a mate in the suburbs .is not really a valid question.\ndo you want to buy my car.-----oops\ni repair moon mobiles on the dark side of the moon ---sorry\n\nbut seriously i am single and live in Antarctica ,any Eskimo maidens want to migrate,dam \n\nbut i do know what you mean and there are a lot of other \ntype questions that are more like anouncements \n\nor questions that just say ,banana, or brother or sister\nand we have to figure out the rest of the question .\n\nplease people if you cannot think of a question,\n this is not a sin ,\nsave the five points and answer a few ,\ngive some input with your opinion instead.\n\nor is this to much to ask \n\nanybody has a female crocodile for my male??????(believe it or not ,that is for real)
"""Oh, thanks for asking, but I don't have the same feelings for you.  It's very sweet of you to ask, but no.""\n\nDo this privately, and never discuss it with your friends or anyone else.  What is ""crushing"" to boys is the humiliation of girls talking about them and saying things like, ""eww, gross, he asked me out but I wouldn't touch him with a ten-foot pole,"" etc.\n\nJust have a little respect for both him and yourself and you'll be fine.  Remember that you are helping him to learn that life goes on after disappointments, which is critical to building confidence."
HOT!\n\ni so want one!
they aren't very assertive and believe people won't like them if they stand their ground. I use to have a similar problem but over time decided to say no when I wanted to. it works better to just say no than to string people along. you can't make everyone happy.
stop worrying about sex.
I don't think that you can
Look here:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_adoption
you have been open with her that you do not want her attention.  you might let your husband know about it so he is aware of what happened but not push it further.  she most likely will leave you alone from now on, give it a chance. if she doesnt, stay away from where she is going to be if she makes you uncomfortable.
""
for a man, cook (or buy him) his favourite meal, if he normally drinks beer, have something a little more expensive to drink. dim the liughts with lite music. He will love it.
hmm, long distance relations work on trust..you have to trust the person blindly and care for him...if you trust him or her automatically care, love will come into your relation and it will be healthy...\n\ncheers!!!
Leave him.  You are no good for him.  By this I mean you must be a happy, complete person before you get in a relationship.  It is not a partners responsibilty to make you happy.  \n\nYou don't need to make him understand.  Ending it is enough.  It's his responsibility to make his peace with it, not yours.\n\n\nReflecting on your life and figuring out what you want is great.  And things change so it's a good idea to stay in touch with yourself 'cuz your wants can change.\n\nNo one belongs to anybody, again his problem to deal with.
Guys usually give me the eye and smile, and if i give them the eye and smile back they know to approach me. It usually works for me.\nOr grabbing my a**, works everytime!!!!!!!!!
unfortunately we all have to face the fact that there are lots of people we will never be with. Not just famous ones but ordinary people we see every day. The key is finding the one who you can love beyond all others and freely gives their love to you.
usually i would say skip the movie but my boyfriend took me to a horror film on our first date.  it doesn't sound very romantic but it gave him the opportunity to grab my hand/put his arm around me when i got scared ;)\n\nyes it sounds very high school but it was sweet and i'll never forget it
Only in fiction, TV, and Hollywood. You love a car at 1st sight. A dog at 1st sight. Maybe even a house. But with people it is lust at 1st sight then maybe some love grows out of it. Usually once the hot fire of lust cools the relationship goes South, because there is nothing to anchor it on. If it were love at 1st sight 95% of the people would marry and stay married to those they were dating. That don't happen. Reality sets in and you find out someone is too clingy, too sloppy, too jealous, too lazy, hot headed, has too much baggage etc. If it were love you would look pass ALL of that and want them as Forest Gump wanted Jenny no matter how much they screwed up or rejected you. You would wait forever and endure all for real love. Does that happen? Love at 1st sight only exist in Hollywood, TV, and in the movies.
play along with it but also tell her that cousins  can't get married to one another.  but it is cool to have alil cousin think she has her own prince charming.  she admires you and maybe one day she will remember what she saw in you for that one day her real prince will come and you can be there to support her in it. :-)
u know that's a good question!!!!\nthat bitch should be in jail too...\nshe'd be raising hell if it were the other way around
Just be glad he's your ex and not your current I think that would be worse.  Go and kick his a.s.s while your at it I'll help.  I can run him over with my Jeep.  Just a little speed bumb that's all he'll be.  Cheer up your not the offender.  what's this world coming to when we have to check out our potential dates on sex offender register
no i kno this guy and he's really sweet he says im pretty but dosent want to do that
in relation to what?
you deserve all you get giving your bf number is wrong and he probably dump you for it!!
You mean she's a junior and you're a sophmore right? If you're only a year apart then go for it!  Just try asking her out as a friend first then let it go from there, good luck.
Reality check!!\nLittle one.  This is where you and he find comfort in your relationship.  You're not dating anymore.  You are a couple.  98% of all men, once they get in their comfort zone, we relax.  If we're right with everything, then we start to concentrate on more important stuff like taking care of you and the family we will make.  We are men, the providers.  It's in our nature.  We are trained to be.  Is he there with you?  Does he come home at the same time everyday?  Are you together on the weekends?  If you answer no to any of these questions, then have concerns.\nI love my wife and will do whatever it takes to make her happy.  I do still talk silly with her.  I hold her hand, open the door for her.  I always tell her I love her.  I will take her anywhere she would like to go.  I don't, however, buy her flowers everytime we go out.   Once in awhile, I'll surprise her.\nThe dating is over and the relationship begins.\n\nGood luck.
the appeal of these numbers over porn is you are interacting with a live person. Now granted, you can't see the person and she may weigh 400 lbs. or may even be a man. YIKES  But most men have a vivid imagination and to them they are speaking to a beautiful woman who is going to fullfill a fantasy.
He's probably pretty young and insecure with his emotions.  It's difficult for men (let alone YOUNG men) to express their emotions.  He's probably feeling like he's abandoning you- and somewhat uncomfortable about the whole situation.   Remeber- men and women are different- not just physically but they way they process information- ALL information.  Give him a break.  If he loves you he'll come back- if not- then it didn't matter to begin with.  \n\nSlainte,\n\n-D
Try talking to her and finding out the real reason she hasn't been hanging around.  You're right, it probably has nothing to do with you.  It sounds like she's jealous of the time that you and her brother spend together and feels left out.  Try to include her more and set aside special time for you and her.  So many people neglect their friends for a relationship and it should never be like that.  She may be jealous that you found someone and she's still single.  The only way to find out is to talk to her and keep trying to talk to her.  If your kids are close and you and her brother have a future you're going to be in her life for awhile, whether she likes it or not and hopefully you can find a way to peacefully co-exist.
A pretty face,a tight rear,and a nice chest,or a nice pair of legs.\n\nany of these will do for me.
we all no that
Well teens think they know everything,but they don't have a clue as I'm sure you know.I'm 40, now divorced w/ 2 great kids.There is a difference between Love & sex.Also there is a difference between sex & making Love.Sex is just physical.Making Love is intimate & emotional.For those who have'nt experienced that I feel sorry for you.Thats what I'm teaching my kids,but unfortunately it seems most parents today are'nt.
Go to marriage counseling with him and try to get past this with him if he is truley sorry and wants to work on the marriage with you. Did he cheat on you in the marriage and relationship or was this before you knew him? Remember as well he is a father to the child and will have to be a Dad to that child so you will also have to accept that too and let him be the dad he needs to be to that child. Please keep us posted on what happens and I am here if you need to talk. I wish you the best in working on this marriage.
"my moms are lesbien.. I found out the hard way.  When I was 8 years old, after my mom and dad got divorced, I was walking to my room, it went past my moms room.. and I saw her and a women flirting with eachother in a weird way.. (like touching and stuff) I just starred for a little bit, then they started kissing... I went to my room and started crying.. and it was really depressing.. I've never been the same.  But I've just come to the conclusion that I have to deal with it.  I can't change my mom's sexual preference.. and I actually think her girlfriend is really nice.  At first I hated her because I thought she was the one that turned my mom into a lesbien and ruined my life.. but later on I found out that it was my mom's choice.  She wanted to be a lesbien.  I only want whats best for her because I know before this she had a very hard life.  But this still doesn't make ME normal.. I get teased a lot at school.. and sometimes I really wish I had a ""normal"" life.  I hope this helped you!  and my moms dont make out in front of me... and I am not a lesbien.  they've raised me to be straight!"
giving a guy oral sex

First off, I am sorry you are in that situation.  I was too, and I did marry that guy.  I do love my husband but we still don't get along any better. We were forced into marriage because I was pregnant and I had just left an abusive realtionship and wanted a steady thing.  Don't settle with someone just to settle down.  Sure the idea of a husband is nice, but what is the point if you can't get along?  Your happiness is of the utmost importance.  You need to sit down and have a talk with him about your feelings, he at least deserves that. He may feel the same way. Good Luck!

as i dont know your age its hard to give advice. if your legally an adult you can do what you want. though i would listen to my parents if they had concerns. they are only thinking of your well being and dont want to see you get hurt.
My lips on your lips
love is love and if u feel the same way for him in real life as on the net then you should follow your heart. i'm writing this as iris plays and makes my throat grow a lump. so go for your life.
"Dude , you gotta listen to those words in your head, she is saying, there is someone else, this is for the best-translation: this is for my best interest. If in time our paths yada yada yada: leave me alone and don't stalk me, if I get kicked to the curb by my new dude, I may give you another shot to build my self esteem back up. ""I need some time"" : I need some time with my new b/f. what you should do is say thanks for the memories, and part company, I know that may sound like I'm making it sound easy and it's not but you have gotta do it. all of our relationship skills come from past relationships. you gotta learn new skills when ending a relationship or you will resort to using past skills, no matter how tough it is, don't pick up that phone and call her. being a guy, you are inherently built with the idea you can fix this lil problem. that their has to be a solution, problem is , you aren't dealing with a problem, you are dealing with a female, if she wants it a certain way, she will have it her way. every lil mind game you play, she has seen it and probably played it before.\nmen aren't built to lose, we have really big egos and this little fragile thing told you that you weren't good enuf for her anymore.\nit happens, get use to it. the sooner you learn how to deal with being dumped, the better you will get at it. good luck........"
that's a good question... i don't know, but i wish you luck...
Talk to them about it.
Just be yourself. Some boys like tom-boys, and some like girly-girls. Don't change to impress. If they really like you when you are being yourself, then you know its for real.
At my age, maybe.But then again, I'm deaf.
Are you a gay guy posing as a girl?\nWhy else would you want to know?
it means sex without a condom,but think first,do you want to have sex with a girl that asks you straight out,man i would be thinking about how many others out their she has done without a condom,i dont know about you but i sure wouldnt .
"The traditional gift for the 5th anniversary is ""wood"". If you are traditional then you should keep that in mind.  While it may sound boring, you will have to be creative.\n\nSince we are talking ""male"" gifts here then consider his hobbies and interests.  Does he love auto repair, cars, hunting, fishing, camping, sports, reading, is he a couch potato? does he love the outdoors or indoor type things?\n\nWhile you may think an oak frame with YOUR picture is a perfect gift, believe me he will not think so.  It is the equivalent of you getting a blender or toaster from him!\n\nFor traditions sake lets say.......he hunts.....a gun cabinet is nice.\nFishing........ a lure kit, to make his own lures.\nSports.....locate a signed ""bat"" via local papers (forget Ebay)\nCamping.....plan a camping trip  \n\nFor a non traditional gift..............try\n\nA coupon book.  One you make up yourself.  Do it on the computer.  Make coupons called ""Off the Hook"" .  Husbands are always looking for ways not to take the trash out, do the lawn or clean the garage or to simply lay around.\n\nYou can add sexy coupons.....one free no obligation massage.\nOne night of total ME...all about HIM, dinner, sports, sex while he watches sports.\nOne coupon ""you have to do anything I ask""\n\nAnd YOU can't complain if he turns in his coupon!\n\nBe creative!  \n\nAs far as purchaseing a gift for him..........you can always do him a favor and buy him some tickets to his favorite team.  HE gets to chose his guest.\n\nThe anniversary itself is about you both.  So plan that special dinner and night on the town or private dinner at home.  The ""gift"" to one another should say that I know you are an individual.\n\nGood luck and Happy Anniversary"
"I may be a male, but I think I can answer this....\n\nTaboos are being usurped everyday.  However, some are deeply seated in history, religion, and decorum, such as discussion of sex by women.  The catholic religion frowns heavily on pre-marital sex (you know the results of that).  Women in nearly every culture and location are still held to a certain level of expectations, and one of those expectations is they should be seen and not heard and another in a certain culture we all know, is that they should not even be seen...  A boisterous woman is often looked at as shameful and ""loose"".\n\nWhile this is trending in popular culture to be much less obvious, there will most likely be residual influence for at least another generation.  This country's puritanical history will always have a certain influence on popular culture, the over-all influence is being buried over the years.\n\nMany other country's have a much looser view of this type of topic (such as Germany, Greece and Brazil) they still are less accommodating on other concerns."
I would applaud and take a picture with my phone camera. Then post it on the web somewhere, AHAHAHA!!
DZ NUTZ FANTASY THEATER FEATURING THE MECHANICAL BULL JACK GOT OFF :P
If he says that you aren't goin to lose him then listen to that!!! Love is alot stronger than anything else in the world!! I kno wat u mean when people out there cause things to happen!!! All I can say is listen to your heart bcuz in the end it's alwayz right!! If you love your man then don't let anything get in your way!!! Ignore those feelings bcuz that what they are!!! Don't let them get in the way of your guys' happiness!!!
Nah, I can let anything lie. I think Reeves and Mortimer had a problem with it though. :P
It is Wrong........ if You don't  do it  at least Once a Day.......;)
have you tried searching the yearbooks on line
You need to dump his sorry butt and move on to a guy that really appreciate you - at least enough to look at only you when you are out. Sounds like a jerk
best: Is there when i need him, and loves me unconditionally\n\nworst: doesn't listen when something is bothering me, and if i do tell him, she says I'm wrong
Tell him about it frankly, and also behave accordingly.Don't cheapen yourself in front of the man, maintain you dignity,  Remember straight forwardness and honesty are traits that are respected by most men, because those are the currencies they have to deal with practically very minute of their working lives. \nst
hmm this question is actually helping me more than my answer would help you. But I think that taking a break and separating for a bit without getting divorced is a good idea. Then I, just like you, would try really hard to keep working on it, and after getting some more strength - come back and battle some more. But if that still doesnt get through to him - leave him, see if he understands the seriousness of the situation that way
nice men is rare, maybe he's just conservative. you can teach him step by step so your sexual relationship will be more exciting. teach him too to be open-minded.
This is not your friend.  Move on.  Find other friends who are in your corner.
People who say they don't want a relationship - then end up calling you, being with you, having sex, etc are usually people who like to have their cake and eat it too.  He wants the freedom of not being in a relationship, but enjoys the benefits of being with someone at the same time.  \nYou should tell him that you wanna give him time to figure out what he wants - and whether he wants you as a girlfriend.  There is nothing wrong with being his friend - but don't treat him any different than you would your other friends (i.e. no 2am booty calls).  Saying he has too much going on right now doesn't make sense - if you really like someone you want them in your life, and usually having a significant other helps things because you have someone there for you.
U love him so much ur going there for him thats the best most romantic gift
99% of guys jack off.... even when their girls ARE giving them some.\n\nIt's normal.
pray hard, my dear
I am. I think that there is enough emotional attachment and problems with relationships and breakups without the added factor of sex. Besides if they really care, they'll understand and will wait with you.
Racism is alive and well in USA and in many other countries.  And if you are going to have an interracial relationship, then you have to be prepared to deal with racism.  \n\nAnd if you get married and have racially mixed kids, then they too will have some difficulty dealing with racism.   It's hard for such a kid to choose sides when his black friend says something against the white folks or his white friend says the same against the black people.\n\nBut I think that interracial friendship and marriage is worth fighting for.  You only need to take a look at such people as Tiger Woods and Hale Berry  to see what good such relationships can bring.  \n\nIf your man is better than anyone else you know, then don't listen to your mother and settle for second best.  You have only one life to live and you must make the best of it, regardless of what other people say.

"It depends on the official. He/She may ask the objector to state their reason(s) and then ask if you wish to proceed. Others may merely say, ""Noted"" or something along those lines and continue on like nothing happened. There are some that will discontinue the ceremony all together as everyone in attendance must approve of the union.\n\nMy ex and I opted to write that part out of our ceremony. We'd already been together for six years and figured that if anyone had any objections, they'd had more than enough time to say their piece before the wedding."
im from england and i know a family with the last name wigan. a mum dad and 2 sons. they live in a area called essex. i dunno it may be may be not.
i think it means he thinks your wierd.
why are you telling her how to lead her life?  maybe that's what's bothering her.  no one likes to be told what to do all the time and a partnership is about working together, not one person being in charge.  ask her what she wants besides living with you.. you may be frustrating her as much as she is frustrating you!
Best Answer - Chosen by Asker\n\nTry what they call Kegel exercises. They are easy to do and you can do them anywhere without anyone knowing.\n1) Try to contract the muscles you would use to stop urinating. You should feel your pelvic muscles squeezing your urethra and anus. If your stomach or buttocks muscles tighten, you are not exercising the right muscles.\n2) Once you've found the right way to contract the pelvic muscles, squeeze for 3 seconds and then relax for 3 seconds.\n3) Repeat this exercise 10 to 15 times per session. Try to do this at least 3 times a day. Kegel exercises are only effective when done regularly. Do these for awhile and you will see a big change in your performance and your own orgasms. Good Luck!!!!\n\nSource(s):\nBOOOYA!!!!\n\nAsker's Rating:\nThanks... more please...
say exactly what you just said.  You value the friendship and do not want to risk losing it.  If he values the friendship, he will understand.
If he's taller than you, hug his waist and put your head on his chest, he'll reach down, that way your arms don't get tangled up.  If you're the same height, I like to go under his arms and reach up and hold his shoulders.
Open the cage and tell her to DO1!!!
I thought about doing this once before. It is immature.  Just talk to him.  You cannot accuse him of anything until you catch him.  Just say you do this plan and you find out he is willing to cheat, how are you going to confront him, what are you going to say? You need to think long and hard before you do this.  You can email me anytime and I will talk to you.
