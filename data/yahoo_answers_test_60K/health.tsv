Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a group of symptoms related to the menstrual cycle. PMS is linked to changes in the endocrine system, which produces hormones that control the menstrual cycle. Medical experts don't fully understand the chain of events that causes premenstrual symptoms to be severe in some women and not in others. The one direct cause that is known to affect some women is genetic: Many women with PMS have a close family member with a history of PMS.
Yes, it is your obligation. Especially if it is just wrong.
"That's a gigantic question -- these days, ""alternative medicine"" seems to run the gamut from ""anything your insurance doesn't cover"" to snake oil & superstition.\n\nThe only risk that holds true for the entire range, I suppose, is that your insurance company probably won't cover it.  Some do, though, which has been nice to see."
Seasonal Defense (90) \nPowerful Immune Support\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDescription: Seasonal changes can be quite stressful to the body. That's why it is important to support your immune system. Seasonal Defense combines andrographis with other immune-supporting herbs, including Fructus aurantia (six percent synephrine extract), thyme, oregano and eleuthero root for complete immune support.\n\nAndrographis has been used for centuries by many cultures. It is used widely in Ayurvedic medicine and is considered a “cold property” herb in traditional Chinese approaches; it is used to rid the body of “heat” and dispel toxins. Andrographis supports the immune system by promoting both specific and non-specific immune-response functions as well as maintaining the muscles in the respiratory system. Other studies show that synephrine may be able to help maintain the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract and that thyme and eleuthero root both have beneficial properties.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBenefits: \n•  Helps the body defend against seasonal changes. \n•  Contains andrographis to help boost the immune system. \n•  Helps support mucous membrane health. \n \nPurchase Information \nSEASONAL DEFENSE (90)  \nStock No.:806-6 \nQV: 12.40 \nMember Cost: $12.40\nNon-Member Cost: $18.60  \n\n\nhttp://www.mynsp.com/lifemoreabundantlyinc/products/guide.aspx?stockNum=8066\n\n\nI definitely stand by this stuff!!!!!  I usually get Sinutitus and Bronchitus every year, ever since I started taking this stuff I haven't gotten sick once this year.  Suggested you would want to completely detox your digestive system, because that's where most of your health issues germinate.
Do you mean fasting? Your fasting blood sugar is normal if it's 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 3.88 millimoles per liter (mmol/L), to 100 mg/dL (5.55 mmol/L).
To sum up what most of these people are saying, cold sores are in fact a form of herpes. There are herpes simplex-2 which is a serious VD (Vanarial Disease), is totally contagious when there is an outbreak, and is  TREATABLE BUT NOT CURABLE.\n\nThen there is Herpes simplex-1 is is generally above the waste, usually marked by coldsores, not nearly as serious but still TREATABLE BUT NOT CURABLE.\n\nThere are treatments for either simplex-1 or 2 but remember this!!!!!! YOU CAN SPREAD ONE TO ANOTHER, MEANING A PERSON CAN HAVE A COLD SORE ON THEIR MOUTH AND TRANSFER IT TO SOMEONE ELSE'S GENITALS THROUGH ORAL SEX...THUS HERPES SIMPLEX-1 (A MILD PROBLEM) CAN TURN INTO SIMPLEX-2 (A SERIOUS PROBLEM).
Get to your doctor asap.  There is something they can give you to soften the affect of shingles, but it has to be very close to the onset of it.  If it is too late for that, there are different kinds of pain reducing creams he can prescribe.  Or a cream with cordison(?)..  You can ask the pharmacist about an over the counter cream.  Good luck with it.
If it is an occasional coke or coffee - go for it.  \n\njust dont pound the red bulls.\n\nThe medical literature does not make strong associations between caffeine intake and bad outcome with heart valve patients, so use the maxim that moderation is good for everything in life.

Salmonella typhi is similar to other salmonellae in that it is a gram-negative, flagellate, nonencapsulated, nonsporulating, facultative anaerobic bacillus that ferments glucose, reduces nitrate to nitrite, and synthesizes peritrichous flagella when motile. \n\nBeing such, you can use chloramphenicol, ampicillin (or any penicillin), Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, Ciprofloxacin (or any quinolone), a 3rd generation cephalosporin, or azithromycin.
Yes, I sister just had her vision corrected 3 days ago.  Was that the only option your doctor recommended?  I just had consultation and my doctor said that I don't qualify for that because my pupil size is bigger than 7.5.  Do you know anything about that?  You can e-mail me at veecherd@yahoo.com\n\n-Vee
Eat less! Also, plan out 3 meals a day, and only eat when you're stomach is growling, not when you're deppressed, or bored!
Do a healthy diet, lots of fruits, veggies, low fat (absolutly nothing fried), consistant amount of carbs, no excess sugar (like candy)...\n\nAnd start an excersize regiment. \n\nThis is better than any old diet etc that you have heard much press about. It will also make you feel better. Email seizethedayfitness at gmail dot com if you want more info.
"Actually, I believe uncut is best. No, they are not ""smelly"" as long as the guy is clean. I think that because the head is always protected, that it leaves it more sensitive when he's erect. I really like the way it feels, in all ways! It's also more fun and interesting to play with!"
NO YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PRESCRIPTION
When I had pneumonia NO cough syrup worked.  I had to get a couple of prescriptions from the doctor -- one for a kick-ass decongestant, and the other for the infection.  After a couple of days bed-rest I felt much better.
you're horny and sad?
Stem cells give rise to normal blood components including red cells, white cells and platelets. Stem cells are normally located in the bone marrow and in the blood and can be harvested for a transplant. \n\nStem cell transplants are occuring right now. It all depends on the nature of the disease or treatment as to whether they can be used. My brother has already had a stem cell transplant using his own blood and will have another one using my other brother's stem cells. He is being treated for multiple myeloma - a cancer of the plazma cell.
I think pearly whites are better vs putting any type of rare metal in your mouth.
I fast and detox once a month and it's great for your mind as well as your body.  If you don't work on a Sunday I think it would be a good day to start.  I start the day with a long bath and throughout the day I try to keep active.  As I'm not a big eater it doesn't bother me if I don't eat food for a week.  For the rest of the week I drink water, fresh juice and herbal teas.  Water helps to break down body fat and get rid of access waste so by the end of the week I have lost about 1/2 stone and feel so much lighter.  If a week seems like a long time to go without anything to eat have raw vegetables.  This is what I have when coming of a detoxing fast.  I also find the hardest thing to eat and drink after is dairy produces.  They seem to have a heavier taste when you haven't had them for a while.  Not only will you loose both weight and toxins from your body you will also feel more happier and alert. \n\nDepending on your age, weight and lifestyle if you have any concerns maybe a visit to your doctor would be advisable if you had any real concerns.
Hernias are outpouching of the intestinal wall through the muscular layer of the abdomen.  Hernias can occur in many areas of the abdomen, and can be harmless or very serious.  When hernias become strangulated (trapped bewteen the muscular wall and blood supply is cut off) then the bowel can lose its blood supply and die... this condition requires immediate surgery.  Minor hernias are usually more of a cosmetic thing and do not cause much serious problems (unless they strangulate) but if you ever have to have surgery on your stomach (gall bladder, appendix, etc) then you should have it fixed at the same time.
THATS A GOOD QUESTION \nCHLORINE CAN CAUSE DAMAGE IF YOUR EYES ARE EXPOSED\nTOO LONG BUT I HAVE NEVER HEARED OF ANYONE WHO HAD PERMANENT DAMAGE
First of all, why do you want to eat tunafish so badly? I mean it's a good food, but if it's unappealing to you then there's no reason you should force yourself to eat it.\n\nThe best way to overcome it would be just to eat it. But may I suggest adding a bit of mayo and slapping it on some bread?

STD stands for SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
In humans and other hemoglobin-using creatures, oxygenated blood is a bright red in color. Deoxygenated blood is a darker shade of red, which can be seen during blood donation and when venous blood samples are taken. However, due to an optical effect caused by the way in which light penetrates through the skin, veins typically appear blue in color. This has led to a common misconception that before venous blood is exposed to air it is blue.
Bronchitis does not have a genetic component.
Below is what I wrote to a similar question. My response was chosen as the best answer.\n\nQuitting smoking is not an easy thing to do, especially alone. The longer you've smoked, the harder it is going to be to kick the habit.\n\nQuitting is going to require the assistance / guidance of a support group. Friends, family, and colleagues are going to have to support you during this time.\n\nTrying to quit cold turkey usually doesn't work. Using tools such as Nicotene Gum or a patch will help to reduce cravings. Eating carrot or celery sticks will help with the or-al fixation associated with smoking.\n\nGetting help from your doctor is probably a good way to go as well. \n\nThe American Cancer Society provides some good information as does the Wikipedia. Tobacco Free California is also a good resource to get help.\n\nBottomline, start with a plan. Involve your friends and family, and decide what is going to work best for you.\n\nGood luck!
It means its time to go see your Ob/Gyn and get that evaluated.

Don't jump to conclusions...see a doctor if your worries but its probably just a pimple, or more likely an ingrown hair. Maybe a cyst, also really common in people of all ages. It probably burns from all the friction of standing and sitting,just moving around. I wouldn't say it's an STD seeing as how this is on your backside and most STD's show up on the front.
i know on my own personal experience that usually it takes 30 mins to an hour.
Ask them why. If they are unhappy try to find out the reason/s and maybe the two of you can work together on it. Doctors love to push drugs but they are not always the answer.
"Beware of Canola Oil, Canola Oil is an Industrial Oil, Not Fit For Human Consumption.\n\nBefore you read the following article\nhttp://www.karinya.com/canola.htm\n\nhere is a summary of a few facts regarding Canola Oil:\n# It is genetically engineered rapeseed.\n# Canada paid the FDA the sum of $50 million to have rape seed registered and recognized as ""safe"". (Source: Young Again and others)\n# Rapeseed is a lubricating oil used by small industry. It has never been meant for human consumption.\n# It is derived from the mustard family and is considered a toxic and poisonous weed, which when processed, becomes rancid very quickly.\n# It has been shown to cause lung cancer (Wall Street Journal: 6/7/95)\n# It is very inexpensive to grow and harvest. Insects won't eat it.\n# Some typical and possible side effects include loss of vision, disruption of the central nervous system, respiratory illness, anemia, constipation, increased incidence of heart disease and cancer, low birth weights in infants and irritability.\n# Generally rapeseed has a cumulative effect, taking almost 10 years before symptoms begin to manifest. It has a tendency to inhibit proper metabolism of foods and prohibits normal enzyme function. Canola is a Trans Fatty Acid, which has shown to have a direct link to cancer. These Trans Fatty acids are labeled as hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils. Avoid all of them!\n# According to John Thomas' book, Young Again, 12 years ago in England and Europe, rape seed was fed to cows, pigs and sheep who later went blind and began attacking people. There were no further attacks after the rape seed was eliminated from their diet."
Abscence of thought is pure peace of mind. There is no other feeling quite like it. \n I believe with a great deal of practice that you can control your thought pattern, so that no thought enters it for a short period. It is not easy, especially with the possibility of distraction. But it can be done and it centers you, you will feel more energy, having clearer thought process and many other benefits. This has been said to be a religion of sorts but that is not how I ever used it, I would use to just relax for myself not to give money to someone for a word to repeat to get to that state. Find one word , preferably single syllable and use that as your mantra. It usually has a meaning special only to you and how can anyone tell you that.\nYou can slow down if not totally end the thought process for a short time with practice. It does not work for all but for some its a blessing.
i think smoking inside the hospitals or any health care facilities is not allowed as well as using alochol use.
Well, start with your doctor.   \n\nOnline, start with the web sites below.
exercise and eat more fruits and vegetables. there is no easy way. if you put it on you have to work it off. fruits and veggies give you low fat and high vitamins a perfect way to fill you up with low calories. other wise cut your intake of fat and calories. you have to cut 3500 a week to lose a pound a week. and dont skip meals this will make you gorge when you can and will keep you from learning good eating habits that can last a lifetime.
With the depression and low self esteem, the best person to speak to would be a professional counselor. A psychologist or social worker can assist you in making better choices than just leaving the situation.\n\nIt is possible that medication can help with the depression, but you also need counseling to understand yourself and the self esteem issue.
Jock itch is a fungus.\n\nJock itch is best treated with topical creams or ointments since the fungus only affects the top layer of skin. Many of the antifungal medications require a prescription, but there are three that can be bought over-the-counter (OTC). The OTC antifungals are tolnaftate (Tinactin), clotrimazole (Lotrimin), and miconazole (Micatin).
Temporal mandibular joint syndrome?\n\nDepends on what is causing it and how bad it is.  Some people will have the problem go away with some tooth straightening. \nThere's a (something, I don't remember what it's called) that puts your teeth into their proper position.  You have to eat with it on.  \nI had to have a couple years of braces and 12 hour surgery where my jaw was cut in 8 different places and screwed/wired back together.  And I still had to have a chin implant to give me a chin.\n\nYour teeth should fit together this way:  molars should lock together and top incisors should overlap the lower incisors just like, er, scissors.  This should be your natural position - where your teeth automatically go when you close your mouth and put your teeth touching.  \n\nYou should see a dentist, but keep this in mind - my first dentist said there was nothing wrong with my bite.  My incisors had a 1/8 inch gap between them! If you have doubts about your dentist's diagnosis, go to an orthodontist for a second opinion.

IMO this is one of the ways our body is built to be adaptive.  For people who are exposed to a constant need to lift heavy objects, the body sends a message to the bone cells to add more bone to handle the extra demand that they will need.\n\nAnother example of this adaptivity is modifying the metabolism to use fewer calories when experiencing a famine and keeping this change after the famine ends.\n\nUnfortunately for us modern folk who never experience famine unless we are dieting, this makes losing weight even harder!
yes or else they will fall out
It all depends on what you're looking to gain from participating in a martial art.  I prefer Aikido because I think it has the best moral philosophy behind it.  The goal in training in Aikido is to be able to diffuse a conflict without bringing harm to yourself or your opponent.  This takes an a great deal of skill and training but it is worth it.  If you want an art that goes beyond the physical aspects of how to defend yourself and actually makes you a better person mentally, Aikido is the way to go.

"a couple of answers to that question:\n\ndepending on how small the child is, the profound hearing loss may have been there from the time the child was born, but was only noticed as a consequence of a workup for something else (eg, an injury).\n\nBut, assuming the hearing loss is new in onset, the question becomes a bit more difficult to answer:  there are two types of hearing loss, one which is the result of a loss of the nerve and hearing organs, and one which is the result of fluid buildup in the middle ear space or a rupture of the tympanic membrane\n\nIt is rare for fluid or TM rupture to cause ""profound"" hearing loss (if you use the official definition of ""profound""), but it can definitely cause a significant amount of deafness.\n\nNeural hearing loss can be caused by injury.  It can also be caused by viral infections, though this is more common in adults.  And it can be congenital but late-manifesting."
OCD stands for obsessive compulsive disorder.  It has absolutely nothing to do with bipolar disorder.  Most people think that OCD only covers the repeditive completeing of tasks or paranoia, but actually there are many branches of OCD.  There are the checkers, who repeatedly check things such as whether or not the locked their cars, there are the cleaners, who are petrified of germs and compulsively clean everything, there are the 'moral nuts' who are constanly terrified of committing 'sins' and there are the pure obsessionals, who have unwanted violent thoughts concerning death, suicide, murder, or sexual activities.  These are only some versions of OCD, and everyone who has it has a slightly different condition.  No one is sure exactly what causes OCD, although it is believed to be an imballance of chemicals in the brain, and seems to be hereditary.  OCD is a very prevalent disorder, although most forms of it are mild, and almost all forms are manageable with the propper tools.

I, personally, don't care for the shaved ball look.. Trimmed is better.\n\nDon't use electric shavers.  My best advice is to do it in the shower, pull your skin tight and shave with a clean new blade.  don't get too crazy, cause you REALY don't want to cut yourself!
There are many types of STD. It depends of what kind of infection cause it. And also symptoms are different in men and women, as well as sometimes there may be no symptoms at all. Lab tests can give  more or less precise answer. And don't guess. Instead go and see your doctor. Your health is precious.
It's not the size that is so important but how you use it. When reading a medical book it will tell you the average male is 4 to 8 inches long. So, 4 inches would be considered normal. For a woman penetration is not always the most important thing. External clitoral stimulation is just as important if not more so. Practice makes perfect!
I had a very simaler problem and after seeing a nutritionist i learned that i was not eating enough protein. If you are concerned go to your doctor. Some blood tests can be run and you may feel better about it knowing whats causing it. There are so many different explinations for hair loss though. Good luck.
There is an issue of selfmedicating, it is not a healthy form of treatment. I am bi-polar and from the many years of experience, all the drugs I have done has caused a degree of damage.\n  As for a natural way of relieving symptoms, well meditating helps sometimes, but what to do when it does not. I then self medicate. This is a cycle that all go through when they have bi polar. There is not one person that i have met who has not self medicated. Its a reaction to the panic. \n  A doctor once told me that i would have to take valium or like drugs for the rest of my life if I chose medication. After a near 15years, I have been on and off bezo's and in and out of rehab. \n  Good luck to us all on this wonderful burden that we carry in our lives. It is sad that our loved ones must wittness us going through this, but I also believe that it gives us a sight that others do not have,

I prefer to cut back to walking or mild hiking. When sick I feel it is better not to exhaust the body while it is trying to recuperate and fight off the cold or sickness.
There are many reasons why a period could be missed including diet, stress, pregnancy, infection, and hormonal balance.  As pregnancy blood tests are the most accurate, it is best to have one done 2 weeks after a missed period.  If it turns out to be negative, then your doctor can do further testing to see what's going on.
MAKES YOUR WRIST HURT
Marriages end because people become selfish and do not care about working as a team with their spouse.  They also can be shallow and fall out of love with their spouse's physical appearance because they are full of their own desires and don't care about the other person's feelings at all.  \nA guy like this is not worth your time.  Find some things that you enjoy doing that make you happy and fill your heart with joy, so that you can get your mind off of him.  He's not worth your pain if he did this to you.

People naturally sleep better in a cold room or when the body becomes suddenly cold. This is due to part of your circadian rhythm. In addition to sleep naturally being effected by light (your internal clock, the superchiasmatic nucleus, is located near the optic chiasm where the optic nerves cross); most humans will wake easier by the light of the sun and sleep easier in the dark, there is also sleep regulation based on body temperature. \n\nThe human core body temperature changes slightly throughout a day. At around 3 AM the body temperature is at its lowest. It starts to rise until near noon when it plateus and even dips a little bit (this results in people getting tired around lunch time...not because of the lunch itself, after all, you don't get tired after eating breakfast or dinner). Many populations, such as Mexico, take into account this normal fatigue and allow workers to nap (siesta) around that time. Afternoon the body starts rising in temperature again until around 8 PM when it begins to fall again overnight.

"Sex has a number of common meanings:\nSexual activities. \nSexual intercourse - or vaginal intercourse; the physical act related to sexual reproduction. \nA general topic of human or animal behavior. See human sexuality. \nSpecies gender - a biological distinction between two or more categories (sexes), such as male and female, which combine genetic material to reproduce. Some linguists object to this use of the word gender, to avoid confusion with the word's meaning in grammar. \nOther things named Sex or SEX include:\n\nSex is a 1926 play by Mae West. \nSex is a 1991 book by entertainer Madonna and photographer Steven Meisel. \nSex: The Annabel Chong Story is a 1999 documentary film about porn star Annabel Chong. \nSEX was a boutique on Kings Road in the Chelsea district of London. Owned by Malcolm McLaren, it was a seminal location in the emerging punk rock scene in the mid-1970s. \nThe ""SEX"" assembly language mnemonic is often used for the ""Sign EXtend"" machine instruction found in the PDP-11 and many other computer architectures. \nSEX is also a good mnemonic for advice about writing essays. It stands for Sentence, Explanation, and eXample. \nSex is an abbreviation for the constellation Sextans.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sex_%28disa...\n\nSex, in the scope of this article and category, refers to the male and female duality of biology and reproduction.

If I understand your question correctly, you are asking if you can get HPV in any way BESIDES having sex/sexual contact with another person.  The quick answer is no.  The HPV virus typically only lives in genital areas (altough there are rare cases where it is present in other mucosal tissue such as the mouth, but that's extremely rare).  The virus could theoretically survive for a small amount of time on an inanimate object (such as a toilet seat) but again, in order to get HPV this way would have to require some pretty controlled situations.  For example, someone with HPV would probably have to consciously rub their gential warts against the toilet seat, afterwhich you would need to contact that same area with your own genitalia almost immediately.  What are the chances of that?\n\nI also wanted to address mutual m*sterbation. You CAN get HPV from mutual mast. HPV warts can be microscopic, invisible to the naked eye. If you touch your partner's genitals and then touch your own with the same hand, you have most likely just put the HPV virus on your own skin. Whether or not you will develop warts/lesions is unpredictable. Some people have HPV but never show any lesions.

"Don't stretch before your workout, stretch after, when your body has had a chance to warm-up.  After the workout, make sure you stretch then you can also take an epsom salt bath or use the pool and hot tub for 15 minutes of relaxation to reduce muscle tension.\n\nHere is some help on how to avoid them:\nMinimizing Sore Muscles\nYou can reduce the incidence of pain and sore muscles by following the following tips.\n\nAdopt good training habits.\nAvoid being a weekend warrior. A weekend warrior does little exercise during the week. The words ""couch potato"" come to mind. Then, with a burst of enthusiasm, the weekend warrior ""seizes the weekend"", running, playing, dancing, etc. A better strategy is to exercise regularly. Get into motion 2 or 3 times a week for 20 min at a stretch! \n\nStart with a slow warm up.\nCold muscles suddenly put to work are more likely to become damaged than ones that have been warmed up properly. Warming up gradually will increase your heart and breathing rates, increasing the flow of oxygen and nutrients to your muscles before you begin to work them hard. In addition, your joints secrete more synovial fluid and become less stiff. With a warm-up, the body is properly adapted to the demands of exercise.\n\nBe sure to drink lots of water.\n\nAnd remember to eat a high carbohydrate, low fat diet so your muscles have plenty of fuel.\n\nDo not increase both intensity and duration during the same week.\n\nIf you are on a  strength and endurance program keep your intensity or duration increase to 10% or less each week.  Allow your body to recover properly and adapt slowly to improved performance levels.\n\nSplit Workouts\nIt may seem that doing full body workouts will benefit you the most but you can actually push yourself harder and work your muscles more effectively (avoid muscle soreness) if you work different body parts each day. Modify your strength training routine by, working back, chest, biceps, triceps, shoulders one day and quads, hamstrings, calves, abs the next day. The advantage is that you can easily incorporate supersets, combination sets, and tri-sets into your workout. The disadvantage is that the full upper body workout can get really lengthy.\n\nGet a massage\nEven though research hasn't proved this to speed healing, massage has been shown to lower levels of muscle soreness by stimulating neutrophils (white blood cells that fight inflammation). It goes without saying that athletes feel better after a massage.\n\nDiet Tip\nMaintain a regular intake of 1000 mg of vitamin C and 100-200 mg of bromelain, an enzyme from pineapples, for two days - these are natural anti-inflammatories.\n\nGood blood flow through your muscles is the key to quick, natural healing."

Generally, elderly people see a decrease in tear duct productivity, so their eyes dry out more quickly than will younger people.  For this reason, they find the need to blink more often to rewet their eyes.

I have a 6 year old so I know where you are coming from.  \n\nFirst i as long as your child is not allergic, give doses of motrin and tylenol.  you can give tylenol @ every 6 hours and the same with motrin.  But you can give Tylenol and 3 hours later give motrin 3 hrs later give tylenol.  I have had to do this with my son.  If this doesn't work in 24 hrs.  Call your Dr. or take the child to the ER.  there might be something else wrong.

Nuclear medicine is a branch of medicine and medical imaging that uses unsealed radioactive substances in diagnosis and therapy. These substances consist of radionuclides, or pharmaceuticals that have been labelled with radionuclides (radiopharmaceuticals). In diagnosis, radioactive substances are administered to patients and the radiation emitted is measured. The majority of these diagnostic tests involve the formation of an image using a gamma camera. Imaging may also be referred to as radionuclide imaging or nuclear scintigraphy. Other diagnostic tests use probes to acquire measurements from parts of the body, or counters for the measurement of samples taken from the patient. In therapy, radionuclides are administered to treat disease or provide palliative pain relief. For example, administration of iodine-131 is often used for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis and thyroid cancer.\n\nNuclear medicine imaging tests differ from most other imaging modalities in that the tests primarily show the physiological function of the system being investigated as opposed to the anatomy. In some centres, the nuclear medicine images can be superimposed on images from modalities such as CT or MRI to highlight which part of the body the radiopharmaceutical is concentrated in. This practice is often referred to as image fusion.\n\nNuclear medicine diagnostic tests are usually provided by a dedicated department within a hospital and may include facilities for the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals. The specific name of a department can vary from hospital to hospital, with the most common names being the nuclear medicine department and the radioisotope department.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_medicine
My son has Cerebral Palsy specifically Spastic Assymetric Spastic Quadriparesis.  He just turned two and is now rolling over and sitting with out support.  He is learning to crawl.  He is still unable to bring himself to a sitting position or stand alone but he is making great progress now.  He has a ton of equipment to help him catch up his developmental milestones.  The best thing for your child is to realize he is not suffering from anything.  He has cerebral palsy.  My son is the happiest little boy I know.  I think it is harder on me than it is on him.  He knows nothing different...remember that.  You must be an advocate for him.  Be sure he is getting the max allowable physical and occupational therapy.  When the time is right he may need speech therapy as well.  The state provides some therapy usually for free.  Definately utilize whatever additional therapies your insurance will pay for.  When in doubt seek out a therapy clinic several specialize in children and talk to the owner.  They are often the greatest source of knowledge.  He/she will know most of the places you can seek help.  If you need just another mom to talk to while you are learning to deal with being the mom of a special needs child please email me.  It took me a very long time to come to terms with my sons special needs but trust me life is easier when you do.  ;)  \n\nMeganHill@MaryKay.com\nMegan\nwww.MaryKay.com/MeganHill

"A better alternative to pills is a medical traction device.\n\nI have gained permanently 1.5"" length and 1"" girth since June 2005 through the use of an Andro Penis medical traction device and PowerJelq for exercises. \n\nUse the Andro Penis device 4-9 hours per day for 3-6 months. You will have time-linear flaccid and erect gains. The flaccid gains appear first.\n\nThis method is natural based on traction increasing the blood carrying capacity of the spongy chambers in the penis."
No, don't try to make appointments yourself.  You're unlikely to get anywhere that way.  Let your family doctor know that you've been unable to find a pain management doc, and have them work for you, to find one.\nGood luck!
Semi-permanant color lasts up to 6 weeks. That just means that it will fade off a little bit. You cannot control how much your hair grows.  It grows a 1/2 inch every monthy on average. Therefor, you will always need to color it every 4 to 6 weeks. To keep your hair healthier, I would suggest that you see a professional because it is relaxing and easier, plus everyone can tell if you color your own hair. Trust me. If you keep doing it at home, then do a retouch when needed and on the 2nd time that you would retouch the roots, pull the color to the rest of your hair the last 5 minutes to refresh it. You can use whatever you prefer too-semi or permanant.  I would use permanant to prevent fading. And don't forget a color safe shampoo! Hope this helps!
absolutely you will have withdrawals.  I've been taking them for about 30 years and it is now life-threatening for me to stop.  Get off of them as soon as possible if your doctor says it's ok for you to do so.

I so can't believe no one answered this question! Ok here goes......\n\n (Ok now am I allowed to have fun with it or do I have to attack it seriously? Ok....we'll see what comes out)\n\nA sociopath obviously will have anti social behavior. For what reasons? Numerous! But a sociopath many times withdraws from society because of hating themselves. Ok something in society could have brought them to this conclusion, but many have been known to be so unhappy with who they are that they remove themselves from any and all social relationships and contact.\n\nNarcissists on the other hand (ok say that three times fast)have an abundance of self adoration! However, they become so preoccupied and fixated upon themselves that they develop a lack of awareness of others. They lack empathy toward others as they fall out of sync with societal gestures of kindness and generosity and sincere concern. However, I don't believe they become anti-social. They have a need to point out to others their fine attributes. It is not enough to love thyself........they must make sure others accept them in the same way. Perhaps society shuns them for this just enough to make them feel the need to love themselves in a way no one else seems to. \n\nNow as I said in the beginning.......there are NUMEROUS reasons we fall into the categories of sociopathic and narcissistic behaviors. All cases are different. So my answer is...........No...not always. (and oftentimes not)\n\nOk......when I started off I was so going to make this funny. But as I started thinking about it, I honestly grabbed hold of a depth in the question that I hadn't felt before. Thanks for making me think about it.
I've had 13 surgeries so far on my ears to repair the damage from years of ear infections, in hopes to someday correcting my hearing. It's routine for me, I've had the same surgery done over and over again but the night before and the day of I always get a little scared because you have no idea what is going to happen. You might react bad to the anestesia, your surgeon could screw up and damage you even more etc. etc. I always make out fine (I'm here typing to you aren't I?) but still the little bit of what if's always catch me and maybe others feel the same.
The acid & caffiene can be murder on the digestive system for someone who has constant heartburn or acid reflux.  It is also very bad, if not worse for your teeth.  Always brush your teeth after you've drank some soda.

It can range from 2 weeks to 3 months (standard window period for HIV) depending on the person, everyone is different and all of our bodies are different... look for signs - swollen lymphs in the neck, underarms and groin areas.  Also do not be fooled, a blood test can come back much sooner than our healthcare workers like to lead on... since I work in the field I can tell you that often the results can come back frmo the lab in 24 hours, depending on what lab it is sent too.
Yes , it is a virus that is transmitted primarily sexually that may stay dormant in your body for several years.  When having a pap test done HPV is screened as it may eventually lead to cancer if left untreated.  Most commonly it is treated with repeat pap smears colposcopies or LEEPS>
Lupus is a chronic autoimmune disease in which the immune system turns against the body and harms healthy cells and tissues. Lupus, which is also considered a rheumatic (arthritic) disease, can affect many parts of the body including the joints, skin, kidneys, lungs, heart or brain. Some of the most common symptoms include extreme fatigue, painful or swollen joints, unexplained fever, skin rashes, and kidney problems.\n\nWe don’t know yet what causes the immune system to become overactive. Scientific evidence indicates that lupus is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Studies show that lupus runs in families, meaning that certain genes predispose you to the disease. Environmental triggers may include ultraviolet light, bacterial and viral infections, medications, diet and stress. \n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, nine out of ten people who have lupus are women. It often first appears during the childbearing years—ages 15 to 45. Lupus is three times more common in African American women than in Caucasian women, and is also more common in women of Hispanic, Asian, and Native American descent. \n\nLupus is not contagious. You cannot give it to someone else.\n\nThere currently is not a cure for lupus and treatments may have serious side effects. The Alliance for Lupus Research hopes that more intensive research will lead to better treatments and a cure. In the meantime, people with lupus should seek the care of a physician familiar with the disease.

A bipolar disorder is also known as a maniac disorder. \n\nThis is a very dangerous phycholigical sickness in which a person can go completely nuts. That person may not only stop caring for their personal needs, but could also become dangerous to themselves,(could committ suicide), or dangerous to others around them,(could kill someone), if early treatment is not provided.\n\nIf you know someone with this disease, you should consult a psychologist immediately before its too late. A person with this disease could lead a normal life with proper medication and regular visit to their psychologist. If treatment is not provided for a long time,then there is also a risk of the patient going nuts forever
Also known as Rest Cramps. Especially in older adults, cramps at rest (often during the night) are very common. Rest cramps may be experienced at any age, however, including during childhood. While not life-threatening, night cramps can be very disruptive of sleep and otherwise quite disturbing. They sometimes recur frequently (that is, many times a night, and/or many nights each week) and are very painful. The actual cause of night cramps is unknown. Sometimes, such cramps seem to be initiated by making a movement that shortens the muscle, which then cramps. An example is pointing the toe down while lying in bed, which shortens the calf muscle, a common site of cramps.

"The use of Zonegran (zonisamide) by pregnant women hasn't been fully studied, but there are serious concerns based on studies using animals. When it was given to pregnant mice, rats, and dogs early in pregnancy, there were high rates of fetal abnormalities, especially heart defects and skeletal malformations. After it was given to monkeys during certain stages of pregnancy, many of the fetuses died, possibly because of malformations. All of these effects occurred at doses (and blood levels in the mother) that were equivalent to the amounts used to treat epilepsy in humans, or sometimes even lower. There was also a higher rate of death among the offspring of rats who were given zonisamide late in their pregnancy. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has labeled Zonegran as ""Pregnancy Category C"" and recommends that women who could possibly become pregnant should use effective birth control while using Zonegran. Recognizing that seizures in the mother also may be hazardous to a fetus, however, they conclude that the risks and benefits must be weighed in considering the use of Zonegran during pregnancy. Tell your doctor right away if you are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant."
"HDL cholesterol is a good cholesterol therefore, you should worry about your LDL bad cholesterol.  Diet and exercise are an excellent first step to lower cholesterol.\nYou should talk to your family doctor that will help you to choose your diet carefully and please read the information on these sites.\n\nLifestyle Changes\n\nExercise: Although not everyone can run, burning between 1,200 and 1,500 calories each week doing aerobic exercise can have dramatic results. Not only is exercising a wonderful way to keep your heart healthy, it also helps lose weight, which is an additional benefit. By losing 10 pounds of excess weight, according to Kokkinos, ""That's where you see significant increases in your HDL cholesterol.""\n\nAvoid Trans Fatty Acids: Avoid trans fatty acid containing foods such as French fries, cookies, cakes and many of the fried fast foods.\n\nMinimize Carbohydrates: Minimize carbohydrates by avoiding sugar, flour, potatoes and white rice. Studies prove that HDL level drops dramatically when blood sugar is spiked by carbohydrates.\n\nAvoid Cholesterol Foods: Minimize the food sources of cholesterol such as egg yolk, liver, kidney, brains, etc.\n\nStop Smoking: According to a study at Vanderbilt, within just one week of quitting smoking, HDL levels raised by seven points.\n\nHDL or Good Cholesterol Foods\n\nRed Wine: Drinking red wine is yet another option as long as it is consumed within reason. ""There are antioxidants contained in red wines such as cabernet sauvignon, Merlot, and pinot noir, that help slow down the oxidation of HDL and LDL cholesterol"", according to Vincent Rifici of the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. What was shown is not that the HDL was higher than those not drinking, but that the HDL contained higher levels of several types of blood fats, thus giving the positive result. There is still a lot more research required but this could prove to be a wonderful option.\nOrange Juice: There was one specific study conducted at the University of Western Ontario in Canada where 25 students drank orange juice every day for four week. The results were amazing. HDL was raised an astounding 21%. The individual leading this study, Elzbieta Kurowska, stated this increase might have been caused by the flavonoid in the orange juice.\n\nBeans: Kidney and red beans are a wonderful choice for raising HDL. These foods are low-glycemic carbohydrates that during digestion do not cause insulin spikes. Studies conducted where people ate foods rich in low-glycemic carbohydrate measure with the highest level of HDL.\n\nFish: Fish eaten several times a week can also be beneficial in raising HDL since it contains omega-3 fatty acids. This fish would include sardines, salmon, sea bass, herring, etc. If you do not like to eat fish, fish oil can be used as a supplement although the benefit takes much longer.\nOlive Oil: Use oils higher in mono-unsaturated fats, such as olive oil or canola oil. Including 1-2 teaspoons of olive or canola oil with each meal would be sufficient.\n\nOat bran: Lowers cholesterol and LDL and raises HDL. In one study, two ounces of oat bran per day was associated with a 16% lowering of LDL and, after 3 months, an increase in HDL of as much as 15% (JAMA. 1991. 285. 1833-1839).\n\nOnions: Some research suggests that half of raw onion/day may raise HDL as much as 30%.\n\nSoy Products: A 1995 meta-analysis of 38 studies of soy confirmed that it lowers total cholesterol, LDL (""bad"") cholesterol, and triglycerides, and raises HDL (""good"") cholesterol.\n\nSoluble Fiber: Add more soluble fiber to diet. Soluble fiber is found in fruits such as apples, grapes, and citrus fruits. The fiber in these foods helps lower total cholesterol and often raises HDL levels. You need to consume at least 30 grams of fiber per day.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.loweringcholesterol.net/show/raise-hdl-cholesterol\nhttp://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4488"
This one is really gonna depend on the person and the circumstances. Life will always have it's ups and downs, but a thing to really be aware of and look out for is depression. \n\nYou can tend to look toward how much worse off some others are than you and your circumstances to give you a better perspective on things. \n\nOn the other hand if you tend to compare your life now to how much better it was prior to this, then you may be setting yourself up to not be happy even when things turn around (as they will usually).\n\nLook at the things that are going well, build on them and do what you can to change the things that aren't so wonderful.\n\nSince I don't know the specifics, perhaps you could find others with the same problem or difficulties to talk with about this?\n\nGood luck and my best wishes for you.
That's pretty soon, and it's hard to make any noticeable type of difference before then.  One thing that seems to make me feel a little more comfortable when I go on vacation, is to get a tan.  You can do the spray tan thing, and get a little color, which naturally makes you look a little skinnier.
Alcohol can't be detected in a UA, because alcohol doesn't exit your body in your urine. It is broken down in your kidneys.\n\nBut if you have alcohol in your system its probably not a good time to go see your PO and take a UA.\n\nDon't do ice!
Yes.  Actually, you are more likely to get pregnant when not on your period then when you have it.  Remember, you can get pregnant at any point during your cycle.
The previous answer was wrong. Nausea and fever won't kill someone, at least in the short term. The most important thing is rapid transport. Other items:\n1) universal precautions (it's contagious)\n2) oxygen, if needed\n3) IV fluids (don't delay transport)\n4) general supportive care\n5) unless the patient was elderly, or had known heart disease, a cardiac monitor wouldn't be needed\n\nThe window of treatment for bacterial meningitis is often a few hours. If treatment isn't started quickly enough, the patient won't survive. This is particularly true for young children.\n\nThe first responders (EMS, fire, police)will likely need to be treated with antibiotics.
Patients with diabetes have higher mortality rates than nondiabetics regardless of sex, age, or affluence. Heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death in these patients. All life-style and medical efforts should be made to reduce the risk for these conditions. \n\nPeople with type 2 diabetes are also subject to nerve damage (neuropathy) and abnormalities in both small and large blood vessels (vascular injuries) that occur as part of the diabetic disease process. Such abnormalities produce complications over time in many organs and structures in the body. Although these complications tend to be more serious in type 1 diabetes, they still are of concern in type 2 diabetes. People with diabetes should aim for fast blood glucose levels of less than 110 mg/dl and hemoglobin A1C or less than 7%. \n\nThe impact of these multiple health problems are of great concern, particularly with the dramatic increase in diabetes. Experts now estimate that over a third of people born in 2002 will eventually develop diabetes. \n\nThere are two important approaches to preventing complications from diabetes: \n\nIntensive control of blood glucose and keeping glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels below 7.0. This is proving to prevent complication due to vascular (blood vessel) abnormalities and nerve damage (neuropathy) that can cause major damage to organs, including the eyes, kidneys, and heart. \nManaging risk factors for heart disease. Evidence is increasing that control of blood glucose also helps the heart, but its benefits most likely occur over time. It is very important that people with diabetes control blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other factors associated with heart disease.

Neurofibromatosis(Von Recklinhausen disease)(NF)\n\n\nWhat is NF? You ask. Neurofibromatosis, pronounced Neuro-fi-bro-ma-to-sis, (NF for short), is a genetic disorder of the nervous system that causes tumors to form on the nerves anywhere in the body at any time. This progressive disorder affects all races, all ethnic groups and both sexes equally. NF is one of the most common genetic disorders in the United States, (one in every 3,000 to 4,000 births), even though not many people are familiar with it. There are two genetically distinct forms of NF, NF-1 and NF-2. The effects of NF are unpredictable and have varying manifestations and degrees of severity. \n\nThere is no known cure for either form of NF, even though the gene for both NF-1 and NF-2 have been identified. Currently, NF has no treatment other than the surgical removal of tumors which may some times grow back. \nNF is an autosomal dominant genetic condition, meaning you can not catch it from other people. Only 50% of those affected with NF have a prior family history of NF. If an individual does not have NF he/she can not pass it on to his/her children. NF is classified as a disease. Disease is so negative. NF is not contagious.
Men have been pondering this question for generations.  There is not one specific, or most effective way. Every woman is different.

The herpes infection has a history dating back to ancient Greece.  The word 'herpes' was used by Hippocrates to describe lesions that 'creep' or 'crawl.'  Although previously well characterized, it was not until 1893 that the transmissibility was recognized.6\n\nThe herpes family of viruses currently is thought to consist of herpes simplex 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex 2 (HSV-2), varicella-zoster, Epstein-Barr, cytomegalovirus, and human herpes virus VI, VII, and VIII.5  All are capable of entering and replicating in epithelial cells, while some of the herpes family is neurotropic and others are lymphotropic.  HSV-1 and HSV-2 are neurotropic, infecting sensory nerve fibers and have been demonstrated to reproduce in epithelial cells.  HSV-1 and HSV-2 are lytic to human epithelial cells and latent in neural tissue at the site of regional ganglions.  Usually the virus initially enters the body through a break in the mucous membrane integrity, although there is evidence that it may penetrate intact skin.  In either case, transmission results from mucocutaneous contact with infected secretions and aerosols.  When reactivated, the virus travels along the nerve axon to the surface epithelial cells and can cause a recurrent epithelial outbreak.\n\nOften the initial herpes infection goes undetected.  However, in a small percentage of cases, the initial oral infection with HSV-1 or HSV-2 is acutely symptomatic causing many signs and symptoms detected by the patient.  When the patient demonstrates systemic signs, symptoms, and has perioral and intraoral vesicular lesions, it is referred to as primary herpetic gingivostomatitis.  Although the condition most often occurs in children, it can also affect adolescents and adults.  Fever and lymphadenopathy may occur, lasting from 2-10 days.  Pharyngitis, malaise, myalgia, fiery red gingival, and mucosal tissues associated with painful swallowing are hallmarks of the primary infection.  Intraorally, many small punctate ulcers may form on keratinized and nonkeratinized mucosa as well as at the nasopharynx.  Perioral tissues can also be affected.\nhttp://www.thejcdp.com/issue009/tilliss/10tillis.htm

There isn't really a good answer to this. It really depends if you are getting the proper nutrition and the proper protein. It also depends if you are really over weight or if you need to lose 10 pounds. A person that is over 100 pounds over weight could lose 5 pounds or more a week.  compared to a person needing to lose 10 pounds could lose 1 to 2 pounds a week.\n\nSerious inquries check out this link.
the lady that answered that question is kidding right!? It can vary a great deal depending on size, height and body type. Like probably from 90 lbs to 160.

You should watch out for shellfish, i.e. lobster, crab, mussels, and other seafood like squid, calamari, eel.  Seafood allergies can be life-threatening and tend to get worse with repeated exposure. I carry an epi-pen and have to have another person serve my food at buffets that have seafood. I avoid shaking hands with people if at an event where seafood is served.  The food allgergy and anaphalaxis network website has excellent resource and information including cards that you can carry with you when you go to dinner to pass on to the chef about your allergy.
"Usually not. Just get a list of proposed immunizations. Remember the second hep b vaccine some areas of the U.S. received? Well those specified areas had a rise in other acute illnesses.

There are no stupid questions when health and safety are concerned."
Best to ask your doctor, as individuals vary greatly in terms of healing time. But as a fellow runner, I will say this -- returning to running too quickly and intensely really increases the risk of you getting seriously injured the next time and putting you on the bench for a long time.\n\nIt's best to wait until your ankle feels completely well, no pain or weirdness when you walk around. Then, ease back into the running -- 15 minutes of running; 15 minutes of walking. Gradually build back up to where you were before. You may resent losing the time initially, but take it from me -- it's better than gaining the time now but losing WAY more on your second injury!
in a word, yes\n\nfish protein has a higher conversion rate into human tissue than ANY other 'meat' including chicken, beef and lamb\n\noily fish especially is good for skin (omega 3 is not only good for the brain, but the skin as well) most ouily fish contain enzymes such as CoQ which is fundemental in a clear complexion and DMAE which inhibits againg and has an anti inflamitory action on the skin
Neither one.  They are both high in carbs and FAT.  If you want to eat healthy, try fruits and vegetables, lean meats and low fat dairy foods. Also make sure you drink atleast 8 glasses of clean water everyday.

Well it doesn't worsen your condition, although it may irritate your scalp (and the flakes may fall on your clothes making it appear worse).\n\nCommon dandruff is thought to be caused by a fungus, so use of a medicated shampoo (such as Neutrogena T/Gel or Nizoral) will help. Use it every day until the flakes are under control, and then once or twice a week afterward to keep it under control.

Some people who suffer from depression due to such things as Dopamine deficiency can find smoking pleasurable.  Cigarettes are said to release dopamine, a happy chemical in the brain.  Similar to the effects of bupropian, which is why that drug can help some people quit smoking.
If you are talking SHORT TERM, this two-week-long weight loss program will work. It has worked for me, for Renee Zellweger (after her Bridgett Jones movies) and for many others who need fast weight loss. Follow these steps religiously:\n\n1.Drink lots of fresh water every day using this formula: (your current weight) divided by 2 = ounces of water to consume each day. I like to drink room temperature water from a bottle because it’s easier to “chug.” I put four of the bottles on the kitchen counter and make sure they are all empty by the end of the day. Best to consume them throughout the day.\n\n2.Don’t drink any alcohol of caffeine. No soft drinks. Only green teas. REMEMBER, THIS IS ONLY 14 DAYS. YOU CAN DO IT IF YOU REALLY WANT YOUR GOAL.\n\n3.Fast walk or run for at least 60 minutes each day. It’s best to exercise in the morning since it will rev up your metabolism and keep our calorie-burn rate high throughout the day. You can do this by walking in place, using a treadmill, or walking outside. Whatever works for you.\n\n4.Do at least 50 crunches each day. I break mine into 2 or 3 different sessions. Also, if I need to do 20 crunches, I play a little trick with my mind and I “pretend” I am going to count to 25. It’s amazing how this helps the body get to all of the crunches with the same intensity.\n\n5.Eat only fresh vegetables! This is the key to the whole thing. Eat as many as you want, but DON’T eat any of the following: starchy vegetables including potatoes, squashes, pumpkins, and the like. They will work against you. Limit carrots, snow peas, and other veggies that are high in sugar content. NO GRAINS. Just fresh vegetables. You can eat salads, stir-fries, steamed, etc. But this is at the heart of your success.\n\n6.Don’t eat anything after 7:00 p.m.\n\n7.Put photographs (from magazines) up all over your house of trim, fit women. They will serve as motivators.\n\n8.Several times each day – especially when you first get up and when you go to bed, say something like: “I am enjoying my weight of (your goal weight).” Put it in the present tense and say it many times – with feeling! This will affect your subconscious mind to help you achieve your goal. Also, post these words in the same places where you post the photographs.\n\nAlso, don’t be surprised if you start feeling better than you have felt in a long time. You will have more energy, most aches and pains will be gone, and your whole body will look brighter. One warning, early on your elimination will be a little “urgent.” You may have some cramping. But this will all go away soon. Your body is in a deep cleanse.

I think I developed an allergic reaction to wheat sometime in my late 20's and would experience severe stomache pains after drinking beer.  I laid off for a while and for some unknown reason can now consume beer without the stomache pains.  I would recommend drinking in moderation and seeing what the results are.
Limit your use of caffeine, chocolate, and nicotine.  \n\nRegular exercise also helps limit the number of attacks.\n\nIf they persist you should contact a doctor.

Routine eye exams usually cost $35-70 in my area.  Generally, you get what you pay for.  Be careful of the bait and switch tactics of the cheapest places.  They will tell you $19 for the exam, then get you in the chair and tell you that you need $235 of additional testing or your eyes will fall out!  Ask what the exam includes when you shop around.  \n\nI think the better question is to ask your friends and neighbors if they like their eye doctor!  If the doctor is nice, honest, and cares for your eyes, you are getting your money's worth, whatever the price.
Far greater than if you only used one condom. Using 2 condoms causes friction and they will BOTH break. I think you should be a bit more educated and talk to your partner more before taking this step. I hope this helps! :)
If you mean Arachnoiditis, then this is the report according to WebMD:\n\nArachnoiditis is a general term for several progressive regional disorders all of which result in the inflammation of parts of the middle membrane surrounding the spinal cord and brain (arachnoid membrane) and the space defined by this membrane (subarachnoid space). Either the spinal cord or the brain may be involved; in some cases, both are affected. This disorder can also be associated with meningitis. The condition may be caused by foreign agents such as anesthesia drugs or testing dyes injected into the spine or arachnoid membrane.
With the flu spreading around the world, the virus has turned up in birds in Asia and Europe, and it is feared that migrating flocks could take it to the Middle East and Africa. So far, the bird flu has only been passed from birds, either to other birds or in the isolated cases, to humans. However, if the flu mutates into a strain that can pass from human to human, people will have no immunity and the flu will probably pass rapidly from person to person, creating a pandemic. Flu vaccines can only be made to protect against a particular virus, and, since the virus has yet to be passed from human to human, no vaccine can be developed.\n\nIn Asia, many people live with ducks and chickens in their homes, and in their yards. Health and veterinary officials worldwide recently announced that a key way to stop the spread of the disease is to improve farming practices, segregating poultry from humans, and culling birds that have been infected with the deadly virus.\n\nWhat's next? When asked for predictions as to the seriousness of the pandemic, should one occur, experts have based their projections on a similar pandemic that occurred in 1918-1919. Up to a billion people fell ill, and nearly 100 million died worldwide. Translating to today's figures, they project that some 30-60 percent of the world's population could be infected by the virus, and over 300 million people worldwide could die. In the meantime, good hygiene remains the best prevention: keep hands well-washed, and avoid contact with people who have been infected with the virus.
Cancer cells could be sleepy in every body. Stress, not healthy diet or other factors could activate them and make them become deadly.

Switch to safe natural products in the house. If the asthma does not go away then grape seed extract is the next step.
"Asthma attack:\nSevere wheezing when breathing both in and out\nCoughing that won't stop\nVery rapid breathing\nChest pain or pressure\nTightened neck and chest muscles, called retractions\nDifficulty talking\nFeelings of anxiety or panic\nPale, sweaty face\nBlue lips or fingernails \nRecognizing Asthma Triggers \nAsthma triggers are everywhere in our environment: indoors, outdoors and in the very air we breathe. Identifying triggers, however, is not always simple. It usually involves a process of elimination. A good place to start is a consultation with your doctor. Ask for guidance. Your doctor may recommend a skin test for allergies.\n\nA vast range of triggers can set off symptoms of asthma. Chief culprits include dust mites, air conditioning (which cycles offending substances into the air we breathe) and cat dander. Individual asthmatics, however, tend to have their own ""red-alert"" triggers.\n\nCommon Allergic Asthma Triggers\nThe following is a partial list of common asthma triggers:\n\nalcohol \nair conditioning \nanimal saliva and urine \natmospheric ozone \nbetel-nuts \nbird, dog and cat dander \nchemicals (e.g., hexachlorophene, formalin, ethylene diamine) \ncockroaches \ncold air \ncolds and upper respiratory tract infections \ndrugs (especially aspirin, cimetidine, antibiotics, beta blockers) \ndust mites & their droppings \nemotional upset \nexertion (especially if strenuous and in cold air) \nfood additives or preservatives (e.g., tartrazine, sulfur dioxide) \nfungal spores \nfumes (e.g., paint) \ngastroesophageal reflux (GERD) \ngum acacia \nhair particle proteins \nhigh humidity \nkapok and feather fillers (e.g., in pillows and cushions) \nmetals (e.g., cobalt, platinum, nickel) \nnuts \nplastics \nPVC \nragweed pollen (particularly in the U.S.) \nrubber \nsawdust (especially oak, boxwood and cedar wood dust) \nshellfish \nsmoke pollution \nsolvents \nstress \nstrong odors \ntemperature/humidity changes \ntobacco \ntree and grass pollens. \n\n\nCommon cold:\nThe symptoms of a common cold include sneezing, runny nose, nasal obstruction, sore or scratchy throat, cough, hoarseness, and mild general symptoms like headache, feverishness, chilliness, and not feeling well in general.\nCold symptoms are due mainly to the body's response to the infection. When a nasal cell is infected by a cold virus, the body responds by activating parts of the immune system and some nervous system reflexes.\nColds last on average for one week. Mild colds may last only 2 or 3 days while severe colds may last for up to 2 weeks."

Usually, when your finger quickly goes against the edge of a paper (which is thicker than a razor blade) you get a paper cut. I used to get them a lot in gradeschool since I reached into my desk, sliding my fingers alongside workbooks to identifiy which subject they were, ending up in multiple paper cuts.\nGiving yourself a paper cut is possible, run your finger very quickly along the edge of printing paper. I have stupid cousins who have tried it.
Just wait it out - she is most likely doing it only in situations where she needs to feel 'more comforted' - perhaps you can address while she feels like that.\n\nIt's also very commonly used as a sleep aid at that age - if she's only doing it when going to sleep - I still would not worry about it at this age. Let them grow up on their own terms as much as you can.\n\nPeople are 'forcing' the development of their children ever earlier and earlier these days - it's sad to see.
No, if you check on a height and weight chart it will tell you that you are in a normal range for your age.

Get a sheet of paper and list things that you would like to do and acomplish them (start out simple). Take some time to do something nice for someone. It feels good. List your good qualities- I'm sure you have many. Most people tend to look at what they don't like about themselves and ignore the wonderful qualities that make them THEM! I think the older a person gets the easier it is. If your in certain age groups no one has good self esteem, even those who seem to have it. Some people who are popular and seek attention and friends have the worst self asteem and waste so much energy trying to prove themselves. If there are some qualities that you don't like, change them. If your self esteem is based on looks alone (don't know what you look like) accentuate the positive about yourself!
Cover it with make-up.
1) Do not sleep on the back.\n2) Do not eat or drink directly before going to bed.\n3) Do not eat foods rich in fat or salt.\n4) Avoid alcohol.\n5) Loosing weight\n\nGood luck. :)
I have OCD, it is a real pain suffering from it! I have a problem with these unwanted ruminating thoughts that are hard to get rid of no matter how hard I try to get rid of them.

I think you should go on ... I believe that if you don't try something then you will regret it for the rest of your life. Believe me you are going to be just fine.
What a great question, and one that has an answer unique to you only.\n\nYou need to talk to your doctor to find out EVERY possible harm, risk, lifestyle change and alternative option you have to consider.\n\nThen write down what you hope to get from the procedure (or the alternative) and weigh each positive outcome against each of these risks/changes and decide which counts more for YOU.\n\nThis will help you understand whether the surgery is right for you.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n\nHere is a great form to help you structure your decision points: http://decisionaid.ohri.ca/decguide.html

I don't eat fast food and I think anyone who does, obviously doesn't care about their health that much.
you can get bladder infections anytime but after a miscarriage and clymidia doesn't make you extra prone. You may have another std if you feel burning during peeing or discomfort during sex get another pelvic exam to make sure you're not infected from the miscarriage or std.

"It sounds like Asperger's syndrome, a very light form of Autism: \n\nIndividuals with AS can exhibit a variety of characteristics and the disorder can range from mild to severe. Persons with AS show marked deficiencies in social skills, have difficulties with transitions or changes and prefer sameness. They often have obsessive routines and may be preoccupied with a particular subject of interest. They have a great deal of difficulty reading nonverbal cues (body language) and very often the individual with AS has difficulty determining proper body space. Often overly sensitive to sounds, tastes, smells, and sights, the person with AS may prefer soft clothing, certain foods, and be bothered by sounds or lights no one else seems to hear or see. It's important to remember that the person with AS perceives the world very differently. Therefore, many behaviors that seem odd or unusual are due to those neurological differences and not the result of intentional rudeness or bad behavior, and most certainly not the result of ""improper parenting"".\n\nBy definition, those with AS have a normal IQ and many individuals (although not all), exhibit exceptional skill or talent in a specific area. Because of their high degree of functionality and their naiveté, those with AS are often viewed as eccentric or odd and can easily become victims of teasing and bullying. While language development seems, on the surface, normal, individuals with AS often have deficits in pragmatics and prosody. Vocabularies may be extraordinarily rich and some children sound like ""little professors."" However, persons with AS can be extremely literal and have difficulty using language in a social context. \n\nAs for the ""left brained, right brained"" theory, that is a myth that came about when some reporters watered down research on 'split brain' procedures (where you cut the corpus collosum in order to prevent severe seizures)."
Since this spot keeps coming back, I strongly encourage you to make an appointment with an optometrist or ophthalmologist.  It is likely something very treatable and unlikely that it will result in blindness if you seek proper care.
turn off the lights in your bathroom and take a bath as hot as you can stand it. this works excelent for me. but sometimes if i dont stay in the tub long enough  my headache will come back. stay away from lights and tv. and do not sit in front of your computer. sitting in front of your computer will make the headache worse from making your eyes adjust to the small screen and the light from the monitor doesnt help either.

Health care providers, clinicians, and researchers have been debating the potential of antibiotics hindering the effectiveness of oral contraceptives for quite some time. There have been several research studies that concluded that some antibiotics do indeed decrease the effectiveness of the pill. Hence, it becomes more likely that an unintended pregnancy could occur. \nThe general recommendation when taking antibiotics for a short amount of time is to use an additional backup contraceptive method such as a latex condom during the treatment time and for one week afterward. When taking antibiotics for a long period of time, the general recommendation is to use an additional backup method for the first two weeks of the antibiotic use. \nIt also is important to remember that you should continue using the pill unless directed otherwise by your health care provider. He/she may provide more specific instructions based on your individual situation, medication, or health status.
It is said that toe nails grow slower because of a decrease in blood circulation in the feet and also nails grow faster on longer fingers.  So because toes are short they take longer to grow.
Exercise is always the best solution.  Also, try to think about something that you do daily (drink a soda, have a cup of coffee with creamer, eat a piece of candy), and replace it with a healthier option.  You'd be amazed at how making a small change, and THINKING about what you eat, can make a big difference in your health!
Both of those symptoms indicate a weak PC muscle. This muscle is responsible for both starting and stopping the flow of urine as well as erection strength and holding power.\n\nFortunately, performing PC exercises (also called kegel exercises) will improve your PC muscles greatly.\n\nAs for the issue of over urination, see a doctor as this may be a separate health issue.

A voiding cystourethrogram is an x-ray image of the bladder and urethra during urination.\n\nThis test is performed to detect abnormalities of the bladder and the urethra. The test may also detect abnormal bladder emptying or any congenital abnormality. In males, it may detect urethral stricture and the extent of narrowing in the prostatic urethra.\n\nX-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation like light, but of higher energy, so they penetrate the body to form an image on film. Structures that are dense (such as bone) will appear white, air will be black, and other structures will be shades of gray\n\nUsually, the urinary bladder does not show up well on conventional x-rays. In this examination, a contrast medium is introduced into the bladder to improve visualization.\n\nX-ray images are taken in various positions with the bladder full of contrast and while the bladder is being emptied.

"I would say yeas, but go to a doctor and they will confirm the test with either a better urine test or blood. \n\nI use to have irregular periods all the time. My husband and I were trying to have a baby for three years we had two others from previous marriages. We finally got frustrated and decided that maybe it wasnt ment to be. All test were negative. So I was going to get my tubes tied to be done with it as depressing as it was. I went in for my prep the doctor did an ultrasound and said, ""sorry we cant do the procedure"". I then was frustrated and said, ""why the heck not now, am I that screwed up that I cant even get my tubes tied. my husband and I just want to end the pain of trying"" He said, ""you are gonna have a baby!"" I couldnt believe it."
"Implants are a great option for replacing missing teeth.  A titanium ""screw"" is placed in your bone by an oral surgeon.  The surgeon covers the screw with your gum tissue to let it heal.  This screw heals for 3-6 months, depending which tooth is being replaced.  The bone integrates around the screw.  After it is healed, the screw is uncovered.  A dentist then bonds a ""tooth"" on the screw.  Once it is complete, the implant functions and looks like a normal tooth.  You can eat and floss like normal.  Most patients say the implant does not hurt being placed."
Study up on which foods have the things you need. Nuts are good, so are beans and so are eggs. If you eat those things then you're probably alright! If you are very concerned, you can talk to a doctor and they can help you figure out if you need protein supplements or something:-) Good luck!

the proper diet is being able to know what weight you want to have.  If you are reduding, eat more fiber. that way you get rid of a lot of fats.  If you want to gain weight, eat more and enjoy yourself.  If you want to lose a lot of weight, i suggest you get a lot prolems. hehehehe!
It depends on what type of insurance you're looking for. I guessing in this case you mean medical insurance. There are a ton of medical insurance providers and basically what it comes down to is what you need that service to provide. Many colleges provide medical insurance to the students who need it, ask your college what services  there insurance provides and where they are covered. For a list of insurance providers look at the links below. There is a link specifically for stundents.

Cancer is a class of diseases characterized by uncontrolled division of cells and the ability of these cells to invade other tissues, either by direct growth into adjacent tissue (invasion) or by implantation into distant sites (metastasis). This unregulated growth is caused by damage to DNA, resulting in mutations to genes that control cell division. Several mutations may be required to transform a normal cell into a malignant cell. These mutations are often caused by chemicals or physical agents called carcinogens. Some mutations occur spontaneously, or they can be inherited (germ line mutations.)\n\nCancer can cause many different symptoms, depending on the site and character of the malignancy and whether there is metastasis. Cancer may be painless. A definitive diagnosis usually requires the histologic examination of tissue by a pathologist. This tissue is obtained by biopsy or surgery. Once diagnosed, cancer is usually treated with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation.\n\nIf untreated, cancers may eventually cause death. Cancer is mainly a disease of later years, and is one of the leading causes of death in developed countries. Most cancers can be treated and many cured, especially if treatment begins early. Many forms of cancer are associated with exposure to environmental factors, such as tobacco smoking, alcohol, and certain viruses. Some of these can be avoidable, and public health and vaccination programmes are important on a global scale.

"Man, most of these people are severely misinformed about the causes of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders.  Cats walking in your food?  Non-vegetarian diets?  Give me a freakin' break...!\n\nSchizophrenia may affect the victim who has it in many different ways and on many different levels of severity.  One may be slightly schizophrenic, or schizphrenic to the point of loss of all social functioning and ability, i.e., it can be disabling.  It is characterized chiefly by paranoia, paranoid delusions, and/or hallucinations - either auditory or visual.  ANYTHING that can affect regions of the brain responsible for vision and hearing can then alter those perceptions and yield signs that would be diagnosed as schizoaffective, for example.\n\nPhysical damage directly affecting the brain can lead to behaviors symptomatic of schizophrenia (you fall down in the park and a stick goes through the roof of your mouth into your brain and causes brain damage, or you use drugs so much that it causes chronic physical overuse of seratonin receptors which results in cellular and functional brain damage are 2 examples of things that could happen physically).\n\nThere is believed (some evidence exits) to be a genetic component to being pre-disposed to having schizophrenia, but keep in mind that most people are not born with overt schizophrenic symptoms.  This suggests that it is more of a socially generated disorder, and is caused by gross misintrepretation of one's local and global environmental states coupled with his or her lack of self-esteem and self-confidence.  Someone with a lot of self-confidence will not become paranoid that everyone is talking about them, and are less likely, therefore, to show signs of paranoia, develop delusional thoughts about conspiracy, etc...all symptoms of schizophrenia.  Someone with no self-esteem or self-confidence, on the other hand, will be more likely to think everyone is against them, that secret agencies like the CIA are pitting conspiracy against them, and that others are plotting to hurt them in some way - since these things are not really happening (that is to sayt they are delusions), this individual will be diagnosed as schizophrenic when he tells these things to his psychiatrist.  There is interestingly the commonality among schizophrenic patients that the people that are out to get them are either secret agencies or large, powerful institutions - the CIA, the FBI, the government, the IRS - this is thought to be based on the fact that the victim needs to fulfill his paranoiad delusions somehow, and these organizations are not well known so it would be difficult for someone else to refute the fact that they are or are not after him.  That is, it's hard to prove that the CIA doesn't have a file on you, because if they did they wouldn't tell you.  This is referred to as ""paranoid security"", and is common among all schizoaffective patients.\n\nSo there are a lot of reasons one ""gets"" schizophrenia - the only common factor is that the causes are related to changes in brain chemistry, as I mentioned this is either physical or chemical in nature, and can have a variety of root causes."
The best way to cure a cold is to not get one in the first place.  Believe it or not its not normal to catch a cold. I may get a cold every 4 years or so, and generally only catch one under stressful conditions, when I mess with my sleep and don't eat right.  \n\nIf you have a cold its your body's way of saying my immune system is weakened.  \n\nTO AVOID CATCHING COLDS EVER:\n\n1)Make sure you control stress in your life, \n2) that you are eating properly (Is your vegetarian diet created by a nutritionist so that you don't get ill because you lack proper nutrients? or did you just create it yourself by deciding not to eat meat? Be healthy and make sure your diet is meeting your own bodys requirements) \n3)get proper rest for your body(generally between 7-10hrs a night sleep), \n4) Maintain routine schedules (eating, sleeping, exercise, etc). \n5) Wash your hands regularly and throughly throughout the day. \n6) During high cold seasons when several people around you are sick, use a plain SALINE NASAL spray throughout the day. \n7) Take a well balanced multi-vitamin daily. High doses of Vit c (500mg) are good for you.  \n8) Exercise regulary.   \n\nOnce you have a cold the best way to treat it is to treat the symptoms with medicine (Tylenol Cold), get plenty of rest (16hrs), drink lots of water and liquids, eat several small light meals (avoid carrots and other vegetables that are hard to digest. You don't want you body spending the energy to digest hard foods when you are ill. Soups, oatmeal,veg broths,oranges, are good to include) And give it a few days to past.  Your body will heal itself if it is healthy enough.

"Well, for one there is nothing to feel guilty or ""dirty"" about.  It is something that is perfectly natural.  In fact, there are a lot of animals that do it, not just humans.\n\nAs long as you are not doing it to excess (multiple times a day) or letting it distract you from your day-to-day life, I would not worry about it.  I am a single female, and I do it on average a few times a week.  Even when I am not single, I still wiw it at least several times a month.\n\nBesides, there have been some studies that say it may actually be good for you.  It raises blood pressure and heart rate, and burns off calories.  And the endorphins and hormones released have benefits including the lowering of blood pressure, long-term endorphins that relieve stress, and it can even reduce menstral cramps and migranes."
real peperment from either hard candies or in tea-  \n\nAnother option, which I have only heard from two people is that peanuts actually help-- my fiance gets terrible cluster headaches which make him extremely nauseas and sometimes even vomit and he SWEARS by his salted peanuts- eating them slowly-- also, when my I told my mom about this, she informed me that when she was pregnant with me thats all she could eat was peanuts because she was sick all the time
Absolutely. \nThe only caveat is that the US gov has increased the level of opiate for a positive from 300 nanograms to 2000. As private companies follow suit, that should reduce the number of false positives from poppy seeds.

"Hey do you mean Ayurveda?\n\nAyurveda (आयुर्वेद Sanskrit: ayu—life; veda—knowledge of) or ayurvedic medicine is a more than 2,000 year old comprehensive system of medicine based on a holistic approach rooted in Vedic culture. Its conspicuous use of the word veda, or knowledge, reveals its role in early Hinduism and describes its hallowed place in India. Ayurveda also had a tradition of surgery. Two early texts of Ayurveda are the Charaka Samhita and the Sushruta Samhita.\n\nThe Charaka and Sushruta Samhitās are compendiums of two traditions rather than texts authored by single authors. A third tradition is that of the Kāshyapas. The scholarly traditions of ayurveda date back to the time of the Buddha, who died (mahaparinirvana) in approximately 400 BCE. Some plant remedies of ayurveda are mentioned in the earlier Vedic literature 2nd millennium BC, but the formal doctrines of the three humours and other key ayurvedic ideas are first mentioned in the Buddhist Canonical literature. Both the Sushruta and Charaka Samhitās are the product of several editorial hands, having been revised and supplemented over a period of several hundred years.\n\nThe scholar Vāgbhata, who lived in Sind at the beginning of the 7th century AD, produced a grand synthesis of earlier ayurvedic materials in a verse work called Ashtānga Samhita. Another work associated with the same author, the Asthanga Samgraha, contains much the same material in a more diffuse form, written in a mixture of prose and verse. The relationship between these two works, and a third intermediate compilation, is still a topic of active research. The works of Charaka, Sushruta, and Vagbhata are considered canonical and reverentially called the Vriddha Trayi, ""the triad of ancients""; or Brhat Trayi, ""the greater triad."" In the early eighth century, Mādhav wrote his Nidāna, a work on etiology, which soon assumed a position of authority. In the 79 chapters of this book, he lists diseases along with their causes, symptoms, and complications.\n\nThe vast majority of Ayurvedic therapies are herbal compounds. Some alchemical preparations start to enter the ayurvedic pharmacopieia towards the end of the 1st millennium AD in works such as those of Ugraditya (8th century AD)and Sarngadhara (14th century AD). It also provides therapies for the treatment of various vegetable and animal toxins like scorpion, spider and snake venom. It has a whole science of toxicology called agada-tantra as one of the eight branches of traditional Ayurveda.\n\nThe Ayurvedic idea is that the organism adapts to the environment and its food, climate etc. This principle of adaptation is called satyma. Through introducing small amounts of a food or medicine, the organism can adapt to it and learn to resist it.\n\nAyurveda became increasingly symptom-based, treating the symptoms of a disease rather than the root cause. However, it is important to note that Ayurveda was originally a consciousness based system of health care. Its philosophy, expressed in modern terms, is to strengthen the immune system.\n\n\nQualities\nIt could be said that the simple essence of ayurveda is knowledge and awareness of the qualities of nature – called gurvadi gunah. By understanding the qualities inherent in the environment, in foodstuffs, in activities, etc., one gains an appreciation of their effects on the individual constitution through the principle of similarities; i.e., that similarities cause increase while dissimilarities cause decrease. Thus hot qualities in the environment or diet will increase hot qualities in the body.\n\nThe gurvadi gunah are listed in Vagbhata's Ashtanga Hrdayam as:\n\nGuru (heavy) – laghu (light) \nManda (slow) – tikshna (quick, sharp) \nHima (cold) – ushna (hot) \nSnigdha (unctuous) – ruksha (dry) \nSlakshna (smooth) – khara (rough) \nSandra (solid) – drava (liquid) \nMrdu (soft) – kathina (hard) \nSthira (stable) – cala (mobile) \nSuk"

"Milk thistle is used to treat inflammatory liver ailments, especially chronic illnesses, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis. Gallbladder ailments and related digestive symptoms, varicose and spider veins problems in the legs and jaundice are helped by milk thistle treatment, as well. A silymarin injection is an antidote to poisoning from the ""death cap"" mushroom, amanita.\n\nTherapeutic Effect\n      The active ingredient in milk thistle seeds is silymarin, a combination of three different flavonoids that supports the walls of liver cells, preventing poisons from penetrating them. It also stimulates the regeneration of these cells. Bitter principles and amino acids help support the entire digestive system.\n\nSilymarin as a liver tonic\n      People with acute liver problems should follow a six-week treatment with tea made from milk thistle seeds (below, in healing tea mixtures) several times a year. This tea treatment program is often recommended for people with liver damage caused by excess alcohol intake and cirrhosis.\n\nHow silymarin works\n      Silymarin helps prevent liver poisoning in two ways. It changes the liver cell walls in such a way that it is very difficult for poisons, such as cabon tetrachloride, to penetrate the walls. Silymarin also stimulates cell division so that new liver cells will grow continually.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMethods of Administration\nTea\n      For poor digestion, drink this tea 30 min. before meals. To support blood vessel integrity for the treatment of spider or varicose veins, drink 2-3 cups of tea throughout the day.\nPour 1 cup of boiling water over 2 tsps. of crushed seeds. Steep 10-15 min. and strain. There is no time limit on treatment with this tea; its use may be ongoing. \n      Peppermint increases the effectiveness of milk thistle tea and improves its taste. When you make the tea, add 1 tbsp. of peppermint leaves to the mixture.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTincture\n      For gallstones or other gallbladder concerns, take 20-30 drops up to 3 times daily until the condition improves. To prepare the tincture, mix ¼ cup of crushed seeds with 1¼ cups of rum in a clean glass jar. Cover tightly and shake well. Let stand for 4-6 weeks, shaking every few days. Strain out the seeds and bottle the liquid. \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNutritional Supplement\n      To support good liver function, eat 1 tbsp. of ground seeds daily. In a coffee grinder or spice mill, grind seeds to add to hot cereals, muffins, rice dishes and other whole-grain meals. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMedicinal Uses\nTincture for intensive treatment\n      Silymarin is only partly water soluble, so for an intensive treatment to protect and regenerate liver cells, you should also use a tincture made from milk thistle seeds to increase the effect of the tea. Put 10 drops of the tincture into 1 cup of milk thistle tea. This tincture can also be purchased in health food stores. Caution: Because of its alcohol content, never use the tincture if you are suffering from acute liver inflammation or alcoholism.\n\nLeaf tea for aiding digestion\n      You can also make therapeutic teas from the leaves of the milk thistle. They do not contain silymarin, but they have an overall positive effect on the liver and gallbladder, and a tea made with them is valuable for improving digestion and for easing mild digestive complaints. Pour 1 cup of boiling water over 1½ tsp. of finely chopped leaves. Steep for 5-10 min. and then strain. Drink 2-3 glasses per day.\n\nCompresses for varicose veins\n      The external application of the tea in a compress can help varicose veins and open leg sores. Make the tea; cool. Soak a cloth in the cooled tea and apply as a damp compress "
"Ok, without getting a full history beyond ""I sleep 10+ hours a day"", there may or may not be a health issue here. Although the ""appropriate"" amount of sleep is widely accepted to be an AVERAGE of about 8 hours; there are clearly individual differences among people in what their sleep ""need"" is.\n\nBeyond the individual differences, there are also age related need... babies will sleep much of the day, where as the elderly will need a bit less than the average adult. Children and teens will need a bit more than the average adult (although teens will often not get it due to poor sleep habits).\n\nNow, all that being said, you may indeed have a sleep disorder with 10+ hours of sleep. That is quite a bit for someone who typed at least 3 sentences with proper grammer and syntax. There are some non-respiratory (the most common sleep disorder is Obstructive Sleep Apnea) that can cause people to sleep all the time and teen years is when they tend to show up. Narcolepsy and Klein Levens comes to mind, but they are rather rare, and the cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone resulting in collapse) that is associated with narcolepsy isn't something that is easily overlooked. \n\nIf you find that you snore when you sleep, then obstructive sleep apnea is a possibility; indicating that you may be breathing poorly (or not at all) through the night disrupting your sleep and requiring you to stay in bed tring to catch up longer. When apneics wake up hundreds of times a night to breath, they don't actually remember it generally.\n\nAdditionally, poor sleep hygeine can add to the amount of sleep you end up trying to get. If you have a poor sleep schedule (changing get up and go to bed times often), work out close to bedtime, drink caffeine late, have TV or radio on at bedtime, read in bed, etc... then you may not be getting very good sleep, and therefore needing more sleep.\n\nNOW, with all those possiblilities thrown out, there are still more I haven't mentioned. The best thing to do is seek out a sleep disorders center in your area (they are everywhere) and get a referal from your primary care physician and have a sleep study done to determine if indeed you have a problem that may be a health risk to you. These are easy tests really, you will come into a lab before bed, they will attach a couple dozen wires to you with a little glue and you'll sleep overnight while being monitored, if narcolepsy is suspected then you may do some ""nap studies"" through the day also. When its all done, a sleep specialist will review the results with you determining if you do or do not have a sleep disorder. \n\nGood Luck"

This is hard to say even now.  I was travelling in China about 10 years ago.  I was in a city near the border where there were a lot of tourists and hence a lot of beggars on the street.\n\nThe beggars were mostly children - perhaps 8 to 12 years old.  What made it worse was that they had babies with them - babies that they left lying on the sidewalk until they saw you coming, then picked them up and ran after you asking for money.\n\nI never heard one of the babies cry and I still wonder how many of them were already dead and where their supply of them came from.  There would be 2 to 4 children (with their babies) on each street I walked.  I only went out the once; I couldn't take it any more.

My question for you is, does she have a family doctor? and if so, she needs to explain what has happened. my mother is only 47 and she had a mild stroke(TIA)about two weeks ago, her family doctor had a MRI and a MRA done which showed some damage done to her brain...If your sisters doctor does not do something now then she could easily have another stroke that causes permanent damage..Keep calling the neurologist,be as persistant as you can be...If you have to take her to someone else and explain what's going on, normally when someone has a mild stroke it is a warning sign that a major stroke is  or will happen.... I hope I helped some, good luck to you and your sister...hope all goes well.

They really do work! They stimulate the gum tissue and toughen it against periodontal disease, and they are also excellent for removing food particles. Try it- brush your teeth, then use a water pick. You'll see the food it dislodges. One tip- when you first begin, use a very gentle setting, or else you can cause gum injury/bleeding. As your gums strengthen, you can increase the pressure.

Honey, no pill will build you lean muscle unless you push weights. Even 3 lb dumbells wil have more effect than pills. The only this I found they are good for is cardio support. On a pill i can keep going on my Stairmaster for 1.5 hours instead of getting exhausted in half an hour
For a lot of reasons. It actually depends on the person involved.\n\nFor one thing, it could be because the person is simply restless in nature. People who belong to this category often are found doing other things besides the one that they are currently working on.\n\nAnother, it is probably because it is a habit that one has developed in the earlier parts of one's life. Pressumably the parents of this person is observed talking on the phone with notepads. In an artistic way, this person is incorporating what his/her subconscious has picked up from her past.\n\nStill, it could be that the person is a workaholic. Someone who falls under this catergory cannot simply focus on doing one task alone. For them, though not really intentionally, talking idly on the phone consumes work time. These are the type of people that cannot keep their hands still, and due to the skill inherent to one person, he begins to multitask. Or in this situation, draw.\n\nLastly, it could simply be because the person is simply... uninterested of the conversation and feels the need to do something other than talking idly on the phone.\n\nOfcourse, there are sometimes where in a person is a combination of these categories. ^^\n\nI hope it helps!
An Orthopedic doctor treats bone injuries.  A Radiologist is a doctor that interprets x-rays. A Pulmonologist is a doctor that treats lung ailments.  You need to go to a family doctor if you think you have a broken rib.  You may have pneumonia and a broken rib.  A family doctor will give you a prescription for an x-ray, so he/she can see what is wrong.  A family doctor will listen to your lungs and be able to detect asthma or pneumonia.

"Pullups/chinups. Not only does it work the biceps, but also your lats and shoulders. A lot of back exercises work the biceps too. Barbell or dumbbell rows, cable rows, lat pulldowns will all work your biceps. And squats. It may sound strange, but squats are great for a full body workout. Your body releases a ton of growth hormones just from squats alone, that all your muscles benefit.\n\nAnd don't forget to work your triceps too. They do make up 2/3 of your upper arm, and having well shaped tri's can really make your arms look great!\n\nThe link below is an article called ""How Can A Bodybuilder Add Inches To The Arms In The Shortest Time?"" It has a lot of good ideas and techniques on overall arm workout (biceps, triceps, and forearms)."

Yes, you can have a vaginal birth....the only thing that has ever occcurred during birth as far as transmitting to the baby is laryngeal papilloma which affects the babies throat but this is quite rare and only occurs in rare cases if the women's genital warts are in the vaginal canal. If the wart's are enlarging because of pregnancy hormones than the stretching of the vaginal wall during labor may be more difficult and C-section may be considered.

Masturbation questions are very common among both female and male TeenHealthFX users. And, many ask questions and really want to know if it will effect what happens to them during puberty and health problems associated with this normal, healthy activity.\n\nTo set the record straight, masturbation does not cause any health problems or affect puberty in any way (like your period or breast development). Also, your doctor cannot tell whether or not you masturbate.\n\nMany topics on the following page, most likely answers your question:

"A ""little tricky"" is putting it mildly, try a little impossible!\n\nLosing 15 lbs in a month is totally crazy (a FEW pounds!!??).   Funny how he waited until the last minute to decide on this.\n\nA pound of fat contains 3500 calories, so if you lost 1/2 a pound a day you would need to use 1750 calories a day, or the equivalent of running 20 miles.   That also assumes you don't take in more than your basal metabolic rate (very lttle food).  A goal of 5 lbs might be more reasonable.\n\nAnyway, try aerobic exercise (running, biking) to burn the calories and some weight work to put on some muscle.\n\nOh...and yoga for losing weight and putting on muscle.  Not likely!"

the trick- YOU MUST DO THIS - find your comfort level with whatever it is youre doin- the pace, the intensity, the resistance, find it- keep it, then- when youre all out of energy- keep going you're gonna be fine its just burn it only lasts for a minute till you feel your second wind then you'll be unstoppable - another secret, remind yourself when you feel you cant (why can't you? not because your body can't take it (it can) remind yourself that there's no real physical injury happening and the pain and resistance will no longer be associated with what you're doin but a separate nuisance that you CAN AND WILL tolerate (only for a short time till your stamina is tougher than zeus!) don't be stupid though - know and don't push real limitations -when you injure yourself it's gonna take forever to heal -
Exercise is a great way to get energy, especially cardio exercise.  I bought some dance tapes, I especially love DANCE Fat Burning Party by Crunch Videos.  Another thing that will help is MAKING yourself get up for a week, maybe two when the alarm does go off.  I used to be a snooze button hitter myself, and that much disturbed sleep is not sleep at all.  Also find a time to go to bed and stick to it, most people need between 6-9 hours of sleep a night, I have found the best to be 7-8, going towards 9 hours and people start to get too much sleep, which can make you just as tired as not enough sleep.  When you wake up in the morning especially when you start getting used to your schedule, splash your face a couple of times with cold water, and so come stretches over all your body.  Good luck! :)  And don't hit the snooze button any more.  :)  TRUST ME.
"try taboo\nWHAT to eat for losing weight\n\n• Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, especially NC (negative calorie) food.\n\n* Print these lists. They will be your ... ""Bible"", from now on !\n* Dill and parsely - include them in all your salads. Also ognion + garlic.\n* Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits (whenever possible, of course)\n* If you really want a book, then check this out: The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook (Win95/98 only). Read more about this e-book here.\n\n\n• Eat fish, chicken, beef, pork. (preferences are in this order)\n\n* If you are a vegetarian, then ignore this!\n* Avoid fat meat\n\n\n• Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day. Don't EVER exclude bread from your diet!\n\n• Snacks between meals (if needed): apples, oranges, grepfruits and other NC fruits\n\n* Don't cheat ... NO cookies, chips, candies, brownies etc! \n* EVEN if they have ""low fat"" indication... They might have low fat, yet they can have lots of CALORIES !!!\n\n\n• About rice, potatoes, beans, [xxx]nuts, pastry, pasta... you know!\n\n* Don't eat too much of those, at least during the first weeks of the diet. I'm not a low carb addict, but I've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities, especially when associated with other foods.\n* If you like them a lot, try and eat them like one meal. A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch (never dinner!), followed by a nice big apple. These rich starch foods are not good for dinner!\n* At dinner time, chose mainly large mixed veggies salads... with fish, lean meat or cheese (if you are not a vegetarian). \n\nif u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it. no salt no nothing just plain. u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound. i heard that from a weight loss tape. the best drink is water or gatorade. thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo. if u want a macine. run with dumbells on a treadmill. u could do the rocky workout. but thats a new story. u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs\n\n1) It is not just the amount you eat, but what you eat. Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start. And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever.\n\n2) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day. Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for you to feel labored. The other half of the time use weights, or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle ""burn"". A gym is also an option, but I don't know if you have the money for or want to spend the money on it.\n\n3) Sleep well. To bed earlier and up earlier. Exercise in the morning when you wake up, not in the evening before bed. 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must.\n\n4) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time. A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom.\n\nThat is a good place to start... if you see good results, keep it up and modify to fit you... if it does not, see a doctor AND a trainer \n\nKeep working out, drink water a lot, eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities, vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice, fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours, minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important, your last meal must be before you sleep by 2 to 3 hours\nthe most important thing is you don't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what you want\n\nyou might have some more ideas from www.ivillage.com\n\ngood luck"

Too much of Anything is bad for you.
they are very common benign tumors (the most common tumor in women) of the smooth muscle tissue in the muscular layer of the uterus. They are a celular proliferation of fusiform cells  with very low mitotic activity that usually arise in several groups.\n\nThey are benign, I insist, because they are well limited and have little or no mitotic activity (cell division), which isn't irregular either (the DNA does not get mutated when they divide). they may cause bleeding or discomfort, which is why the woman should go to her gyno. surgical treatment is usually completely curative and doesn't involve any loss of function (as in a histerectomy or anything).
She may have a medical problem that causes the odor.  It could be a STD or something not as serious.  There isn't really an easy way to approach her about this problem.  But if I was you, I would suggest that we both go to the local clinic and have STD testing done.  At least that way you are protecting yourself from catching anything if that is the case.  Good luck.  But above anything else make sure you wrap it up!

General metabolism increases - expressed as an increase in activity or raised temperature, or both.
Good hygene of course.  Also, what you eat (garlic for example) may be a contibuting factor in body odor orally and through the sweat glands.  A good absorbing powder (Gold Bond) may help subdue the sweating factor as well as the use of a good deodorant. Have your blood and urine checked to see if you have abnormal body chemistries..and see a dentist if the problem is persistant ORAL odor.  If your feet are part of the problem...you may have fungal infections...see  a podiatrist or your own general physician for medications to eliminate the problem.\n\nAlso, you may have to bathe more frequently and change into fresh clean clothes more frequently.
No cancer is not a communicable disease. It is not contagious or spead from person to person.\nCommunicable disease: illnesses caused by microorganisms and transmitted from an infected person or animal to another person or animal. Some diseases are passed on by direct or indirect contact with infected persons or with their excretions. Most diseases are spread through contact or close proximity because the causative bacteria or viruses are airborne; i.e., they can be expelled from the nose and mouth of the infected person and inhaled by anyone in the vicinity. \n\nCancer is a disease of cells. It is an abnormal growth of cells which tend to proliferate in an uncontrolled way and, in some cases, to metastasize (spread). \n\nCancer is also called malignancy. A cancerous growth or tumor is sometimes referred to as a malignant growth or tumor. A non-malignant growth or tumor is referred to as benign. Benign tumors are not cancer. \n\nCancer is not one disease. It is a group of more than 100 different and distinctive diseases. Cancer is NOT contagious.\nhttp://www.answers.com/cancer?gwp=12&method=2
Wellbutrin was given to depressed people and it was found that some of the smokers also stopped as a side effect. So the drug maker marketed a new product now called Zyban. \nZyban or Wellbutrin are SSRs, meaning - they are a class of drugs dealing with selective serontonin re-uptake.  It is designed to 'top up' the serontonin supply, which act on the brain's neuro pathways triggering a supply of 'mood changing' chemicals... similar to the reaction smokers get from nicotine.\n\nZyban has side effects, some serious and occaisionally fatal, and it does not help with the habitual or psychological addiction to smoking, which are very important. See 'Ways to Stop Smoking,' at the website below.

Yes!\nEverything is connected.  If you neck is tight, your body will re-align your shoulders and upper torso so that you cause the least amount of damage to the already-hurting area.  This causes discomfort in your mid-torso...causing the mid- and lower-torso to shift.  On down the line, your lower-torso is in a state of discomfort...etc...etc...all the way down to your tailbone.\n\nDoctors have even shown how a bad shoe (poor foot alignment) can cause headaches.\n\nYou will be surprised.  Have a doctor (sports med. or chiropractic) adjust your neck, and wait...and it will all adjust itself back to normal, and pain-free.\n\nGood luck!\n\n(remember, it took time to hurt...it will take time to heal)

Heptitis C is a disease of the liver, The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the most important causes of chronic liver disease in the United States. It accounts for about 20 percent of acute viral hepatitis, 60 to 70 percent of chronic hepatitis, and 30 percent of cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and liver cancer. Almost 4 million Americans, or 1.8 percent of the U.S. population, have antibody to HCV (anti-HCV), indicating ongoing or previous infection with the virus. Hepatitis C causes an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 deaths annually in the United States.\n\nA distinct and major characteristic of hepatitis C is its tendency to cause chronic liver disease. At least 75 percent of patients with acute hepatitis C ultimately develop chronic infection, and most of these patients have accompanying chronic liver disease.\n\nChronic hepatitis C varies greatly in its course and outcome. At one end of the spectrum are patients who have no signs or symptoms of liver disease and completely normal levels of serum liver enzymes. Liver biopsy usually shows some degree of chronic hepatitis, but the degree of injury is usually mild, and the overall prognosis may be good. At the other end of the spectrum are patients with severe hepatitis C who have symptoms, HCV RNA in serum, and elevated serum liver enzymes, and who ultimately develop cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. In the middle of the spectrum are many patients who have few or no symptoms, mild to moderate elevations in liver enzymes, and an uncertain prognosis. Researchers estimate that at least 20 percent of patients with chronic hepatitis C develop cirrhosis, a process that takes 10 to 20 years. After 20 to 40 years, a smaller percentage of patients with chronic disease develop liver cancer.\n\nChronic hepatitis C can cause cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. About 20 percent of patients develop cirrhosis within 10 to 20 years of the onset of infection. Liver failure from chronic hepatitis C is one of the most common reasons for liver transplants in the United States. Hepatitis C might be the most common cause of primary liver cancer in the developed world. In Italy, Spain, and Japan, at least half of liver cancers could be related to HCV. Men, alcoholics, patients with cirrhosis, people over age 40, and those infected for 20 to 40 years are more likely to develop HCV-related liver cancer.\n\nRisk Factors and Transmission\n\nHCV is spread primarily by contact with blood and blood products. Blood transfusions and the use of shared, unsterilized, or poorly sterilized needles and syringes have been the main causes of the spread of HCV in the United States. With the introduction in 1991 of routine blood screening for HCV antibody and improvements in the test in mid-1992, transfusion-related hepatitis C has virtually disappeared. At present, injection drug use is the most common risk factor for contracting the disease. However, many patients acquire hepatitis C without any known exposure to blood or to drug use.\n\nThe major high-risk groups for hepatitis C are:\n\nPeople who had blood transfusions before June 1992, when sensitive tests for anti-HCV were introduced for blood screening. \nPeople who have frequent exposure to blood products. These include patients with hemophilia, solid-organ transplants, chronic renal failure, or cancer requiring chemotherapy. \nHealth care workers who suffer needle-stick accidents \nInjection drug users, including those who used drugs briefly many years ago \nInfants born to HCV-infected mothers \nOther groups who appear to be at slightly increased risk for hepatitis C are:\n\nPeople with high-risk sexual behavior, multiple partners, and sexually transmitted diseases \nPeople who use cocaine, particularly with intranasal administration, using shared equipment \nMaternal-Infant Transmission\n\nMaternal-infant transmission is not common. In most studies, only 5 percent of infants born to infected women become infected. The disease in newborns is u
Genital Warts?\n\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common causes of sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the world.  Some types of HPV cause genital warts—single or multiple bumps that appear in the genital areas of men and women including the vagina, cervix, vulva (area outside of the vagina), penis, and rectum. Genital warts (sometimes called condylomata acuminata or venereal warts) are the most easily recognized sign of genital HPV infection. Many people, however, have a genital HPV infection without genital warts. Genital warts are soft, moist, or flesh colored and appear in the genital area within weeks or months after infection. They sometimes appear in clusters that resemble cauliflower-like bumps, and are either raised or flat, small or large. Genital warts can show up in women on the vulva and cervix, and inside and surrounding the vagina and anus. In men, genital warts can appear on the scrotum or penis. There are cases where genital warts have been found on the thigh and groin. \n\nHPV has no known cure. There are treatments for genital warts, though they often disappear even without treatment. There is no way to predict whether the warts will grow or disappear. Therefore, if you suspect you have genital warts, you should be examined and treated, if necessary.\n\nDepending on factors such as the size and location of your genital warts, your health care provider will offer you one of several ways to treat them.\n\n• Imiquimod cream\n• 20 percent podophyllin antimitotic solution\n• 0.5 percent podofilox solution\n• 5 percent 5-fluorouracil cream\n• Trichloroacetic acid (TCA)\n\nIf you are pregnant, you should not use podophyllin or podofilox because they are absorbed by your skin and may cause birth defects in your baby. In addition, you should not use 5-fluorouracil cream if you are expecting.\n\nIf you have small warts, your health care provider can remove them by one of three methods.\n\n• freezing (cryosurgery)\n• burning (electrocautery)\n• laser treatment\n\nIf you have large warts that have not responded to other treatment, you may have to have surgery to remove them.\n\nSome health care providers use the antiviral drug alpha interferon, which they inject directly into the warts, to treat warts that have returned after removal by traditional means. The drug is expensive, however, and does not reduce the rate that the genital warts return.\n\nAlthough treatments can get rid of the warts, none get rid of the virus. Because the virus is still present in your body, warts often come back after treatment.

Call you doctor right away.\n\nI take the same medication and the same dosage.  I have never experienced these symptoms.  Everyone is different though.  Just make your doctor aware of this, so he can advise what is proper for you.
If you take too much psuedophed for your sniffles, your body will become dependent on the drug. When you stop taking the psuedophederin, you will have a case of sinus congestion you have never known before.\nThe doctor will X-ray your face and see all the congestion and unless another drug such as anti-biotic does not clear it up, he will have to drill holes in your face to drain the sinus

Well, as an RN student, I  can give you some info.  You can get an RN degree in 2-3 years.  An LPN takes 2-2 1/2.  Starting pay for an RN varies by the area of the country you live in, but here in the midwest, I can start at about $60K per year.  LPN's is about half of that.
"My husband and I have been smoking pot for about the same time you have. We have also thought about quitting but not too sure if it will make us better or not. Honestly, it cuts back on our smoking cigarettes and drinking so, I think we will keep smoking pot. We enjoy it socially and responsibly. If we stop, I think we will probably be ""not so nice people""...LOL Enjoy!"
Ughhh, I don't know why people do. It is rancid. Who wants to actually eat another animal? It is so last century to be a nasty carnivore.\n\nPlus why should all of the animals suffer when there are alternatives? People are selfish, and ignore the facts so that they can keep on being gluttonous in their consumption of dead cow, pig, etc.\n\nHey if you like eating dead animals, good luck to you, because your health is deteriorating with every bite. \nThis is pure medical facts.
1 - Evaluate your intakes in kilocalories.\n\n2 - Add X kcal a day.\n\n3 - Make some calculations. 9 kcal = 1 gram of weight (lipid)\n\ni.e. + 500 kcal a day -> 50 g a day  (1 kg for 20 days)
yeah why not... someone there must need one and the cool thing about a small town is everyone knows everyone so if you do a great job you should get referrals.
You might want to consider a vitamin supplement with B complex vitamins and pantothenic acid, biotin, choline and inositol.  It would only really help if you have a deficiency in one of those.  If you are a vegetarian it is hard to get enough biotin (primary source is meat), or if you have a typical american diet, you might be deficient in the other ones (best source is cruciferous (cabbage, broccoli) vegetables and dark green leafy vegetables).\n\n  For some unknown reason, shaving any part of the body other than the head seems to stimulate thick regrowth in both men and women.\n\n  Hope this helps!
Doctors will probably tell you not to quit cold turkey, but I had no problems.
Eat your veggies and don't do drugs :)

Rigor mortis sets in after the body dies when the body has high amounts of lactic acid build up. It happens the same time with any type of death. I have a theory and I'm not sure that it's true. It may depend upon the person's body weight how quickly it would occur.
continue to stretch and also eat things rich in potassium, like bananas
Rotaviruses are a genus of viruses belonging to the Reoviridae family. Seven major groups have been identified, three of which (groups A, B, and C) infect humans, with group A being the most common and widespread one. They cause vomiting and diarrhea and are the most common cause of severe diarrhea in children, killing about 600,000 children every year in developing countries (as of 2005). New vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in 2006.

"It hurts a lot because you have let it mean a lot to you. In a way, you gave power to her, and you kind of relinquished emotionally; you kind of put your life in her hands, and your self-worth upon her acceptance of you.\nThere's probably not much you can do about it now that everything happened.\nI say that retrospecting back to a similar, extremely traumatizing experience I had. I was in so much pain, for months. It was because I had invested my pride in her. That's always a mistake. You need to kind of ""carry your own pride"" and not expect your woman to hold all of it.\nWhat I refer to ""investing your pride"" is a process by which you try to come to terms with being with her. The first feeling is that you like her a lot, and in essence she becomes some type of possession or trophy, and she determines your social standing. Then a paradox happens: you think ""since she's so great, and she's with me, that means I'm great... no wait... I'm even greater than her""!. that's when things start falling apart. Too much of that, and then she leaves, and you're don't feel that great anymore.\nMaybe I'm like way off. This is just my guess.\nThe solution is to concentrate on your goals. read as many self-help books you can on goal setting and ""reaching your dreams"" and stuff. Audio books are even better, it's like listening to a friend trying to help. Good luck."
Well what are your questions. I wore braces for about 5 years. The removal process takes about an hour to an hour and a half. They scrape of all of the brackets like they do when they fix one. After the removal, they wil, take off any extra cement that was left on your teeth. It will fell weird the first few days, but you won't be able to stop rubbing our tounge across your teeth. I will feel so smooth. any other questions just e-mail me at aprilchick70@yahoo.com

Yes, yes, yes, yes and yes!\n\nI'm a med student currently on my surgery rotation, and we see a lot of 20-year-olds with skin cancer and the majority of them have a history of tanning bed use.  It's a major risk factor for skin cancer...   Tanning outside isn't better.  Either use self-tanner (I know, they're difficult to use) or use a tanning lotion with UV-B protection and apply generously according to the directions on the bottle.
it is only misunderstood by MEN LOL, You know yourself better then anyone if you feel like you are having problems, talk to your doctor, not every has postpartum, but the women who do have real simptoms, and it is nothing to be assamed of, it is horrmonal, and treatable.
sorry for the first answer that you received to your honest question... the reasons behind the infection rate really due lie in the use of condoms but not as ignorantly put by the previous poster. African American people are the least likely to have adequate health care and therefore not have knowledge of the transmission of the disease. It is also well documented that some AA men have at times engaged in high-risk sexual behavior with other HIV+ men (down-low) or with prostitutes. They then unknowingly bring the disease home to their GF/wife. There are many other factors that go into the descrepancy between the races but this seems to be the number one cause.
Dental Esthetics- not only refer to the appearance of your teeth, but including everything from your mouth,lips,oral occlusion, and good oral health. A specialized or preferred choice of practicing dentistry.
stretch you legs and do exercises take a walk lower back pain is the worst kind i know i have experienced it my self try leg lifts as these can help also see if you can find some one to give you a masage its not the bone that gives you pain but the muscles around it. lay on your back and bring your knees one at a time up to your chest do at least 8 times and hold for 8 seconds do this every day for two weeks and you should be feeling beter.
Nutrition is a key role in good skin.  Watch what you eat, drink plenty of water as you already stated.\n\nWash your face 2 times a day with a good wash for oily skin. Don't over wash either, that can make it worse.\n\nWhen applying make up, use a good oil free base makeup and use a make up sponge to apply it lightly and evenly.  Dust over foundation with an oil free, fragrence free light powder.

sounds psycological.  Try not leaving the restaurant.  Try hiding in one of the bathroom stalls until all the employees leave for the evening and then crash on one of the booths.  If the sneezing re-occurs when the employees (or cops) wake you up the next day, seek medical attention.
Active labor is defined as continuous, regular contractions that are strong enough to cause a change in the cervix.  Are you contracting?  If not, it's probably not active labor.  \nYou can walk around dilated a small amount and not be in labor.  Be glad, celebrate!  When you do go into labor, you have already made great progress!
Depending upon the underlying cause, there could be several things you could try.  One is limiting the amount of fluid intake before bedtime, another is establishing a pattern of using the bathroom right before bedtime regularly.\n\nIn some cases, the child may be a very sound sleeper and they make some devices that can be used to sound an alarm at signs of moisture.\n\nPossible causes to this problem could be physiological, such as slow development or some type of blockage of the nerves that sense a full bladder, although sometimes the cause can be psychological too, caused by a major change in a child's life.  (Such as moving to a new home, switching schools, divorce or death in the family, etc.)\n\nIf limiting fluids and establishing a pattern don't seem to work, you should consult the family physician for further guidance.
take 10% of that number, divide it by your number of competitors and that should give you your worse estimate of what you can expect. of course if you have no competition, that number will be significantly higher.\n\nno competition= 540 potential customers\n5 competitors= 108 customers\n\nnow say these people exercise twice a week at say 3$ per day admission, you'd be looking at a daily income of :\n\n3$ x 2times a week X 108 people= 648$ a week X4 weeks= 2592$ a month in gross income.\n\nif you have the maximum 10% of the people, you can take this amount 2592 X 5= 12960$ a month\n\nso your best case scenario would bring it 540 customers (10% of the population with no competition) that would spend 12960$ a month at your place only for working out. of course if you sell other products you can expand your profit margin\n\nyour worse case scenario would be 2% of the population with 5 competitors 108 people that would spend 2592$ a month.\n\ni must point out that starting a gym is a very risky business and quite hard to succeed. 90% of new gyms dont make it through a year and go bankruptcity.

Pure mineral oil is not good for you pores.  And it just leaves your face feeling slimy.\n\nYou want a lightweight, facial moisturizer.\n\nI use two products: St. Ives Essential Collagen Elastin and Clinique.  Both are wonderful because they are quickly absorbed and don't leave an oily residue.
Yes, postnasal drip can cause bad breath. \n\nI would first recommend an over-the-counter saline solution or an antihistamine (if your postnasal drip is caused by allergies). \n\nIf this condition continues for a prolonged period, you should see a doctor. This could be a sign of a bacterial sinus infection. In this case, a doctor could easily prescribe antibiotics to alleviate the problem.

But yeah, if it doesn't mess with your life and the people you talk to don't tell you to do stupid or harmful things, then it should be okay."
"First of all, figure out if it is a chemical inbalance or if you are bummed because of something in your life. For the first, go see a doctor. If you have already, read the book ""the new feminine Brain"" by Dr. Mona Lisa Schultz. If your life is not going as planned or you have had a lot of disappointments, see a therapist and figure out what is bugging you and learn to work through it. It is hard work, but if you want to get over your depression, which is a SYMPTOM of something else, you need to tackle the source. \nI hope this helps. Best of luck to you.\nFor minor blueness; exercise and do things for yourself (NOT shopping) by taking walks, reading, anything you REALLY enjoy for yourself."
Turquoise this is the color,,, but in eyes  it is different:\nBlue-Green eyes\n \nBlue-green eyes, here with a yellow ring around the pupil, may appear to change colorA variant of blue eyes, blue-green eyes are quite rare and usually consist of an iris with a predominantly blue color, usually darker blue, with green streaks or stippling caused by a yellow- or copper-colored overlay. Yellow-, amber-, or copper-colored rings are often present around the pupil.\n\nThe exact color is often perceived to vary according to its surroundings. Wearing lighter blue colors or getting tanned tends to emphasize the blue components. Wearing bright red, green, and shades of yellow or brown can emphasize green components, or even give the impression of grey\n   A hazel eye is not the case:Hazel is usually used to describe eyes that contain elements of both green eyes and brown eyes, sometimes transitioning from green at the edges to brown around the pupil. This should not be confused with irises that display a brown, yellow, or copper-colored ring around the pupil, as in the grey iris shown below.\n\nSo i think ur eyes color is BLUE GREEN
Hospitals are short of doctors and nurses.

"I believe codependency is a situationally, developed sickness (and it IS a sickness), a ""learned behavior"" stemming from lack of self esteem, self-centered ego (eg: everything that happens must be caused by me, to me, fixed by me, etc.). It's actually a deep rooted issue of needing to control (everybody, everything, etc.). ""Dependency"" is a whole new category of sickness. Both require professional and/or spiritual treatment."
Found this site that shows some good poses during pregnancy (scroll down below the Childbirth at Home section).  Although, you should talk to your doctor first, in case there are any issues with your particular pregnancy that yoga may not be good for.\n\nIn general, you can start with long, deep breathing.  The breath starts in your belly, then it travels up through your chest and throat.  Breathing out, it leaves the same way.  Slowly, with control, and relaxed.

No. Loosing or putting on weight both has no effect on the penis structure because there’s no fat in it. Anyway, you’ve to consider that either severe diet or obesity give negative effects on the sexual performances.
I would suggest talking to your Dr. S/he will prescribe you some prenatal vitamins based on your iron levels and health history.  There are so many different ones, tailored for individual needs.  Call your Dr. or pharmacist for any questions about a specific drug.  Don't take any drug while you are pregnant, without consulting your Dr.

well I am a HIV+ person and have been for the last 12 years or so, and I have never had trouble either gaining weight or losing it. Good nutrition is great for the body no matter if you have health issues or not. But since you are concerned in regards to HIV and you have taken part in higher risk sexual behavior my suggestion would be to have an HIV test performed. Your local ASO has a simple 15min test available.

Hiccups are gulping sounds caused by involuntary spasms of the diaphragm. The diaphragm is the muscle that separates the chest and abdomen and helps with breathing. Hiccups can be triggered if you eat too much or too fast, consume very hot or cold foods and beverages, or drink carbonated beverages. Other causes include cold showers, entering or leaving a hot or cold room, sudden excitement, and stress. \nHiccups are not a serious medical condition and usually disappear on their own within a few minutes. If they last longer than 24 hours, hiccups may be a sign of another condition or injury. You should see your health care provider if you experience prolonged hiccuping. \n\nHome remedies are usually the primary treatment for hiccups, although no one is really sure how well they work. Hiccup home remedies include sneezing, being suddenly frightened, holding your breath, gargling, drinking pineapple juice, drinking water rapidly, sipping ice water, or swallowing dry granulated sugar. These activities may help by altering breathing patterns.
"You can try icing it for a while and see if the swelling goes down, but if there is a cut or ""rip"" and you do not properly take care of it it might get infected and that would be even worse.\n\nI know the hospital takes a long time but consider how much worse it can get if you do not get it taken care of."

It's very difficult to get rid of cellulite.  But 2 things that have helped reduce cellulite for me are Avon's anti-cellulite cream and taking tonalin CLA.  Rub the cream on the areas with cellulite twice a day.  Take 2 CLA caplets twice per day.\n\nThe other thing is to reduce fat overall by exercising and building muscle.  Running is good... really burns calories and works those legs.  Squats and lunges, too.
It will do more harm than good. It is no more powerful than caffeine. It causes headaches. It also helps people develop bad habits. Frankly, she should get involved in a diet program through her physician and join a gym.

have u gotten urself checked by a dentist? x-ray will show the extent of infection in ur tooth....no medicines will work since regardless of the xtent of infection, damage is definitely there as is obvious from ur symptoms. but xtraction is the last thing, it may be saved by root canal therapy, though u need to strt tht at the earliest. after the same, ur tooth can b capped nd thus restored bak to health. 2ndly, plz dnt use clove oil nd such home remedies...it will do harm rather than good.
Give a guy a few minutes.. don't argue back, it will only make matters worse... Ask yourself how you want to be treated when you get angry and try to apply here. Anger is a part of life and living.

I think a lot of people really psych themselves up about wearing contacts and then find out that it really wasn't a big deal at all.  Try not to be afraid.  You might be aware of the contacts at first (maybe for the first couple of days), but it shouldn't be painful.  Once your eyes adapt to them, you won't be able to feel them at all.  Someone at your doctor's office will be there to teach you how to put them in and take them out properly.  And you'll probably go back to see your doctor a week or two after you've had the contacts.  So if you have any problems or questions, you'll be able to talk about them then.  Just remember to follow your doctor's instructions and also remember that you can never lose a contact behind your eye (it's not physically possible).  Good luck and enjoy your new contacts!

I do the same thing -- it is very annoying.  I have tried to research it and can't find much about it other than it is normal when falling asleep.  I find that it happens most often when I am really stressed and/or really tired.  Also, the thing that was mentioned about too much caffeine late in the day might have to do with it, too.  If the twitching was all the time, I'd be worried and go to the doctor.  But I can't find anything abnormal about it happening as you fall asleep in any of my nursing books.  It is just SO FRUSTRATING!\n\nHere are some helpful links that I found:\n\nhttp://www.mayoclinic.com/health/myoclonus/AN00330\nhttp://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/library/DS/00191.html\nhttp://www.diagnose-me.com/cond/C254143.html
Yes, it would effect your brain.
No, I don't think so.  I give myself a B-12 shot once a month, but that is because my body can't absorb B-12 from the food I eat.  My doctor says that it really has nothing to do with helping you lose weight.  YOu only need a B-12 shot if your body doesn't absorb it, and this often happens to women as they age.  Vitamin B-12 deficiency is quite serious over time, so if you need it you should get it.  \n\nHowever, if you need it, you may feel better once you start getting enough B-12, which would then help you lose weight.
Wow, it could be all manner of things. Birth control pills/ patches can cause her periods to be irregular. PCOS (poly cystic ovarian syndrome)or an STD. Have her see a gynocologist ASAP.

for me.. true love is when you have to sacrifies a lot! give your him what he desires and would make him happy even if it means a lot to you for the opposite thing. like having a baby, most women don't like being pregnant for the very ovious reasons, first, the pain! nothing compares to the pain you will endure while being pregnant specially when giving birth. second, your life is at risk delivering your baby. like what they say, giving birth puts the half of you body 6 feet below the ground! and still you would take the plunge to take it for him!\n\nand also true love for me is all about taking care of his feelings! like when we are on a fight, i don't shout at him or even say bad words to him even if im about to burst with anger. i've learned to control/prevent this things because that i dont want him to be hurt with either my actions or words. and learning that was a hell lot of love! and him saying the first sorry for that fight and telling me that he would never want us to be in a fight again even if i was the one who started it all.. that's true love.\n\ntrue love is also not letting go, even thru your toughest situations, thru thick or thin, supporting one another through their deepest moments. \n\n..feeling both your most happiest moments when your together, even if your not doing anything or talking about something. just being with each other just makes you the happiest and luckiest person to be.\n\nbeing all worried and even praying for his safety when i have no idea where he might be.\n\nand even if im mad at him for having me wait at our meeting place, i just couldn't help but smile when i sight him even from afar, my heart just trembles with joy when i see him.\n\n..true love is all about swallowing your pride and true \nlove is nothing without honesty and being TRUE!! :)
Yes, a STD can stop you from getting pregnant thats why it is so important for sexually active women to get regular gynocological check ups because a woman could have an STD like chlamydia or gonnoreah and not even know it and this if left untreated will led to pelvic inflammatory disease which can cause women to become infertile. Therefore, when you visit your gynocologist not only do you need to ask for a pap smear but, you should let him/her know that you are sexually active and want to be tested for STDs there is nothin to be embaressed about when it comes to your health this should be a top priority and remember to always practice safe sex or better yet abstinence.
It should.  The HCG hormone is in the blood and urine.

Aphasia, a total or partial loss of the ability to use words, sometimes is quickly and completely cured after a stroke.  Since your case has been for a number of years, it is likely that aggressive therapy is necessary.  To date, treatment is mostly confined to speech therapy which helps to improve reading, writing, and comprehension skills.  Speech pathologists and neurologists would be best trained to help you recover. You should certainly contact a neurologist for more treatment information.  According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, patients tend to recover skills in language comprehension more completely than those skills involving expression.\n\nOn a more global level, there are a number of people who believe neural connections can be re-forged through increased usage.  A number of studies have shown that those who think more or are involved in more intelletually challenging tasks are less at risk for Alzheimer's disease, for example.  This may very well be true for stroke patients.  Keep working hard and seek as much help as you can.  Best of luck.

No, you can't be allergic to heat from a radiator, but you could be allergic to something used on the radiator (such as paint or a cleaning solvent) that is activated when it heats up and releases into the area.\n\nIf not that, radiators have a different effect on the moisture levels in a room than most other forms of heat. You might want to check the humidity levels in your place as high or low levels of moisture in the air can exasperate cold-like symptoms.
Yes it gets bigger even after you give birth. But the down side is, it also gets saggy even when you didn't breastfeed. The constant stretching during pregnancy snapped the elastic band that's keeping those girls perky. I suggest that you get pregnant first then decide if you still need those implants afterwards. It could help :-)
Your body reaches its maturity when you're 18-20 years old, so (since you're 25) your breasts aren't going to get any bigger unless you gain weight or become pregnant. There's surgery too, but I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nAs for the stress, there is no way that anyone's life can be totally stress-free! If you were more specific on what's stressing you out, you might get some helpful answers.
yes. but not that much if you are young and dont smoke. the risk will increase at the ages of 30-35 y/o and if you smoke or have other health conditions. Remember there is a risk for any medication. Consult your doctor to see if you are in a higher risk group. You can go to planned parenthood if you cant afford to pay. They do a lot of service for free. And a lot of people think that all planned parenthood does is abortions but that is not true. So do consult a physician. to decide what is best for you. And also weigh your options. There are a lot of different types of birth control and some may have lower risks than others. also look on the web for more info. Yahoo health, webMD, and planned parenthood are great websites.
for one that works kinda wel,, if you eat healthily( low cal/fat/sugar) afterwards is the SUPER SOUP diet. search for it on the web. its pretty easy and only  takes one to two weeks to lose five or more pounds
try a pinch of nutmeg in what ever child drinks. or bring some rice to boil in water, cool and give the water to the child either will slow the dierrhia. rehydrate and take to doctor
Do NOT, I repeat, DO NOT use a tanning OIL with an SPF of 4.  I learned the hard way that it's for middle-eastern men, not fair-skinned white girls.  An SPF 15 will still allow you to tan.  You can try an SPF 8 spray on if you don't burn easily, but again....don't go for anything lower than that.

Painkillers can become severely habit forming, especially if you have been taking them for an extended period of time. It can be difficult to stop taking them without experiencing physical or psychological withdrawl. There are some things you can do to lessen the effects however.\n\n1.) You might want to consider speaking with your physician if you feel you have a problem, There are several medications that can lessen withdrawl symptoms. But you want to avoid the doctor, so maybe you could try these ideas.\n\n2.) You can try to wean yourself off of the pills slowly, reducing your dosage gradually or increase the time period between doses. This will be a process that takes place over time. You will still have to take the pills, and it could be a while before you get off of them, but you won't crack up from withdrawl!\n\n3.) You may want to consider meditation or other pain management techniques to reduce your dependence on painkillers and increase your willpower. \n\n4.) You could try another medication, something to help with calmness or nervousness. There are several herbal remedies you could try. Check out your local GNC for some hep if you want to avoid the doctor.
I make my own now and scent it with my favorite essential oils, but before I started doing that I used to really like Vaseline Intensive Care Moisturizing Bath Oil Beads (Gentle Breeze scent) and it made my skin so silky soft feeling too!
I guess.  because we are always thinking, we are always aware of everything and nothing at the same time, always wanting to make things better, and that makes living in a world of mediocrity an ongoing hell. most of the time Im thinking 2 or 3 things at the same time, its like watching 3 tvs at the same time different channels, so it gets complicated when someone else is talking to me sometimes coz im too distracted. Always aware, always my head saying things, it never shuts up, even when I sleep, I get lucid dreams at least 4 times a week, during that time im aware of been sleeping, my brain wont shut down and I wake up happy for been flying in my dreams but mad about controling them with my awareness, and I just need a rest of my brain but dont know how. This has isolated me from alot of people that get frustrated when they talk to me and I dont pay attention or I am but also thinking of 2 other things its hard. its hard to focuse, it takes me a long time to start reading because I just have to much in my mind, I need a brake!! from my head... I speak my mind and that gets my in trouble too.
Before you do surgery, try a chiropractor or massage therapist.  The chiropractor may find that your spine is out of alignment, which is putting strain on the hip.  Or a massage therapist may discover that the muscles are in spasm, or have trigger points, which they can help you with.  I have a bad hip from when I was pregnant, and both have helped me.  Also, both a chiropractor and a massge therapist can give you stretches to help prevent it from happening again, or at least not as much.\n\nBlessed be\n\ngypsy
That wan't a bad dream so you can wake up now.
Lots of saline nasal spray, like Ocean brand. You may be too dry to let things drain. Also try breathing in steam through the nose or use humidifier.  \nOn the other hand, if you have lots of drainage try Sudafed Non-Drying. For the headache part if severe, try Motin/Advil.  A warm towel from the microwave may help any facial pain.  Drinks LOTS of water and be stingy on the amount of dairy, as dairy thinkens the mucus. And sleep on 2 pillows and that may keep you from getting too blocked up.  Good Luck to you! :) I hope you feel better real soon!
"The story of enzymes is as fascinating in its details as it is amazing in its applications in promoting human health and wellbeing. Enzymes are proteins that are an integral part of Nature. In fact, life without enzymes would not be possible. Enzymes are needed for each and every chemical reaction that make life possible. No vitamin, mineral or hormone can exert its beneficial effects in the human body without the involvement of enzymes. Despite their central role in all bodily functions, it is only now that the full import of enzymes in human health and disease has begun to be fully appreciated. MUCOS Pharma, the pioneer in systemic enzyme therapy, has been the standard bearer for the last fifty years in having paved the way to elucidate the function of enzymes, and their use as an oral systemic therapy.\n\nFunctions of Enzymes\n\nSince they have unique structure, each enzyme is meant to carry out a specific task. Any given enzyme is evolved to fulfill a definite function, and this specificity allows the body to strictly control the use of enzymes. Once activated, an enzyme will perform its specific function until it is ""exhausted,"" or it is inhibited by another enzyme, in which case its activity is curtailed and/or stopped. As researchers have found out after years of painstaking and laborious work, there is a good reason for this control: It prevents bodily processes from spinning out of control, which may be deleterious to health and wellbeing.\n\nEven casually, the specificity of enzymes suggests that there will be particular types. In fact, Nature has ""engineered"" families of enzymes for specific tasks. One of the most beneficial and abundant classes of enzymes is referred to as proteolytic enzymes. Enzymes in this category have the ability to ""nibble"" at other proteins, and break them down into smaller chains of amino acids. Hence the name, proteolytic enzymes, which literally means ""chewing up proteins.""\n\nOn the surface, it might appear counterintuitive to degrade proteins in the body. Are proteins not required for optimal cellular function, and do they not afford good health and vibrancy well into the golden years? Indeed, they do! In disease, however, the human body produces proteins that could potentially have injurious effects, and further compromise health if left unattended. It was precisely this goal that Drs. Max Wolf and Helen Benitez set themselves roughly one-half a century ago when they started their quest to find a wholesome, effective and safe alternative for human health and wellbeing. Of course, their objective was to understand how c comes about and whether natural alternatives could be designed that will not wreak havoc on the human body as radiation and chemotherapy do. Despite their scientific astuteness, little did Drs. Wolf and Benitez anticipate that their systemic enzymes will afford man immense health benefits, irrespective of whether or not systemic enzymes ""cured"" c.\n\nDrs. Wolf and Benitez, along with Dr. Karl Ransberger, a young biomedical researcher from Germany, tested a large number of enzymes from animal and plant sources. The work was slow, and it progressed in fits and starts, since the researchers had to optimize the conditions to isolate and purify the enzymes. Not only that, they had to struggle to maintain the activity of the enzymes, because the enzymes are notorious for being finicky and unstable. That is, if the enzymes are not handled properly under precisely defined condition, they become inactive. After all, the researchers were working in the 1950s, a time when the basic enzyme technology was still in its infancy, and individual scientists had to rely more on their wits than technology to tweak answers from Nature.\n\nOnce Drs. Wolf and Benitez had optimized the conditions necessary to maintain the enzyme activity, they started the next part of their work to combine and evaluate various enzyme formulations in assessing th"
Go get an independent consult with an orthopedic  or sports med doctor.   These docs are youth oriented, and they want you to be able to be as active as you want to be. I'm only a RN, but I beg to differ with the VA. Favoring one side while walking with a cane over a protracted period of time, would put a strain on L4-5.
Nothing. Most people skip beats or have extra beats in the form of PVC's all the time, but we never notice it. It's just the way it works. If you've had the tests you listed and the doctor didn't find any anomolies then I wouldn't worry about it.

"The word ""schizophrenia"" is simply a label used to categorise a list of psychosocial traits that Psychiatry considers to be improper or abnormal in society. Psychiatry defines these traits as a ""mental illness"", and promotes it as a ""disease"" that requires ""treatment"".\n\nIt is not a ""disease"", despite claims made in certain peoples answers here. There is NO credible scientific evidence that shows the existence of what constitutes ""schizophrenia"" as a biological/neurological disorder, brain abnormality or ""chemical imbalance"".\n\n""For a disease to exist there must be a tangible, objective physical abnormality that can be determined by a test such as, but not limited to, blood or urine test, X-Ray, brain scan or biopsy. All reputable doctors would agree: No physical abnormality, no disease. In psychiatry, no test or brain scan exists to prove that a 'mental disorder' is a physical disease. Disingenuous comparisons between physical and mental illness and medicine are simply part of psychiatry's orchestrated but fraudulent public relations and marketing campaign."" Fred A. Baughman Jr., MD (Neurologist, Pediatric Neurology), & Fellow at the American Academy of Neurology.\n\n""Chemical imbalance…it’s a shorthand term really, it’s probably drug industry derived… We don’t have tests because to do it, you’d probably have to take a chunk of brain out of someone - not a good idea."" Dr. Mark Graff, Chair of the Committee of Public Affairs for the American Psychiatric Association. July, 2005.\n\nSymptoms that psychiatry labels as ""schizophrenia"" (or it's related disorders), can stem from any number of variable sources. Many people have overcome disorders such as ""bipolar"" and ""schizophrenia"" through effective megavitamin therapy and effective nutrition. A growing wealth of evidence supports that underlying nutritional deficiencies can cause even the most severe mental disorders, including ""schizophrenia"". [1,2,3,4,5,6] \n\nYou may also be interested to know that the work undertaken by pioneers such as Dr. Lars Martensson and the late Dr. Loren Mosher show that there is also another way - far safer and more effective than psychiatric restraint, drugs and electro-shocks. For over a decade Loren R Mosher, MD, held a central position in American psychiatric research. He was the first Chief of the Center for Studies of Schizophrenia at the National Institute of Mental Health, 1969-1980. He founded the Schizophrenia Bulletin and for ten years he was its Editor-in-Chief. He also led the Soteria Project, which demonstrated that effective rehabilitation is possible without harmful antipsychotic drugs. Soteria provided a safe and sane environment where schizophrenic patients could stay, medication-free, with a young, nonprofessional staff trained to listen to and understand them and provide companionship. The idea was that schizophrenia can often be overcome with the help of meaningful relationships, rather than with drugs, and that such treatment would eventually lead to unquestionably healthier lives. The results were fantastic. Over just 6 weeks, patients recovered as quickly as those treated with medication in hospitals. [7,8] \n\nBottom line? Psychiatry is a belief-system, a ""faith"", not a science. Despite the huge marketing strategies, the so-called ""research"" and all the propaganda thrown at the world, there is not one iota of scientific evidence that proves that ""schizophrenia"" or ANY mental illness, in fact, exists as an actual --medical disease--.\n\nIf you have been told differently then know this: You have been lied to.\n\nFor more information, please visit:\n\nhttp://groups.msn.com/psychbusters\nDecoding Psychiatric Propaganda\n\nSee also http://www.alternativementalhealth.com/articles/default.htm#S\nand http://www.webcom.com/thrive/schizo/"

breathe in sharply, and swallow air, it works for me!!
Depends on the person.\n\nTypically it's no more than just a few teaspoons.  \n\nIf it's a lot more than that, you may need to see your doctor.

Odd, because Wellbutrin is well known for its lesser tendency to have sexual side effects. Perhaps your dosage wasn't sufficient enough to control the depression (which, in turn, would have a significant effect on sexual function).\n\nStill, it is true that you need to find the right one that works for you. Just remember to make sure your doctor knows the effectiveness and side effects of your medications so he can work with you.

A That drooling can have several causes, and excessive drooling even has a medical name: ``sialorrhea.''\n\nWe actually make more saliva during the day, but we also swallow more often when awake. In most adults, both saliva production and swallowing slow during sleep, and drooling does not become a major problem, says Dr. John Winkelman, associate director of the Sleep Disorders Service at Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\nSeveral things can cause nighttime drooling. Some medications increase saliva production. Your sleep posture can also contribute. When you lie on your back, saliva pools in the back of the throat and often causes a swallowing reflex that prevents drooling. But when you lie on your side, saliva can pool in your cheek -- or flow onto your pillow.\n\nYou're also more likely to drool if you breathe through your mouth instead of your nose. That happens to people with colds, or those with a deviated septum who must keep their mouths open to get enough air.\n\n``In general,'' says Winkelman, ``drooling is not a problem and people don't need treatment -- although they may have to change pillowcases in the middle of the night.''\n\nOccasionally, excessive drooling can result in breathing saliva into the lungs. This can be dangerous, since saliva contains much of the bacteria found in the mouth, and can cause repeated bouts of pneumonia. In this case, treatment to stop the drooling may be necessary, says Winkelman. Drugs can cut the flow of saliva. Allergies or nasal obstructions that cause people to sleep with their mouth open can also be treated.\n\nBut in general, drooling is nothing to lose sleep over.

I will tell you right now I have the cure for psoriasis and my wife figured it out! I will even send you pics to back it up. Guess yet? Tanning salon...yes I'm serious. My wife had is so bad that it covered 50% of her whole body (she tried everything!!!) and she started going to the tanning salon to build her tan so she could go swimming in the pool come summer and after 3 weeks of going 3 times a week for ten to fifteen minutes at a time you couldn't hardly see it anymore. I was amazed! Now you can't see any trace of it at all. Her mom was the same way. She asked a doctor and said that they use a somewhat similar treatment called light therapy. If your's is the kind that gets a little better in summer (if you go out) then this should help. Don't over do it cause tanning salons can be bad if you do too much and let the employees guide you into builing your tan slowly. My wife is going to be so happy I shared this with you. If it works then look me up and answer one of my current questions at the time with your story. GOOD LUCK!!!

this is not rare to occur...coz it takes time for sensation to recover and so the patient my not even realise that he has bit his tongue, cheeks or lips...\nthe only possible precaution is that the docs need to inform the patient to consciously avoid doing that or ask the relatives to take care wen it is a child patient. so it also depends on the age of your niece.\nwhile inserting the tube, they shud hold the tongue and retract the lips and cheeks in such a case.\nbut still with all such precautions, soft tissue bites are quite common after oral surgeries especially under local anaesthesia.

"Cholesterol is a certain lipid used for various causes in the organism: it is a major constituent of membranes, a precursor of bile acids, steroid hormones etc. \nThe terms ""bad"" and ""good"" cholesterol reffer not to cholesterol itself ('cause chemically it is all the same), but the vehicles by which it is transported in the blood stream. The are two major types of cholesterol vehicles: LDL (low density lipoproteins) and HDL (high density lipoproteins). HDL transport cholesterol from organs and tissues to the liver, which excrets it. Therefore, higher levels of HDL are ""good"", since they help to get rid of excess cholesterol. LDL, on the other hand, transport cholesterol from the liver to various organs and tissues. Of course, it is a necessary function, but if there's too much LDL, it is ""bad"", since, simply speaking, it packs vascular walls with cholesterol, which ultimately leads to cardiovascular diseases. \nIt is not quite clear whether cholesterol rich foods really increase the ""bad"" LDL levels. However, it is very likely that if you eat oatmeal instead of a ribeye steak, your bad cholesterol levels will go down, since plant-derived products do NOT contain cholesterol. Cholesterol is found only in animal products (meat, eggs, dairy)."

Yes, I have vaginismus and am working on correcting it now. It is a condition where the the entry to the vagina tightens and causes pain when anything enters or touches it. I am still learning about it but I do know that it's only PARTLY psychological. My OB told me that its an actual condition. First and foremost if you speculate that your gf has this condition, do NOT have intercourse. It will make it worse! Second, she needs to see her OB. He will definitely be able to help. Mine prescribed lidocaine (which is a cream that numbs the skin) for me to use on myself. He said it is fixable but takes patience and work. He told me it could be up to 6 months before we have intercourse again. \nMy advice to you would be to 1. Be patient, supportive, and understanding with her. It is extremely painful. So it's understand not to want to have sex, or even look forward to it.\nI hope I helped!

Are you talking personal medical problems, or the ones asked in Yahoo answers?  Obviously, you can take yourself out of the yahoo link if these are the medical problems you are asking about.\n\nI pressume the problems actually are yours personally, or belong to a friend or family member....correct?  The answer is you have to deal with life good and bad, because the alternative is death.  Waking up each day is the first hurdle for everyone.  After waking up, we have a whole day of opportunies, some we make for ourselves and some life will hand to us whether we want them or not.  The opportunity may seem and act like a whammy, but we still have to get through it/them the best we can, go to sleep, wake up and start a new day.  Like I said, the other choice is death and for most of us, this is a definate,  unacceptable choice....at least for today.  Sometimes the best we can do is take one day at a time, or one hour at a time, or one moment at a time, get through it and face the next.
boxers are like short, just a lot lighter.  Briefs snuggles your groin and keeps everything in place.  there is no real determination to what to wear but it's just a preference.  However, I have known doctors to ask couples for the guy to wear boxers if they are planning to have a baby. It's a lot easier for the penis to breath.  But it's not required, just a suggestion.
there is nothing wrong in letting your child eat mcdonalds on occassion. let your child be a child as far as stuff like this goes.\nmy son has IBS and that is why antidepressants didnt work for him as IBS is linked to the lack of a certain enyme in the gut that regulates the serretonin in the brain.\njust with diet alone we have almost eliminated his outbursts. no more medication for my son! lactose intolerent was a problem for my son in the beginning. we tried otc chewables for a while. that seems to reverse his type of IBS into constipation type IBS. I would take him off the enzymes for the ibs and just watch his diet. but please at least once a week, if its mcdonalds or a small bag of skittles, let him indulge.

I have a friend who is having it done Monday and was told she would be off work for 4 to6 weeks.
i see this question daily .. you cannot change the size .. just learn to use what you do have
They all have vitamins.
A good punch is a full body movement. A powerful punch comes more from your legs, shoulders, and stomach, than from your arms.  Get a heavy bag, and just work on punch combos for a week or two.  Don't go full force, because if you haven't done much boxing your wrists won't be able to handle the stress at first.  Do lots of push ups and sit-ups.  Doing push ups on your knuckles will also help get your wrists stronger.  Once you have some speed, then start working on adding power.  A jab is to stun, and its just a quick hit.  When you want to do damage you want to use more weight, and drive the punch into them for optimal damage.\n\nDo like a right jab, left cross, right power, solid left to the body, then a power right to the stomach, as they hunch down from having the wind knocked out of them, just give them a right cross from your elbow. Boom, fights over in about a second flat.\n\nReally tho, fighting should always be the last option.  If you are an experienced fighter, you can do lots of damage with a single blow.  Fights rarely last anywhere near as long as they last in movies, or boxing.  A single solid un-gloved hit to the head will end most fights.... One good hit can cause... Detached retina, broken nose, broken teeth, lockjaw, and even damaged hearing.
sounds like swollen lymph glands get checked if it happens often
Before you engage in any type of sexual activity.
The largest erect member in medical literature would be the 14-inch organ mentioned by Dr. David Reuben in his book Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (1969). Reuben didn’t divulge any source for this figure, and there was no independent verification, so you may question his accuracy. The largest medically verified penis on record is 13.5 inches long and 6.25 inches around, documented in the early twentieth century by Dr. Robert L. Dickinson. Other sources (Alfred Kinsey, Masters and Johnson, etc.) mention specimens ranging from 9.5 to 12 inches.\n\nThen there are the dubious claims of immense penis size by various personages operating within the sex industry (read: porn actors). These claims are almost invariably false, the result of exaggeration and hype by unscrupulous dealers hoping to hawk more products. Take the legendary Long Dong Silver, for instance. Made famous by the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings, his one enduring trait was his supposedly 18-inch penis. Totally fraudulent, as it turns out; in fact, there are videos in which he appears only normal sized.
"try taboo\nWHAT to eat for losing weight\n\n• Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, especially NC (negative calorie) food.\n\n* Print these lists. They will be your ... ""Bible"", from now on !\n* Dill and parsely - include them in all your salads. Also ognion + garlic.\n* Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits (whenever possible, of course)\n* If you really want a book, then check this out: The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook (Win95/98 only). Read more about this e-book here.\n\n\n• Eat fish, chicken, beef, pork. (preferences are in this order)\n\n* If you are a vegetarian, then ignore this!\n* Avoid fat meat\n\n\n• Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day. Don't EVER exclude bread from your diet!\n\n• Snacks between meals (if needed): apples, oranges, grepfruits and other NC fruits\n\n* Don't cheat ... NO cookies, chips, candies, brownies etc! \n* EVEN if they have ""low fat"" indication... They might have low fat, yet they can have lots of CALORIES !!!\n\n\n• About rice, potatoes, beans, [xxx]nuts, pastry, pasta... you know!\n\n* Don't eat too much of those, at least during the first weeks of the diet. I'm not a low carb addict, but I've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities, especially when associated with other foods.\n* If you like them a lot, try and eat them like one meal. A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch (never dinner!), followed by a nice big apple. These rich starch foods are not good for dinner!\n* At dinner time, chose mainly large mixed veggies salads... with fish, lean meat or cheese (if you are not a vegetarian). \n\nif u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it. no salt no nothing just plain. u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound. i heard that from a weight loss tape. the best drink is water or gatorade. thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo. if u want a macine. run with dumbells on a treadmill. u could do the rocky workout. but thats a new story. u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs\n\n1) It is not just the amount you eat, but what you eat. Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start. And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever.\n\n2) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day. Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for you to feel labored. The other half of the time use weights, or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle ""burn"". A gym is also an option, but I don't know if you have the money for or want to spend the money on it.\n\n3) Sleep well. To bed earlier and up earlier. Exercise in the morning when you wake up, not in the evening before bed. 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must.\n\n4) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time. A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom.\n\nThat is a good place to start... if you see good results, keep it up and modify to fit you... if it does not, see a doctor AND a trainer \n\nKeep working out, drink water a lot, eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities, vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice, fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours, minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important, your last meal must be before you sleep by 2 to 3 hours\nthe most important thing is you don't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what you want\n\nyou might have some more ideas from www.ivillage.com\n\ngood luck"
Sounds like she's a psycho of some sort. Tell your son to talk to her about it and straighten things out. Also suggest to him to dump her.. before it gets too serious between them.
Vaginal yeast infections are caused by Candida albicans, which, along with a few types of bacteria, are normally present in relatively small numbers in your crotch. sometimes the yeast multiply rapidly and take over, causing a full-fledged yeast infection, or, in the heart-warming terminology of the medical establishment, candidiasis or monilia. this can be due to a change in the vaginal environment, injury, sexual transmission, or HIV. common environmental disruptions that favor yeast include increased pH, increased heat and moisture, allergic reactions, elevated sugar levels, hormonal fluxes, and reductions in the populations of bacteria that are normally present. \n\nSome infections flourish in non-cotton, tight, or dirty clothes that trap heat and moisture. \nyour safest bet is unbleached, undyed cotton underwear and breathable clothes. it's a good idea to change your underpants regularly, like maybe once a day. if at all possible, don't sleep in underwear; if you do, put on clean stuff. yeast can live in your underwear, so be sure to wash it well, particularly during and after a yeast infection. some medical types think that when you have a yeast infection, you should wash and dry your underwear and then iron it or throw it in the microwave on high for 5 min to kill the yeast. \n\nchemicals, such as inks, dyes, and perfumes, can upset the balance in your crotch or trigger allergic reactions that lead to yeast infections. the classic example is commercial douches, which have no benefits and are definitely harmful to the vaginal environment and your health. \n\n  condoms can promote yeast infections in two different ways. first, a lot of condoms come packaged with a lubricant that contains nonoxynol-9, a spermicide that may kill the HIV virus. several recent studies have shown that nonoxynol-9 is linked to yeast infections. if you suspect this is your problem, try using a condom that doesn't have a spermicidal lubricant, and use a different spermicide or additional barrier protection. condoms can also cause yeast infections if you are allergic to latex, although this is less common. if this is the case, don't give up hope on practicing safer sex. you may want to try some of the newer plastic (polyurethane) condoms for boys or girls. \n\nHormones, both naturally-occurring and artificially introduced, can affect yeast. for example, pregnant women are particularly prone to yeast infections. many women taking contraceptive pills experience regular yeast infections as their hormone levels fluctuate\n\nSymptoms:\nFeels like an intense itching, burning sensation, localized in your vagina and vulva. this itching is not always present, but can get really bad, so bad you can hardly walk, let alone ride your bike to the pharmacy or doctor to get it treated. \n\nsmells like bread or beer. in fact, it smells pretty much exactly like yeast, although the yeast used in brewing and baking is an entirely different species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). no bacteria could smell like that, so it's a great diagnostic. \n\nMonistat has a purportedly 1-day treatment called Monistat-1. the active ingredient is tioconazole, a scary-powerful antifungal drug. \n\nI hope this helps! Let me know!
Definitely see the Dr. but also drink cranberry juice, and lots & lots of water and tea to flush it out. There are also cranberry supplements in pill form. Yogurt too,(acidopholus)
Just take them to a pharmacy and ask the pharmacist. That would be the easiest way.
my brother got it removed when he was younger.It was with full anaesthesia so he didn't know during the surgery of course. It hurt for a while later. What I remember the most is he got to eat icecream for a week later!
I believe you mean pneumonia. I had  an encounter with walking pneumonia myself 5 years ago and know what you might be experiencing. I am not a DR nor RN and don't know how bad yours was but,can tell you that with my experience it takes time to heal. One of the best advices that I can give you is to follow up with all of your DR's appointments. Make sure you take and complete all medications that you were given and try to get as much rest a possible. I suggest that you keep your environment as dust free as possible for this can cause difficulty with breathing. I am not sure if you have any chronic respiatory diseases such a asthma which I have, this could also cause you to still have trouble inhaling. Your lungs are being over worked if you do have a respiatory illness which can cause a delay in healing due to a suppressed imune system.\nIf you continue to experince difficulty breathing I suggest you inform you DR right away just incase you have developed a secondary infection. \nHope you feel better and get lots of rest!
Good question, I think.  Nicotine is a physically addictive drug that acts as an euphoric and vasal-constrictor.  It can raise your blood pressure.  Tobacco also has tar and burning the leaves, burning ANYTHING gives off carbon monoxide.  Tar sticks to your lungs and gets in your blood.  It can cause body cells to turn into cancer cells.  Carbon monoxide makes it hard for your blood to carry oxygen.  So.... smoking the leaves is still dangerous.  Sorry.
"Greetings.\n\nIt's all in ""how you use it"", not ""how big it is"".\nIt's all in what you do to your partner to make her feel aroused and supply her pleasure. Learn what turns her on, besides your ding-dong and combine penetration with touching, caressing, kissing."
Nope!
about 110-125 lbs!
Just tell her it's not very nice. Don't put her down she already knows about her weight issue and doesn't feel good about herself, that is why she is getting her pleasure from other peoples pain. In some strange way, she feels better about herself when she points out someone elses flaws. It is a touchy situation, maybe the two of you could come up with things to do that involve more physical activity so that she may start shedding some of her extra pounds and feel better about herself. She really is sufferring, with low self esteem and self confidence. She needs to realize that she is worth more than her weight.
"Most of the ""dust"" in a house is dead skin cells that the family is constantly losing.  And nearly all of the ""dirt"" in your bed and on your pillow is the same stuff.  So...it's only as harmful to you today as it has been the rest of your life."
its the feelin of not being hungry.\nthe severe form is anorexia nervosa...wen people intentionally throw up wat they have eaten to avoid puttin on weight.
There are mostly capilaries, the small blood vessels.
a hicky is caused by sucking, the blood raises to the surface of the skin, which causes the skin to look bruised and discolored. There are rumors that you could possibly get tumors or blood clots from this however there is no need to worry because they cannot cause cancer. cancer is a disease, it is caused by low production of white blood cells that help your body fight of infections and bacteria. Most people who have cancer die because of some other illness before they die of the actual cancer itself. So you see it may be quite impossible for a hickey to change the white blood cell count in your body.....

depedning on your living conditions and work conditions what you breathe in. people who work in coal mines, factorys and weld get a lot of gunk in their lungs. There is a disease called pulmonary fibrosis. this is irreversable I am more familar with black lung due to the area I grew up in and work in. My father had black lung, you can wear special respirator masks while you are around what ever the fiber etc is you are being exposed to. you need to go to a pumonologist for the proper test and management of the problem
You can use Peroxide and baking soda found in your house w/ a bit of salt. It tastes gross, don't swallow it...but it works well and is affordable. Make sure the Peroxide hasn't expired and that the baking soda is fresh and not out of the box that has been in the back of your refrigerator for a few years.
"This is more of a medical question which only your doctor can answer.  Personally, my problem was sleep apnia.  I was unaware that I was awakening every few minutes.  They discovered this at a sleep clinic, and I now use what they call a ""CPAP"" machine when I sleep.  I now sleep very well and do not need as much sleep as I had thought."
Absolutely!  You may even find that it takes your mind off your cramps.
Fibromyalgia.
Do you tend to rest your head in your hands?  Lean on one arm and then the other while sitting?  Lean your elbows on the armrests in your vehicle?  How about reading/doing homework while stretched out on the floor, leaning on  your elbows?\n\nNot all hand numbness indicates carpal tunnel syndrome.  What you describe is a common experience for freelance writers like myself.  We tend to suffer pinched nerves in our elbows, which demonstrate numbness in the pinky fingers, then heels of the hand (the portion of hand under the pinky to the wrist), then up the bottom part of the forearm.  As the nerve becomes more and more pinched, more fingers, hand portions and forearm become affected.\n\nI suggest you first notice what you're doing with your arms.  Refrain from leaning whenever you notice you do so.  The physical therapy other writers and I have been assigned to relieve such numbness is simple:\n\n1.  While standing with your feet hip-width apart, slightly tuck pelvis (tighen tummy to support lower back), stretch top-back of head toward the ceiling (slightly jut out chin, then lower chin to feel the strectch in the spine), roll shoulders up, back, down (breast-bone will feel lifted) and hold position.\n\n2.  While arms are at sides, turn out affected arm's hand, slowly raise up arm, bend foream down so elbow is pointing at ceiling and hand points down back.\n\n3.  With the opposite hand, pull raised elbow behind head (your head may slightly move ahead as you do this).\n\n4.  Repeat on other side if necessary.\n\nNext, while standing with both arms down in that beginning position; \n\n1.  Raise affected arm straight out to the side.\n\n2.  Slowly, without turning torso, move arm across chest so the fingers point to opposite side (if you are tight in the shoulders, you may not be able to get your arm to go very far...not a problem).\n\n3.  With the opposite hand, pull raised arm into chest.\n\n4.  Repeat on opposite side as needed.\n\nAt night, notice whether or not you are sleeping on one side, falling asleep on  your side with one arm under the pillow and your head resting on that side.\n\nIf you are, then do what you can to change up your falling-asleep position for a while.  You may very well wake up in the position you attempted to change, but you will have at least spared your body some crushed nerve time in the process.\n\nTry these exercises for a week or so.  Take anti-imflammatory ibuprofen.  If you still do not experience any relief, then visit your doctor.

this depends. If he has entered puberty then it is perfectly normal. People start puberty at all different ages and everyone starts mas*erba*ion at puberty. \nIf he has not entered puberty then it might be a little to young.........it might hurt his reproductive system.

Also, not measuring liquid laundry rinse does the same.
If you take a really strong and careful interest in things, and associate new information with experiences and ideas that you're well-versed-in, that should help a lot. In my experience, it's often a matter of convincing yourself to care more deeply about whatever information is coming your way. If you approach new facts with the attitude of intensity and (reasonable) amazement, stuff just tends to stick.
"Surprisingly, it was started as a 'mom-and-pop' family practice by Dr. William Worrall Mayo and his two sons in the late 1800s.  In fact, Dr. William Mayo, Jr. said ""We came along in medicine like farm boys do on a farm.""  And to think their clinic would become one of the most prestigious medical centers in the world a century later.  Pretty amazing."

If your bother comes during the daily urination act too, it will probably be an infection of the urethra. \nOn the contrary, it could be a Prostate inflammation or a shorter “Frenulum” even.\n[The prepuce is usually tethered at the bottom by the frenulum] \nAt last, we should consider the vagina environment too, whose infection or acidity could be another cause.
Go to the local VA hoispital or clinic in your town. You will need Your fathers DD214 to prove his time in service. If you do not have this you can have hime order one off the web just search under dd214. If he need care now he can go to ANY hospital and the are required to stabilize his health. Also try and hae them apply for medicad in your state. Many Hospitals ( not for profit) have clinics that work on a sliding scale as do many counties

This could be a number of things, depending on your age, weight, and activity level.  Somebody who is older may experience a condition where the cartilage that surrounds bones that make up the joint begins to wear down over time and bone begins to rub on bone.  Another possibility is a meniscal injury that can result from a twisting motion while weight bearing.  Often times people complain of locking, clicking, or pain with going up or down stairs.  Patellar tendinitis can affect any age, but is commonly found in active individuals that are involved with jumping sports, but can also be found with any activity where there is a lot of motion at the knee joint and flexibility is an issue.  Osgood Schlatters affects youth and is a condition where the patellar tendon begins to pull the immature bone away from the tibia where it is attached.  Gosh, this list could go on and on, from knee cap abnormalities to ligament damage.  The best thing is to go and see your doctor.  GOod luck.
Sets are made up by a certain number of reps (repetitions) One rep means you do said movement one time.  Two reps means you do said movement two times.  2 sets means you do the number of reps two times with a break between each set.\nSo 3sets of 5reps = 15 said movements.

I have 3 sisters and 3 brothers.  There is a difference of 7 years between the youngest one and the oldest one.  Yes, every single one of my siblings have aggravated me at one point or another in my life.  To think of it, so have my parents, my husband, my friends, my child, the lady that drove to slow today, the man had too many items in the express lane, and the salesperson that had to tell me the style I wanted was sold out.  Lots of people and things have aggravated me.  You learn to deal with it as you get older.  Smile and realize that in the end you are responsbile for your emotions and thoughts.
inflamation and/or physical impingement of nerve(s) as they come out of your spine - likely involving the sciatic nerve.  I'd go see a legit healthcare provider and keep a dated log of the symptoms progression for future reference.  Good luck.
I use to have the same problem... just do crunches and situps... but also match it with a good diet... it would tone your body well... also drink tons of water... but yeah... crunches are the best as because you can do it for a long time. Also if you can try situps.
it could be but didnt the hospital elaborate a bit more about the diagnosis,anyway i hope he gets better soon im sure he will.

"Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) is an inherited metabolic disorder, that, if untreated, causes mental retardation, physical disabilities and death.  First described as a disease in 1954, it is a rare disorder, believed to be in all ethnic groups worldwide.  The national incidence is 1 in 225,000 births.  \n\nMSUD derives its name from the sweet, burnt sugar, or maple syrup smell of the urine.  The disorder affects the way the body metabolizes (processes) certain components of protein.  Amino acids accumulate in the blood causing a toxic effect that interferes with brain functions.  The symptoms of classic MSUD are usually evident within the first week of life. The first symptoms in an infant are poor appetite, irritability, and the characteristic odor of the urine.  Within days they lose their sucking reflex and grow listless, have a high-pitched cry, and become limp with episodes of rigidity.  Without diagnosis and treatment, symptoms progress rapidly to seizures, coma, and death.  In some variant types, failure to thrive may be the first sign.  The earlier these children are diagnosed and treated, the less risk of permanent damage.\n\nTreatment of children with MSUD must be started as soon as possible, preferably at birth.  It involves a complex approach of maintaining metabolic control.  A special, carefully controlled diet is the focus of daily treatment.  This requires careful monitoring of protein intake and close medical supervision.  The diet centers around a synthetic formula  or ""medical food"" which  provides nutrients and all the amino acids except leucine, isoleucine and valine.  These three amino acids are added to the diet with carefully controlled amounts of food  to provide the protein necessary for normal growth and development without exceeding the level of tolerance.  \nVarious tests are available to monitor the levels of the amino acids and their keto acid derivatives in the blood and urine.  Illnesses and stress, as well as consuming too much protein, raise these levels.  Even mild illnesses can become life‑threatening.  A metabolic imbalance requires dietary changes and at times hospitalization."
I had a lot of difficult issues to deal with.  One thing that helped a LOT was journalling about them, then analyzing what I wrote to identify the key emotions that were triggered...(fear, helplessness...etc)  I wrote those emotions on pieces of wood (like flat paint sticks), then ritually burned them in a bonfire.\n\nBelieve it or not, it helped...a LOT.  Not that I am no longer plagued by those emotions, whenever they start back up, I imagine the fire, and watching those emotions burn up and float away as smoke.\n\nOther people have done similar things, such as writing the emotions/feelings on a stone, and throwing it into a deep body of water....anything that helps you physically release them is the key, I think.
What Is Tubal Ligation?\nA tubal ligation is a simple operation to block off the fallopian tubes that lead from the ovaries to the womb and thereby prevent a woman from getting pregnant. The fallopian tubes are like two long, straight pieces of macaroni that let the sperm reach the egg and fertilize it, and then provide a passage for the fertilized egg to go back to the womb and grow into a baby. \n\nPeople commonly refer to this operation as having your tubes tied, but the tubes are not tied in a knot. In some types of tubal ligation, sutures are tied round the tube to pinch it off and this is likely why the operation has become to be known as “having your tubes tied”.
Are you starving yourself? (Judging by your other posts.) Then your stomach must be growling for food.
Burn sodium?  I'm guessing you mean get rid of it.  There isn't necessarily a way to get it out of the body, but if you drink plenty amounts of water it will dillute the salt in the cells of your body.  This is the basic principle of osmosis.  The more water you drink the more diluted the cells will be.
This is kind of funny but I answered the same question for my female friend less then two days ago because she had the same issue, same problem! I researched it for her as a medic that likes to study gyn and here's your answer: The surge of hormones in your body causes your endometrium (lining of the uterus) to become extremely thick and then fissure and crack (so to speak) at your fourth week and then to fold and flush out of your body(menses). When you take the pill it enforces a state of pregnancy on the body and causes your endometrium to thicken and stay thickened so that you cannot become pregnant because your body already thinks that it is. So when your on it for three days or more esp. right after your period your endometrium starts to thicken again rapidly due to the surge of hormones the pill is providing, but then you suddenly come off and your body is like what the hec!?! I need to flush my lining again but it's not thick enough for a complete mense so it just releases the little that it's built up by infrequent spotting till the lining goes back to ex nhilo, or the beginning of a fresh cycle. So it's really nothing to worry about at all unless you starting cramping terribly and have spotting into the two week range. Then you should see your gyno. I hope I covered everything if I missed something post an additional detail and I'll do my best to answer it.

I get botox in my masseter (jaw) muscles for spasms related to possible ALS.  The shots help alot and are not big.  Because of the constant spams, it can hurt a little, but the relief (which lasts for a few months and starts within a few weeks of the shot) is definitely worth it!\nGood luck! And don't be scared.
"Did he check the TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone), which is a pituitary hormone which stimulates the thyroid??  The usual cause of hyperthyroidism is a diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland.  You have high thyroxin (T4) and low TSH (the high T4 causes feedback inhibition on the anterior pituitary gland, and lowers the TSH).  In fact, the TSH is often a more sensitive test for Graves disease than the T4. Sometimes your T4 will be in normal range, but if you got a low TSH, you probably got hyperthyroidism.  Also, your eyes may look a little bulging. Rapid pulse, heat intolerance, fine tremor, losing weight, sure---irregular periods, all can be signs of hyperthyroidism.  You expect the person to be a little manic and skinny, but there is an ""apathetic hyperthyroidism"", where they get kind of burned out on the high hormone, and start to put weight back on and look depressed.  Of course, if you got a very high TSH and a high T4, then it means you got a little tumour of your anterior pituitary gland causing the high thyroid, and sometimes other hormone imbalances as well.\n\nAn endocrinologist is the expert.  There are lots of subtleties to this I'm not totally aware of.  But i'm thinking you might still have hyperthyroidism and need treatment with PTL (propylthiouracil) at least, if not radioactive iodine ablation therapy or surgical subtotal thyroidectomy, which are the treatment options.  I would get a thyroid scan.  That tells you more.  Otherwise, see an endocrinologist.  Also, if you have been on any meds or drugs, this can effect your thyroid function.  Lithium, used to treat bipolar disorder, certainly messes with the thyroid.  I believe depression can affect it as well.  So can alcoholism."

Women CAN react much differently to cardiac problems than men, although they can also have the classic symptoms.  Often during an M.I, a woman may feel abdominal pain or lower back pain. She may also feel a sudden on set of exhaustion.  Radiating pain to the left arm and jaw as well as chest pressure are classic symptoms that men and women should pay attention to.  I mentioned in another answer at another time that a male friend of mine was having (L) shoulder pain when he was in fact having a M.I. \n\nMy answer is that if the question of a possible M.I. crosses your mind during discomfort/pain....get checked out.  Also, in terms of an M.I., chest PRESSURE is treated as chest pain.....

LUNG CANCER\nLung cancer is a malignant tumour of the lungs. Most commonly it is bronchogenic carcinoma (about 90%). Lung cancer is the most lethal malignant tumour worldwide, causing up to 3 million deaths annually. Only one in ten patients diagnosed with this disease will survive the next five years. Although lung cancer was previously an illness that affected predominately men, the lung cancer rate for women has been increasing in the last few decades, which has been attributed to the rising ratio of female to male smokers.\n\n \nThe incidence of lung cancer is highly correlated with smoking. The above is an illustration for the United States incidence of lung cancer.Current research indicates that the factor with the greatest impact on risk of lung cancer is long-term exposure to inhaled carcinogens. The most common means of such exposure is tobacco smoke.\n\nTreatment and prognosis depend upon the histological type of cancer and the stage (degree of spread). Possible treatment modalities include surgery, chemotherapy\n\n\nSigns and symptoms\nSymptoms that suggest lung cancer include:\n\ndyspnea (shortness of breath) \nhemoptysis (coughing up blood) \nchronic cough \nwheezing \nchest pain \ncachexia (weight loss), fatigue and loss of appetite \ndysphonia (hoarse voice) \nclubbing of the fingernails (uncommon) \nIf the cancer grows into the lumen it may obstruct the airway, causing breathing difficulties. This can lead to accumulation of secretions behind the blockage, predisposing the patient to pneumonia.\n\nMany lung cancers have a rich blood supply. The surface of the cancer may be fragile, leading to bleeding from the cancer into the airway. This blood may subsequently be coughed up.\n\nDepending on the type of tumor, so-called paraneoplastic phenomena may initially attract attention to the disease. In lung cancer, this may be Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (muscle weakness due to auto-antibodies), hypercalcemia and SIADH. Tumors in the top (apex) of the lung, known as Pancoast tumors, may invade the local part of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to changed sweating patterns and eye muscle problems (a combination known as Horner's syndrome), as well as muscle weakness in the hands due to invasion of the brachial plexus.\n\nIn many patients, the cancer has already spread beyond the original site by the time they have symptoms and seek medical attention. Common sites of metastasis include the bone, such as the spine (causing back pain and occasionally spinal cord compression) and the brain.\n\nTypes\nThere are two main types of lung cancer categorised by the size and appearance of the malignant cells seen by a histopathologist under a microscope: small-cell (roughly 20%) and non-small cell (80%) lung cancer. This classification although based on simple pathomorphological criteria has very important implications for clinical management and prognosis of the disease.\n\n\nCauses\nExposure to carcinogens, such as those present in tobacco smoke, immediately causes cumulative changes to the tissue lining the bronchi of the lungs (the bronchial mucous membrane) and more tissue gets damaged until a tumour develops.\n\nThere are four major causes of lung cancer (and, actually, cancer in general):\n\nCarcinogens such as those in cigarette smoke \nRadiation exposure \nGenetic susceptibility \nViral infection \n\n\nThe role of smoking\nSmoking, particularly of cigarettes, is believed to be by far the main cause of lung cancer, which at least in theory makes it one of the easiest diseases to prevent. In the United States, smoking is estimated to account for 87% of lung cancer cases in the U.S. (90% in men and 79% in women). There are hundreds of known carcinogens—such as polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons—present in cigarette smoke. The length of time a person continues to smoke as well as the amount smoked increases the person's chances of contracting lung cancer. If a person stops smoking, these chances steadil
It sounds like anxiety. Talk to your doctor, nothing to be embarassed about.
Yes, you can be addicted to hurting yourself to receive pain and to making others have pain.  Going to a counslor to get help for it would be a good idea instead of trying to break the habit by yourself.
My experience has been that the growth has slowed down but not altogether.
It's probably a cold sore, if it is, DO NOT KISS ANYBODY! and don't touch it.

Sweating is your body's way of cooling down. If you are sweating alot then your body is heating up. If you start feeling light headed then you might be overdoing it.
Prostitution is the sale of sexual services, such as oral sex or sexual intercourse. A person selling sexual services is a prostitute.\n\nThere are many forms of prostitution. \n\n- Massage parlor prostitution: Sexual services may be offered for an additional tip or they may be requested for additional fees. \n- Bar prostitution: solicitation is done at bars. In some areas may occur in any bar, however, in the U.S. and Canada it is most prevalent in go-go bars or gentlemen's clubs. \n- Brothels: establishments specifically dedicated to prostitution.\n- 'Call Girls' (Call Boys) or escorts: the customer calls an agency and the act takes place at the customer's location. (Usually an hotel room or home) \n- Street prostitution: The prostitute solicits customers while waiting at street corners or walking alongside a street.\n- Truck stop prostitution (lot lizard): A special case of street prostitution where the prostitute mainly services those in the trucking industry at truck stops and stopping centers often using lingo on CD radios to solicit business. \n\nAs a note, although not legally prostitution, many people maintain the belief that a person who engages in sexual activities with another person because they expect to get something out of it, (a ring, nice gifts, a new car, status, a position in a company, etc...) are in fact prostituting themselves and thus are prostitutes. For example, a woman makes sexual advances towards a person at the company for which she works. If he responds, she teases him a little longer until he gets worked up into a sexual frenzy.  Then she offers to help him with his 'troubles' if he can help her get that newly opened position she wants. In the end, he gets what he wants and she does too. The underlying truth is, she had sex for profit. Does that make her a prostitute?
Nope, do you? Love yourself the way that you are.
"Ok to take on your first question first: Ketones are breakdown products of fatty acids. In diabetic people who have low glucose (eg. if you take too much insulin, or a Type 2 diabetic doesnt take their meds) the cells in your body eg.liver and muscle start utilizing other sources of energy. As a result of these ""abnormal"" pathways being activated, fats are broken down into ketones rather than a molecule known as Acetyl CoA. This is a problem because ketones are highly acidic, and their buildup causes a condition known as Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) which can lead to serious consequences if left untreated.\n\nNow, with regards to your second question, I strongly recommend going to your doctor rather than getting info about drugs from the internet. This is because not only are you different, being a diabetic, but you may also have other factors (age, sex, pregnancy, other conditions, genotypic variations) that make you react differently to drugs."

There is no way to lose fat in a certain area. Your stomach muscles along with your lower back muscles and obliques work together like a weight lifter's belt, acting as a slimming corset. If your obliques get huge they will make you look wider. you may or may not be after these love handle muscles. Now to answer your question.\n\nhttp://www.netfit.co.uk/abd6.htm \n\nThe best way to gain strength in the abs according to recent studies which were cited in FitnessRx magazine is to work the abs with heavy weight 3 times a week.  Strong abs, however, are large and undefined like the guys in the World's Strongest Man competition have. Most people don't want that. \n\nIf you are going for looks, getting to the single digits in body fat percentage will automatically give you some visible abs. I'd do that first. \n\nThe best way to gain definition in the abs is to work the abs using an ab routine, going from one exercise to another (without rest time)targeting different parts of the abs. Abs are unique muscles in the fact that they benefit from being worked daily. You can do your ab routine every day.\n\nMy ab routine consists of 15 exercises, 16 reps each (12 reps for beginners), and takes me about 10-15 minutes. The reps are done about 2 seconds per rep. If you do them right, you should start to feel a burn after your first set of 16 and that burn will not go away for the whole time. Use crunches, not sit-ups. Sit-ups give you rest time each rep which is not inducive to gaining definition. \n\nI am a guy and am answering from personal experience. The following results are for a skinny male. Your results may vary some. Although you get a 6 pack in the first couple of months, in 6 months you will have great abs! In a year your abs will be the best you have ever seen, unless they are hidden by fat.\n\nYou don't have to read the rest. When you get stronger (in about 6 months) you will be able to do the routine back to back. In a couple of months from that point you will be able to do it for hours. At this point it doesn't seem like the abs get too much more defined but they will look better than any abs you see on ab commercials on tv.\n\nNote that you will feel be very sore the first time you do the routine. If you don't work your abs the next day because they are sore, then they will be sore the next time you work them. However, if you tough it out and work them while they are sore you will stop feeling sore after about 2 minutes of exercise. Also, if you continue to work through the pain every day, in about 2 weeks your abs will not feel sore any more. Taking L-Glutamine can make you feel less sore and aide in recovery. The body uses Glutamaic acid (an essential amino) to make L-Glutamine so don't worry, Glutamine is not like steroids or something. The majority of your muscle is made of Glutamine. On this routine you will gain abs fast and if you don't have much fat around your midsection, you will see these results right away. A few years ago I found this website http://www.netfit.co.uk/abd6.htm It's all you really need! This info is out of date though. A new study showed that utilizing one of those exercise balls in combination with crunches can get better results.

An enterovaginal fistula is a hole in the wall between your rectum and your vagina, so that feces can enter your vagina. Cancer in the pelvic region and long difficult labour can cause this. A fistula, meaning opening between two areas that should not have it, can also occur between your urinary bladder and vagina, so you leak urine into your vagina. Or it can occur between your bladder and rectum so you can get feces into your urine. A fistula is not part of a persons normal anatomy. The word entero in enterovaginal fistula, means something to do with you gut basically. I am a Physician.

"There are many causes of ulcerative colitis just like there are many reasons why someone can be crying.  The bleeding and diarrhea are simply symptoms of your immune system losing its ability to tune the good and bad bacteria in the gut and even in remote places as the sinus cavity behind your nose.  Researchers are even investigating the bacteria in the mouth as potential triggers for colitis.\n\nSome researchers try to suppress the inflammation by blocking various molecules that control the immune system.  This can be dangerous if the cause in a particular person is a bad bacteria.  This approach is like taking the cops off the street in a bad neighborhood.  For a while it will be quiet as there will be no fights between the cops and bad guys but eventually the bad guys will really start to hurt a lot of people.  Oversuppressing the immune system can lead to a lot of side effects such as secondary infections.  As a result, researchers are trying to block inflammation in a more targeted manner.  However, due to the complexity of the body, immune targeting will be risky.\n\nThe best treatment for most patients is a fecal transplant.  As disgusting as it sounds, check out the link below.  The science behind it is quite deep.  One general situation where colitis occurs when the populations of good and bad bacteria get out of control when the good bacteria start to die off prior to a flare.  This is like when the police or the parents stop supervising the inexperienced folks.  Transplanting pre-screened healthy flora back into a colitis patient is like putting the cops and parents back into the system to reteach and discipline the bad guys.  Borody is the doctor in Australia who has performed nearly a thousand transplants successfully. Check into it below.\n\n\nThere are many things you can to to ease colitis. Review the following list of KEYWORDs and go to http://www.pubmed.gov and type in: ""ulcerative colitis"" KEYWORD \nto see the results of the peer reviewed journals.

well  a tube in her lungs can mean several things. but it sounds she has had a rather difficult time.if she has problems with her lungs and there are unknown spots there abcesses it can be from many things,or a simple infection that settled in her lungs and her body isolated it and encapsulated the bug.\nor it can be from a systemic wide organism\nand it has simply gotten in enough places\nher body can no longer control its spread.\n  until they know what it is be content she is doing ok.\nthey could be talking about doing a biopsy to see what it is,or chest tubes which you havent said if her lung has collasped.\nthey could be talking on mechanical ventilation also,which is placing a tuber in her lungs to right at the carina so air can go into both lungs s she can breath easier.\n or placing drainage tube into the abcess to drain it.\n  so the bottom line is none is terrifcally major,except the illness its self.\n  whether she has a bacterial infection in the lung or other reason, the major thing it sounds they are trying to control it and may have to let her rest on a ventilator till they can control the infection. saw on that they will give her medications and put her to sleep,and place a tube into her lungs and hook her up to a vent. they may keep her knocked out till they can treat the infection,and then get her back to breathing on her own.\n  the next thing is is what kind of infection is it. there are bugs out there \nthat are not good to get, so without sounding crude simply relax until they know what they are dealing with.\n  some of the bugs can totally destroy parts of the lung,others simply get isolated and encapsalated by the body.\n  so the trick is is to get a direct specimen of the critter,and then grow it in the lab and test what kills it,in order to know how to treat her.\n oxygen isnt all that bad either,it is simply what the bug is and get samples in order to know how to treat it.\n  if you wonder i do intensive care work,and tried to make things simple for easy understanding.\nshe has an infection and she has become very sick and they dont know what to treat her with yet.\n  so relax some, and support her.\ndepending on what they find out will determine the rest.
there is a technique of self examining your breast for any mass ...mass  feeling is the best sign for a breast cancer ..however i must tell you that a mass might not be a cancer but ratherly a benign lesion...( some doctors advice their patients to remove it so it might not change into malignancy ) ..there is other signs concerning the mass & doctors take it into consideration when they are physically examining their patients such as ..the size of the mass .. is it adherant to overlying tissues ..is adherent to the skin .. how does the skin over the mass looks like .. they also look for the nipple & ask if any changes occured to it such as inverting inside the breast tissue\n\neven if not totally true but if the mass is small its better & its more likely to be benign \nif the mass is adherent to the breast tissues or to skin over it its more likely to be malignant \nif the skin over the mass has changed in colour & became grey to orange in colour its more likely the mass is cancerous \nif the nipple was inverted inside ( a new change & not born with this feature ) then its more likely that its a breast cancer \nsome of these signs are more dangerous than others such the changes in the skin & nipple because they indicate a high grade cancer lesion \nif you have felt a mass under your fingers when self examinning urself its better to go to a doctor as soon as possible because if it a cancer breast & still a low grade you can remove it before the cancer metastasize into other tissues & organs

Ask your physician about a statin to help lower the LDL and total cholesterol.  Ask about Tricor, Zetia, and/or Niaspan or Niacin to help lower your Triglycerides.  To lower your LDL and total cholesterols, stay away from cheese, red meat, and any type of animal fatty foods. To lower your triglycerides, limit your sweets, alcohol, carbohydrates (which quickly turn into sugar in the body), this includes natural sugars (as in fruits) also...it is still sugar. No more than about 3 servings of fruits a day, including juices. If you like carbohydrates, choose high fiber carbs.  And you should think about diet and exercise EVERY day, don't wait until it is too late.
Take 800 mg of Ibruprofen which is prescription strength.  It has an anti-inflammatory in it so it's going to work better than Tylenol or aspirin.  This will give you temporary relief.  But the only way to 'cure' it is to see your dentist as soon as possible.
Well it depends, have you used them in a while? Are they clogged with hair? Your best bet is to get a clipper wash (its really a spray in a can) and hit em with that, following directions.

Your cervix thickens considerably during early pregnancy.  A thick mucus plug starts to develop.  The color changes (to a dark pink, I think, but I don't recall clearly), which of course only could been seen on internal exam.
Your diet is probably the problem. You need to drink Lots of water and stay away from soda's. My son had the same problem and this was the problems that caused his odor.\n  Good Luck.

yes. This is a side effect.  It's related to the hormones...so as time goes by your body will adjust.  DONT self treat you depression/mood swings with any supplements (like st johns wort) they effect the reliablilty of the pill.  Talk to you doc about this.

I would say your being raised to not have premarital sex has alot to do with it.  If you really think you will be with her the rest of your life, than go ahead and wait until you are married.  This way you will not sin, and you won't have any guilt.
"Perhaps the best thing you could do for yourself and your reproductive future is to see a doctor or visit your local emergency/triage clinic.  They will be able to prescribe the ""Morning After Pill"" for you if you are still within 72 hours of the sexual incident you are concerned about.  Otherwise, I have been instructed that taking the remaining pills in a patient's standard monthly pill pack will also abort a pregnancy, I'd rather see someone like yourself go out and just get the ""Morning After"" solution. You simply take two  contraceptive pills twelve hours apart.

The proven way is long, heavy breaths. Like you're trying to relax. Nice, deep breathes all the way.
Okay...lets see if I can make this simple in explanation.  There is a chemo receptor in the medulla of the brain that regulates respiratory rate according to the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood.  A person with a more advanced emphysema has a difficult time breathing in enough oxygen and expelling enough co2 (carbon dioxide).  The problem that begins to happen is the retention of co2 and when the co2 gets high enough, the chemo receptor regulating respirations is knocked out of commission.  The only thing that keeps a person breathing is air/oxygen hunger.....keeping the oxygen in the body low enough that the oxygen hunger makes the person work to breath.  The challenge in oxygen therapy is to supply enough oxygen so a person can function, but not enough to supply the full oxygen needs of the body.  If the full needs of oxygen are supplied, the body will not work to breath and if the co2 is high enough to knock out the chemoreceptor....the person will no longer breath.  A loose way of calculating the percentage of oxygen with a person using a nasal cannula is this....and mind you, this is an aproximate.  Using a nasal cannula, figure 4% per liter...2 lpm=8%.  Add the percent of o2 therapy to 21% room air.  So, if a person is using o2 at 2 lpm=8%, added to 21% room air o2, you get aproximately 29% oxygen being used.
cyclooxygenase (COX)\ncyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)\n\nCox-1: Cyclooxygenase-1, a protein that acts as an enzyme to speed up the production of certain chemical messengers, called prostaglandins, within the stomach. The prostaglandins work within certain cells that are responsible for inflammation and other functions. For example, they promote the production of the natural mucus lining that protects the inner stomach. Cox-1 is normally present in a variety of areas of the body, including not only the stomach but any other site of inflammation.\n\n\nCox-2 inhibitor: A type of drug that selectively blocks the enzyme cox-2 (cyclooxygenase-2). Blocking this enzyme impedes the production of the chemical messengers called prostaglandins that cause the pain and swelling of arthritis inflammation. Cox-2 inhibitors may not pose as great a risk of injuring the stomach or intestines as cox-1 inhibitors. Cox-2 inhibitors now on the market include celecoxib (brand name: Celebrex) and rofecoxib (brand name: Vioxx).

Because you are dealing with products not regulated by the FDA (diet pills) the safety and potency should always be questioned.\n\nDiet pills do work, although not forever.

Genetics - you have very little control, but you are not a prisoner of your genes.  \n\n2. Lean Muscle Mass - this one throws most people off because women think, oh no I dont want muscles and men think I guess I have to look like a body builder.  Lean muscle mass is simply your weight minus the weight of your organs, bones, fluids and fat.  You increase lean muscle mass primarily through eating properly, resistance exercise, and a lifestyle that doesnt promote catabolizing activites (smoking, heavy drinking and drug use)\n\n3. Frequency of meals - the more meals the more the metabolic processes take place in your body and the faster your metabolism.\n\n4. Water Intake - dehydration is a major drag on metabolism.\nMost people are dehydrated and they dont know it.\n\n5. Sleep - getting enough rest allows the body to function at a higher metabolic level.\n\nYou will learn more than you ever knew about metabolism from my source .   I cant type it all here, just click the link.\n\nhttp://www.jtfit.com/metabolism/
Sit-ups, 20 sets, 3 reps. I.e. 20 sit-ups, 1 min break, 20 sit-ups, I min break, 20 sit-ups, 1 min break. But if you have a fat tum, you'll need to lose weight first, for which I recommend eating less.
Preparation H is a wonderful thing & TUCKS medicated pads if they still make them
Yes, go to the doctor.

I like Zicam. Everyone I know who has tried it swears by it.
If its from working out take some vitamin E and rest it for a day or two. Eat a few high protein meals to help it recover. Try the supplement MSM too.
No.  Your doctor evaluates your symptoms, discusses your medical history and performs a pelvic exam to check for cysts, unusual tenderness or a thickening of the pelvic area. They may also perform an ultrasound to check for cysts in your ovaries.  Endometriosis is detected by a laparoscopy (a thin, lighted microscope--is inserted in a incision in the abdomen to view internal organs.\n\nOptions for treating endometriosis depend on the severity of your symptoms,the location and size of your endometrial growths,and your childbearing plans.  Your age is also a factor since your symptoms may intensify as you grow older.\n\nI had to take shots for 6 months.  The drug was expensive (insurance paid for it) but it helped to relieve the symptoms.  You can't do anything to prevent or cure endometriosis.\n\nHope this helps.  Good luck and God Bless!

Usually, in the confection it is refered what is the RDA(recommended daily dose). This is getting stabilized by WHO(World Health Organization).\nThere is also the FDA site,www.fda.gov \nFor your information, cod liver oil contains vit.A, vit.E and omega-3 fatty acids. Do not ecced with the dose in any case, be sure that you need it and for how long you are going to take it.\n\nKaterina

"First, here’s the average measures:\nErect Length \nMODEST = 14 cm.(5.4"")\nAVERAGE= 16 cm. (6.3"")\nErect Circumference\nMODEST = 11,5 cm. (4.5"")\nAVERAGE= 12,5 cm. (5.0"")\nWhile sex even is possible with shorter penis.\nOn some (anonymous) web sites, you find miraculous pills, herbs or creams, which are of no effect.\nAs external methods, there is the pump and the Andro-penis.\nThe pump is practically useless because its effect doesn’t last long !\nThe Andro-penis by external device, with the time and sacrifice gives really a development and maybe a flabbier penis too, and since it’s a new method, nobody still know the possible collateral effects in the time. Somebody affirms that the same result could be possible with some constant and manual exercises. At last, there is the (risk) surgery operation, which isn’t suitable for anybody. \nSince I guess you’re not in the actual condition to resort to such technique, just enjoy your body as it’s. \nGood and satisfactory sex isn’t measured by penis length!"
I recommend you need to get to a doctor ASAP! this is not something to mess around with. I ask my wife and she is a  RN in Mexico. She says see a doctor Immedeately.
Just make sure you have a comfortable chair with plenty of cushioning. As a CNA we change patients positions frequently to keep them from getting ulcers. So get up frequently to walk around and stretch, maybe do some yoga on breaks, and make sure you walk around alot. Like walk to a co-workers desk to ask the work question instead of calling them. Make sure your back and butt are well supported and don't wear clothes that are too constricting. Good luck.

working out decreases the size of the breasts and also firms them up
Yeah, I've noticed that too. Here's a disgusting thought. Just think if someone gathered up all those pubes and put em in a big pile. It would probably fill a freakin' stadium up. But, I digress on to why theres more. Dudes scratch themselves more, maybe scratchin those hairs loose. Also dudes stand up to pee so bam they fall right on the urinal. Alot of women shave so on average, less pubes. and since the ladies sit to do evertything if they are losing pubes there going right in the water. Well thats my two cents.
Improper footwear, lack of vitamins, dry skin, athlete's foot. I suggest washing your feet every night in warm soapy water and gently massaging off the callouses with a rough towel or buffer bar. Then apply foot cream or lotion. Wear only WHITE socks and tennis shoes. Also, take a multi vitamin every day.
Liniment, from the Latin linere, to anoint, is a medicated topical preparation for application to the skin. Liniments are of a similar viscosity to lotions (being significantly less viscous than an ointment or cream) but unlike a lotion a liniment is applied with friction, that is a liniment is always rubbed in.\n\nLiniments are typically sold to relieve pain and stiffness, such as from sore muscles or from arthritis. These liniments typically are formulated from alcohol.\n\nNow Horse liniment is Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). While DMSO has a low toxicity, prolonged exposure can cause dermatitis and possibly damage the liver or kidneys.\n\nIt is commonly used as a liniment for horses, although its use in humans is controversial.

It may for some people.  Asprin is a blood thinner so it HELPS to prevent some of the clotting that can result in heart attacks and heart disease.  It is not a magic cure all however.  Each person should consult with a doctor before starting an asprin program.
do you mean bunions? those can be VERY painful, and they need to be surgically fixed(http://orthopedics.about.com/cs/toeproblems/a/bunions_2.htm).... if you mean a burn blister, (if it is bad, seek medical attention)\n \n1. Clean the skin around the blister.  \n  \n2.   Place a doughnut-shaped piece of moleskin over the blister. This will keep pressure off it.  \n  \n3.   Try to avoid popping the blister unless it's in an especially awkward place, such as the bottom of your foot. The blister provides a sterile environment for the skin underneath. Breaking it makes the area more susceptible to infection.  \n  \n \n5.   Avoid peeling any skin off the blister; this can lead to an infection and delay healing.  \n  \n6.   Cover the exposed blister with a thin layer of antibiotic ointment and dry sterile gauze.  \n  \n7.   Change the gauze regularly and watch for signs of infection, such as pus or redness.

"It depends on the diet.  If you are looking for low-cal: NO because even non fat milk has calories, so does the caramel sauce, and so does the vanilla syrup in the beverage.  You're beverage, as is, will be approximately 280 calories.  That's not terrible, but it isn't helpful to maintain weight loss, especially since it's not a balanced diet, which is by far most important, and a characteristic other places have.\nIf you want to make the drink lower in calories, reduce the amount of caramel sauce on top (just say ""light caramel"") and change the vanilla to sugar free (made with splenda).  This will greatly reduce you calories, by as much as 75 per drink!\nIf you care about fat, the only fat is coming from the caramel, so reducing that will help.\nIf you care about Atkins/carbs, heavy cream has 0 carbs, half-and-half has approx 1/serving, so about 3-4/drink.  Not bad.\nIf you care about the negative effects of dairy on the body (humans aren't made to consume bovine dairy, we all become intolerant eventually), the soy milk is a great solution, and it helps the body in many ways (creating a better balance that WOULD be beneficial for your diet along with other measures.\nOrganic whole milk is also available, if all you care about is the hormones in the milk, which are significant, and abolishing them is helpful to the body.\n\nHope this helps."
I'm not saying your probably dirty but try using a loafa with your soap or body wash in the shower.  Shower in the mornings before you start your day to know you are clean and apply deoderant on freshly cleaned skin.  I know that your sweat can smell stronger when you've eaten spicey foods and a lot of greasy foods, so maybe the tent is from the foods too.  Or maybe you aren't drinking enough water either.  When you urinate, is your urine dark or clear?  Dark soda could be the cause.  Try more water and cut out soda and eat fruits and veggies too.
Edema is an observable swelling from fluid accumulation in certain body tissues. Edema most commonly occurs in the feet and legs, where it also is referred to as peripheral edema. The swelling is the result of the accumulation of excess fluid under the skin in the spaces within the tissues that are outside of the blood vessels.\n\nHeart failure often causes edema. Congestive heart failure or CHF is the bunch of symptoms that hit you when your heart can't pump enough blood to satisfy your body's needs.
As a paramedic, that looks good to me. You didn't mention your age or any health problems. If I were to see you in my ambulance, providing you didn't have any trauma, that is not a treatable blood pressure. Go to the American Heart Association web site. There is good info on blood pressure education. Also, don't hesitate to sit at one of those automated blood pressure machines at the pharmacy (Target, Walmart) and just get it checked. Most fire departmants welcome people to get their pressure checked for free. I took several people right to the hospital because I felt like they could stroke out any minute. Saved a life or two I'm sure.
Can't be done because sunburns kill skin, and when skin dies, it must be shed. However, keep it very greased with aloe vera, you can buy it anywhere, and that will minimize skin that was just damaged, not dead, from shedding with the dead skin.
Anywhere from 45-55 is normal, but in some rare cases it can start as early as the mid thirties.  You should check with your OB to be sure it isn't stress, diet, excersise, or weight related.

To lose weight or to lead a healthier lifestyle
i am older than you but my weight stays between 113 and 118. at nine months pregnant i only weighed 133 and i had a seven pound boy. i ask the doctor what to do one time and she said drink a lot of milk shakes. that did not help and that also gets expensive. i started working out. i work out five days a week and also lift weights. i am still small but the working out gives your body the woman shape you are wanting. so you can weigh 110 and still have shapely legs and butt, small waist so your boobs will look bigger and from lifting weights your arms will be shapely. enjoy it. i have a lot of women jokingly tell me that i make them sick.
Infested bed sheets, towels.
Cold packs, quiet, darkness, caffeine, acetaminophen and aspirin (but leave out the aspirin if you could deliver in the next few weeks) Also, check with a pharmacist. Don't skip eating. Check with your midwife doctor or clinic as well...some bad headaches in pregnancy are not migraines.

"Regulated drugs are drugs that are considered ""controlled drugs"", usually that means that they are addictive and they are monitored by the doctors, pharmacy and I THINK the government (not sure about that one). Examples of that would be any kind of pain medication or ritalin."
Please, don't put your health in the hands of an amateur forum. Respect your mind and body. Consult your doctor. (I am a physician myself and this is the best advice I can possibly give you.)
"Aspirin helps these problems by stopping cells from making prostaglandins. Remember the enzyme, COX-2?  It is a protein made by your body's cells whose job is to take chemicals floating around in your tissues and turn them into prostaglandins.  \nCOX-2 can be found in lots of normal tissues, but much more of it is made in tissue that has been damaged in some way. Aspirin, it turns out, sticks to COX-2 and won't let it do its job; it's like a lock you put on your bicycle.  The bicycle won't move with the lock on, and COX-2 can't work with aspirin stuck in it.  So by taking aspirin, you don't stop the problem that's causing the pain, like the tight muscles in your scalp, or the cramping in your abdomen, or the hammer-damaged finger.  But it does ""lower the volume"" on the pain signals getting through your nerves to your brain. \n\nOne common question about aspirin and other medicines is, ""How does it know how to get to where the pain is?""  The answer is that it doesn't! When you take aspirin, it dissolves in your stomach or the next part of the digestive tract, the small intestine, and your body absorbs it there. Then it goes into the bloodstream and it goes through your entire body. Although it is everywhere, it only works where there are prostaglandins being made, which includes the area where it hurts.  \n\nYou may ask, ""How come I have to keep taking aspirin if it works so well?""  As with almost all chemicals, your body has ways of getting rid of aspirin.  In this case, your liver, stomach, and other organs change aspirin to... surprise! Salicylic acid!  This chemical then slowly gets changed a bit more by the liver, which sticks other chemicals onto the salicylic acid so that your kidneys can filter it out of your blood and send it out in your urine. This whole process takes about four to six hours, so you need to take another pill at that time to keep the effect going. \n\nThe problem with the fact that aspirin goes through your entire bloodstream is that your body needs prostaglandins for some reasons.  One place they are useful is in the stomach; it turns out another enzyme called COX-1 makes a prostaglandin that seems to keep your stomach lining nice and thick.  Aspirin keeps COX-1 from working (it keeps most prostaglandins from being made equally well -- it's ""nonselective""), and your stomach lining gets thin, allowing the digestive juice inside to irritate it.  This is probably the biggest reason why aspirin and its relatives upset stomachs (not only because it's an acid, as Hoffmann had thought).  \n\nCOX-2 also works in some normal tissues like the brain and kidney; at normal amounts, one dose of aspirin probably doesn't affect these areas much. And there are other places in the body where prostaglandins have a job in normal tissues, such as the blood.."
yes. I am having one now.
OH YEAH!!!!   I THOUGHT THE SAME THING.....I ATE MCDONALDS YOU NAME IT ALL THE TIME AND SINCE I TURNED 21 IT HAS CAUGHT UP WITH ME AND I HAVE HAD TO STOP... MY ADVICE STOP EATING JUNK FOOD NOW BECAUSE IT IS HARD TO BREAK THAT HABIT!!!!
I had my appendix out several years ago. You dont see anything of the operating room, or anything scary. When you get taken for the operation, you enter a plain room when you are sedated. It is very quick and simple. You fall asleep very quickly. You dont know anything about having the operation and it feels that as soon as you fall asleep they are waking you up. You dont dream at all. \n\nAfter the operation, you will be on strong painkillers for a few days. You wont be able to sit up as easy as normal, but just roll onto your side and push yourself up. Using your stomach muscles will hurt for a while. You will be well looked after. There is nothing to worry about. These operations happen many times a day and all turn out fine.\n\nDont worry, and make the most of the attention and people waiting on you hand and foot. ;-)

tidal volume is the amount of air you breath at rest (not taking deep breaths in and blowing all your air out).  It is one of many numbers used to analyse pulmonary function.
Crest whitestrips worked for me.  I did notice increased sensitivity to cold foods during the whitening process.  But my teeth weren't very sensitive before, so I didn't find it too uncomfortable.  The sensitivity went away after I finished using the strips, and my teeth are still whiter over 6 months later!  :)\n\nAlso, using a whitening toothpaste (I like Crest but there are others out there) 2X a day will help keep them white after the strips.
Basic skills in CPR = knowing the amount of compressions to make (15, I believe) and knowing how to tilt the head back to open the airway. \n\nImportance = so you can save lives if need be, if someone is choking, has collapsed and stopped breathing, or has something blocked in their airway and is unable to respond.
If you are very much over weight, I would think vegetarian diet is the best choice for you because you can help your body reduce the fat that make you over weight. But if you are not over weight or under weight, then eating a combined meat and vegetarian diet is more ideal for you.On the other hand, if you are ok with your weight but having heart or other health problems like high cholestrol and so on... then you should eat more vegetable and fruits but cut down on red meat, white meat without the fat can be eaten in moderation to provide the protein your body needs.
Losing your virginity is defined as penile-vaginal intercourse.  So, you're still a virgin until you do that. \n\nNow, I recommend you don't do anything else with your boyfriend since you sound too young and immature (if you have to ask, you're not ready).  \n\nWait a few years, get all the facts, and then if you're ready (and very safe), should you do the deed.
"first of all 5'5"" isnt even short thats probly average for an adult female. like a few others said it could be done surgically but i seriously doubt a doc would do it for a girl thats 5'5"". they break the leg bones and use braces to spread them apart (like i'm gonna do with ur legs :D ). the bones naturally try to grow back towards each other to try to heal, which lengthens the bone, and the braces are very gradually adjusted to pull the bones further apart to add more height. just wear some big a** stripper shoes, hehe get some clear heels.\nand u cant f*ck him unless u f*ck me first ;)\n\n&#92;/"

"Holiday Heart may be harmful to your overall health.\n\n""This type of arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, develops when muscles in the heart's upper chambers contract too quickly, resulting in an irregular heartbeat.

If you have fatty liver, it can be from drinking heavily or drinking massive amounts of soda.  Most soda uses high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar, this leads to fatty buildup in the liver. Children are more prone to this these days because the soda companies switched from regular fructose to high fructose corn syrup.  If you suspect you have fatty liver, the non alcoholic type NASH or the alchoholic kind, you should have your liver enzymes checked and have your liver looked at on a sonogram.
BOO
We actually had our baby's ears checked in the hospital a couple of days after he was born, so you can certainly get them checked at 2 1/2. They use some method with electrodes (just on the outside of the child's head) and can see whether the sounds are being received in the brain... so it doesn't rely on the kid's being able to say whether he heard something or not.
Tea Tree oil will do the job.
I'm not a dentist, but it stands to reason that the cost of any cosmetic dentistry will vary according to what you want done and to how many teeth you want it done to.\n\nLooking at the prices shown on London Dental Studio http://www.londondentalstudio.co.uk/html/fee_guide.html the inital consultation is £45, a Diagnostic Smile Makeover is £100 per tooth and Dental Implants with crowns cost £1800 per tooth.

The only way to decrease cup size is to decrease the amount of breast tissue. This can be achieved two ways, one is surgery, the other is too loose weight. The majority of breast tissue is composed of fat, but you can't loose fat in just the breasts, you will loose all over. If your not overweight then the only way to reduce breast size will be surgery. Sorry, it's genetic.

Anything that is fried contains LOADS of unhealthy fat.  \n\nRed meats contain fat - and they are terribly 'banished' by the view of the 'healthful world' but in my eyes, our grandparents did quite well on it.. it's HOW we fix it now and such...

"What is fifth disease?\nFifth disease, or erythema infectiosum, is a contagious viral illness that is much more common in children than adults. It is also known as ""slapped cheek disease"" because of the distinctive rash that some people develop on the face.\n\nFifth disease is spread mostly by coughs and sneezes. Generally, people can spread fifth disease only when flulike symptoms are present and before a rash develops. Some people who have fifth disease, such as those who have certain blood disorders or impaired immune systems, may be contagious for a longer time. \n\nWhat causes fifth disease?\nFifth disease is caused by a virus called human parvovirus B19. \n\nWhat are the symptoms?\nThe incubation period—the time from exposure to the virus until symptoms develop—is 4 to 20 days. Initial symptoms usually resemble a mild flu (generally without fever), sometimes followed by a bright red rash on the face, and later a lace-like rash on the body. The rash usually fades within 2 to 5 days and may reappear with exposure to sunlight, warm temperatures, or stress. After the rash appears, your child is no longer contagious and can return to school or daycare.\n\nJoint pain and swelling, lasting several weeks or even months, and headache may also occur. Adults develop these symptoms more often than children. \n\nNot all people with fifth disease get a rash or feel sick.\n\nHow is it diagnosed?\nFifth disease is diagnosed through a medical history and physical examination by a health professional. A diagnosis of fifth disease is generally easier if a person develops the distinctive rash associated with the infection.\n\nHow is it treated?\nIn uncomplicated cases, home treatment (including rest, fluids, and pain relievers) is usually the only care needed for fifth disease. If complications develop, close monitoring by a health professional or hospitalization may be required.\n\nComplications of fifth disease\nIn fifth disease, the body stops producing red blood cells for a short time. This usually does not cause a problem for an otherwise normally healthy child or adult. However, it can become a serious threat for people who have blood disorders, such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia. These people can develop transient aplastic crisis, a rapid worsening of existing anemia that usually lasts 7 to 10 days. People who have transient aplastic anemia can become very sick; symptoms include fever, lethargy, rapid heart rate, and rapid breathing.\n\nPeople who have impaired immune systems who become infected with fifth disease may develop a chronic parvovirus B19 infection that can lead to severe anemia.\n\nMedical treatments for complications of fifth disease\nPregnant women and people who have impaired immune systems or blood disorders are at risk for developing complications from fifth disease.\n\nTreatment for pregnant women\nIn very rare cases, a fetus that becomes infected with parvovirus B19 may develop severe anemia and swelling, a condition called fetal hydrops. The mother and fetus should be closely monitored with fetal ultrasounds to detect this condition. \n\nWhen fetal hydrops is detected, the fetus may be treated with blood transfusions while in the uterus, although this is not usually necessary.\n\nSome babies born to mothers who were infected with fifth disease during pregnancy may also be treated with blood transfusions.\n\nTreatment for people who have blood or immune disorders\nPeople who have blood disorders that cause anemia (such as sickle cell disease or thalassemia) may require blood transfusions if a rapid worsening of existing anemia (called transient aplastic anemia) develops.\n\nIntravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be given to people who have impaired immune systems to prevent a chronic parvovirus B19 infection and severe anemia."

A CT examination with an effective dose of 10 millisieverts (abbreviated mSv; 1 mSv = 1 mGy in the case of x rays.) may be associated with an increase in the possibility of fatal cancer of approximately 1 chance in 2000. This increase in the possibility of a fatal cancer from radiation can be compared to the natural incidence of fatal cancer in the U.S. population, about 1 chance in 5. In other words, for any one person the risk of radiation-induced cancer is much smaller than the natural risk of cancer. Nevertheless, this small increase in radiation-associated cancer risk for an individual can become a public health concern if large numbers of the population undergo increased numbers of CT screening procedures of uncertain benefit. \nhttp://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ct/risks.html

Well, I'll try to be clear. Yes, it's semen (and only it!)\nThat event is called male orgasm and it occurs when the excitment reaches the apex. Mind sends signal and from Prostate and Testicles (and from other glans too) semen begins to come out (through the urethra). It's a fast event lasting few seconds even. And after 1 -2 min. penis become flabby again. I hope to have satisfied your question.
I think it is ok, the human sexuality is very rich and diverse, enjoy it!!
It hurts if the penis is really large.  If it's your first time then it will hurt regardless because the hymen will be broken... it might bleed a little.
My experience says yes. My former wife is a nurse and they gave free flu shots for family members at her hospital. The one and only time our family went in for the shot was the one and only time all of us caught the flu. I never got the shot again, and never caught the flu again. But maybe it was just a coincidence.
valerian root is a sedative it calms w/out the side effects of orthodox drugs. i'm unaware of your childs other issues, so i want you to know valerian is also used in the treatment of seizures, muscle spasms, nervousness. if your son is on any medication that causes a drowsy effect it will increase that, so be careful not to give valerian root to him at the same time because it will slow the rate of his heart, however while it slows that it alsoincreases the strength of each beat. Also valerian root STINKS, this is because of the drying process, just wanted to warn you. you may want to try a pure chamomile extract, or a tincture of herbal minerals like alfalfa, borage, chickweed,oatstraw,horsetail, and red raspberry. Theres a lack of trace minerals in our food these days and it effects our babies. Scullcap is another sedative, it is a bit more slow working than valerian, but it would be gentler on his system. Good Luck to you

I don't know how old you are or how severe your problem is. I heard and advertisement on the radio today advertising Botox as a treatment for excessive sweating. You may wish to consult a doctor about this.
If you are talking cancer with brain mets, this means that the cancer has spread to the brain area.  It may or may not hurt depending on the symptoms or where the cancer is first located in the body.  If there are tumors in the brain you may experience some headaches, vision changes, dizziness or balance problems, or neurological changes with numbness and tingling in the hands and feet or limbs of the body. It may have paralyzing limb changes, speech changes, memory changes, and stroke like symptoms as well.  This also depends on the staging of the cancer that the doctor decides with further testing, such as CT scans, MRI's and blood tests.  The mets ususally means metastasized, that it is more advanced and has originated in a different spot in the body to begin with.
Well basically the healthiest way to lose weight, is to limit your food intake and exercise at least 30 min. a day.\n\nWeight watchers is good program, because you can basically eat what you want but it just limits your food portions. \n\nAlso you should maybe join a gym or join a group exercise program, that will get you motivated.  If you can't do that.  Walk or jog in the park or in your neighborhood.\n\nJust remember, you need good will power and the commitment to want to loose weight.\n\nGood Luck!
same as most people I'd think.  I don't know of any diseases that occur more often for that culture.  Ireland is a Christian based society,  so anything that would not be acceptable to the Christian community should be avoided.  Each patient is an individual, so ask about last rites, birth control use, stem cell use, etc. and know a religious figure such as a priest or nun that you could contact with questions, or refer a patient to if they need a bit of spiritual guidance as well as medical.
The world we are living in right now is the driving force.Young girls are inclined to reain slimmer as men are more attracted to slimer women. This is clearly demonstrated in the way men tend to get drawn to younger slimmer women after their wives have gone and had babies. \nThis doesn`t nessesarily mean that they love the young girls more but i tend to think that it is an indication of agility which means more fun!
I would recommend going to the center for disease control site.
I have found that the Avon cracked heel relief cream works really excellently on my feet & I was told by my partner that I have Ugly Troll Feet! So yeah, they now look really good.. so it must be a miracle lotion!!!
He would definately gain muscle.  Cardio really isnt great for building muscle- especially if you are doing it for a long time (running distance, biking long ways, etc).  Cardio is an equal opportunity burner of stored energy- which is both fat and muscle mass.  There are a couple of problems with fat guys doing only lifting.  The first is that you're a lot more likely to have a heart attack or annurism while lifting if you're real heavy.  The second is that you're not going to look cut when you're fat- the fat just sits on top of the muscle and hides it, so you still look fat, not cut.
you may find home remedies/over the counter creams or such that temporarily make the wart/warts go away but you should be aware that it is a virus in your system and will never go away. prescription meds can be taken to control the virus and outbreaks.
Blood Cholesterol is produced by our body for several purposes. In some people it is produced more than is required by our body, especially when the diet contains saturated fats. Saturated fats in the diet force the body to make too much cholesterol. The cholesterol may become high when our diet is rich in saturated fats that are found only in animal products. Plant foods do not contain any cholesterol, but the animal foods are loaded with cholesterol and fats. Most of the fast foods are very rich in fats, monounsaturated fats. If you eat lot of meats and fast foods, then the chances are that you have high cholesterol. You should get your blood cholesterol checked. Remember that without your blood cholesterol report, you can not know if you have high cholesterol.\n\nNote that you do not always need to take medication for controlling your cholesterol. There are several natural heart friendly foods that are good for controlling cholesterol without any medication. Good eating habits and some exercise can control your cholesterol and triglycerides naturally.\n\nFoods you must avoid!\n\ni. Salt\n\nSalt is the greatest culprit for diabetics. You get enough salt from vegetables in inorganic form, so reduce the intake of inorganic salt.\n\nii. Sugar\n\nSucrose, a table sugar, provides nothing but calories and carbohydrates. \n\nAlso, you need calcium to digest sucrose. Insufficient sucrose intake might lead to calcium being leached off the bones. \n\nSubstitute sucrose with natural sugar, like honey, jaggery (gur), etc.\n\niii. Fat\n\nExcessive fat intake is definitely not a good habit.\n\nTry and exclude fried items from your diet totally. \n\nBut, remember, you must have a small quantity of oil to absorb fat-soluble vitamins, especially vitamin E.\n\niv. For non-vegetarians\n\nTry and stop the intake of red meat completely. \n\nTry to go in for a vegetarian diet. If you cannot, decrease the consumption of eggs and poultry. \n\nYou can, however, eat lean fish two to three times a week.\n\nv. Whole milk and products\n\nTry to switch to low fat milk and its products like yogurt (curd). \n\nReplace high fat cheese with low fat cottage cheese.\n\nvi. Tea and coffee\n\nDo not have than two cups of the conventional tea or decaffeinated coffee every day. \n\nTry to switch to herbal teas.\n\nvii. White flour and its products\n\nReplace these with whole grains, wholewheat or soya breads and unpolished rice.\n\nviii. Foods with a high glycemic index\n\nAvoid white rice, potatoes, carrots, breads and banana -- they increase the blood-sugar levels.  \n\nSpecial food for diabetics\n\ni. Bitter gourd (karela)\n\nThis vegetable contains a high dosage of 'plant insulin'. It lowers the blood-sugar levels effectively.\n\nHave the juice of three to four karelas early morning on an empty stomach. \n\nAs a vegetable, too, it can be taken on a regular basis. \n\nPowder the seeds of karela (measuring 1 teaspoon), mix with water and drink it.\n\nii. Fenugreek (methi)\n\nIt is the most common food used to control diabetes. \n\nGulp a teaspoonful of these seeds with a glass of water daily. \n\nSoak the seeds overnight. Have the water in which the seeds were soaked.\n\nYou can make a chutney with methi seeds. You can also eat them sprouted, dried and powdered, or mix them in wheat flour to make chapattis.\n\niii. Indian blackberry (jamun)\n\nThis fruit is very effective in preventing and controlling diabetes. \n\nPowder the stone of the fruit and eat it -- it contains glucoside, which prevents the conversion of starch into sugars.\n\niv. Garlic \n\nThis is used to lower blood-sugar levels. \n\nGarlic is rich in potassium and replaces the potassium which gets lost in urine. \n\nIt also contains zinc and sulphur, which are components of insulin. \n\nTake about three to four flakes of freshly crushed garlic daily.\n\nv. Onion \n\nBecause of its diuretic and digestive properties, onion works against diabetes. \n\nRaw onion is more useful.\n\nvi. Flaxseed\n
Once per year digital rectal exams and PSA tests are the most effective preliminary means to detect prostate cancer. \n\nIf you the doctor feels something during the DRE then further tests may follow. If you PSA is high, usually above 3.6, then further testing is warranted. If your PSA is below 3.6, but has risen by .75 per year, then additional tests may follow.\n\nIf one of the above conditions arises then you may be asked to see a urlogist who will want to do a biopsy. Ask for an fPSA (free PSA) test first. If you 'free' PSA level is below 20% by all means have the biopsy. If the free PSA is above 20%, and the doctor did not feel an irregularity, you might consider waiting and watching for 6 months to a year. \n\nOtherwise a biopsy where the doctor takes at least 10 samples should be done. Since this is invasive, but not painful, the biopsy should be the last resort to finish your testing for cancer.\n\nIf the lab determines you have a cancer, then send the lab results to another private lab to have the results confirmed, before you starting treating your cancer.\n\nThe best labs in the country are..\n\nThe Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions\nAnatomic Pathology Consultation Service\n401 N.

Call a nurse and she will tell you this trust me its called old blood its normal at times when from the last time you stopped your period you didn't shed all of the blood and well the blood will be black on your first few days of the next period its normal lots of women do this so many times in there life that it just becomes a normal sight but it goes back to the normal color in a few days sometimes it will last tell your last day then that last day it will be red again its normal and you just collected all your blood early on in between the last period and this one is all.

"Women's clothing isn't measured the way men's clothing is measured. Frustrating but true. Ask any woman who wears a size 8 in Gloria Vanderbilt jeans but a size 10 or 12 in another brand. That's why women have to spend so much time trying on their clothes. Men can buy a size ""38 long"" jacket and know it will fit because men's sizes are measured in inches. For women's clothing, it's all arbitrary from one brand to another... or even within the same brand. So there is no correct answer to your question."

The Body Mass Index is a useful measure of an individual's current weight related to an ideal body weight. An ideal BMI is generally between 20.5 and 21.5. A BMI greater than 30 (usually what you find on the biggest loser) is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and other health problems related to obesity. \n\nHere's a calculator to figure out your BMI:\nhttp://www.preventdisease.com/healthtools/articles/bmi.html

Are you talking about eating it or putting it on your big toe?\n\nSodium is not an element of gout, which is caused by uric acid  crystals in the joints. Salt causes the body to retain fluid, which can actually help gout, although it may be bad for you for other reasons.\n\nYou should avoid foods containing purine, especially red meat and strawberries.

"I don't know if there is a best age for taking ""real"" vitamins. My mom had me start taking ""real"" vitamins when i was about 7 or 8. I take calcium, multi-vitamins, and Vitamin C almost every day. There are many other supplements that you can take if you think you are deficient in a certain area.  But don't just rely on vitamins and not eat right.  Fresh fruits and vegetables contain many vitamins and minerals that are essential to your body's health.  Exercise is also essential in the proper absorption of vitamins and minerals."

"Whether you like him or not, you have to respect Dr Phil just because of one thing.\n\nHe continually asks his guests one simple question: ""How's it working for you?""\n\nSuccess in anything comes from FINDING WHAT WORKS then DOING WHAT WORKS.\n\nI am going to reveal to you the Secret Weight Loss Formula that Celebrity personal trainer don’t want you to know about.\n\nBefore I reveal the secret, first I need to explain to you that there is process that your body goes through to burn body fat. \n\nSo how does your body burn fat?\n\nIt is a 2 steps process and in order you need to:\n1.Release the fat from the fat cells and only then\n2.You can burn the fat\n\nThat process is the same for every human being. I will outline the steps and then show you how you can easily apply some fundamental rules to allow your body to burn the maximum amount of fat with less effort and minimum time. Once you understand that simple process, you can easily see why you are not getting the results that you want. Even bigger, you will finally see that getting that dream body is getting so much closer to reality that you will be extremely motivated to get started as soon as you can.\n\nHow does your body release the fat from the cells?\n\nBefore you can turn your body into a fat burning machine, here what needs to happen: your body fat need to be released from the fat cells. You can accomplish this step successfully with your nutrition program. Here are some specific tips that you can apply right away to achieve that.\n\n1.Eat 4-6 small, frequent meals and never skip meals.\n2.Include small amounts of good fats.\n3.Eat natural foods; avoid processed & refined foods\n4.Eat lean proteins with each meal.\n5.Eat more complex carbs, fruits & vegetables.\n\nThe most misunderstood weight loss strategy. How to burn the *fat* instead of burning muscles.\n\nReleasing fat from the fat cells is not the end of it; actually, it is just the beginning. Because the fat needs to be transported from the fat cells to your muscles so it can be burned there. This is done through your blood and the cardiovascular system is responsible for that. The more effective is that system, the more effective your body will become at burning fat. You can improve your cardio vascular system by doing so cardio training.  However, don’t go out yet and spend 1 hour on the treadmill because you probably not going to be doing too much good like that.\n\nThe reason is excessive cardio combined with a restrictive diet burns fat but mostly muscle tissue. That is not a good thing at all, because muscle tissue is where you burn the fat and if you are burning away muscle tissue, you are burning your ability to burn more fat in the future (weight loss plateau). You just don’t cut the hand that feed you. So cardio burns fat and it can also burn muscle tissue, this is a huge dilemma. Damn if you do, damn if you don’t. But wait there is a solution to that…\n\nYou need to do some MODERATE cardio training. The key word here is moderate. \nDoing too much cardio can be detrimental and I am sure you have seen those people that are doing cardio on a daily basis and still not getting anywhere. The result is a low metabolism. Low metabolism means, your body fat is not going anywhere, anytime \nsoon. Here is what you need to do:\n\n1.Do some moderate cardio training; the key word here is moderate\n2.Never diet but consume little fewer calories that you will burn (No starvation diets, Please...)\n\nThe world most efficient “fat burner” is FREE and You already have it.\n\nBefore I reveal to you how personal trainer get those celebrities in the best shape of their life in such short period there is one more thing that I want you to understand. Because it is very important. \nWeight loss marketers always claim that they have the magic “fat burner” that will melt your fat away. The problem is that they have a new one coming out every year, so I wonder if the one from last year was so e"
Well it depends. Do you feel that your emotional and/or mental state of health is being threatened by something other than everyday trials and stress? \n\nStress can be managed by a psychologist, who basically is someone for you to talk to, someone who listens (and is paid to) without making you feel embarrased, and also someone well versed in dealing with common problems.\n\nPsychiatrists are for mental DISEASES or disorders, mostly relating to genetic brain disorders and chemical imbalences in the brain and the spinal column. \n\nIf you want you could get yourself evaluated (for a fee) by a psychiatrist that your insurance company reccommends. Believe me, you'll want the insurance.
ive recently seen this commerical where a woman is told be her doctor that she ahs cancer and then she comes home and has to tell her small children about it. i think its the ebst to think over and realize the consequences of smoking. do you wnat to get married , ahve children , grandchldren, grow old with your husband etc? think what you wnat to do in your life and realize that smoking will simply take it away from you. while your friends will be having their dreams coming true you will be saying goodbye to your family. tahts harsh but true.
I make sure that no matter where I go or what I'm doing there is a 'please take a seat sign' within eye shot.  If I know there isn't going to be one of those signs, I bring one from home.
I would definately not take any other supplements/metabolism boosters while on creatine.  There are several studies (which of course none of these are proven) that say it can have adverse affects. Personally I wouldnt risk it.  Although personally, I wouldn't waste my money on creatine when you can do it the natural way.
I do not think they  Allow that  ,, there are laws  you may just have to go there to visit  Them  if you are a family member   Best to you

Dental Hygienist:    There are 2 different program types to become a hygienist.  There is the associate's degree program and the bachelor's degree program.  To obtain your associate's degree in hygiene it takes approximately 2 1/2 - 3 years.... 2 years of hygiene school plus a semester or two to take pre-requisite classes.  To obtain your bachelor's degree in hygiene takes 4 years.  Once graduated from your hygiene program, you will be required to take an exam administered by your State Board of Dental Examiners that you must pass in order to receive your license to practice in your state.\n\nDental Assistant:    Dental assisting programs vary greatly.  They could range from about 7 months to 2 or 3 semesters.  Generally only a technical certificate is obtained to become a dental assistant.  Also, depending on the state you live in, the functions of a dental assistant vary.  Assistants are allowed to do certain things in some states that they aren't allowed to do in other states.... for one example.. packing a cord during a crown prep procedure.  There are Certified Dental Assistants and Expanded Duty Dental Assistants... tests are given once finished with schooling for both the CDA and the EDA.  An assistant is required to hold a radiology license within the state they are working in order to be able to take x-rays.

Ritalin (stimulant) works because it stimulates a certain part of the brain to work at a minimum level of activity to control other parts of the brain. It only is really effective in this way in people whose executive function area is already working below normal. It doesn't do the same thing with people who are  'normal'. It only speeds them up, but only at dosages above the ADD/ADHD levels which are usually used. There are other side effects of using stimulants, like insomnia, indigestion, dry eyes....
eating healthy has a fair amount of common sense to it. try and eat a balanced diet. your body needs three basic food groups, carbs, fats and proteins. diets like atkins do work but they are extremely bad for you. \neat fruit and salad for vitamins, rice bread potatoes etc for carbs. red meat will give you proteins and fats, white meat will give you proteins and less fat. for fats you can always use olive oil. grilled meat is best for dieting. \nto lose weight take your daily recommended calorie intake, minus about 200 cal from that and then split that amount of calories into 6 meals that you eat regularly through out the day. drink plenty of water. for lunch and dinner take about a fist sized portion of carbs,meat and salad. avoid eating carbs for about 3-4 hrs before you sleep. chew your food for a long time.\nyour exercise programme sounds ok, you could always ask a personnal trainer to give you a structured weighs programme.\nto be completley honest it sounds like you large hips and thighs may be to do with genetics as well. the exercises that you are doing shouldn't really build your thighs but should be toning them. aim to do about 45 mins of cardio work 4-5 times a week.\ngood luck
Hydrochlorothiazide (Apo-Hydro®, Aquazide H®, Microzide®, Oretic®), sometimes abbreviated HCT, HCTZ, or HZT is a popular diuretic drug that acts by inhibiting the kidney's ability to retain water. This reduces the volume of the blood, decreasing peripheral vascular resistance.
Does your doctor know? It's much safer to tell your doctor that you're on Paxil before starting Phentermine as they could interact harmfully.

I would suggest you go as soon as you can.  My daughter used to get UTIs all the time and they were so uncomfortable we hated to wait too long.  If you have been doctoring the infection on your own for that long, get to the doctor.  The meds really help.
Ummm I would take one aspirin and see if it improves.  If it does, but does not go away, take another and wait another 20 mins... if it's better, go to the HOSPITAL ASAP!  Men and Women experience pain differently with heart attacks.. this was actually my Father's first clue.  Acid indigestion happening with it??  Could you have a kidney infection or stone?  When something persists, and you are 'nagged' about it by concern, that tells me anyway, it's time to be seen.  Good Luck and take care!  \n\nI am not a doctor, just have a little bit of medical training.
"It is normal for a man to feel ""weak"" after sex because men go through a refractory period after ejaculation and orgasm, which means, he cannot climax again during that time period until refractory time is up... For a female, this period does not occur, which allows for multiple orgasms that are very hard to count at climax, but amazing. LoL. You're at the prime time for sex. It's not really avoidable...having sex so frequently won't improve it."
Listen to be honest with you it's not always ok to act happy. You need to get things off your chest once in a while. Mankind was not made to be able to sustain happiness. So, I suggest finding a way to relieve your anger, stress, slowly and not bottle it up. Tell someone when they pisss you off, don't just let it pass and smile.
As the first author mentioned, Halothane was the potent inhalational anesthetic that people probably used in 1958.  It came out in 1956.  You received this gas through the circle system ventilator which was already in use at that time.  In addition there was muscle relaxant used (most likely curare at that time) and a narcotic (most likely morphine at that time.)
Believe it or not, it is very true. On average, people ingest between 2-3 spiders per year while they are sleeping. Spiders (and other insects) like dark, damp places to hide, and your mouth is sometimes seen as a 'perfect' place to hide. Gross, isn't it? \n\nDon't stress to much about it though, chances are you have already eaten a couple of dozen spiders and you never even knew about it. Just think of it as protein! Sweet dreams...

"Coronary heart disease (CHD), also called coronary artery disease (CAD) and atherosclerotic heart disease, is the end result of the accumulation of atheromatous plaques within the walls of the arteries that supply the myocardium (the muscle of the heart). While the symptoms and signs of coronary heart disease are noted in the advanced state of disease, most individuals with coronary heart disease show no evidence of disease for decades as the disease progresses before the first onset of symptoms, often a ""sudden"" heart attack, finally arise. After decades of progression, some of these atheromatous plaques may rupture and (along with the activation of the blood clotting system) start limiting blood flow to the heart muscle. The disease is the most common cause of sudden death."
Try to Develop more positive thoughts, and remove or be indifferent to negative thoughts.  Look at negative feelings / incidents as passsing clouds. Apply the same temperment towards your relationship with frinds and foes.  Another importnat attitude is freely move with society and frinds, without hurting any one, and controlling your hard feelings (and avoid expressing it)and don't do outright criticism.  Even mind control and Yoga may help.  Try to be like a 'good snake'that hisses but does not bite.  Last but not least is that dont get envy / jealous looking at others success.\n\nI used to be like you, and even more depressed than you.  But I am changing for good.

Most health care providers adhere to the best preventive - washing hands.  They do so between patients, procedures, you name it.  It will work for you.  Beyond that, don't brush off symptoms thinking they will pass in time.  Have it checked.  Keep in mind, if your in your first year in a health care field, illnesses can be rampant until your immune system builds up.  That is a problems with kids today.  Many are not allowed to get dirty leaving nothing for their immune system to fight.  Same with animals.  Kids that are around cats and dogs from an early age will build up imunitites and not become allergic.  Hope this helps.
I cannot imagine anyone not wanting to be an organ donor, why is it that there are so few and so many people have been waiting for years and there are people commiting suicide and dying every day all over the universe, I don't quite understand why the hold up  for so many.

I have 4 children... My husband is ADHD and I am ADD... we did not realize this until we had our son tested for ADHD. I do know that when we started to see the signs in our son we started to realize that the problems and certain things we did as kids were the same things our son does. Our girls who are next in line have ADD and ADHD symptoms. The same symptoms my son had not to mention that they look like mirror images of ourselves. We have a small house and our house gets pretty loud and wild. We are a happy family. My husband and I believe that his siblings may have some of the same symptoms. So in my opinion and experience yes it is possible.

Infectious mononucleosis (also known in North America as mono, the kissing disease or Pfeiffer's disease, and more commonly known as glandular fever in other English-speaking countries) is a disease seen most commonly in adolescents and young adults, characterized by fever, sore throat and fatigue. It is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or the cytomegalovirus (CMV). It is typically transmitted from asymptomatic individuals through saliva or blood, often through kissing, or by sharing a drinking glass, eating utensil or needle. The disease is far less contagious than is commonly thought. Since the causative virus is also found in the mucous of the infected person, it can also spread through coughing or sneezing.\n\nA person can be infected with the virus for weeks or months before any symptoms begin to appear. Symptoms usually begin to appear 4-7 weeks after infection and may resemble strep throat or other bacterial or viral respiratory infections. These first signs of the disease are commonly confused with cold and flu symptoms. The typical symptoms and signs of mononucleosis are:\n\nFever - this varies from mild to severe, but is seen in nearly all cases. \nEnlarged and tender lymph nodes - particularly the posterior cervical lymph nodes, on both sides of the neck. \nSore throat (throat infection) - nearly all patients with EBV-mononucleosis have symptoms similar to tonsillitis. \nFatigue (sometimes extreme fatigue) \nSome patients may also display:\n\nEnlarged spleen (splenomegaly) or liver (hepatomegaly), which may later rupture \nAbdominal pain \nAching muscles \nHeadache \nLoss of appetite \nJaundice \nSinus infection \nDepression \nWeakness \nSkin rash \nAfter an initial prodrome of 1-2 weeks, the fatigue of mono often lasts from 1-2 months. The virus can remain dormant in the B cells indefinitely after symptoms have disappeared, and resurface at a later date. Many people exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus do not show symptoms of the disease, but carry the virus and can transmit it to others. This is especially true in children, in whom infection seldom causes more than a very mild illness which often goes undiagnosed. This feature, along with mono's long incubation period, makes epidemiological control of the disease impractical. About 6% of people who have had mono will relapse.
I'm social phobic too. Some days are worse than others but generally, every time I leave my home and put myself in a social situation (even if it's just going to the local corner store) my mind is racing with thoughts about people looking at me, judging me or waiting for me to make some sort of embarrassing mistake. No matter how much I tell myself how irrational these thoughts are, it still doesn't take away the anxiety. It has affected my life and still does to a certain extent.\nThere are a couple of things you can do about it. You can go see your doctor and he/she will put you on an anti-anxiety medication like Paxil or something similar to it and maybe even give you something to deal with acute anxiety too, like Clonazepam. Just make sure you research the side effects of anything your doctor puts you on because with anti-anxiety meds, you do have options. (I know what you're thinking....this means you have to sit in the waiting room at the doctor's office and even worse yet, you have to walk through the door not knowing how many people are going to be looking at you).\nThe other thing that you'll find helpful is to establish a comfortable place outside of your home, like a park or a daily trip through the drive-through at a coffee shop. The reason for this is that it will expand your comfort zone. It's tough to do at first but locking yourself up in your home will only amplify your anxiety when you do have to go out. Familiarity goes a long long way.\nYou might always feel anxious when you go somewhere and it feels even worse when you HAVE to go somewhere. Don't psych yourself up about it, just do it......and remember, you're not alone dealing with this sort of thing.\nHope this helps!
If you told me the state you live in, I would be able to find a web page for you to check. All states have licensing verification online these days through their state medical board.

Don't take steroids. Also they make your nuts smaller, not your penis moron. You usually don't get boobs from them either. Usually it is rage, bacne and small nuts. There are long term health risks. You could probably gain almost a pound a week without if you do it right. Steroirds are cheating anyway. Don't be a pu$$Y.
Guilty. I am a sloppy person, not disgustingly sloppy or anything, but defiantly messy. I don't know why, I guess I don't have the attention to detail that some people have. I'm pretty laid back for the most part and already have enough things to worry about without letting the smaller things bother me.\n\nIt also depends on your definition of sloppy. I am unorganized, but not dirty. I guess it is low maintenance versus high maintenance. I would describe myself as a jeans and tee-shirt gal, wash and wear.

my front teeth are crooked, i have more cavities than i can count and my wisdom teeth are coming in and crumbling as soon as they break the surface. I steer clear of sweets as much as possible but the main problem is i am TERRIFIED of the dentist. The last time I went I had a panic attack in the waiting room. The smell makes me want to gag. I can't even watch my fiance brush his teeth, it just grosses me out. I think I have a teeth phobia maybe...
Yes that could be a reaction to sinusitis.  Hope you are taking antibiotics?
If you want to lose weight (since this was in the diet category), you shouldn't eat and then head to bed.  You want to give your body time to burn off some of those calories first.
yes you can, but be careful about vitamin overdose,specially vitamins A,D,E,K. you'd better to see your doctor to decide about your real need to vitamins.

The following medical conditions are some of the possible causes of Bleeding gums as a symptom.

It will determine what types of blood types the baby may have.  But, apparently there can't be any adverse affects.\n\nIf a father's Rh factor genes are + +, and the mother's are + +, the baby will have one + from the father and one + gene from the mother. The baby will be + + Rh positive. (this is the case for A+ and AB+ parents)\n\nProblems with the Rh factor occur when the mother's Rh factor is negative and the baby's is positive. Sometimes, an incompatibility may occur when the mother is blood type O and the baby is either A or B.\n\nSee the source for further information, or ask your doctor because i'm not in the medical profession.

"Red cells have very little DNA so this is not a problem. Only white cells have DNA but most transfusions are now of leucodepleted red cells so an incredibly small amount of DNA is transfused, any that is will be removed through the normal processes of cell destruction and sequestration and will not replicate or ""change"" the DNA of the individual. The only thing that can change is the ABO/RhD blood group when a stem cell transfusion has taken place"
"Self hypnotize yourself to sleep. Close your eyes. Picture a place that makes you the most happy..mountains,beach,green pastures, something you can picture in detail. Then begin to 'build' it in your mind. Begin with things closest to you and then work outwards, and as you imagine outwards imagine yourself moving slowly forward. It helps if you think the sentence""slowly I walk....."" as you move outwards.\n Best way to describe it is for me to tell you mine I guess. I imagine the sky dark,the only light being the moon..it's full. I hear the ocean as it comes in and out. Slowly I walk toward it feeling cool sand on my bare feet. I creep closer and closer to the shoreline. First just my toes get submerged in the warm water, then my calves(you have to actually see and hear your imagery it'll take practice before you can do it real good.) Long imagery short I eventually end up fully submerged and swim slowly to the very bottom of the water where there is a small pin prick of light (the pinprick of light is important you need it in yours too) I slowly make my way to it and as I move closer it gets gradually bigger. If I'm still awake after I reach it I imagine going through it until I am on the other side which is sky blue and I 'float' through the air. You have to make your senses cooperate with you...hearing smelling and feeling everything imagined. This really works and it's a technique I read in a book years ago when I was younger. Can't remember the book just the technique. It puts me to sleep every time and everyone I have shared it with has found peaceful slumber also. Oh big detail make sure your room is quiet and dark unless the dark bothers you."
"Hemoglobin in the red blood cells comes in several forms. F is 'fetal' and isn't produced after birth. S is the sickle cell type, and so on. A is one of these, and 1c is a subtype of A. There are several names / abbreviations for it; it is also called glycosolated hemoglobin. It reacts with glucose to form a permanent combination. The modification of this form of hemoglobin has no particular affect on oxygen transport and so is without much effect, save as a record of glucose levels. \n\nFurthermore the reaction goes forward at a nearly constant rate, depending on the concentration of blood glucose. Since red blood cells last about 90-120 days in the blood before being recycled, the amount of HbA1c is proportional to the average blood glucose over the last 3 months or so (with some increased weight to the last few weeks in that period). \n\nThe usual value in a non-diabetic is around 5, and in diabetics with good sustained glucose control will be 6 or perhaps 6.5 or less. Values above perhaps 7 are evidence of sustained poor blood glucose control. \n\n\n\nAnother similar test is the ""fructosamine"" test. Like HabA1c, it measures the results of a relatively constant reaction rate with glucose, but in this case with blood protein (mostly albumin). It is reprocessed much faster than red blood cells; the value reflects average blood glucose over about 2 weeks."
You can apply a thing called a hot potise ( I dont think ive spelled it right !! ) .. Get a slice of bread cover it in boiling water then add some salt .. Leave it for a couple of seconds for the salt to soak in & then apply it as hot as you can for as long as you can to the boil.. It will bring the boil to a head & then it will burst.. It really works I used it on a nasty underarm boil & it was great

"In California, to be a medical assistant, you only have to have a high school diploma and a few months of extra training at a vocational school.  If you are a physician, your level of education is WAY to high to be working as a medical assistant.  Why wouldn't you to try to become licensed as a doctor in the United States?  \n\nIf you go on the Medical Board of California website and enter ""International Graduate,"" into the search engine, you can get a form for becoming licensed or gaining additional training/supervision here. \n\nAt the VERY LEAST, with your training, you should try to be a Physician Assistant (P.A.) or a Certified Nurse Practitioner (N.P.)  Then you can work almost as you would if you were a licensed physician; you just have to have a physician ""supervising"" you.  There is more information on the Medical Board website.  I encourage you to use the skills and training that you have...Good luck!"
First of all, the numbers you are stating, are the inches around her ribcage just below her breasts.  I have no idea why no one realizes this.  This does NOT indicate the size of her breasts.

Wilson's Syndrome\n\nIf you have a body temperature of less than 98.6 F. and some of the following symptoms you probably have Wilson's Syndrome. This condition involves a disorder where the cells of the body are unable to convert the inactive thyroid hormone, T4, into the more active hormone, T3. Wilson's Syndrome itself does not alter the thyroid hormone tests. It may exist in association with true hypothyroidism, however. In these cases, thyroid tests may be abnormal but the usually prescribed thyroid hormones may not entirely solve the problem.\n\nIf you suspect that you have Wilson's Syndrome, take your temperature with an accurate glass/mercury thermometer orally 3 hours after getting up and every 3 hours times 3 for a couple of days. If your temperature averages a few 10ths of a degree below 98.6F., and you have several of the above symptoms, you have Wilson's Syndrome.
Well..at 29 Years old, I still get a stray one from time to time. Blessed with oily skin from my mom. Anyhow, I have found that using Neutrogena Deep Clean Facial Wash, and tend to follwo up with a swipe of Stridex pads. Has been quite helpful.
yes, you could have Irritable Bowl Sndrome.  I have it and it took us 5 months to figure out!  Your doctor would probably want a colonoscopy done, and I warn you they make you drink this nasty laxitive that will clear out whatever is left in your colon.  You will only be able to drink clear liquid the day before, broth, popscicles, jello that sort of thing but nothing red because it can temporarly stain the colon and make the doctor think you have internal bleeding. They generally knock you completly out and you may be a bit sore after words but its worth it to make sure you don't have something worse.\nPlease cut back on drinking too, it could be causing it and you will get liver problems in the future if you don't  slow down! \nGood luck
64 ounces. This is the recommended amount for everyone. Tap, distilled, spring, it doesn't matter. Drink whatever water you like. Personally I drink Deja Blue.
Lung cancer is very serious,They usually don't last that long,Maybe 6 months.But it also depends on if it a fast growing cancer.As for her spin,It sounds like it has spread.I am so sorry to hear this,I pray that God give you strength.And in God's timing she will go.But also if your grandmother has a fighting spirit and a great will to live,That does keep people around longer.
It depends on what you mean by nice upper body. Strength or appearance? You will not be able to see the results unless you tone down (or up I guess) overall. You can target muscles but you can't spot reduce. Example: You could have awesome abs but never see them because all you've done is crunches and haven't toned the rest of your body. Cardio and weight lifting are great ways to reduce excess fat. If your body is already trim, then you will see your results. There are many areas of the upper body to work: triceps, biceps, deltoids, lats, traps,... Push ups and sit ups will not engage all of these muscles.
The best overall cardio workouts burning the greatest amount of calories, simulatanously giving you the greatest peripheral pump to your upper torso and working your heart are Cross-country skiing and Rock-climbing.  \n\nContrary to popular belief non-competitive swimming is not even on the top five due to your buoancy in water.\n\nhttp://www.preventdisease.com/healthtools/articles/various_sports.html

Sell? Yes. Donate? Yes. Give away? Yes. We women produce SO many eggs that end up as nothing. And when there are so many people out there that would do anything to be parents it is nothing to give what would have been nothing! As for the fear of needles - it's a lot less painful to have a needle in your belly than in your arm, leg or buttock! As for a husband PRESSURING me to do it, without knowing the circunstances it is hard to make a decision, but my gut reacton is - LEAVE THE B*S**RD he has NO respect for you and may think of you as his own personal egg factory for his private income!! A women selling/donating her eggs is about a whole lot more than financial considerations!
Bacteria is usually the cause of body odor. Bacteria produce gases as a waste product that can have an unpleasant odor. When we take baths and use deodorant, these bacteria are washed away/killed. Body odor is natural, but sometimes can be a symptom of an underlying problem. Here is an article that can explain more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_odor\n\nBody odor is also a very social issue. Some cultures do not bathe as regularly as those in Western cultures. This does not make them gross by their standards, but may offend us. The nose gets used to certain smells over time. Just remember, no one smells like a rose garden naturally. Everyone stinks, including you ane me.
There are special schools for massage therapy but not every state requires you to be a licensed massage therapist to set up business- this is why those escort services with happy endings exist and call themselves massage parlors. I'm not sure which states require a license- certification or some type of training but I think all of them should.
Yes, you could be pregnant.  It will take you longer to find out if you are pregnant than if you weren't on birth control, because sometimes it takes a while for your body to get back on a cycle after you quit birth control, so it is not abnormal to not have a period for six or eight weeks after you go off and that may not necessarily mean you are pregnant.  I would give it three more weeks and then test.  It won't hurt.  But if you get a negative, it doesn't necessarily  mean you are not.  The only way to know for sure is to get a blood or urine test done.  If you got pregnant two weeks ago they would know by now with a blood or urine test.
I think so too, but too many lobbyists will never allow it to happen. btw ... I have an uncle that says, back before insurance was really used that much, health care was relatively affordable. But when people found out they could charge insurance companies more, it made things go up. So I have to wonder, if you took insurance out of the picture, if prices would fall. Don't mind me I'm just ramblin lol

"For your benefit, and information, I feel it wise to inform you that penis enlargement pills do not actually increase the literal size or length of your penis, but merely ""improve"" blood circulation and flow to the nether-region to give the erection a slightly larger, more ""engorged"" (and therefore, larger) in appearance.  So really, they should be called something other than ""penis enlargement pills.""  \n\nDepending on which brand of so-called ""penis enlargement pills"" you intend to try, you may be ingesting organic (natural) extracts, herbal substances, vitamins, flavors, fillers, dyes, waxes, binders, etc.  There has also been some evidence and documentation of these products being contaminated by a number of undesirable ingredients.  (For more information about this in general, see the Wiki article I've linked you to in my sources.)\n\nAs far as side-effects are concerned, depending on which ingredients are used in the ""penis enlargement"" pill you've chosen, you may experience many of the side-effects involved in taking stimulants and other medications which oxygenate the blood and improve circulation.  Specifically, some of those side effects may include:  upset stomach, nausea, anxiety, hallucinations, insomnia, headaches, loss of muscle function, increased blood pressure as well as rapid heartbeat, dizziness, and severe hypertension to name a few...  ***It should be noted that these side-effects are presumably possible in a normal, otherwise healthy subject.  These pills may actually exacerbate any negative symptoms or complaints accompanying previously existing medical conditions such as high blood pressure...\n\nPersonally, I believe ""penis enlargement"" pills are not a necessity for sexual performance or vitality.  Perhaps they have a ""placebo-like"" value to them, which helps improve the consumer's self-esteem, ego, and self-image which is definitely beneficial as far as boosting the individual's confidence in intimate situations, but they shouldn't ever be a requirement.  In my opinion, if you want to be in the ranks of male ""sexual dynamos"" and ""great lovers,"" you should be more concerned about learning how to properly ""USE"" the equipment you were born with for the maximum benefit and pleasure of yourself, as well as those with whom you have sexual interactions, and less concerned about the physical ""size"" of your equipment.  It has been my experience that guys who are obsessed with increasing the size of their package think that increased size will compensate for poor technique and what I like to call, ""operator error.""  =)  \n\nPenile penetration isn't everything, however.  Learning to administer pleasure in other ways, (i.e., massage, or perhaps incorporating sexual aids and toys) may be a positive and healthy alternative to imaginary ""penis enlargement.""  You may discover that seeking alternative methods and means of giving and receiving pleasure is very sexually stimulating as well as sexually satisfying.  \n\nSo basically, in this girl's opinion, SIZE REALLY DOESN'T MATTER, as long as you know how to ""work it"" with what you've got!  \n\nCheers!"

"try taboo\nWHAT to eat for losing weight\n\n• Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, especially NC (negative calorie) food.\n\n* Print these lists. They will be your ... ""Bible"", from now on !\n* Dill and parsely - include them in all your salads. Also ognion + garlic.\n* Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits (whenever possible, of course)\n* If you really want a book, then check this out: The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook (Win95/98 only). Read more about this e-book here.\n\n\n• Eat fish, chicken, beef, pork. (preferences are in this order)\n\n* If you are a vegetarian, then ignore this!\n* Avoid fat meat\n\n\n• Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day. Don't EVER exclude bread from your diet!\n\n• Snacks between meals (if needed): apples, oranges, grepfruits and other NC fruits\n\n* Don't cheat ... NO cookies, chips, candies, brownies etc! \n* EVEN if they have ""low fat"" indication... They might have low fat, yet they can have lots of CALORIES !!!\n\n\n• About rice, potatoes, beans, [xxx]nuts, pastry, pasta... you know!\n\n* Don't eat too much of those, at least during the first weeks of the diet. I'm not a low carb addict, but I've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities, especially when associated with other foods.\n* If you like them a lot, try and eat them like one meal. A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch (never dinner!), followed by a nice big apple. These rich starch foods are not good for dinner!\n* At dinner time, chose mainly large mixed veggies salads... with fish, lean meat or cheese (if you are not a vegetarian). \n\nif u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it. no salt no nothing just plain. u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound. i heard that from a weight loss tape. the best drink is water or gatorade. thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo. if u want a macine. run with dumbells on a treadmill. u could do the rocky workout. but thats a new story. u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs\n\n1) It is not just the amount you eat, but what you eat. Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start. And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever.\n\n2) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day. Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for you to feel labored. The other half of the time use weights, or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle ""burn"". A gym is also an option, but I don't know if you have the money for or want to spend the money on it.\n\n3) Sleep well. To bed earlier and up earlier. Exercise in the morning when you wake up, not in the evening before bed. 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must.\n\n4) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time. A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom.\n\nThat is a good place to start... if you see good results, keep it up and modify to fit you... if it does not, see a doctor AND a trainer \n\nKeep working out, drink water a lot, eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities, vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice, fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours, minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important, your last meal must be before you sleep by 2 to 3 hours\nthe most important thing is you don't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what you want\n\nyou might have some more ideas from www.ivillage.com\n\ngood luck"

yeah, she has it, vitamin e in a liquid capsule is the best bet.  Just break open the capsule and rub it into the scar nightly.  Try not to overdo the sun while the scar is new, that can make it worse.  I have heard some people suggest tea tree oil as well.  It is a natural antiseptic and is reportedly good for the skin.
good luck to your sun and you\ncall 911 \n i hope all is well my prayers for you and the family
yes bet it depends on how much u gain and how much u lose, it if is alot i suggest u see a doctor abt this just so it isnt anything serious
Colonic irrigation can potentially cause severe adverse effects and must be carefully administered. People receiving frequent treatments may absorb too much water, leading to electrolyte imbalances in the blood, nausea, vomiting, heart failure, fluid in the lungs, abnormal heart rhythms or coma. Infections have been reported, possibly because of contaminated equipment or as a result of clearing out normal colon bacteria. There is a risk of bowel perforation (breakage of the bowel wall), which is a severe complication. Deaths have been reported. \n\n\nColonic irrigation should not be used in people with diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, severe or internal hemorrhoids or tumors in the rectum or colon. It also should not be used soon after bowel surgery (unless directed by your health care provider). Regular treatments should be avoided by people with heart disease or kidney disease (renal insufficiency). Be sure that the equipment used is sterile and that the practitioner is experienced. Colonic irrigation should not be used as the sole treatment (instead of more proven therapies) for severe conditions, and it should not delay consultation with a qualified health care provider for a potentially severe symptom or illness.  http://www.intelihealth.com/IH/ihtIH/WSIHW000/8513/34968/358752.html?d=dmtContent\n\n\nThere is more scientific information gathered from studies at this link:  http://www.meridianinstitute.com/reports/colonic1.html

>Epilepsy (Seizure Disorder)\n\nWhat is epilepsy?\nEpilepsy, a physical condition caused by sudden, brief changes in how the brain works, is estimated to affect one percent of the U.S. population, about 2.5 million people. In about half of all cases no cause can be found, but head injuries, brain tumors, lead poisoning, problems in brain development before birth, and certain genetic and infectious illnesses can all cause epilepsy.\n\nEpilepsy occurs when nerve cells in the brain fire electrical impulses at a rate of up to four times higher than normal. This causes a sort of electrical storm in the brain, known as a seizure. A pattern of repeated seizure is referred to as epilepsy. Medication controls seizure for the majority of patients, who are otherwise healthy and able to live full and productive lives. On the other hand, at least 200,000 Americans have seizure more than once a month. Their lives are devastated by frequent, uncontrollable seizure or associated disabilities.\n\nThis past decade has seen a dramatic increase in our knowledge about epilepsy, but there remains much tragedy in the lives of many people with the disorder. To brighten tomorrow's outlook for those who must live with seizure, the epilepsy research community continues to concentrate its efforts on:\n\nWhat are the causes of epilepsy?\nBasic research aims to identify viral, genetic, or other factors that cause epilepsy. These findings provide the basis for developing new and improved methods of prevention and therapy.\n\nWhat are the newest means of diagnosis?\nScientists are using promising new technologies such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetoencephalography to diagnose epilepsy and pinpoint seizure location.\n\nIs there any treatment?\nThe goal of modern neurological research is to develop safe, well-tolerated drugs that control seizure. Basic research has brought some of the now more commonly prescribed anticonvulsant drugs to the market. Scientists are also developing ways to test new and better drugs in patients.\n\nIMPROVING AND DEVELOPING NEW SURGICAL TECHNIQUES\nThis form of treatment, performed at epilepsy clinical research centers, is now an option for more people with epilepsy, including children. For patients whose seizure cannot be controlled with drugs, surgery can turn the dream of a seizure-free life into a reality. Improved technology has made it possible to identify more accurately where seizure originate in the brain and to what extent surgery may affect vital functions, such as smell and speech. As a result, investigators estimate that 2,000 to 5,000 new patients in the United States might be suitable for surgery each year.
If I were a doctor, i would do a sternotomy and open the pleura then I will be able to see the heart.  after that, i will put the patient in the cardiac by-pass pump and open the heart with a scalpel. that's it

That depends on the question.
Drink plenty of water.  Add fiber to your diet - prunes, apples, oat bran, and carrots are good.  During an attack, peppermint oil extract helps.  You can get capsules or pills that are enteric coated.  0.2 millimeter of peppermint oil is recommended.  Drinking peppermint tea can also be soothing.  Try to asses what foods trigger attacks and avoid them.  You can get a supplement called Robert's Formula at health food stores that also may help.  Stress can also trigger an attack so do whatever you can to keep your stress at a minimum.  Take time for yourself - it will keep you healthier.
I'm not a doctor, but I'm pretty sure that they are just vitamins, so there would be no negative side effects to taking it. I took mine after I had a baby and I lived.

This is a complicated situation for you to be in. and it is a situation that depends a lot on why she chooses to remain a virgin (maybe she wants to remain a virgin until she is married, or is she afraid of having sex?)\nThe most important thing is for you to be understanding and patient. My first time was not a good memory mainly because the guy was a bit pushy. this has had the affect of making me close up very quickly when anybody pushes me around. so avoid pressuring her at all costs! \nwhen it comes to explaining sex... well, i think theres only so much you can talk about- you learn the most by actually doing it. \nwhen it comes to oral... well, the best way to convince her is to give her oral. \ni could help u a lot more if i knew a bit more more about the problem (a lot depends on the current state of your sexual relationship, and on why she chooses not to have sex) if u told me more, i could probably help more...
"I have had fibro for twenty years now and I can tell you from my personal experience, pain medications do not work. I have tried everything up to Fentynl patches with Actiq suckers. The amount of pain medication that I require is too toxic to my system. After being on pain meds my liver function was consistent with Hepatitis induced from drugs, I had Type II diabetes, high blood pressure, rotting teeth, and terrible bowel problems from the pain meds shutting down my gut. I awoke one day with paramedics looking over me with my husband. I had come out of a seizure (which I'd never had before) and a temp of 107.5. Scary. Moral of the story, pain medication is not effective in Fibro pain treatment because if increasing resistance to the medication it builds up to toxic levels. You are really better off taking a good muscle relaxant (I am on Zanaflex)\n\nAs far as insomnia, first have a Sleep Study performed. Mine was ordered by a Neurologist This will tell you what is happening when and if you sleep. For instance I found out that I had three types of insomnia: chronic, initial (can't fall asleep), and maintenance can't stay asleep). I also get no REM sleep which explains the extreme fatigue. You can then work with your doctor to address your problems. \n\nThe fibro fog can be from medication side effects &/or the bodies concentration on the pain signals it is constantly receiving. I believe the fog is a combination of both and it is genuine. Sometimes I can't find words to say that I speak all the time. Or I forget things a lot. My computer calendar has helped tremendously. A study was performed to explain why we feel so much pain. You can find it at http://www.fibrohugs.com/article.php?story=20040301120311535\nThe increased pain response kicks our bodies into the ""fight or flight response"". Medscape explains that pain alerts the central nervous system to the presence of a major stressor to the body; one that demands a response. Pain experiences are typically accompanied by systemic responses similar to those that characterize the ""fight or flight"" dynamic. These responses are caused by the involuntary release of norepinephrine and adrenaline, which causes increased mental alertness, muscle tone, respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels. Facilitated clotting factor, shunting of blood from the viscera to skeletal muscles, increased visual acuity, and sweating also occur when catecholamines are released. The ""flight or fight"" response, although clearly beneficial to the endangered organism, can be a threat to the individual with chronic pain. Further, the level of high acuity and anxiety commonly associated with the ""flight or fight"" response is often caused by the anticipation of a painful event rather than the actual ""experience"" of one.\n\nTry taking warm baths in Epson Salt. It contains Magnesium Magnesium allows oxygen into your muscles, reducing cramping and spasms. Consult your doctor or a nutritionist to have your Magnesuim level checked- it is a simpe mouth swab and not painful. If you have a low level, which most people with Fibro do have, take Magnesium and Malic Acid supplements. There are a few studies listed below that explain the rationale of using the combination in treatment of Fibro. \n\nTry eliminating Monsodium Glutamate from your diet. I did and some of my symptoms (chronic headaches and nausea) went away. It is in everything from Doritos to chicken soup. A few key finding's of an FDA study found MSG to cause a ""burning sensation in the back of the neck, forearms and chest"". \n\nIf you need adjustments try to see a D.O. that is familiar with Firbro instead of a chiropractor. In my opinion Chiropractors tend to be a little more violent in their adjustments and can cause more pain in your soft tissue. D.O.s do a more passive adjustment.\n\nBefore you exercise make sure you really stretch out and breathe de"
Well prayer is certainly not the answer you need though it may help it is not a program. You need to talk with your school guidance counselor or your church pastor,priest, someone you trust. There are many approaches you can take at your age, alot will depend on what is going on with you and how bad your drug problem is. You are seeking help and that is a great first step, if it isn't for you then get your friend the help he/she needs before they get too far down that long dark alley.

You should buy some arch-supporting inserts for your footwear; I was in the Army for 9 years, and that's how I resolved my arch pain from all the marching I did, etc.. Also, at the end of the day, soak your feet in very warm water that has a 'peppermint-y' foot-soak powder mixed in..

"Depending on where in Canada you would like to get a job as a nurse because each province has a College of Nurses. You would have to contact them and find out all the requirements to become licensed in that province. In Ontario you can contact the College of Nurses on their web site as follows- www.cno.org. I know this because I am a nurse in Ontario. I noticed at the end of your question you stated ""job in USA"". I know each that they have a similar system to ours in regards to licensing. You'd have to contact that states specific ""college"" as well. I hope this can help you somewhat to get you started towards your goal. Good luck!!!"

Lemon: \nLemon is an ideal fruit, which helps in losing weight.\n\nLemon & Water: \nA glass of warm water with one lemon squeezed in it (remember no sugar) is ideal to lose weight.\n\nTea:\nMake green tea (without milk) and squeeze in half a lemon and have it 2- 3 times a day or more, this is an ideal remedy to reduce weight and stop those hunger pangs.\n\nFood to Lose: \nWhenever hunger strikes its better to eat food that is low in calories and is very filling, such foods are Corn, Beans, pulses and brown bread. Replace your white bread with Brown bread, which is rich in fiber and very stomach filling unlike white bread, which makes you feel hungrier.
I took Accutane, a prescribed medication for serious acne. It has a high success rate, however, doctors are wary of prescribing it because it does have some side effects. Also, you have to take a monthly blood test so they can see if you are pregnant. Otherwise, if you are you must stop the meds immediately because it causes severe birth defects. All in all, a wonderful medication that changed my life. However, I guess there are some downfalls where ever you look.
I took Effexor, and had the same problem, it will go away in a few weeks. I just dealt with it.
Over-the-Counter:  First Response or EPT\n\nHowever, a blood test from Dr is most accurate.
I would agree that you should see a doctor, however I think you should go to a reputable chiropractor.  I have worked for a chiropractic clinic for 4 years.  This could very well be something needing to be re-aligned in your neck or upper back.  It would explain some of the symptoms that you listed. Good luck!!  Do me a favor and let me know what you find out.  But please----------do NOT think that pain meds are the answer.  They only MASK the pain for awhile, no problems are solved.
"Absolutely not!!\n\nHealthy semen (that is, produced by a well-nourished, disease-free male) is in fact not only safe to eat, but actually good for you! Seminal fluid is a veritable nutrient-rich soup. Semen is a source of highly concentrated, high-quality protein. In dietary terms, it's comparable to egg whites or gelatin.\n\nBesides protein, semen contains high concentrations of some minerals, such as zinc, and trace amounts of other important nutrients, like calcium and magnesium. While you shouldn't depend on a shot of it to get your recommended daily allowances of vitamins and minerals, swallowing semen on a regular basis can't hurt as a dietary supplement.\n\nDo be sure to note the words ""disease-free"" above. If STDs are a concern or you are not in a monogamous relationship, always use a condom, even for oral-sex."

It is not necessarily the exercises rather how you do them. You should pick four or five exercises for each body part, chest monday, legs tuesday etc and do 4 sets each comprising of 15 to 20 repetitions making the last rep of each set very challenging. You only need to exercise a particular body part once every five to seven day seven being the best but really hit it when you do. This will firm and tone the muscles however to see your results you must diet and do cardio.

Not everyone with a UTI develops recognizable signs and symptoms, but most people have some. These can include:\n\nA strong, persistent urge to urinate \nA burning sensation when urinating \nPassing frequent, small amounts of urine \nBlood in the urine (hematuria) or cloudy, strong-smelling urine \n\nEach type of UTI may result in more specific signs and symptoms, depending on which part of your urinary tract is infected:\n\nAcute pyelonephritis. Infection of your kidneys may occur after spreading from an infection in your bladder. Kidney infection can cause flank pain, high fever, shaking chills, and nausea or vomiting. \nCystitis. Inflammation or infection of your bladder may result in pressure in the pelvis and lower abdomen and strong-smelling urine. \nUrethritis. Inflammation or infection of the urethra leads to burning with urination and sometimes pus in your urine. In men, urethritis may cause penile discharge. \n\n\nYou can take steps to reduce your risk of urinary tract infections. Women in particular may benefit from the following:\n\nDrink plenty of liquids, especially water. Cranberry juice may have infection-fighting properties. However, don't drink cranberry juice if you're taking the blood-thinning medication warfarin. Possible interactions between cranberry juice and warfarin can lead to bleeding. \nUrinate frequently. Avoid retaining your urine for a long time after you feel the urge to void. \nWipe from front to back. Doing so after urinating and after a bowel movement helps prevent bacteria in the anal region from spreading to the vagina and urethra. \nEmpty your bladder as soon as possible after intercourse. Also, drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria. \nAvoid potentially irritating feminine products. Using deodorant sprays or other feminine products, such as douches and powders, in the genital area, can irritate the urethra\n\n\nUTIs can be painful, but you can take steps to ease your discomfort until antibiotics clear the infection. Follow these tips:\n\nUse a heating pad. Sometimes a heating pad placed over the abdomen can help minimize feelings of bladder pressure or pain. \nDrink plenty of fluids. However, avoid coffee, alcohol, and soft drinks containing citrus juices and caffeine until your infection has cleared, because these things can irritate your bladder and tend to aggravate your frequent or urgent need to urinate. \nIf you have recurrent bladder infections, let your doctor know. Together you can determine a strategy to reduce recurrences and the discomfort UTIs can bring.
If you eat or drink a pound of anything, even water, you will TEMPORARILY gain one pound.  But long term weight gain is determined by the amount of calories in food, not how much it weighs.  A pound of water has zero calories and will just get pee'ed out.  A pound of spagetti has several hundred calories.  Our bodies burn calories constantly, for most people between 2000 - 3000 per day, more with exercise. 3500 unburned calories is equal to 1 pound of weight gain.  So, if you wanted to gain 1 pound in 1 day, and your body burned 2000 calories per day, you could accomplish this by eating 5500 calories (that is, 3500 extra calories) in that day.

Nurses in clinics are the mid-level practioners of medical care and assessments.  They will often screen patients (called Triage) to determine exactly what the baseline problem is and prepare the doctors space to quickly and efficiently do his own assessment.\n\nIf medications are needed, the doctor will provide orders and the nurse will then follow up with this part of the patients care.\n\nIn the case of Nurse Practitioners, they are often primary care givers in the place of doctors and can do many assessments with the backing of a physician in the clinic.  They can provide perscriptions for certain medications and do assessments such as PAP smears, etc.

People who smell bad, or have bad breath often times don't realize it. Sometimes it becomes apparent from the reactions of other people, sometimes it doesn't. If you kiss someone with bad breath, it usually hits you right in the face (no pun intended!).
Don't look for a quick solution like medications (unless if you consider your nervousness bad enough to need medications as a side treatment). The answer for the relief of nervousness, same as any other psychological problem, is to find out what is causing it. What goes through your mind when this is happening? Monitor your thought patterns. Don't try to change anything or think or feel differently, that only makes things worse. Your only job is to realise what is happening, what goes through your mind exactly. At times this will give you an instant relief. At other times the problem is much deeper and more chronic, and realising what you are thinking does not make the problem go away straight away. But even though you may not realise it, doing this will gradually make those forces inside you weaker and weaker everytime you monitor those thoughts. After a while you will realise that the nervousness is not that intense anymore and if you keep going it will be completely resolved. \n\nUsually monitoring your thoughts will give you MUCH MUCH more than you bargained for. Realising one little thing could lead to realising other things and before you know it you can have much more overall life satisfaction...
Sugar and BP both can make you dizzy and feel sick at your tummy. There are medicines your doctor can prescribe for the panic attacks and anxiety. Just call him and let him know what is going on. He will know what you can take that won't counteract with your other medicines.
Usually normal babies this age can begin eating strained or pureed foods at first.  Plain rice could be difficult or dangerous for the baby if it is still firm as he/she could choke on it.  It would be best to ask your Doctor for advice pertaining to your baby in case there are some special concerns and for a general nutrition plan.  Also, there are many good books and pamphlets about this available from WIC or at your pediatrician's office.

"I looked at your profile where you said ""lost and alone"". I also looked at your questions. One was on marriage and divorce and getting your heart broken and another was about why life is so disappointing. Another question was if anyone has ever thought about murder. You seem to be suffering from depression or some other mental illness. My guess is that you took an overdose of pills to kill yourself and now you have second thoughts. If this is the case, get someone to take you to the emergency room at the closest hospital or call 911. In any case, you need to see a psychiatrist asap or at least talk with your doctor who can advise you or refer you to someone in the mental health department. Depression is nothing to be ashamed of and you should seek help. Let us hear from you. God bless."

I am a wound care nurse..so lets say your ear is your wound. 1st I read the responses and don't follow the advice of them. \n\nYou need to wash your piercing with soap like dial (antibacterial) and use warm water. Replace your ear ring. Your ears may be sensitive to metals so get some hypo-allegenic ear rings sold at most places, just ask someone for them.  \n\nNo doctor is needed. \n\nYou can use alcohol and peroxide in a 50/50 mix and apply it to the infected area in the morning after waking up and getting out of bed. And at night before bed. do not use these alone or undiluted. These 2 things aide in healing but also if used to much they can kill the bad germs and the good ones too.\n\nDon't use ointments they don't help things like this. Ointments attract dirt and cause the infection to worsen. Clean your ear regularly and keep it clean and dry. If you use hairspray of gel cover the area while fixing your hair.\n\nPierced ear infections are not to hard to clean up just do as I suggest and it should be healed within 1-2 weeks.

UVB ones are easy to come by - they're in every sunscreen - it's the UVA ones that are more difficult to find.\n\nLook at the ingredients list - there are only THREE tried-and-true UVA blockers (no matter what the label says).\n\nAvobenzone (aka Parsol 1789)\nTitanium dioxide\nZinc oxide\n\nAvobenzone is a chemical block - it absorbs the sun's rays and basically neutralizes the effect chemically.  The bad part about Avobenzone is that it does degenerate over a period of a few hours, so you need to reapply fairly frequently.\n\nTitanium dioxide and zinc oxide are physical blocks - they reflect the sun's rays, so they don't ever hit your skin.  Unfortunately, if you have darker skin and are using a product in which the particles of titanium/zinc have not been micronized properly, these products can leave a whitish cast on your skin.\n\nThe best thing to do to find a good-quality ZO or TD sunscreen is to check labels and expect to pay about $10-$12 for a tube.  It may seem expensive but isn't your skin worth it?\n\n[If you live in Canada or Europe there is a newer sunscreen ingredient available called Meroxyl - it's VERY effective at blocking UVA and UVB rays when blended with Avobenzone in a product - L'Oreal's Ombrelle line has this combination and it's great.  It's what I use, but it's not available in the U.S. - yet.]

We all agree with you.  Some of us here find it amusing.  Others find it... interesting.  But to have multiple personalities disorder, you must be unaware of the fact that you may have it.  It is an unconscious thing you see? If you can ask yourself, you don´t have it.  Unless some deep voice answers back inside your head.
I cannot answer your question for *sure*, but I would think it varies on which type of hysterctomy one will be having, and how well she recovers from it afterwards.\n\nSite is Hyster Sisters, women who had or are contemplating hysterctomies can go there and do a little research.  Hope it helps!
One of the biggest misconceptions is that doing sit ups will make you lose fat around your waste. Not gonna happen.\n\nA diet is the only thing to help that. Now doing those sit ups is going to help burn fat. But so will the stepper or tread mill. Cardo training along with a good diet is your best bet to burn off the fat.\n\nI would recommend cutting calories, fat and carbs from your diet as much as possible. I had a chart cant find it, but if you look around on the net. You can find the right amount of calories to body weight to help you get a target of what you should be doing.
you were lucky you didnt die maybe next time you will.Stay off it.
i dont, but i know some that do! its so annoying...its mostly the spoiled brats!!!LOL
It's possible that what you call a bruise is really blood from the hand wound pooling up in the wrist.  It would be difficult to tell the difference without a professional test or two.  If she experiences painful tenderness when touched on the wrist, then it's most likely an unrelated bruise.  Blood pooling from another injury site might not be especially painful.\n\nKeep an eye on it, and seek medical attention if the bruised area grows larger or doesn't seem to heal on its own.  There could be another injured vein or artery in the hand.

Stretching every morning (especially your hamstrings) and strengthening your abdominal muscles really helps. It also helps to ice the base of your spine to help with the inflammation. A chiropractor may help depending on what's causing the sciatica. There are several different conditions involving lumbar vertebrae and discs that cause sciatica pain.

A phototoxic substance is a chemical compound which becomes toxic only when exposed to light.\n\nPhototoxicity is a phenomenon known in live-cell live cell fluorescence microscopy, where illuminating a fluorescent molecule (the fluorescently active site is called a fluorophore) causes the selective death of the cells expressing it. While not completely understood, it seems to be clear that the main cause for phototoxicity is the formation of oxygen radicals due to non-radiative energy transfer.\n\nTypically in fluorescence, photons of a certain wavelength excite electrons of the illuminated fluorophore to higher energy states. When these excited electrons return to a lower energy state, they emit a photon with a lower energy level thus causing the emission of light of a longer wavelength. This principle of fluorescence is also known as Stokes shift.\n\nUnfortunately for microscopists, in many cases some of the energy is not used for this radiative energy transfer but is transferred to oxygen causing the formation of oxygen radicals. These radicals are highly toxic to living cells, sometimes killing cells in seconds.\n\nPhototoxicity in live cells depends strongly on the kind of fluorescent molecule used. The isolation and characterization of fluorescent proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) has provided biologists with fluorochromes which show a much weaker phototoxic effect compared to most smaller chemically synthesized fluorescent molecules such as FITC or rhodamine. Still, the energy level of excitation light as well as the duration of illumination must be minimized to ensure long-term survival of living cells during fluorescent imaging.\n\n\n\n# May cause a skin reaction such as burning, irritation, or pigment change upon exposure to ultra-violet light (sunlight, tanning lights).\nwww.simplers.com/herbal/definition.htm\n\n# sun exposure causes skin pigmentation\nwww.aworldofaromatherapy.com/aromatherapy-glossary.htm\n\n# increases the sensitivity of the skin to sunlight and ultraviolet radiation to the point of toxicity\nwww.lovingscents.com/Glossary.htm

"It can be used during certain parts of the operation (and is quite frequently).  If the cystectomy is being done for bladder cancer and there is any worry about disease through the wall of the bladder or within the abdomen, the recaptured blood may not be usable.  By definition, the ""cell saver"" really filters the heck out of salvaged blood - but there are limits and unknowns.  Strict criteria are used for what can be given back to a patient and what cannot.  \n\nIf religious beliefs do not allow you to receive a transfusion it may be your only option, many hospitals have, or are affiliated with bloodless surgery programs - ask you doc about them.   \n\nIf it is fear of transmission of blood borne disease - you need to talk with your surgeon about the real statistics - the risks are not as great as the risk of blood loss that may require the use of blood products.

ARCH PAIN\nThe human foot is made up of 26 bones, 19-foot muscles, 13 leg muscles and 15 ligaments along with over a mile of tiny blood vessels and nerves. The arch forms a bridge between the front and the back part of the foot. It is made up of bones, ligaments and tendons and is subjected to a lot of stress and work. Ill-fitting shoes, long periods of time on your feet, and hard surfaces can all cause arch pain. Arch pain itself is often an early symptom telling you that the bones, ligaments and muscles of the foot are being overworked and are getting tired. Tired legs and feet, foot and leg cramps, and perhaps even low back pain can frequently accompany it.
if the ovaries are not removed ,you will not get flashes.my wife did the ops 7 years back when she was 44.she is absoulutly normal since then
Relax, probably stress, try meditation, yoga or even Thai Chi, whatever feels good......don't give up after a week !
TRUST ME.... It reallllly is the most painful thing I have ever went through, the worst, and I only had a c-section.... I want my tubes tied so bad, but they usually won't tie them, untill you have more than 1 child.... so I would guess that is definatly a factor why, because you have so little time, you usually don't remember a pill, and condoms break!
I got married at 21....and lost my virginity at 16.  In that time I slept with over 50 men.  I'm not proud of what I did....but I'm not ashamed either.  I always took the proper precautions, and have never had a disease; and only one unwanted pregnancy(which I miscarried at 7 weeks).  I have never hid my past from any of my partners, nor have I felt a need to.  As soon as my husband and I started dating I told him straight out how many partners I'd had, he doesn't have any issues with it, so why should I?
Issues pertaining to what?
Some of these answers are not correct.  While I WOULD go see your physician because stopping on their own isn't an every day occurance, there is no harm in not having one.  First, they even sell birth control pills called Seasonale which only give you a period every 3 months.  Second there is a decent sized percent of the (female) population who do not have regular periods.  I only know one, but she showed me the medical data.  My friend Robin has a period every 4-5 months and even then it is light.  She's not in PAIN nor has any problems as others suggested.  But I'd still check it out.\nTake care.
Strength training, weight lifting and aerobic exercise would definetly help the cause

From my experience: 1st the orthodontist will put spacers in your between your teeth(for about two weeks).\n2nd they put the actual brackets and wires on for the making of the braces. After your braces are on, you normally go back every month or few weeks for an adjustment and new bands are put on brackets. If you have an over or under bite, that will normally be corrected with rubber bands that hook on the top and bottom of your braces.3rd your treatment should almost be over soon and your braces will be removed. 4th you should RELIGOUSLY wear your retainers every night to bed. I have had my braces off now for 4 years, and I always get compliments on how straight my teeth are. I hope you are satisfied with your experience and your beautiful new smile.

Ascites is defined as an excessive amount of fluid built up within the peritoneal cavity. Both the abdominal organs and the abdomen itself are lined with membranes called the peritoneum. Between these two linings is a space referred to as the peritoneal cavity. In pathological conditions that result in edema, or excessive fluid accumulation in bodily tissues, fluid can build up in the peritoneal cavity.  \nA septate uterus is a uterus with a dividing wall of tissue (septum) within the uterine cavity. It can be treated with surgery if the tissue is thick, but if the tissue is thin it usually poses no problem during pregnancy.\nAs for what caused your condition, ask your doctor.  He or she is the best source for your medical questions.  Ascites, in itself, is not a disease, but rather a symptom of several other pathological conditions.

"PERFECT SOLUTION: GET BALD\n\nread on...\n\n\nWhile there is neither a cure for alopecia areata nor drugs approved for its treatment, some people find that medications approved for other purposes can help hair grow back, at least temporarily. The following are some treatments for alopecia areata. Keep in mind that while these treatments may promote hair growth, none of them prevent new patches or actually cure the underlying disease. Consult your health care professional about the best option for you.\n\nCorticosteroids--Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs similar to a hormone called cortisol produced in the body. Because these drugs suppress the immune system if given orally, they are often used in the treatment of various autoimmune diseases, including alopecia areata. Corticosteroids may be administered in three ways for alopecia areata:\n\n\nLocal injections--Injections of steroids directly into hairless patches on the scalp and sometimes the brow and beard areas are effective in increasing hair growth in most people. It usually takes about 4 weeks for new hair growth to become visible. Injections deliver small amounts of cortisone to affected areas, avoiding the more serious side effects encountered with long-term oral use. The main side effects of injections are transient pain, mild swelling, and sometimes changes in pigmentation, as well as small indentations in the skin that go away when injections are stopped. Because injections can be painful, they may not be the preferred treatment for children. After 1 or 2 months, new hair growth usually becomes visible, and the injections usually have to be repeated monthly. The cortisone removes the confused immune cells and allows the hair to grow. Large areas cannot be treated, however, because the discomfort and the amount of medicine become too great and can result in side effects similar to those of the oral regimen.\n\n\nOral corticosteroids--Corticosteroids taken by mouth are a mainstay of treatment for many autoimmune diseases and may be used in more extensive alopecia areata. But because of the risk of side effects of oral corticosteroids, such as hypertension and cataracts, they are used only occasionally for alopecia areata and for shorter periods of time.\n\n\nTopical ointments--Ointments or creams containing steroids rubbed directly onto the affected area are less traumatic than injections and, therefore, are sometimes preferred for children. However, corticosteroid ointments and creams alone are less effective than injections; they work best when combined with other topical treatments, such as minoxidil or anthralin. \n\n\n\nMinoxidil (5%) (Rogaine*)--Topical minoxidil solution promotes hair growth in several conditions in which the hair follicle is small and not growing to its full potential. Minoxidil is FDA-approved for treating male and female pattern hair loss. It may also be useful in promoting hair growth in alopecia areata. The solution, applied twice daily, has been shown to promote hair growth in both adults and children, and may be used on the scalp, brow, and beard areas. With regular and proper use of the solution, new hair growth appears in about 12 weeks.\n\n*Brand names included in this booklet are provided as examples only, and their inclusion does not mean that these products are endorsed by the National Institutes of Health or any other Government agency. Also, if a particular brand name is not mentioned, this does not mean or imply that the product is unsatisfactory.\n\n\nAnthralin (Psoriatec)--Anthralin, a synthetic tar-like substance that alters immune function in the affected skin, is an approved treatment for psoriasis. Anthralin is also commonly used to treat alopecia areata. Anthralin is applied for 20 to 60 minutes (""short contact therapy"") to avoid skin irritation, which is not needed for the drug to work. When it works, new hair growth is usually evident in 8 to 12 weeks. Anthralin is often used in combination"

Digestion, or the break-down of your food, begins in your mouth with saliva.  The main absorption of nutrients occurs in the intestines.  If I remember correctly, however, if you swallow any of your saliva after chewing (but not swallowing), some of the food will inadvertently be digested, thereby consuming calories on a limited basis.
"I can not believe you would drink bleach water!!!!!!\n\nSince it's been a month, you should be safe. if you've drank alot of water, that should do the trick. however, you do not want to drink too much water the day of. if your pee is too watery it will show up ""inconclusive"".

Atrial fibrillation can be serious at times, especially if it is new in a patient and there is no clinical history of it.  On the other hand, if A-fib does not affect your normal routine I would not worry about it.  The negative effects of having A-fib are not that great, especially since the anatomical structure of the heart allows blood to basically fall out of the atria and into the ventricles.  Just from gravity alone, you should be getting about 60% of the blood in your atria falling down into your ventricles.  Although not highly effecient, it is manageable for living a mostly normal life.  If your doctor seems to be ok with allowing your A-fib to persist without any medical intervention, he probably sees no reason why you cannot sustain your normal activities with it therefore saving you time, pain, and money.  Hospitalizations are expensive, cardioversions are painful, and all of these plus drugs cost money.  If you don't trust your doctor's opinion and the advice of the answers you have received here, go to another city to another cardiologist and get his opinion.  Just don't mention anything that the other doctor said and take the new doctor's opinion and make a decision from that.  I see people everyday that go home from this hospital with persistent A-fib after cardioversions and every rhythm regulating drug on the market shoved down their throat, and they all seem to be just fine.  No matter what anyone tells you though, doctors, nurses, friends, family; make this decision on your own and go with your insticts and whatever will make you feel comfortable.
I like the Herbalife diet because it is customized to the individual and it helps people with different challenges. I mean what is your weaknesses and how much weight do you want to lose.

No, it's not true!  It's not possible to make a small penis big.  Pills don't work, pumps don't work either.  If you have surgery, the doctors can only extend it 1/2 an inch.  It's really not worth it....1/2 an inch is nothing!  Don't worry about the size, honestly woman don't!  We just want you to make us feel good.  Do whatever you gotta do, but make us feel good!

Hi 'Error'.  I am a retired Chiropractor.  I have treated many patients with hernited discs.  Many responded to chiropractic treatment and a few did not.  Usually patients that did not respond to chiropractic care eventually improved with appropriate surgery.  \n\nWhat has the Chiropractor told you and your husband?  How has the herniated disc been diagnosed - MRI? CT?  What level of the spine is involved?  How large is the herniation?  Are there any additional spinal conditions that might worsen the problem (e.g. spinal canal stenosis or lateral recess stenosis)?  These types of issues help predict treatment success and/or the need for surgery.\n\nWhat are your husband's symtoms?  Back pain only?  Leg Pain?  Leg pain only?  Are there any signs of neurologic damage?  Change in reflexes?  Muscle weakness?  Muscle atrophy (wasting)?  Again, these issues help predict likelyhood of treatment success.\n\nLastly, if treatment is likely to help, some improvement should be seen within 3-4 weeks. Of course, if there is improvement, continuing treatment to maximum improvement can take many months.  However, ongoing treatment without any significant improvement, month after month, with the hopes that 'in time' it will help, is not realistic.\n\nOops, one more point, if chiropractic treatment is unsuccessful for your husband, referral for a neurological consult should be the next step.  At that point you want to see a Neurologist and NOT a surgeon.  Neurologists specialize in DIAGNOSIS.  They will not be motivated by 'surgical dollars' to prescribe surgery.  While a surgeon would perform the surgery (note: spinal surgery should only be performed by a neurosurgeon - someone who specializes in spinal surgery), sadly, some surgeons never see a patient (with good insurance, of course) that doesn't need surgery.\n\nGood luck with Chiropractic.  It often works wonders.  But if surgery is needed, be sure to find the best.\n\nP.S. If you want to answer the questions I have listed here, I will check back and give your further feedback.

The most important part of getting abs is first DIET.  IT doesn't matter how big or strong your abs are if you have a high body fat percentage your abs won't show  up ... in fact bigger abs will only make your belly look larger.\n\nOnce you have your diet under control, you then need good exercises that specifically target all the muscle groups that make up the abdominals:  the upper abs, the lower abs, and the obliques.  Be sure you are performing the exercises with good form.  Probably about 80-90% of people I see in the gym are doing ab exercises using their hip flexor muscles instead of the abdominals.

I can almost see ""Seizure"" because epilepsy causes muscle spasms/seizures which can cause an arm to shake out of control, but usually there are more signs of a seizure than just that:\nhttp://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4742\n\n\nAnyways, you are better off seeing a doctor other than reading what others have to say who have no medical background.\n\nEdit:\nFrom reading all of your questions I would strongly suggest you see a doctor right away... Fever and involuntary jerking/shaking can be a danger and something has to be causing it. If Insurance is a problem, there should be some form of clinic near you that can work with you.. Also an ER in a hospital can't turn you away and won't charge you on the spot.. usually they will work out some sort of payment plan as well."

"If you just chew, it's called a bad habit. \n\nIf you also eat it, it's called PICA and it is ""the persistent eating of non-nutritive substances (such as paint, string, hair, animal droppings, insects, soil) for over a month. The behavior must be developmentally inappropriate and not part of a culturally sanctioned practice.""\n\nI hope this helps."
try not to eat anything within one month!! he he he just joking!!:D Dont eat anything that has a lot of fat and try to do exercise everyday. Good luck!!
Is this a 24 hr. position?  Depending on what the person needs, it can sound like this.\nMorning: prepare breakfastmay need assistance in eating, assist in shower/bath/washing and grooming, and dressing. help may be required in transfer or walking.\nLunch: prepare lunch, may need assistance in eating. May need to help assist to bathroom.  Should not let person sit for more than a couple of hours as they could then have breakdown of the skin.  Entertain as needed.\nDinner: prepare dinner. may need assist eating. oh. and you need to clean up dishes after meals.  Assist person as needed.\nNight: help person to dress for bed, and to get into bed.\nThere are so many different things to being a caretaker, suffice it to say that all activities of daily living.  Think about what you do everyday without thinking about it, and thats what a caretaker helps people with.\n\n\nThe most difficult thing was finding out that one of the old women I took care of was hoarding her pills unerneath her pillow and I found them, and turned her in to the agency.  If I hadn't found them she would probably died while I was taking care of her.\nAlso when I worked at a nursing home, I had to clean up a dead person.

"there is nothing more miserable than lying awake knowing you need to sleep..Nice relaxing baths and reading help me, but TV  is something I avoid in the bedroom...(a problem since my husband likes to fall asleep while watching, but he usually drifts off first, I turn it off, then have my quiet time to read and fall asleep)..But you said you CAN fall asleep with TV on? is it a problem to just leave it on? or does it wake you up later? If I wake up in middle of night and cannot fall back asleep, I try a couple of things...think about something really monotonous (sort of like ""counting sheep"") ...If I try to start mentally reciting a poem, or song (T'was the Night before Christmas works for me) I don't get too far before I fall asleep..If it is really a bad night, I get up and go to a different room and read on the couch until I feel sleepy...a change of setting seems to help..This all may seem kooky, but have worked for me since college (12 years ago...)  Also, I am a pharmacist and don't think use of meds occasionally is bad...they are available because some people truly need their help...however, they won't be of benefit for long periods since the body adjusts.."

Breathing will definitely help you make your jogging easier, but if you're not struggling with any limitations based on your breathing (i.e. I wanted to run 20 more minutes, but I got the most horrible sideache!) than this is very likely not the problem.\n\nLosing weight is the most complicated simple equasion there is.  To lose 1 lb of weight a week you have to cut 500 calories per day either through diet or exercise, or ideally a combination of the two.  500 calories x 7 = 3500 calories (1 lb of fat).  Do you keep track of how many calories you take in?  If not, that might be a good thing to start.  You might be taking in more calories than you realize causing you to maintain your current weight, but not lose any. \n\nYou also might want to try adding in some strength training.  Cardio's great, but it will only get you so far. Every pound of muscle you gain can increase the number of calories you burn by as many as 30 a day.\n\nWhen you first start lifting weights, the best way to measure progress is by how your clothes fit. Muscle is heavier than fat. So, when you begin, the scale may not budge, or it may even go up a few pounds. Don't panic! Muscle takes up less space than fat, making you look smaller. The first changes you'll probably see will be in your waistline and clothing sizes. The scale will catch up.
guys like it fast! oh ya! whatever it takes baby!
Diet pills do work, although not forever.  You see, diet pills are like any other drug your body builds resistance to them and their effectiveness wears off when you take them for a while.  \n\nThey do work short term but there are better ways to boost your metabolism and lose the weight.\n\nThere are several ways to boost your metabolism but lets look at the factors that drive your metabolism first.  \n\n1. Genetics - you have very little control, but you are not a prisoner of your genes.  \n\n2. Lean Muscle Mass - this one throws most people off because women think, oh no I dont want muscles and men think I guess I have to look like a body builder.  Lean muscle mass is simply your weight minus the weight of your organs, bones, fluids and fat.  You increase lean muscle mass primarily through eating properly, resistance exercise, and a lifestyle that doesnt promote catabolizing activites (smoking, heavy drinking and drug use)\n\n3. Frequency of meals - the more meals the more the metabolic processes take place in your body and the faster your metabolism.\n\n4. Water Intake - dehydration is a major drag on metabolism.\nMost people are dehydrated and they dont know it.\n\n5. Sleep - getting enough rest allows the body to function at a higher metabolic level.\n\nYou will learn more than you ever knew about metabolism from my source .

I work for an Early Childhood Intervention program which commonly works with premature babies.  The good news is I have seen babies born as early as 24  weeks survive.  Statistics say that ethnicity does play into this.  Black females have the highest survival rate and White males the lowest.  Some common problems I have seen in preemies are:\nbreathing problems, make sure he gets RSV shot Oct. -Mar.\nEye problems - most extreme preemies have Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), this cause various eye and vision problems, surgery can help or it can resolve itself but most likely he will need glasses.  \nTone problems - muscles tend to be very tight or sometime very soft, this usually causes motor delays\nReflux, just about every preemie is on Reglan and or Zantac.  \nFeeding issues, it is also very common for preemies to be tube fed because they do not have the strength to get a good suck going or they have GI problems\nInfection risks are higher for preemies and some strong antibiotics can cause hearing loss. \nStudies do indicate that preemies are at higher risk for learning disabilities such as Attention Deficit Disorder, Get Occupational Therapy as early as possible to help regulate his sensioneural motor skills!!!\nThe good news is that there is great Medical care out there and every state has an infant and babies program which help support and educate families and provide a variety of intervention services (therapies ) to babies.  If your baby is early make sure you look for your state's program as soon as he is out of the hospital.
First of all you need to lower your fat intake. Secondly do a mixture of cardio and resistance. When I say resistance, I mean pilates or light weights. Altogether do about an hour to an hour and a half. Do this 5 days a week, and eventually you will see a change.
We just covered this topic in psych class. Yerkes-Dodson Law states that the more nervous, scared, ect you are, the more likely you are to lose your ability to do complex or important tasks.
Tell your parents. If they won't take you seriously, try grandparents, other family members, his or your teacher, just anyone who can talk to your parents and your brother. Your brother may need treatment, so the sooner he can get to a dovtor the better. You're a good sibling, looking out for him! Your brother will appreciate that when he gets older.
Green tea naturally contains protective antioxidants. This is important because antioxidants help your body protect itself against free radicals - molecules that can damage cells. And I agree green tea has a good taste.

this does happen, although not just in the nose.  Chronic alcoholism causes severe damage to the liver.  The liver produces clotting factors which help to stop bleeding.  Petechiae often results as microscopic vascular damage bleeding is not easily halted due to increased bleeding time secondary to cirrhosis of the liver.  This petechiae is what makes the appearance of the nose change, although if you look closely you will notice it on their cheeks and other areas of the skin as well.  Just it becomes obvious on the nose.
No!  Not only are you within your ideal weight range for your height, you're also too young to diet.  At age 14, your body is still growing and developing and a diet could compromise your body's development.\n\nIf by dieting, you just mean eating healthier, then that's a safe option.  Try to include more fruits, veggies, whole grains; less junk food, saturated fat, empty calories (eg. soda)\n\nInstead of cutting back on calories, try exercising.  This will make you feel better about your body and will give you results too.  Anyways, having a toned body is waaaay sexier than just being a toothpick.\n\nSociety does place a lot of pressure on women and girls to be thin.  But I hope that one day you'll be able to realize that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes.  You need to accept yourself the way you are, and then you can try to eat healthier and exercise more.\n\nIn general, I don't believe in dieting per se.  Healthy eating and exercise is better for your health and still gets results.
Yeah it would be drowning.A Buddy of mine can not drink water with out choking on it for some reason. And sometimes he looks like he's fixing to die.So I'm sure if enough water goes in the lungs it would be possible to drown.

I assume you're a girl cause of the pic. You have to do both. Cardio and weights go hand in hand. I don't know if you are over weight or if you are just skinny, or what. You will get more muscle, and definition when lifting, but if you are overweight, the fat will stay on top unless you incorporate cardio. Sorry. You should enjoy sweating. It's good for the skin, and it just feels good knowing that you worked out hard!\nTry a spin class or step!\nYou can always shower after!
You know no one forces anyone to go into these places. The blame should be put on the people that use them. There isn't really any safe place to eat out. Think about it. How sanitary are most places? Why not hold every restaurant accountable not just the fast food chains. No the people will have to make the changes. It seems in our country people forget they are the voice. Not the government. If enough boycott it the industry will have to take action. It is easier and less of a hassle not to choose some where quick and easy because of the laziness that set in on society and the need for a quick fix.
You talk about female empowerment but abortion is anything but. I'm sorry but my opinion is that women who use abortion as a type of birth control need to grow up and be smart. I could see the reason for ROE vs. Wade when that was passed although personally I don't agree. But in this day and age of all the many types of birth control out there why do women think they have the right to end a life because they were lazy or just didn't want to make the effort. We have taught the future generation in so many ways that there is no recoarse for stupid choices. The answer cold blooded murder. Now don't get me wrong, abortion in cases of rape and incest, or serious danger to the mothers health needs to be considered and I feel would fall under acceptable reasons for allowing abortion, but come on give me a break as far as It's my choice and right even if I'm a lazy immorale piece of crap who has a bazillion types of ways to not get pregnant and doesn't use one of them. I'm sorry I think that puts women and their liberated ways back 100 years. Also how many women do you really know who actually perform abortions. The majority of them are men! Get a clue ladies.\nI'm just tired of the way people are so casual about it and especially when it doesn't have to happen if you're so smart.  I am for pro Choice.......... condoms, IUD's, the shot, the pill, the patch, foam, cream, norplant, the day after, what ever you choose, just not abortion.\n\nI just want to add it is not a great thing, I know someone who chose that road and it almost did her in. It took many years for her to recover from it mentally, and all those pro choicers why don't you ask them how many have actually gone through the proceedure. Plain and simple fact is it is demoralizing and mentally destroying. It is not what they make it out to be is the whole problem. And for young girls it really isn't the answer. Not with out making sure she knows exactly what it is she's doing and there are too many people out there with their own agendas who don't care about the individual or what it really does to a person. That's probably the biggest problem I have with the whole situation. Why not spend some of the money of education of these young girls and teach them safe sex times2, less spread of diseases and less chance of pregnancy when you use a condom. Prevent unwanted preg. that way. Not deal with them after the fact.
The best thing is to watch your diet. Drink lots of water to flush out your system, also lose weight helps and avoid the foods that bring on an attack. My Dad and hubby both suffer from it and I know how painful it is for them. There really isn't a cure, but if do those things it helps prevent attacks.\nWhen you get an attack cherry juice helps. Best of luck to you.

Liquid generally absorbs faster.\n\nPills last longer, generally.\n\nYou shouldn't chew pills. Often the coating is designed to dissolve in such a way that the medication is absorbed. If you chew them, it may pass through your system too quickly. \n\nSome medicines do work better if you take them with more water or on an empty stomach or with food. It depends on the med. Ask your pharmicist or look up the info. Sometimes the package will specify.\n\nIf fast acting is necessary, ask your pharm too. They may be able to recommend a better brand or delivery method.\n\nGood luck!
"Usually we use that term when we refer to barium in the colon (a barium enema).  \n\nHere is an example of its use:\n""It is regarded as axiomatic in radiology that a temporary, circumferential, physiological narrowing of the barium column in the lumen of a hollow muscular tube is due to contraction of the walls of the tube. This supposition has not always been accepted universally. It has been argued, especially in physiology, that a barium column may appear to be narrowed in cases of incomplete filling of the lumen. Alternatively, even with complete filling, a passive ""falling together"" of the walls (as opposed to active contraction) may narrow the column. Whether these objections are valid or not may be determined by combining alternative modes of investigation, e.g. manometry, with radiological imaging procedures."""
I was in a bad auto accident where my ACL was severed in 2 places and underwent surgery. \n\nTreatment of an ACL tear is most dependent on how much knee instability is caused by the injury. Therefore, there is no critical cutoff (i.e. 50%) for determining when ACL reconstruction surgery is necessary in the setting of a partial ACL tear. Rather, the decision should be based on a combination of symptoms (instability, episodes of 'giving way,' etc.) and physical examination findings (Lachman test, pivot-shift). If there is instability perceived by the patient, and physical exam findings consistent with laxity of the ACL, then reconstruction is a reasonable option. \nUnfortunately, incomplete tears of the ACL are difficult to assess. When looking at an injured ACL during an arthroscopy, your surgeon can assess the look and feel of the ligament to make an assessment on the extent of the injury. \n\nGood luck! \n\nBy the way, after surgery and my rehab, I was able to go back to my love of the martial arts for a while!!
I'd be happy if people would just bathe more often (with any kind of soap).
"This really depends on what your goal is whether strength, endurance, power, speed, flexibility, weight-loss, weight-gain, etc.  You would need to define your goals before establishing a suitable exercise regimen.  You will find that there is not any ""best"" exercise program and incoporating several types of methodologies can help you meet goals.  Any exercise is better than no exercise, but it could very well be that the exercise you do enjoy and can stick with is one that is contrary to your goals, so you really have to set out what you want out of your fitness first before you define your exercise program."

Contact poison control!\n\nMy chemistry teacher told us that, if we ever got anything in our eyes, we had to continuously flush clean water into our eyes for fifteen minutes. Yes, that long (the water needs that amount of time to completely dilute the chemical and get it out of your eye). The eyes must stay open and don't rub. If you have contact lenses in, you must remove them before you flush your eyes with water.

"SUMMARY.  Marjolin's ulcer is defined as a malignant, ulcerating neoplasm occurring in cicatricial tissue, and is thought to be more aggressive than the other more common varieties of skin cancers. It has been reported in chronic scars of diverse origins. The following report describes two cases of burn scar carcinoma. A review is made of the literature pertaining to the mechanisms, paihological findings, clinical presentation, prognosis, prevention and treatment of this malignant degeneration of burn scars.\n\nIntroduction\nThe association between thermal burn scars and neoplasia was initially recognized by Celsus in AD 100 (Treves and Pack, 1930). Jean Nicolas Marjolin, writing in 1828, is widely credited with the first description of tumour arising in bum scars (Marjolin, 1828). It was De Costa in 1903 who first coined the term ""Marjolins's ulcer"", applying it to tumours arising in simple leg ulcers. Although Steffen (1984) and Nancarrow (1983) have pointed out that Marjolin probably did not recognize the malignant nature of these ulcers, most other authors have all iden'tified the malignancy found in burn scars such as Marjolin's ulcer. Today the term ""Marjolin's ulcer"" is used to describe malignant turnours arising in many different types of cutaneous scars and chronic wounds, such as bum scars, chronic venous ulcers, pressure ulcers (decubitus ulcers), osteomyelitis sinuses, urinary fistulas, pilonidal sinuses, gummata, smallpox vaccination scars and radiation scars (Abbas and Beecham, 1988; Barr and Menard, 1983; Berkwits et al., 1986; Fishman and Parker, 1991; Nancarrow, 1983; Steffen, 1984). Butterworths Medical Dictionary (MacNalty, 1965) now defines Marjolin's ulcer as any cancer arising in association with a chronic sinus, ulcer or scar."

i know this sounds dumb but prayer thats what helped me and continues to do so. i cried out to god for years about this one and finally he helped me. it was a living hell,i have an idea of the pain you must be experiencing and i know how horrible a world it is you are feeling with this problem and by the way im sure you are already attractive even with the weight on but i know you're the one who has to look at yourself in the mirror and you break your 'standard' of what beauty is. i remember being revolted at myself about how i ate and about how i felt and looked. im so sorry for you but at the same time excited that i know that a loving god does hear our prayers and if you dont mind i will be praying for you darls. i know it doesnt sound like much of an answer but really with any addiction most people find that a higher power is the only real long lasting answer and yes it is an addiction. food comfort amongst other reasons only god knows.

Yes.\n\nA friend in college wore a strap around her head when she needed to wear glasses, but normally she had contacts.
The reason that children are overweight is so much more complicated than that.\n\nFirst of all, the gap between the rich and poor in this country is widening at an astromical rate. The vast majority of this country is living just above the poverty line, from paycheck to paycheck. Families need two incomes just to survive, whereas in the past only one parent needed to work.\n\nThe reason this is important is because eating healthier is MUCH more expensive than eating the cheaper processed food. A box of macaroni and cheese costs about a dollar, but buying all the ingredients to make a salad or sandwich would cost you 10-20 times that amount. Organic fruits and vegetables and healthy snack options always cost more in a grocery store and rarely go on sale. If you eat fast food, you can get an entire meal for $5, whereas if you ate at a healthy restaurant you would spend at least 3 times that if not more. The middle class is feeding their children the only way they can, which means eating Ramen noodles and frozen dinners full of unhealthy preservatives. This is a huge factor contributing to obesity.\n\nAdditionally, since both parents are working, they have even less time to cook for their children and plan healthy meals. They also aren't around enough to help motivate their children to make healthier choices. They simply have too much on their plate, no pun intended.\n\nTV is probably a very small contributor to obesity if at all. Children have been watching TV since the 50s, but you didn't see nearly as many obese children then as you do now.\n\nHope this helps. Good luck on the project.

"After having both my eardrums blow and recovering only 75% in one ear I know alot about this. There a few different things to try. """"First of all and I repeat Dont listen to us If it is bad go to the doctor thats what they are for.""""  Now for my suggestions take sudafed it works wonders, the green sudafed with guaphafenasen(sic) is best.  Second take a warm compress and apply it to the affected ear. Third pinch your nose and blow and your ears will pop and everything will sound a little wierd but it helps with the pressure. Personally I dont think poring stuff in your ear is the best idea. Above all else and I stress this GO TO THE DOCTOR if it is bad. No one on here is gonna suffer through the pain of having tubes put in your ears ""I have one in both and it sucks"" or you could end up at least temporarily deaf or worse."

You can go to the emergency room for any reason.  It does not have to be a life and death situation.  People go to the ER for diarrhea.  If you feel you need to be seen by a doctor, and you don't want to or can't wait for an appointment with your primary doctor.  Than I would suggest you go, they will see you no matter what your problem is.  You just may have to wait alittle while if there are more serious patients than you.  And the bill may be alittle more than your primary doctor.  But your health and well-being is the most important thing.
"You have two options. \n\nYou can cut calories and perform crunches like crazy, try one of the hot new incredible infomercial ab devices and buy the lastest new and improved  “fat burner”. \n\nAlso there is another  option but it is not too popular. Eat right, Understand functions of the abdominal muscles, work the body as a whole, and allow for ongoing fat release. \n\nOf all of two options, there is only one that ""works,"" all of the time. Unfortunately, it “appears” to be the most complicated. \n\nHere is the Real Ab-Solution:\n\nBefore we go any further, I would like to point out that slimming down your abdominal parts REALLY means reducing you body fat percentage in those areas. Therefore, the goal is to reduce your body fat percentage.  \n\nNow that we understand what we are seeking, let us zero in on the solution.\n\nStep 1: Eat right to release the fat from the fat cells\n\n""Eat right"" sounds so simplistic, but the idea is maximize natural unprocessed foods and minimize processed or junk foods (Please do not go on a depravation diet, it will make things worse). However, you also need to eat in a way that supports Fat loss.\n\nThe real trick lies in stabilizing blood sugar, which allows fat to be released from your fat cells. You would do that by eating meals free from simple sugars and refined carbs, low in processed saturated fat, and balanced with protein, complex carbs, fiber, and essential fatty acids. \n\nStep 2: Move your body to burn the fat in the muscle cells.\n\nOnce the fat is release from the cells, they need to be burned in your muscle cells. Releasing the body fat is not enough; you need to support your nutrition with a more active lifestyle. If you are not active, the released fat just goes back to the fat cells and they are not burned. Burning that fat make your “six packs” visible. \n\nYou not only need to work on your abs or core muscles but you also need to work you the body as a whole (focus on the major muscles like your legs and back).\n\nThen you need to optimize circulation with moderate aerobic exercise (do not go crazy), and fat release should be consistent and ongoing, and a little at a time, those abs will shine through.\n\nDO NOT continue doing something just because ""THEY"" say it's the way things should be done. Allow yourself to choose the solution that will work for you, regardless of what it may be. The only way for you to know who is right is to measure your progress and ACTUALLY track your results.\n\nCHANGE IS HARD, but it's also worth it. Not getting results makes change EXTREMELY HARD.\n\nGet support from friends, family or a coach. Losing weight is not as hard at it seems once you know what to do.

Yes. There IS a way, through Stem Cell Research. I had a friend who did the SAME THING and he can now walk thanks to the research. China has had lots of success with stem cell treatment. It will cost a lot of money, and insurance will NOT pay for it. But, I suggest seeking treatment in China.
Are you a guy or girl? If girl you are pretty much done growing. If guy you MIGHT grow a little bit more but it won't be much. Most girls reach their full height between the ages of 16-18. Guys reach theirs around the age of 20.

before your shower scrub them with soap and water, then dab some hydrogen peroxide and let it bubbule for a sec.  If you have deep crevaces in your pits, this will push the bacteria up out of them, then when you shower it will just wash away.  Shave everyday.

Gardnerella Vaginalis \n\nGardnerella vaginalis is a bacteria (germ) that can normally live in the vagina of women without causing any symptoms unless there is an imbalance in the vaginal environment. It is not considered to be a sexually transmitted infection (STI).\n\nWhat symptoms can Gardnerefla vaginalis cause?\n\nGardnerella vaginalis can cause symptoms when there is a change in the acidity (pH) of the vagina in association with the presence of other organisms.\n\nUp to 70% of women can have the organism in the vagina without being aware of any symptoms.\n\nThe commonest problem that Gardnerella Vaginalis causes for women is a smell from the vagina. This fishy smell can be more obvious after sexual intercourse (if condoms are not being used) as the male’s semen is alkaline and this releases amines by a chemical reaction. The amines have a characteristic fishy smell.\n\nA vaginal discharge can also be present in some women. The discharge can vary from a thin watery white secretion to a frothy and an occasionally yellow loss.\n\nSoreness of the vulva (opening of the vagina) can also occur.\n\nThere are no known long term effects of this condition.\n\nHow is Gardnerella vaginalis diagnosed?\n\nThis is done by an examination of the vagina using a speculum and looking for the above symptoms.\n\nA small sample of the discharge can be mixed with a chemical, potassium hydroxide to detect the presence of the typical fishy odour due to a.rnines, “the whiff test”.\n\nIn the laboratory, a slide of the discharge can be examined for ‘clue cells’ and a swab from the vagina can be cultured for Gardnerella Vaginalis.\n\nHow can Gardnerella vaginalis be treated?\n\nIf a woman does not have symptoms, then treatment may not be needed.\n\nWhere symptoms are present, a course of antibiotics can be used.\n\nIt is possible that changing the acidity (pH) of the vagina by using aci-jel or a vinegar douche (vinegar, warm water) may be sufficient to resolve the problem.\n\nAs bacterial vaginosis is not a sexually transmitted infection (STI) there seems to be no need to treat the partner.\n\n\nFor further information and help please see your:\n\nYour General Practitioner\nSexual Health Clinic\nFamily Planning Centre

It will take about a week for the soreness, etc to be gone and you are completely comfortable again.  But it will take up to 6 months or so for the bone to completely heal.  To avoid a dry socket (which is often times more painful than a toothache) avoid things that could potentially disrupt the blood clot formed in the socket such as smoking, drinking through a straw, sucking on hard candies, fiddling with the area with your tongue and spitting forcefully.  If you are experience a great deal of pain after about 48-72 hrs post-extraction then make sure to get back in to see the dentist who performed the procedure as it's possible you have a dry socket and it will need to be packed with a special medicated gauze.
WIC, Medicaid etc.. this is what it was designed for... temporary, NEEDED help when it arises.... it takes a lot for people to swallow their pride and go ask for help, but guess what, you have a baby inside  you and THAT is more important than any 'crap' procedures you need to endure to ensure you have a healthy baby!

I take Atenolol for mvp.  It's a beta blocker that's usually used to lower blood pressure.  I do have mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and this takes some of the strain off my heart so it doesn't try to overcompensate.  Yes, i still have the prolapse, but it does control the symptoms and arrythmias.\n\nMost people with mvp don't need medication, though.  For the lucky few who do need it, Atenolol is quite common.
Thank you for telling us, what would you like to know though?

If the jewelry is too large to allow adequate drainage, it could be replaced with a smaller size by a piercing professional. Removing your jewelry prematurely can cause an infected hole to close up, trapping an infection and leading to complications requiring a medical professional.

"The only thing I could find on it is that it's the maintenance stage of depression.

Maintenance therapy may be given to people at high risk of developing depression, since depression often recurs:\n\n    * Once a person experiences a single episode of depression, he or she has a 50% chance of having another.\n    * With two episodes, the chance of recurrence rises to 70%.\n    * With three episodes, the chance of developing depression again is 90%.\n\nMaintenance therapy is used based on the theory that continuing the medication after an initial episode of depression may prevent or lessen the intensity of a subsequent episode.

You really cannot get rid of stretchmarks, quickly or slowly, without plastic surgery. You can apply makeup to minimize them, and there are some applications that claim to help shrink them, but I am not aware of any that have been tested and found to work.\n\nThere is no way to enlarge your penis, although, since you're 16, it may get a bit bigger over the next couple of years. The only way to get a much bigger penis is to have a penile transplant, with all the usual problems of transplants. Better to learn how to treat a woman well, because you will have better luck finding a woman who likes you the way you are. There are attachments you can use to help satisfy a woman who has to have a large penis to get her off, though they don't do much for you.\n\nMaybe by the time you're in your 20s, the rabid Republican religious right will no longer control the government, and researchers will be able to find out how to give you a longer penis without surgery, as well as replace hearts and other organs with your own tissue.

Yes I have from time to time. The first thing I would do is get a complete physical including a testosterone level. Many things can cause a decrease in libido such as over work, financial problems, court appearances,  and a partner who is super critical of everything such as my ex wife. All of us men go through periods such as you describe but eventually the interest returns.  If it doesn't, I would not worry if I was you because the more you think your not interested the more you won't be.  Also, libido varies a great deal from person to person so enjoy the lack of stress that a low one gives you.  If you're single, think of all the money you'll save.  Good luck!
well what work for me is meditation and a message twice a month.If your spiritual God is a sure way to realive stress you can call on him for comfort he'll give you the strenght to move on and realize we can't change things that already happened,and he will give you the wisdom to know how try it and believe.....

It is actually a homeopathic remedy, not herbal.  It is made from the venom of a viper (snake).  \n\nHomeopathic remedies use the original substance, in this case the venom, and dilute it greatly via a methed called potentization.  This is said to remove any toxic properties of the substance, but to keep in tact the healing aspects of the remedy.  The urls listed previously have some decent information, but homeopathy can be very complex and it is often better to seek professional help for homeopathic treatment.\n\nThe number and letter next to the name indicate the potency, or how diluted it is.  There are two scales, C for x100 and X for x10.
The only real way to slim quickly is liposuction. If your thighs are padded with fat, that's where your body collects excess weight. Either go on a diet to reduce weight (which will help to some degree), or get lipo. However, with lipo, your body will find other places to store excess weight afterwards, so you still have to keep your diet in check. You could find yourself gaining weight under your chin or in your arms... although some gain it in the chest.
Lasik is always an option. I had Lasik done 2 years ago, it was the best thing I've done and will never regret it. My eyes were pretty bad, I was nearly blind. \nIt is pricey, but some doctors will let you work out a payment plan.

This includes lengthy sitting at a desk. These patterns usually develop an imbalance in the body of short and weak muscles, either left/right or front/back of joints.

Go back to work/sport, doing same old movements, no need to continue those exercises; ""I feel better now"".\nThen we wonder why the problem comes back some time later??\nDUH?\nI had a back history many years ago and have solved the problem by treating and managing the cause."
It is a difficult call because after any pregnancy - whether live birth, stillbirth, miscarriage or abortion, one still sees positive home pregnancy tests for up to eight weeks following the birth or loss. \n\nThe only way to determine if you are in fact pregnant right now would be to ask for a blood test. If your levels are up, you will be asked to return the following week to see if those initial levels have doubled. If that happens, you are pregnant. If the levels stay the same or drop, you may have been recently pregnant again or just have lingering hCG hormone in your bloodstream from your last pregnancy\nhttp://www.anairhoads.org/bc/pregabort.shtml

In Dentistry, we try to save a tooth if possible. Extraction is the last resort (if a patient is willing to try other routes, as you have done). Sometimes, even with the best Dentist and the best intentions, a tooth is nonrestorable. Ideally, you should have had a crown on this tooth right after the root canal, (was this done/recommended) this is a way to avoid loosing more strucure. If a tooth is broken or decayed below the gum line it typically cant be saved. I cant say for sure what I would do if you were my patient as I do not know the entire history and cant see your tooth. If you fear you are being told this because for some reason this dentist can't fix your tooth or just doesnt want to for some reason, I would recommend a second opinion. Find a friend who is happy with their dentist and make an appointment for a consultation regarding this tooth. GOOD LUCK!

Some of the causes of a high BUN level:\n\nA high BUN value can indicate kidney injury or disease. Damage can be caused by a variety of conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, that directly affect the kidneys. In addition to direct damage to the kidneys, high BUN levels can be caused by blockage of the urinary tract (by an object such as a kidney stone or tumor) or reduced blood flow to the kidneys caused by dehydration or heart failure. \n\nA high BUN can be caused by medications, such as allopurinol (Alloprin), aminoglycosides (Garamycin), furosemide (Lasix), indomethacin (Indocin), methotrexate (MTX), aspirin, amphotericin B, carbamazepine (Tegretol), vancomycin (Vancocin), propranolol (Inderal), rifampin (Rifadin), spironolactone (Aldactone), tetracyclines, thiazide diuretics, and triamterene (Dyrenium). \n\nA high BUN value may also be caused by a high-protein diet, Addison's disease, tissue damage (such as from severe burns), or from bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. \n\nA rise in BUN can indicate kidney problems caused by diabetes. \n\nHigh BUN-to-creatinine ratios occur with sudden (acute) kidney failure, which may be caused by conditions such as shock or severe dehydration. An obstruction in the urinary tract (such as from a kidney stone) can cause an elevated BUN-to-creatinine ratio. A very high BUN-to-creatinine ratio may be caused by bleeding in the digestive tract or respiratory tract.

Yes, actually there is.  What you need to do is firmly grab the head of your penis with thumb and index finger.  The lightly pull outwards for 5-10 seconds about 5 times a day.  What this does is allow the skin to stretch, also making the 3 canals of your penis that fill with blood longer, thus increasing, over time, the length and possibly girth of your penis.  Now bear in mind that you NEVER, and I repeat NEVER, want to pull too hard on your penis.  This may lead to serious damage, and may harm your penis.  Don't try and make yourself stretch an added 5 inches overnight, it's not going to happen.  This is something that will take time, but it will work, you just have to be patient.

I am an 18 year old and I had a heart attack last year. I had a cardiac catheterization. The serious complications really don't happen that often because it is done as a daily procedure so the doctors know what they are doing because they specialize in that and do it day in and day out. But you can die from a heart attack while they are in there if the puncture something. You are awake during the procedure and you can tell the doctor what you are felling. You will take a valume or a kind of drug like that where you get goofy. They numb the area where they put in the catheter and you don't feel it inside of you. I felt like the side where they were doing the procedure my leg was getting tingly like it was falling asleep. If you go to the link below it is a fantastic link it will tell you everything that you need to know about the procedure. Recovery is quick it is about six to eight hour after that you can walk, with a limp and some pain but you can. I took morphine after for the pain because of was getting pretty painful but just ask the doctor you can get some. Don't worry about it. It takes about an hour but it feels like 15 minutes because of the drugs.\nE-mail me if you have any other questions?\na_t_derose@sbcglobal.net\nOh and can I ask what this is for?
"Air does contain oxygen, but is actually something like 70 to 75% nitrogen, as well as other inert gases like carbon dioxide.  People that need oxygen for medical uses carry pure oxygen in those tanks - usually, it's because they can't get enough filtered through their lungs and circulatory system.  This is pretty simplistic, I'm sure somebody will give you a more technical explanation.\n\nI forgot about altitude - good catch on that one!  \n\nAnother interesting thing - deep sea divers don't use pure oxygen in their tanks, I think it's usually a mixture of helium and oxygen (though this may have changed, it's been several years since I learned that).  I think the reason is that when your lungs are functioning properly, pure oxygen can make you ""high"" or dizzy...hence the ""oxygen bar"" fad a few years ago."

"Before you jump on the medicine cabinet bandwagon, be aware that there are often many side effects to these prescriptions.  While it may clear up your anxiety, you may have other issues!  Of coarse, only a licenced medical professional can determine if you're a candidate for anxiety medication and what the best path for treatment is for you.  My recommendations before you start popping pills are:\n\n1:  Can you pin-point if there is a specific incident or occurance that is giving you anxiety?  If you notice you're only having episodes at work, maybe it's time for a job change.  \n2:  Keep a journal of your feelings and incidents of anxiety.  This may release some of your stress, and additionally help a doctor understand you're situation.\n3:  Try yoga, pilates, or other relaxing workouts.  Not only will it get you in shape, it will help your body produce more ""feel good"" chemicals in your head which can help with your anxiety.\n4:  Look at your diet.  Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and copious amounts of water help more than you think in making all parts of your body feel better.\n5:  Do away with negative habits.  Smoking, drinking, and drugs can all negatively impact your brain's chemistry and cause undue stress and anxiety.\n6:  Seek a Higher Power.  Even if you're not particularly religious, you could benefit by praying.  Think of it as free counseling.  You talk, He listens.  \n\nHope you feel better!"

Maybe you don't think of it as important, but defecating is as important as breathing, or your heart beating.  Our bodies are amazing biological systems and elimination of wastes is very important.  Asimilation of nutrients from food is important to sustain life.  With the proper diet, beneficial bacteria thrive in our bowels.  This flora is important for our health.  This flora help and support with : digestive process by helping digest lactose (milk sugar) and protein, clean the intestinal tract, purify the colon, and promote regular bowel movements, create lactic acid, which balances intestinal pH, produce antibiotics and antifungals that prevent the growth of harmful bacteria and fungi, provide a passive mechanism to prevent infection, contribute to the destruction of molds, viruses, and parasites, protect us from environmental toxins such as pesticides and pollutants, reduce toxic waste at the cellular level, and stimulate the repair mechanism of cell, manufacture vitamins B6, B12, K, folic acid, and assorted amino acids, help maintain healthy cholesterol and triglyceride levels, break down and rebuild hormones. \nThe best diet would be the one that incorporate enough fiber for the intestinal floral to do its thing and increased transit time, so you actually poop more frecuently... which in fact would be more 'healthy' for you.
i have a close friend who is a meth user (now in recovery) his behavior was similar to a schizophrenic. one day he was depressed, angry and over reactive, the next outgoing, cheerful and energetic. Many times he told me things and later seemed to not remember that he had told me or not remeber things we had done together. he would make commitment or appointments and the next day would have no reccolection of them. he would go through violent stages with almost superman like strength puting holes in walls and fighting with ppl 3 times his size and holding his own. i grew up with this guy and he never exhibited any of these quality or actions before his drug use. his recovery has been long and painful

"I have a lot of success with treating patients with carpal tunnel, but usually if I cannot help, the scar tissue accumulation is too advanced.  The patients usually have the surgery, and come back to me with success!  I would have the surgery if all other non-invasive methods have failed.  The truth is, when Carpal tunnel advances, ""wallerian degeneration"" occurs, where the nerve simply loses its ability to transmit signals.  The numbness you're experiencing is the first stage, then pain, followed by loss of muscle function.  Sorry to ramble on, but if left untreated, you WILL lose the use of the thumb and 3 1/2 fingers.  Get it treated, don't leave it until it's too late!"
"I love Dr Phil for one reason and here it is\n\nHe continually asks his guests one simple question: ""How's it working for you?""\n\nSuccess in anything comes from FINDING WHAT WORKS then DOING WHAT WORKS.\n\nI am going to reveal to you the Secret Weight Loss Formula that Celebrity personal trainer don’t want you to know about.\n\nBefore I reveal the secret, first I need to explain to you that there is process that your body goes through to burn body fat. \n\nSo how does your body burn fat?\n\nThat process is the same for every human being. I will outline the steps and then show you how you can easily apply some fundamental rules to allow your body to burn the maximum amount of fat with less effort and minimum time. Once you understand that simple process, you can easily see why you are not getting the results that you want. Even bigger, you will finally see that getting that dream body is getting so much closer to reality that you will be extremely motivated to get started as soon as you can.\n\nHow does your body release the fat from the cells?\n\nBefore you can turn your body into a fat burning machine, here what needs to happen: your body fat need to be released from the fat cells. You can accomplish this step successfully with your nutrition program. Here are some specific tips that you can apply right away to achieve that.\n\n1.Eat 4-6 small, frequent meals and never skip meals.\n2.Include small amounts of good fats.\n3.Eat natural foods; avoid processed & refined foods\n4.Eat lean proteins with each meal.\n5.Eat more complex carbs, fruits & vegetables.\n\nThe most misunderstood weight loss strategy.\n\nReleasing fat from the fat cells is not the end of it; actually, it is just the beginning. Because the fat needs to be transported from the fat cells to your muscles so it can be burned there. This is done through your blood and the cardiovascular system is responsible for that. The more effective is that system, the more effective your body will become at burning fat. You can improve your cardio vascular system by doing so cardio training.  However, don’t go out yet and spend 1 hour on the treadmill because you probably not going to be doing too much good like that.\n\nThe reason is excessive cardio combined with a restrictive diet burns fat but mostly muscle tissue. That is not a good thing at all, because muscle tissue is where you burn the fat and if you are burning away muscle tissue, you are burning your ability to burn more fat in the future (weight loss plateau). You just don’t cut the hand that feed you. So cardio burns fat and it can also burn muscle tissue, this is a huge dilemma. Damn if you do, damn if you don’t. But wait there is a solution to that…\n\nYou need to do some MODERATE cardio training. The key word here is moderate. \nDoing too much cardio can be detrimental and I am sure you have seen those people that are doing cardio on a daily basis and still not getting anywhere. The result is a low metabolism. Low metabolism means, your body fat is not going anywhere, anytime \nsoon. Here is what you need to do:\n\n1.Do some moderate cardio training; the key word here is moderate\n2.Never diet but consume little fewer calories that you will burn (No starvation diets, Please...)\n\nThe world most efficient “fat burner” available in the market is FREE and is already available to you.\n\nBefore I reveal to you how personal trainer get those celebrities in the best shape of their life in such short period there is one more thing that I want you to understand. Because it is very important. \nWeight loss marketers always claim that they have the magic “fat burner” that will melt your fat away. The problem is that they have a new one coming out every year, so I wonder if the one from last year was so effective, why we need a new one. There is only one thing that actually burn body fat is you already have it. It does not come in a bottle or a special recipe. Body fat can only be burned"
hello my friend,I have tried poppers several times...at first it felt very funny,making you laugh nonsensely,and making you high for 30-45 seconds at each swiff you take.But after a while it began to cause severe headache and constant dumbness.Since it is fully chemical and seriously raises your blood pressure and pulse, I really don't recommend this stuff...it is ok if u wanna try it out once,but later on,stay away from it!!
This is a question for your doctor(s).  The specialty that deals with this is Hematology/Oncology.  This is not a question for the general public, and the desired result, of a healthy child, is too great for this forum.  Although most everyone means well, Gatorade cannot increase anyone's platelet count, antibiotics only work if the cause of low platelets is infection.\n\nYou child needs care directed towards the cause of low platelets, by a qualified medical professional.\n\nBest Wishes

In the first place, try to do introspection on how you passed the entire day before retiring to bed.\n\nNext Step:\n\ntry to sleep with your back on bed.  With closed eyes, bring your attention at the christ centre, ie., third eye, at the upper end of nose. while keeping concentration at this point, first tense your left foot at low tension, hold for two seconds and release, then tense following body parts in the same manner, i.e., tense low and hold for two seconds and release tension:\n\nright foot, left calf muscles, right calf muscles, left thigh, right thigh, left hip, right hip muscles, lower abdomen below the naval, and upper abdomen above the naval, left forearm, right forearm, left upper arm, right upper arm, left chest, right chest, left side of neck, right side of neck, front side of neck and back side of neck muscles.\n\n...... By doing this, you will be increasing your will power consciously, having better control on your body, and the beauty is that you will be fast asleep even before you reach tensing exercise of all the aforesaid 20 parts of the body.  This technique is unique and is part of yoga training of Paramhansa Yogananda the famous Indian Yogi who has written 'Autobiography of a Yogi'.\n\nMay God Bless you.
Let's see now. Male secretions, a.k.a. semen is made up of about 2–5% spermatozoa and some 60% of the volume is seminal plasma. Seminal plasma of humans contains a complex range of organic and inorganic constituents including metal and salt ions, sugars, lipids, steroid hormones, enzymes, prostaglandin hormones, amino acids and basic amines such as putrescine, spermine, spermidine and cadaverine. Since the seminal plasma provides a nutritive and protective medium for the spermatozoa during their journey through the female reproductive tract, it has been believed for a long time that the same protective properties can help protect skin from the environment.  The poster jnunz5353 suggests that there is a lot of acid in sperm, the truth is that there area lot of alkalis is sperm. The female reproductive tract if filled with acids, and the alkaline bases in the seminal plasma counteract the acids and protect DNA inside the sperm from acidic denaturation. \n\nAs for it's benefit to skin, Well, semen contains proteins, which tightens the skin helping with wrinkles. It also contains an abundance of natural lipids, essential amino acids and prostaglandin, natural substances which aid in skin repair and increase blood flow bringing in more nutrients to the to the skin. So I would venture to say that it's not bad and may be good. \n\nAs for female fluids, I would venture to say that they probably have little if nay skin health benefits since the vaginal microflora produce lactic acid and acid is not a good thing to ad to the skin unless you are trying to dry it out.
i have no clue but good ?
Thanks for asking a pointless question but we do not agree the case may be reversed.\n\nOK, So need some sleep to retain.

Wow.  Scary.  From what you said it does sound suspicious.  I'd first talk to any relatives/her friends (hopefully in confidence) to see if they have noticed anything.  If so, do an intervention. There are mediators for that.  Ask a church leader or a private org like narcotic or alcoholics annonymous.

DOn't fall into that trap.\n\nBest wishes to you.  Be strong.
For teeth whitening you really ned to see your dentist for the best results and for the proper care.  Whitening toothpastes will not change the shade of your teeth.... at best, they may do a little better at removing some of the everyday stains caused by such things as smoking and drinking dark beverages. I do not recommend them because they are very abrasive and could potentially harm the enamel of the teeth. As for the over-the-counter bleaching materials such as crest white strips, NONE of them are approved by the ADA (American Dental Association). For products that are approved by the ADA you will need to see your dentist. Also, it's best to be under the care of a dentist while you are whitening due to high reports of sensitivity and in case of any allergic reactions.
No.  I prefer Sonicare.
loser, 2pts :-d
You should make an appointment to see your Dr. Ask him to send you for a pulmonary function test. They can find out if you have asthma. They may do a methacholine challenge test. He may also order chest x-rays. There are other things that can cause wheezing and shortness of breath, but it could be asthma.

I had a bad problem with insomnia for many years, and did some research on it.  Here are the things I’ve found that help the most.\n\n1.  Don't take the sleeping pills.  Although they are not addictive in the way we tend to think (you won't jones for them if you miss taking them) they are addictive in the sense that once you have taken them for a while, you will have to take them to get to sleep, but they won't have the same effect they used too.   This is because you tend to not get the necessary REM sleep you need to be rested.  If you must take a sleeping pill, take it well before you go to sleep.  For instance, I prefer to take sleeping pills 2 hours before I go to sleep, so that the pill can get into my system and make me drowsy before I get into bed, then get out of my system (hopefully) early enough that I get some normal sleep.\n\n2.  Try to go to bed at about the same time every night.  You have some wiggle room on this, but if you stay out on Saturday night till 3, it'll be harder to go to sleep at 10PM Sunday.\n\n(Which somewhat contradicts:)\n\n3.  If possible, don't go to bed if you're not sleepy.  Note  - one thing I have read and found to be true is that you have to be awake for 12 hours before you can go back to sleep.  So if you sleep till noon, again, you won't be sleepy at 10PM.  \n\n4.  Don't spend more than 15-30 minutes trying to get to sleep.  If you notice that you've been in bed more than 15 minutes, get out of bed and do something for a while.  Make sure what you do isn't going to make you more hyper; e.g. no exercising or energetic music or writing posts to online debates. \n\n5.  When you go to bed, choose a chore or some other task that you do not want to do and tell yourself that if you are still awake in thirty minutes you will do that task.  Then, if you are still awake, get up and do your chosen task.  This is my favorite suggestion, as it has worked nearly every time I've used it. .\n\nThose are the most useful suggestions I have.  Other things you can try:\n\nBefore you start getting ready for sleep, turn off high energy music and turn the lights down.  I love R&R music, but I went through a period where I had to turn the radio off every night about an hour before I went to bed, or I would be to wired to sleep. And our bodies react to reduced light by producing melatonin which puts us to sleep.  \n\nGet plenty of exercise, but not right before bed.  (Unless you're weird like me - exercise right before bed just puts me to sleep)\n\nAnother suggestion that might work is to relax your body, consciously, one area at a time, starting from your feet. You think about the ball of your left foot and relax it, then the ball of your right foot, then the arch of your left foot, etc. You have to concentrate (pretty hard) on what you are doing\n\nSex *grin*  by yourself or with an SO, it produces a nice soporific chemical, which does a nice job of putting you to sleep.
Stress, thinking to much, genetic.\n\nIf you feel you have any type of anxiety disorder there are plenty of sites that offer free help on what to do, I dont know what your anxiety symptom is so I cant suggest what you can do. The only thing I can say is if you do feel anxious do other things that keep your mind off of it. Its a pschyological thing and not real so no worries. Just keep reassuring yourself that you are ok and talk to someone about it, makes you feel better lots of things!  Good Luck!

"I actually work in infection control at a hospital.  Right now the nation stand point is not a matter of ""if"" the disease comes to the US but ""when"".  Hospitals are being told to develop a plan for a pandemic with vaccines and anti-virals.  Then they are supposed to rewrite the plan with the reality that they probably won't get either, or definately won't have enough to go around.  The virus currently can not be transmitted from human to human but influenza is the most adaptive virus out there.  That is why people catch it over and over.  Eventually the virus will mutate into a form that can be transmitted from human to human, at that point we will have a pandemic.  This current strain is being compared to the virus of 1918 that killed millions, it has the same rapid development and ability to kill perfectly healthy people.  Most viruses kill those that are already sick, old or young.  The best recommendations at the current time are to get a flu vaccine.  It won't completely prevent the bird flu but it will lessen the effects.  And proper hygiene, especially handwashing, you just don't realize the things you touch in a day and how easy transmission is.  I hope that helps."

I should work out 5 times a week, but thats me.  I do weight training mon/wed/fri, and cardio all five days of the week.  That way I get a good rest for the muscles I just worked out.  For me weekends are impossible to get to the gym.  \n\nIf you can afford it, you should spend a session or two with a certified personal trainer.  He/She should be able to get you on a good program for your body and schedule, and what your personal goals are.\n\nWhatever you do, keep at it, and dont give up.
yes you can just go to walgreens and look in the pharmacy dept. or ask a pharmacist they will direct you to the drug test
Wax is the best way to go.  Less irritating to skin than Nair and lasts longer than shaving or Nair.  So it's a little painful at first, but you can numb the area and take some pills to help with the pain.  Also, waxing can cause damage to hair follicles so regrowth comes in finer.
"It's normal especially if you don't have an orgasm.  The blood flow increases to your erogenous area and makes things feel ""swelled up"". No orgasm means no ""release"" of this built up engorgement. Also your vagina is right beneath your urethura (where the urine goes from your bladder to the outside).  The friction ""irritates"" the urethura and increases blood flow there.  All of this makes you feel increased pressure as if you need to urinate.  You MAY have a bladder infection.  This would increase all of the sensations mentioned above.  But if when you finally are able to urinate you no longer feel the pressure  it's probably not a urinary tract infection."

Depression is caused by the lack of endorphins created naturally by your body.  Food, excersise and sunshine will definitely contribute to the development of endorphins.  Just trying to train yourself to see the positive in place of the negative is also very important in controlling depression.  Do your best to see the good in life, we only get to live once.

Ive always been told typically a gallon which is 128oz.  I think if you add gatorade mix to it thats okay but atleast half of that should be directly water. But mom always said a gallon a day.  I never drink that much though. Milk has alot of water in it too.  Stay away from carbonated beverages, and high amounts of sugar you should be okay.  Ice Tea is tasty!
First of all everyone has the right to life, it's a fundamental human right.  Also everyone has the right to sex!!  Please, most Africans are not dying of AIDS and if we could get some more retroviral drugs, even the ones who have AIDS could live healthy lives (though not reproductive to my knowledge even with anothe HIV positive person).\n\nOk, I'd advice in areas of Malaria to use mosquito nets, they are cheap and effective against Malaria, the LARGEST killer in most African countries before HIV/AIDS.  In Ghana alone it kills about 40,000 persons per year, (population 20 million) mostly elderly and young children.  \n\nSecond secure clean drinking water, so try to spread easy water purification technologies (I don't know if these Brita water cleaning things we use in Europe are any good there), deep dug water boreholes (as surface water is muddy and can carry disease especially if it doesn't flow anywhere).  \n\nEating healthy is an issue, but I think African diets are generally healthy, at least what I've witnessed from West Africa they just eat too much palm oil, otherwise it's fine.  Addion iodine to salt is a major issue still, so buy better salt to avoid iodine deficiancy which causes strange bone growth.  Ethiopians also eat healthy when they don't have a hunger situation, my friend travelled there.  Eat lots of fruit, it's generally good.\n\nIn Ghana they use lots of tooth picks, made from a special local timber that also has enzymes or something to protect the teeth.  The birch tree in Europe is similar, so it's not uncommon that trees have something that protect the teeth.  In Finland they make chewing gum sweetener out of that, called xylitol and it's widely used, but basically the same thing can be achieved by using the tree as a toothpick.  That is a great idea, so keep dental health alive as well, use a toothpick after every meal if possible.\n\nFinally be concerned about maternal health issues, as childbirth is one of the most crucial steps in the life of a woman and of course a child.  I'm not an expert, but reducing infant mortality is important.

AIDS is caused by infection with a virus called human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This virus is passed from one person to another through blood-to-blood and sexual contact. In addition, infected pregnant women can pass HIV to their babies during pregnancy or delivery, as well as through breast feeding. People with HIV have what is called HIV infection. Some of these people will develop AIDS as a result of their HIV infection.

You need to talk to your Doctor about a Vitamin Supplement for women going through Menopause.  Let the Dr. know what kinds of exercises you are doing, and he might be able to give you an idea of nutrients you are lacking to keep up the muslce tone.  Most likely though you need more protein in your diet.  Using a high protein supplement is good like the powder shake stuff you can get at GNC.  And they have made HUGE advancements in the flavor and taste of that stuff, so it doesn't taste like powdered evil anymore.

Twenty.  Baby or primary teeth are lettered A through T.  Unless there is an unusual circumstance: example some children retain baby teeth when there is not a permanant tooth under it.  Children have twenty teeth by about age three.  The permanant molars come in behind the last teeth in the child's mouth.  Central incisors, Lateral incisors, canines, and premolars (bicuspids) come in as the baby teeth fall out.  Most children have all of their permanant teeth by age thirteen or fourteen give or take.  Except wisdom teeth which can come in between the ages of 17-21.  Note not all children have wisdom teeth, some have four, some two, and so on.  In the case of my son he is missing a permanant premolar (lower left side, second one) his baby tooth will have to suffice for as long as possible or until he stops growing, then we will have an implant placed in this missing tooth area.  Adult teeth are numbered 1-32.
Seek medical attention.  This isn't anything to be embarrassed from.

Chocolate, if eaten in excess, will without a doubt cause obesity, and has even been linked to outbreaks of acne. However, medical studies have shown that dark chocolate, although less sweet tasting has beneficial effects on the heart, so eat in moderation is my best answer.

It's not the physical age so much. I just turned 40. It's been  real bummer actually. I felt I should be much farther in life than I am. I also feel the clock ticking louder than ever. I don't want to live to be 80 at least the way most 80 year olds live. 70 is probably older than I want or have any realistic hope of achieving. I grew up fast and grew up hard. Most did not think I'd make it to 18. When I made it to 21 I realized things had to change if I wanted to see 25 and I decided I did. So by the time I was 25 I quit using drugs, quit doing the kinds of things that should have gotten me killed long ago and started working on the things I wanted to do in my life before I was done. \n\n15 years later I havn't achived very many of those things. I've made progress. I've come close on some things. I havn't done what I set out to do. I lived my youth like I'd never live to see 40 and it's taken it's toll. Drinking, smoking, drugs, work in hazardous environments and injuries. It makes me a cancer and other disease magnet. How many years do I really have left? \n\nThat of course assumes a semi doesn't broadside me 10 years from now or a bolt of lightning doesn't hit me tomorrow. Whatever the case 40 for me is a time of realizing my mortality. Somehow I always thought I'd live forever and die young. That is I always expected to die because of the life I lived. Then when it didn't happen I felt like nothing could kill me (That doesn't mean I was about to jump off high buildings or something stupid like that :) ) No I am coming to grips with my own mortality and it's frig gin uncomfortable. \n\nThis is strangly at odds with the fact I really don't feel much older mentally or emotionally than I did as a Teen. My back aches, my eyes are starting to go, my knees hurt and various other minor sings of age are creeping in. Still if feels like the party can go on forever yet I know the end is far too close for comfort. I personally am having a hard time reconciling that. \n\nSo yeah I feel something akin to what you feel though I am probably much younger than you right now.

Norpramin can make you dizzy and can also increase your heart-rate. I read up on it for you because I have never taken it but i'll tell ya, I am on 1800 mg.(which is very high) of Neurontin for my anxiety and it helps better than anything else I have ever taken.\nNeurontin is not generally prescribed for anxiety. It is an anti-seizure medication but does work as an anti-anxiety med.\nThe following website tells you about Norpramin and it's side-effects.\nGood luck.

Mild central canal stenosis means there is mild narrowing of the central canal of one or more vertebra(e).  The central canal contains the spinal cord down to about the 1st/2nd lumbar vertebrae.  Below this level it contains the Cauda Equina, which consists of the remaining nerves extending down from the spinal cord.  It is much more important to understand WHAT is causing the narrowing and, if possible, WHY the cause is present.
A women gets horny and wet only by her desires for a particular man. You cannot artificially induce it.

The nightly wet-dream just is a normal event and for young guys mainly.\nIn fact, during puberty and adolescence it is due to the hormones storm while later it just is the vivid fantasy and the hot dreams to let that event.\nIt occurs in the night and precisely at the end of the sleep and in the REM phase of the sleep.\nOn that time dream are more deep and unconscious, many erection occurs repetitively and during one of them, there could be a little ejaculation too. \nWhen awake guys remember nothing about.\nGrowing on and with a regular sexual life such occurrence decrease till to disappear.\nThere’s no problem of course. Maybe you too got them during the night (with no emission), and you don’t remember that, or, on the contrary, your fantasy isn’t so vivid or you libido is very soft.... \nOKAY??

Well, its not normal to puke after eating, nor is it normal to loose your appetite. \n\nEating only one meal a day is actually worse for you than eating three meals a day. the best thing you can do is eat five small meals a day...this helps maintain your metabolism, and will get you to burn offf fat more quickly. Eating only once per day starves your body - thats what is causing the headaches. Also, because your body starves, when you do finally eat soemthing - no matter how healthy - the body manufactures it into stored fat. So, youre doing the opposite of what your body wants and needs! \n\nStick with the lots of water, but add in several fruits and veges and exercise. You'll loose those pounds faster than you thought! \n\nGood luck, and remember that no matter who you are or what you think you look like, youre a beautiful person. Always.

I'm on my third pack of Seasonale and I really like it.  I too have oily skin and that hasn't changed.  No birth control pill I've ever been on has cleared up the oil.  You might break out less, but the oil will stay.  My skin cleared up when I moved to Wyoming, but that might not be practical for you.  If your skin is breaking out due to hormones then Seasonale should be great for you since, you'll only experience those hormones every three months.  Seasonale really helped one of my girlfriends with her hormone induced migraines.  Also, Seasonale is not a new type of birth control.  It's a regular birth control pill.  Doctors have been prescribing birth control in this exact manner for years.  Seasonale is just the first company to actually market the product and put it in it's snazzy little case with all three months together.  Good Luck, hope you like it.\n\nHow often do you wash your face and what do you use? You might actually be making your skin oily by washing it too often with a harsh oil stripping product. \n\nUse an oil free product, but it doesn't necessarily have to be for oily skin. I like Purpose face wash and occasionally use their moisturizer. Aveeno Positively Radiant face wash is also really good. I also keep Basis Facial Cleansing Cloths in my purse. I stopped using Purpose when I moved to Wyoming since the air here is so dry and of the three products Purpose is the most drying. I keep it around though for when I travel.\n\nAll of these products are readily available and not very expensive. Also, I tried all of these products at my dermatologists suggestion. She has also recommended different Neutrogena products but I only use their sunscreen. I really like the oil absorbing sheets, it doesn't matter what brand you buy they all work well.
no, but i want to skip certain steps for no reason at all.  not because i'm in a hurry, nor because there is something wrong with the step.  sometimes i have to make sure to stand on certain steps for a period of time for no rational reason.  when i descend a staircase, i have to count each and every step
"How Antidepressants Work\n\n\n\nA brief review of our rapidly expanding knowledge of the mode of action of antidepressants.\n\n(This article was first published by the Lundbeck Institute in the Institute Magazine no. 6, 2003.)\n\nOne of the best known medical illustrations from recent years and one used by many of us to explain to patients how their antidepressants work, is the image of the synaptic cleft.\n\nThis simple illustration, usually with serotonin receptors and re-uptake pump, has probably done more to explain and legitimise the diagnosis and treatment of depressive illness than any other single initiative in the last twenty years. Most patients find its simple logic reassuring and it seems that doctors do also.\n\nA recent informal survey of colleagues showed that most of us know little more of the mode of action of antidepressants than is illustrated by the diagram.\nA typical synaptic cleft diagram used to illustrate the mode of action of antidepressants\nBreaks down on closer examination\n\nOn closer examination this simple model starts to break down. It does not explain a number of very basic facts the most obvious one being; Why is there a significant delay between starting medication and the onset of symptom relief?\n\nThe origins of the model are interwoven with the history of antidepressants. In 1948 Hafliger synthesized imipramine and ten years later Kuhn observed and published its antidepressant properties. In 1965 Schildkraut published what has become known as the Biogenic Amine hypothesis, which postulated that reduced norepinephrine levels were associated with depression.\n\nIn the same year Bunney and Davis reviewed ""Norepinephrine in depressive reactions"" in the Archives of General Psychiatry (ref. 1).\n\nSerotonin was linked to depression in 1965 when Coppen and others postulated serotonin's involvement in depressive illness in the British Journal of Psychiatry (ref. 2)\nAxelrod's Nobel Prize\n\nJulius Axelrod investigated the presence of catecholamines in neurons and the phenomenon of release and reuptake (the norepinephrine uptake pump). This research explained the mode of action of imipramine at a molecular level within the synaptic cleft and, together with Katz and von Euler, he received the 1970 Nobel Prize for this work.\n\nHis diagram is the origin of the multiple stylised versions we have become familiar with over the last twenty years. In an attempt to integrate the independent observations that both norepinephrine and serotonin were implicated in causing depression.\n\nArthur Prange formulated the Permissive Biogenic Amine theory. Writing in the Archives of General Psychiatry in 1974 (ref. 3) he postulated that alterations in mood were due to a deficit of serotonin plus either a deficit or excess of norepinephrine. This dual neurotransmitter approach lives on today in the debate as to whether single or dual uptake blockers are more effective in treating depression.\n\nAt a molecular level Prange's model focused on the synaptic cleft and this was to remain the area of interest for a number of years.\n\nIt appeared self-evident that increasing the availability of serotonin in the synaptic cleft and thus on the post-synaptic receptors changed membrane electrical activity (firing rate) of post-synaptic neurons. This changed firing rate somehow reversed the problems caused by the depression and returned the activity of the ""faulty"" system to normal.\n\nAs noted above this concept did not explain the fact that even though inter-synaptic transmitter levels increased within hours of starting antidepressants, reduction of symptoms did not commence for one or two weeks.\nA further clue\n\nA further clue to what was really happening came from the discovery that the neurons of depressed patients had up regulation (increased numbers) of serotonin and norepinephrine receptors and down regulation of uptake pumps (ref. 4). Researchers noted that the onset of antidepressant a"
when something is acute, it is small, and sharp.  think of the triangle, with acute angles.  i always remembered them as 'a cute little angle'.  it is quite sharp, and tiny, much like the description acute as it describes a condition (usually a pain)\n\nthe word chronic comes from chronos, which means time, an unending flow.  a newspaper might be called the times, or the chronicler.  anything with the word 'chron' means that it involves a lengthy period of time.  when it is used to describe a pain, it means a pain that you've had for years.  it eases up every now and then, but for the most part, it is the same pain that keeps coming back again and again.  such as a migraine headache.

Their are alot of theories to this.  The best answer that I have is it all depends on your pulse, and the duration that you have your pulse elevated.  If you ride a bike, and your pulse never breaks 100, you will not burn alot.  You will burn much more the higher your pulse gets.  Their are formulas for calculating the total calories burned...I don't know them off hand, but it takes into account your weight, your age, your pulse, and duration of the activity.

"Is Douching Healthy?\nSimply stated, the answer is ""No."" \nAccording to a study published by the American Journal of Public Health, douching may reduce a woman's chance of becoming pregnant during a particular month by approximately thirty percent. \n\nRegular vaginal douching changes the delicate chemical balance of the vagina and can make a woman more susceptible to infections. Douching can introduce new bacteria into the vagina which can spread up through the cervix, uterus, and fallopian tubes. Researchers have found that women who douche regularly experience more vaginal irritations and infections such as bacterial vaginosis, and an increased number of sexually transmitted diseases. \n\nFurthermore, regular users of vaginal douches face a 73% greater risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) -- a chronic condition that can lead to infertility, or even death, if left untreated. Bacterial vaginosis and PID can have serious adverse affects on pregnancy including infections in the baby, labor problems, and preterm delivery. \n\nFor these reasons, douching is no longer recommended as a safe or healthy way to routinely clean the vagina. The only safe and healthy way to clean the vagina is to let the vagina clean itself. The delicate chemical balance of the vagina is very sensitive and easily disrupted by routine vaginal douching. \n\nHow does the vagina clean itself?\nThe vagina cleans itself naturally with its own mucous secretions. When bathing or showering use warm water and gentle unscented soap to cleanse the outer areas of the vagina. Feminine hygiene products such as soaps, powders, and sprays are not necessary and may lead to irritation of sensitive tissues"

Hypnosis is one of many viable options for those interested in quitting smoking.\n\nIn fact, a study conducted at the University of Iowa in 1992 found that hypnosis was the MOST effective treatment for smoking cessation as compared to other techniques (patch, gum, etc).  \n\nResearchers conducted a meta-analysis, which combines the results of more than 600 studies covering 72,000 people in the U.S. who participated in various cessation techniques. They found that subjects that underwent hypnotism had the highest success rate of quitting.\n\nThis is just one of many scientific studies that have been conducted regarding the effectiveness of hypnosis.  Thousands of studies can be found on PubMed, a service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine.

Hepatitis C is not as bad as it sounds. You can get treatment for this. As long as he doesn't drink alcohol he can get a liver transplant if worse comes to worse.\n\n\n\nspeaking, hepatitis is any inflammation of the liver. Although it is often caused by a virus, other causes may include alcohol, medications that have a harmful effect on the liver, toxins, or autoimmune disorders.\n\nIn total, there are at least 7 known viral hepatitis strains: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Of these viral forms, hepatitis C may be the leading infectious cause of chronic liver disease in the Western world, affecting more than 170 million people worldwide. Hepatitis A, which is not blood-borne, and hepatitis B, which is blood-borne, are also very widespread. Only these viral forms of hepatitis, including hepatitis C, can be spread directly from one person to another.\n\nExamples of nonviral forms of hepatitis include alcoholic hepatitis (caused by excessive drinking), toxic/drug-induced hepatitis (caused by inhaling or swallowing certain toxins or medications such as acetaminophen), and autoimmune hepatitis (which occurs when the body’s immune system attacks its own liver cells).\n\nTo learn about hepatitis C, including its causes, how it develops, and how to prevent its spread, see What Is Hepatitis C?\n\nTo learn more about hepatitis A, click here.\n\nTo learn more about hepatitis B, click here.\n\nYou may also want to visit Role of the Liver to learn more about the liver and how hepatitis affects this organ.\n\nAbout Hepatitis A\n\nHepatitis A, often abbreviated as HAV (hepatitis A virus), is extremely prevalent (widespread) in the U.S. population. In fact, 1 out of 3 Americans has been infected at some point. However, most people who are infected with hepatitis A recover completely without treatment and, once the infection has subsided, develop lifelong immunity to the disease.\n\nHepatitis A is transmitted primarily by the fecal-to-oral route through contaminated food or water, or because of poor hygiene habits. Hepatitis A can also be contracted by eating shellfish from contaminated water sources. In the United States, people who live in communities with high rates of hepatitis A infection are considered at risk for contracting the disease.\n\nPeople who are infected with hepatitis A generally develop flu-like symptoms, such as low-grade fever, aches, and mild abdominal pain within 10 to 40 days after exposure. In some individuals, these flu-like symptoms can be followed by jaundice (a yellowing of the eyes and skin). Hepatitis A is an acute condition and most people clear the virus on their own without treatment. However, in fewer than 1% of cases, severe acute infections may lead to liver failure and to a need for liver transplantation. Hepatitis A does not lead to the development of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer.\n\nA vaccine is available to protect against hepatitis A. It is recommended for anyone who may be going to an area where there are increased rates of hepatitis A, including Mexico, Central America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. The vaccine is also recommended for people who might become seriously ill if they are infected with the virus.\n\nHepatitis A can be avoided by washing hands with warm water and soap, particularly after using the toilet or changing diapers, and before preparing and eating food. Good hygiene practices are particularly important for anyone who works with food.\n\nFor more information about hepatitis A, including risk factors and prevention, see the Support Library section.\n\nAbout Hepatitis B\n\nHepatitis B, often abbreviated as HBV (hepatitis B virus), is transmitted through blood or blood products, through sexual contact, or from mother to child during pregnancy or childbirth.\n\nIn the United States, an estimated 1.25 million people are infected with hepatitis B. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 30% of people who a

You seem to be conscious about what you are doing so if you can afford it, hey why not?  In a way it's the same thing or maybe even better than picking up a girl at a bar and taking her home for a one night stand and then never calling her again cuz you just used her for sex and if she is innocent and not on the same vibe, she'll feel crappy and used.  The only thing is be careful!!! Use protection - more than one method.  I guess there is always a risk when sleeping with a prostitute which is a risk that can cost you your life - STDs.  But this is true for anyone you sleep with that you don't really know (like what happens amongst college kids all the time).  Man, I used to be a crazy in university and was very promiscuous so the same is true.  Some people even know the people the sleep with but there is a lack in trust or education.  Case in point, unfortunately in this day and age, sex is a bit of a risk.  And regardless, even when you are careful, often condoms can and do break.  Just be smart, educated, and careful.  Go with a good escort agency instead of picking up a sketchy hooker on a shaddy street that would do anything to get cracked up.  And don't forget that there is also a certain pleasure in renting a good porn and being with yourself.  It's very underrated but feels so good to give yourself pleasure - you know what you like, how you like it, etc.  Even this you can make exciting instead of just a wack off.  If I'm horny, I go home and take a bath and rub myself and then I wear some secy nightie just for myself and then I'll drink some wine and watch some porn and get on a table or on the floor or infront of a mirror and let myself pleasure me.  It's totally enjoyable sometimes even more than sex with a partner.
First of all, do you have a speculum to properly open the walls of your vagina to see what you're doing??? Mrs. Shantee is quite correct. A swab is taken from the cervix and those cells are sent to a lab for analizing. It's called a 'smear'. Furthermore, a proper pelvic examination doesn't just include a pap test. Palpating the ovaries must be done as well to determine if there is any abnormal swelling. That is why the Dr. has one finger in the vagina, and pushed on your tummy with the other hand. The ovaries can be examined that way.\nAlso, when a speculum is inserted into the vagina, the Dr. can make a visual inspection of the vaginal walls, checking for any possible abnormalities.\nTo to a pap test on oneself...is only having a fool for a patient.
Carey, I'm sorry but the weight loss goal you are pursuing is nor realistic or safe.  And I would not even consider losing that kind of weight in that short a time period without medical guidance.\n\nEven at your level of obesity, the most amount of weight you should consider losing on any given week should not exceed 3-5 pounds.  This would not even get you half way to your goal, but at least you would have a much better chance of permanent weight loss.\n\nThe best advice I can give you is to seek the advice and guidence of a naturopathic doctor who can help guide you in the right direction for safe and permanent weight loss through diet, supplementation and even exercise.\n\nIn the meantime here are some helpful tips for you to review:\n\nLose Weight Safely:\nhttp://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/weightloss/articles/losesafely.html\n\nHealthy Eating\nhttp://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/nutrition/articles/healthyeating.html\n\nWeight Management Issues\nhttp://www.preventdisease.com/fitness/weightloss/articles/management.html
I would say maybe you hit a spot on your spine which is causing the numbness. Stress could be making your chest numb but I think it's more than that. Even though you/ve had an mri and x-rays done...sometimes they can't show the real culprit. I would advise to get some more opinions of other doctors, check medical websites...but definitely don't let this go. It could be serious nerve damage. If you hit certain spots on your spine, nerves that carry impulses to the brain malfunction and can't carry signals as well anymore giving you the feeling of numbness or tingling and can spread down your legs or arms. Good luck....keep searching for answers.

Usually that refers to a condition where a person becomes confused at night.  Such as when a person suffers from a form of dementia, they can often keep it together for only so long during the day.  At night, when there is less stimulation to keep them alert, or they become fatigued, they just can't control their symptoms as well.  This is when they may become agitated or combative.
Poor thing :(  Every two weeks\n\nI agree, go to the doctor.  There are many girls who have irregular periods.  Most of the time it isn't a problem, but there are some things that can cause irregularity.  It also can't hurt to have a checkup, and the doctor can help you regulate your period.
If the woman's infection is in her throat, then it can me transmissible via fellatio, but this is rare because chlamydia has a moderately-sized infectious dose. A certain minimum of bacteria have to move from the throat to the urethra. Biologically, men do have less ability to pick up infection as insertive partners compared to women who receive (into the pharynx or into the vagina).\n\nSo it's difficult for this to happen, but not negligible. Always use a flavored condom during fellatio.

"Yes, those with adhd have a greater tendency to abuse drugs and alcohol according to statistics.  It has NOTHING to do with the fact that they already take prescribed drugs.  They want to escape their issues like so many kids today.  Why they end up abusing drugs is because they don't get ""high"" like kids without adhd do.  The drugs have a reverse affect on them.  So, they end up taking higher and higher doses trying to achieve that high that their chemically unbalanced brain just doesn't get.  That is why they often add alcohol into the mix and end up addicted to alcohol and drugs.  Educated parents can make all the difference in preventing their child from getting into the drug and alcohol cycle.\n\nI get SO angry at those (like the first responder) who ASSUME that add/adhd doens't exist and that all kids with it are drug abusers.  If you have a child with add/adhd, you KNOW it really exists.  I hope those who scoff are someday ""blessed"" with an adhd child.  To those who are so under-educated, please do your research...you may learn something.\n\nAlso, brain scans have shown a completely different thermal makeup in an add/adhd brain compared to that of a child without add/adhd."

You´ll need your psychology and communication skills since those are a very important part of nursing :-D\nYou´ll have to do stuff that you might think are disgusting but just try to imagine how you would feel in the position of the patient you are helping and then try to be the person you´d want doing this to you/with you etc. \nYou´ll be responsible for other people´s health, life, well being - be aware of this, always live up to your own standards and don´t abuse the power you are given!\nAll in all, if you try to be great, you will be and hopefully you´ll love your job and don´t let hard shifts get you down!
"They are working out with expensive personal trainers for many more hours per day than the average person can fit into a busy work schedule.  And often not eating healthfully at all (Elizabeth Hurley has talked about going to bed ""sad and hungry"" in order to keep her figure.)  Us normal folks cannot afford to compare ourselves to celebs as they often portray an unrealistic ideal.  Eat a balanced diet and exercise enough to burn off more calories than you consume and you will lose fat.  Weight training will help you build lean muscle, which looks great and increases your metabolism.  Basically, take good care of yourself, but don't torture yourself trying to look like Jennifer Aniston."
Nothing's wrong, it just takes some people a little bit longer. You're not missing out on anything so don't rush it.
"A doctor cannot tell whether you are a virgin or not. What a doctor can tell is whether your hymen has been broken or not. A female can break her hymen in many different ways, such as horseback riding. Also, some hymens have a large enough opening to accommodate a penis during sex so that the hymen does not tear. If you are concerned about a doctor inferring that a torn hymen means you are having sex, do not worry. It is not the doctor's position to make any assumptions about you, even though he or she might ask you questions regarding your sexual activity. For your best interest, you should answer your doctor truthfully. Your doctor can better care for you if he or she knows all of your medical history, including whether you are sexually active or not. In addition, doctors have a bond of patient confidentiality with their clients, so a doctor cannot tell your parents if you are sexually active if you do not ask him or her to tell them. \n\nhttp://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/print.php?article=faq&refid=310\n\nIt is very difficult to know if a woman is still a virgin, even if there is tightness as a doctor examines her. There are many factors that need to be taken into consideration. For example, a woman's vagina may be tight because she is nervous while being examined by the doctor, or then again, her muscles may be relaxed and she may never have experienced intercourse before. A woman may also not have a hymen, and never had one, so this would not indicate her state of ""virginity"". The best way to know if a woman has had penile penetration still remains to ask her. Most doctors will also ask their female patients if they have had sex before, when they are about to make a gynecological examination for the first time. \n\nhttp://ideas.uqam.ca/~dsexo/english/9906e/qa0384-1518m.htm"
The cloud cover has much effect on the atmosphere. The colors appear more vibrant as harsh sunlight is blocked by the clouds. The presence of raindrops in the air gives a sense of freshness. Also, the sounds of the birds and beast add to the beauty. No normal being would like to work on such a day. Thus you feel cozy on a cloudy day.
You don't give the name of the medication, so I can't really answer your question.  Call you doctor to find out if the medication has been discontinued, and why.  Also, ask what alternatives you might have.
Could you be pregnant? Before you test, read this list of classic clues. \nAre you pregnant? The proof is really in the pregnancy test. But you may suspect — or hope — that you're expecting, even before you miss a period, if you experience one or more of the following signs and symptoms of pregnancy. These early clues may begin in the first few weeks after conception.\n\nTender, swollen breasts or nipples\nOne of the first physical changes of pregnancy is a change in the way your breasts feel. They may feel tender, tingly or sore. Or they may feel fuller and heavier. As early as two weeks after conception, your breasts start to grow and change in preparation for producing milk. The primary cause of these changes is increased production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Changes in your breasts are often most dramatic when you're pregnant for the first time.\n\nFatigue\nMany women feel wiped out during pregnancy, especially in the early stages. This may be nature's way of persuading moms-to-be to take extra naps, in preparation for the sleepless nights ahead. But there's also a physical reason for fatigue.\n\nDuring the early weeks of pregnancy, your body is working hard — pumping out hormones and producing more blood to carry nutrients to your baby. To accommodate this increased blood flow, your heart pumps harder and faster. Plus, progesterone is a natural central nervous system depressant, so high levels of this hormone may make you sleepy. In addition, the possibility of pregnancy can bring about a range of feelings and concerns that may sap your energy and disturb sleep.\n\nSlight bleeding or cramping\nSome women experience a small amount of spotting or bleeding very early in pregnancy, about 10 to 14 days after fertilization. Known as implantation bleeding, it happens when the fertilized egg first attaches to the lining of the uterus. This type of bleeding is usually a bit earlier, spottier and lighter in color than a usual period and doesn't last long.\n\nMany women also experience cramping very early in pregnancy as the uterus begins to enlarge. These cramps are similar to menstrual cramps.\n\nNausea with or without vomiting\nMorning sickness is one of the telltale signs of early pregnancy. Most women feel some sickness around four to eight weeks of pregnancy, but the queasiness can begin as early as two weeks after conception.\n\nAlthough nausea and vomiting during pregnancy is commonly called morning sickness, it can occur at any time of the day. It seems to stem from the rapidly rising levels of estrogen produced by the placenta and the fetus. These hormones cause the stomach to empty somewhat more slowly, which could be part of the problem. Pregnant women also have a heightened sense of smell, so a variety of odors — such as foods cooking, coffee, perfume or cigarette smoke — can trigger nausea.\n\nFood aversions or cravings\nTurning up your nose at certain foods is often the first hint that you're pregnant. Even the smell of some foods may cause a wave of nausea in early pregnancy. One study suggests that pregnant women experience a unique aversion to coffee in the early weeks of pregnancy. Meat, dairy products and spicy foods are other common objects of repulsion.\n\nFood cravings are common, too. Like most other symptoms of pregnancy, these food preferences can be chalked up to hormonal changes. Pregnant women typically find that their food tastes change somewhat, especially in the first trimester, when hormones have the strongest impact.\n\nFrequent urination\nMany pregnant women find themselves running to the bathroom more often than usual. During the first trimester of pregnancy, this is caused by the enlarging uterus pushing on your bladder.\n\nHeadaches\nIf you're pregnant, you may be troubled by frequent, mild headaches. Early in pregnancy, headaches may be the result of increased blood circulation caused by hormonal changes.\n\nConstipation\nConstipation is ano
Honestly, its better you consult a specialist to find out what's best for you. I really want to help but I don't think I can give better answers than specialist do. Sorry.\n\ngood luck\n\nLove is omnipresence, Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.
"Yes you are under weight. Heres the proof.\nUnderweight = <18.5 \nNormal weight = 18.5-24.9 \nOverweight = 25-29.9 \nObesity = BMI of 30 or greater \n\nYour BMI is 18.4, that falls into the ""underweight"" range."
most of them have caffeine in them, not good for the baby!
It is generally personal preference.  Morning is good because you do feel more energetic for the day.  About metabolism boost, I'm not so sure if it lasts any longer than it does at night (a healthy breakfast is good for jumpstarting the metabolism).  Some research suggests that greater fat loss occurs when you exercise a long time after eating (be careful not to faint - if you feel faint have some juice or something to get blood sugar back up).  This is because the body is forced to use body stores instead of readily-available blood sugar after a meal.  So the morning may be better for overall weight loss - but I don't think it's too significant and exercising anytime is better than not exercising at all.  Too late at night results in increases in adrenaline (epinephrine and norepinephrine), which can keep people awake.
diethopropian is one i had. it stopped all my cravings and i did not feel like picking all the time \ni had to go to a private clinic to get mine but people say you can get them off your doctor on prescription.\nyou will have to have a medical to see if these are ok for you.
Why are you wanting this surgery? My daughter has PFFD and needs this surgery. It puts alot of stress on your hips and kness. (might need surgerys for this also). I heard the surgery itself is not that bad. It's the therapy that hurts
The cost of diabetes supplies and medications is a big problem today. I know because I am diabetic and have to deal with it personallly. There is help out there though. \n\nThe first place to start is with your doctor. Talk to him / her about your difficulty. Most doctors can help you out with meds by offering free samples of some of your prescriptions. Trust me, they have them and they are there for the taking, so just ask. My doctor does this for me and it saves me hundreds and hundreds of $$$$$$ a month. If you doctor isn't willing to do this for you or doesnt' have the resources, then at least he / she can probably refer you to someone who can help. \n\nCheck with your local health department. Chances are that there may be a diabetes program in place there than can offer you lots and lots of great resources. The great thing about the health department resource is that all services will be offered at little or no charge to you, depending your income level. Take advantage of the free diabetes education, support groups, programs, etc. That's why they are there.\nAs far as medication goes, there is probably a pharmacy assistance program in place that can help you with your medications. These programs are income and need based and open to most anyone. Check to see what's out there. \n\nFinally, check with your local department of social services about getting assistance. I am not sure of your location and programs differ from state to state, but it's worth a phone call to see what they can do for you. I am sure that there is something out there to help. \n\nGood luck and best wishes...

The burning sensation in your stomach is the horrible guilt you carry for whatever it was that you did!\n\nJust kidding!\n\nBurning in the stomach usually is due to some form of irritation of the lining of the stomach. This may be due to increased acidity or a decrease in the protective barrier of the stomach. In the beginning this inflammation of the stomach is referred to as gastritis. If the protective barrier of the stomach becomes overwhelmed and the stomach acid and digestive enzymes start acting on the stomach wall itself, you may eventually develop a gastric ulcer (stomach ulcer). This is different than a peptic ulcer which may also present with these symptoms.\n\nIf you drink a lot of caffeinated beverages (coffee, sodas) and/or alcohol or smoke (nicotine does it), or take a lot of a certain class of medications called NSAIDs (the Motrin/Advil/Aleve or aspirin kind of medications) that may cause it.\n\nDepending on your age, this sensation may actually be due to problems with your heart. If you do have problems with your heart, certain types of heart attacks may be felt as stomach pains.\n\nThe best thing to do is to consult with your doctor.

You might have something going on with your throat. Go to the doctor and he might recommend you to an ENT (ear, nose and throat specialist). A year ago I had really bad tonsillitis. The pain was in my jaw and neck and even in my ears! Try going to your doctor. It might be nothing, but it might be something you can get rid of too.
A nursing theory by Peplau (1952) which says that people develop through interpersonal relationships, including the nurse-patient relationship, and that this relationship has a therapeutic value apart from any nursing or medical treatment being undertaken.  \n\nA pretty good detailed outline comes from: http://members.tripod.com/~psychnursing/peplauneuman.html although there are other papers which may make it clearer for you.\n\nTry using Google Scholar for questions like this - it searches academic papers using the Google search format which a lot of people are familiar with.  Some papers are available online, some you may have to get in hard copy from an academic library.\n\nOne more thing: Is this for a nursing school essay?  I wouldn't copy the answers you get too closely if I were you.  You probably realise that most lecturers are cluey enough to do a Google search of sections of an essay to be sure you're not plagiarising if they think your answer sounds too 'professional'...

Nice question.\n\nWell, neither peptic ulcer nor any medications used to treat it can cause palpitations.\n\nHowever, there are two weak links. \n\n1.   People suffering from anxiety suffer from palpitations very often. Such people are also prone to increased acid production and hence peptic ulceration. So ask yourself? Are you an anxious person?\n\n2.   Most people who use caffeine excessively (such as tea and cofees and soft drinks) are prone to get acid-reflux disorders including peptic ulceration. Same caffiene can also transiently cause palpitations in susceptible individuals.\n\nI hope that helps.
Nonsense! Exercise is the best thing for all your organs it makes your heart stronger, it helps your body make insulin naturally it helps your digestive system. Unless your doctor tells you not to exercise that and eating lots of green veggies are the healthiest thing you can do for YOU.

Closing your eyes is a natural reaction for several reasons: strong wind blasts and, of course, sneezing. It's mainly to keep your eyes protected from the resulting dust and mist.

An MCT diet, or medium chain triglyceride diet, is one form of a ketogenic diet. A ketogenic diet is one that is high in fat and extremely low in carbohydrate. It is often used to treat epilepsy, but (obviously) has other uses as well, such as in your brother's case of non-Hodgkins lymphoma.\n\nIt works by inducing ketosis and its related effects, a condition typically only present in starving individuals. Without getting too technical, in ketosis, the body stops using glucose as an energy source and starts using fat.\n\nNormally we don't want this to happen, but in the case of your brother, it could cause a reduction in chyle buildup because the body would be forced to use the chyle (which is just lymphatic fluid rich in fat and other nutrients) as an energy source.\n\nI have included below in the source information a page with guidelines for a few different ketogenic diets. The page is geared toward the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy, but the dietary guidelines themselves are the same (the ketogenic diet is the ketogenic diet, regardless of what you are using it for). Hope this helps, and best of luck to your brother.

There is not a Fast way to lose weight, it didn't just appear over night on your body.  Drug companies are literally making billions telling people they'll lose weight with their products.  Cutting calories, drinking water, and exercise is the only true safe and healthy way.  Good luck

I get nosebleeds a lot in the winter. My mom says it's because the air is a lot dryer, so we turn on a humidifier (that's the right word, hmm?) and the nosebleeds lessen.
The only way you can know what is good for you is to test them out.  What works for others may not always work for you.  Dieting in itself is not a permanent weight management tool.  You need to make a lifestyle change.

Go for it especially if you snore..have someone observe you to see if you snore r kick in your sleep.
Im sure that you care about you son's condition. Instead of using drugs to cover up his symptoms, I would recommend improving his general health condition. Most diseases that effect us today are based on inadequate nutrition. Now it is possible to resolve most illnesses with a small sip of a daily nutritional tonic called Via Viente. This new product on the market has been proven effective in increase the immune system, lowering inflammation levels, lowering blood sugar, lowering blood pressure, and lowering heart rate. It contains the highest level of antioxidants available as well as 13 chelated minerals. It is made of nine whole fruits including the skin, seeds, and pulp. Read more at http://www.viabenefits.com and also at http://bruce.myviaoffice.com , see the Peggy Fleming video for an 11 minute description of the product and company that makes it. I know several families who have used this to treat ADD & ADHD in young people with outstanding results. Many move to the head of their class. Need more details: Write me at bruce@getvia.com
There are MANY types of headaches...with several different origins. The most common one is the tension headache, which originates in muscle spasm in the neck and shoulder areas. Others include things like migraines, cluster headaches, and they are also a common feature in many other illnesses like the flu or other generalized infections. They may come from muscular sources, vascular sources (in the blood vessels of the head or brain), or--RARELY--from increased pressure inside the head from something like a brain tumor or fluid mechanics problem.  Most headaches are simply a nuisance, though some can truly be debilitating, and NOT related to any serious pathology.
go to the doctor explain what is going on if he/she cannot tell you what is wrong find another doctor.
i think banana because it's rich in potassium.
cucumbers work!  I use them all the time.  I get little sleep with working overnights and I found that cucumbers work sliced about 1/4-1/2 inch thin.

For medical questions I usually go to http://www.webMD.com they have a symptom checker on the right hand side of the main page. The Mayo Clinic has a good one too, where you can ask a specialist. http://www.mayoclinic.com/ hope it's nothing serious. Good luck.
I've got the same problem..my doctor gave me a clean bill of health & told me it's normal; a very few women has this condition. It's caused by natural stimulation & with you shaving..alot more stimulation.  {my tubes are tied; so, that rules out the pill causing this} But I do agree with the other comment..that this is ALOT better than having the dryness problem. My suggestion to you, go have a complete physical to rule out any possible problems. Good luck.

Being masturbated by an HIV infected person or masturbating an HIV infected person does not normally carry any risk of HIV transmission. The exception is in case the semen of an infected person is used as a lubricant for masturbation of a non-infected person or if the non-infected person has a open cut or wound on the hand and this cut comes in contact with the semen of an infected person. The risk of HIV transmission from ORAL SEX is not as high as other forms of unprotected penetrative sex, but we now know that HIV can be transmitted by this route. The risk is greater if the infected person ejaculates in the mouth of his partner. Saliva too can be infective and the mouth often has cuts and bleeding points from gums increasing the risk of HIV transmission. It is best to avoid all penetrative sex except with a mutually faithful and regular partner or to always use a condom for oral sex. These general comments also apply in the case of sex between man and woman.

That questions is flawed because it assumes that emotional intellignece or strength is a function of gender alone.  Upbringing, position within society, quality of home life, etc...will all influence emotional stability.  In general, one can not presume that males are emotionally weaker than women.  Some men are emotionally weaker, some women are emotionally weaker.  Some people, regardless of gender, become stronger with their emotions over time while others become weaker.\n\nTheir is no steadfast rule concerning this.  And just because somebody is emotionally weak now, does not mean they will be emotionally weak in the future.
Im a specialty aged care nurse and well there isnt a lot you can do. If it is offending other people well i suggest you buy/him her a hospital type liek gown. If your nan/pop etc is reverting to childhood years as they commonly do, say snat wont visit them or some kind of coax. If they just want to keep taking it off, as youd know its hard to reason well you ant reason with a demented patient. Manipulate other techniques you use to settle them and use it in this sitaution.

As you become older you become more reliant on your own sense of self and less reliant upon what other people think of you. That is because in a society it is important for adults to be able to be relied upon and able to stand for themselves. When you are younger you are more vulnerable to the opinions of others because you are still shaping who you are and how you will fit in or not. It's part of continual development of life to keep a balance between what other people think of you and what you think of yourself, so you can be in some way socially acceptable without losing your own identity. \nSometimes you are winning and sometimes you are losing as far as the bit in society goes (proper employment, good job, spouse/bf/gf, good health/looks) but a good self-esteem will develop independent to these things, as you are who you are and everyone has something to contribute.\nYour self-esteem may be improved by removing it from the category of a sexually transmitted disease.

Aerobics as it raises the heart rate to burn fat start with something simple and expand the style of the class as you start to lose weight and become more confident, if it's the first time you have done it you will feel body conscious and if you have two left feet like me ( and i teach aerobics) you will have a great laugh and every instructor likes a challenge it makes every day different. good luck

"Women's sizes are extremely tricky because they vary alot by manufacturer/designer and cut.  Also, more expensive clothes tend to run larger than cheaper clothes (e.g., a size 8 dress from a more expensive designer might be equivalent to a size 10 dress from a less expensive designer). The other tricky thing is that there are misses sizes and womens sizes.  In many cases, 0-16 is misses and 18+ is womens, but there are some manufacturers who make 18 in both misses and womens and the proportions are slightly different (misses are a little smaller). Here are a couple of examples:\n\nsize 18 misses(from Land's End)\n43"" bust\n36"" waist\n46"" hip\n\nsize 18 womens (from Lands End)\n44.5"" bust\n36.5"" bust\n47"" hip\n\nsize 18 womens (from J Jill, a little more expensive than Land's End)\n44"" bust\n36"" waist\n46"" hip\n\nsize 18 misses (from J Jill)\n43"" bust\n35.5"" waist\n45.5"" hip\n\nsize 18 misses (from Chadwicks, less expensive than Land's End, multiple brands)\n41.5""-43"" bust\n33""-34.5"" waist\n43.5""-45"" low hip\n\nsize 18 womens (Chadwicks)\n42""-43.5"" bust\n34""-35.5"" waist\n44""=45.5"" low hip\n\nMost websites that sell women's clothing will have a size chart--typically it's part of the ""customer service"" page.  Hope this helps!"
If it does not get better in a day or two, or if it gets any worse, go back to the doctor.\n\nAnxiety can cause trouble breathing. If you have a lot of stress or something happened to cause anxiety, that could be the cause. If so, back to the doctor for something to calm down.
are these raw apples you are eating? are they organic?\nIt could be some type of pesticide you are reacting to.\nOr perhaps you need to drink some water--apples are a good source of fiber--maybe that bulk is upseting your stomach.\nI can eat cooked apples without skin and also applesauce, but for some reason raw apples make my gums and mouth itch and my stomach gets queasy.\n\nIf you are concerned, best thing to do is talk to a medical professional.
Increasing your height is impossible unless you are still a growing child/ young adult. Generally, we stop growing around the age of 21, though occasional growth spurts have been reported in older people. But they can't be controled I'm afraid! \n\nHow about high heels? They lengthen the legs and make your legs look slimmer! \n\nWith regards to thigh size, just eat in moderation, and do leg exercises. A great one is to lie on your back, hold your legs in the air above you (straight, at about 45 degrees from the ground) and open and close them.
Unfortunately he is the only one who can do that, not you They say in Al-Anon there are 3 C's.\n\nYou didn't Cause it\nYou don't Control it\nYou can't Change it\n\nThis decision must come from him. Nobody else can change him. I'd contact Al-anon if you are worried.

First, don't listen to these smart-ass people bein' rude to you. Second, i would recommend that you go to a health clinic and tell them that you haven't had your period in a few months and they will give u a pill that will make u ovualate. I believe u take it for 10 days so wait about the 6 day to have sex, and if that doesn't work then have yourself checked out to see if you can get pregnant. hope all goes well.....
There are no creams or rubs that will take away fat. I am going to tell you what worked for me. My Dr. recommended the Medifast Diet. It teaches you to eat 5-6 small meals a day every 2-3 hours. You lose weight quickly and healthy with very little execise. I lost 26 lbs. so far. If you want more information just e-mail at lovejae247@yahoo.com

"If you dont have a trusted older person to go to, you can always go and seek out family-planning clinics for young people; they are trained to do just that and they exist to educate you in sex related matters... This is a short summary:\n1. Protect yourself. Both from unwanted pregnancy (that can change you and your life FOREVER in more ways than you can imagine) and from sexually transmitted disease (STD). Those are mainly treatable, but you'll definitely need to see a doctor if you contract STD as neglected ones can even lead to infertility. You may not care now, but later in life you'll for sure be sorry as hell. You can get contraception pills from either your family doctor of those clinics mentioned above. Protection against STD is a condom. DO NOT HAVE SEX WITHOUT ONE!\n2. When you're having sex for the first time, the penis will penetrate your vagina and in the process the hymen (a membrane stretched across your cervical opening) will tear. It can cause some bleeding and momentary pain. It is highly individual - it depends on the thickness of the hymen, or how tense and nervous you are. Some girls/women dont bleed at all and some profusely. You ll be probably slightly sore for couple of days afterwards. The best is to prepare yourself by informing yourself thoroughly about how it works exactly so you know what to expect.\n3. First sex is best when you're relaxed - your vagina will be well lubricated (wet) and that will ease the penis along; foreplay is well worth investing in. Cuddle, gently explore, kiss and caress untill you feel the warmth in your vagina - that means that you're ready enough to try the ""it"" thing...\n4. Consider staying with foreplay (heavy petting) alone - it can bring you to satisfaction just as well (you and your boyfriend) and, emotionally, it can bring you together just as sex will. For the record, petting and oral sex without the penetration IS sex, too! So if your boyfriend insist on the penetration, and you're not ready (either physically or emotionally), just say no and be firm. Do NOT do anything you dont want to do! Respect your body and its integrity. And your boyfriend should also - its not some toy thing existing only for his pleasure!\n5. Women express themselves while doing it in as many ways as there are women. So, just be yourself - that's why your boyfriend likes you in the first place!\n6. Explore gently and carefully.\n7. Have fun and good luck!"
Honey, i have been trying for years to lose weight, but nothing seemed to work. After having my 4th child, i have been determined to do something. In 3 months, i have dropped 39 pounds, and hope to continue being successful. I only drink diet, and it is very important to drink 8 glasses of water a day. Walk for at least 15 minutes a day. That's what i have been doing. Good luck, and stay confident.
see a doctor ASAP
I dunno, oxygen?

Yes, especially if you are concentrated in it, you might as well be considered smoking it.  It is best to stay clear of these situations.  If this is just a one time deal, and was not for a long period of time, you may be in the clear.  Always give your body a good flushing, drink plenty of water, cranberry juice, and eat lots of vegetables.
There's a girl in one of my classes who claims that her cousin went into the hospital with horrible cramps and it turned out that she was 9 months pregnant and about to give birth.  She had no idea she was pregnant.  But I'm thinking she must have been pretty overweight to start with.
It's clear to me, but then I forgot my medication.

"A pelvic exam is different from a biopsy. The person above described a uterine biopsy. \n\nA plain jane pelvic exam, also called a well woman exam or my personal favorite, ""going to the icky doctor"". Is very simple and not painful at all. \n\nThe ob/gyn, or even a general practitioner, can do this. This is when the doctor checks the cervix for abnormalities. Most docs use the newer method of using a small brush (looks like a pipe cleaner on a stick to me) to gather cells from your cervix. \n\nThese cells are then sent for testing and you may have to wait about a week for results. \n\nIn addition to this the doc will check your other female organs by pressing on your lower abdomen. Check out this site for details. \n\nIf this is your first one, try to relax your muscles as much as you can when having the exam. Oh, and don't go too close to your period...before or after. \n\nBest wishes to you."
Always be very supportive and don't be judgemental.  In most cases, there's not much else you can do.
The circulation to a particular part of the body has been cut off or extremely slowed. When the pressure has been taken away the blood comes rushing back into the little capillaries and the nerves tingle.
The last one is usually lost around the age of 12 - 13 years.  But keep in mind that occasionally a person will have an adult tooth that doesn't develop, therefore, the baby tooth remains in the mouth.  Take the child to the dentist if they are over 13 and still have any baby teeth to ensure their adult teeth have developed and will erupt properly.  (although your child should be going to the dentist every 6 months for cleanings and exams anyway)
Depends on who you talk to. Conventional medicine would disagree with me but  as a practising naturopath I come from the premise that all disease state are as a result from poor mental/emotional patterning and or energy (chi) blockages. These make you susceptable to infection due to imbalance or if you like predispose you to infection. We breathe in and out and carry millions of pathogens each moment of each day, why then do we become sick all of a sudden from a pathogen we have carried for years? The energetic conditions were right. Thoughts influence us at every level including physical, for instance depressed people look depressed, rounded shoulders, poor digestion, lowered immunity etc and they think depressed thoughts, profoundly negative. Tibetan monks for instance are said to be the happiest people on the planet and think very happy thoughts, they frequently live till ages far and beyond western people with little or no ill health.\nThe treatments numbers are far ranging and their effectiveness is varying. Most natural therapies are approached from the premise of healthy mind/emotions/spirit=healthy body so any of those modalities are considered treatments, examples would include reiki, reflexology, massage, counselling, herbalism, Accupuncture and many, many more.\nThis is a topic that there is a great deal of literature available on and you can do Diploma courses on them. Puch in your question to google and sit back for about the next 50 years and go for it.\nAs a foot note the vast majority of my clients are patients that western or convetional medicine has failed for one reason or another, they end up on my door step and in  the majority of cases the approach I use brings lasting positive results, world wide there is a massive swing to natural health and healing therapies, ask yourself why.\nHope this helps you.\n\nCraig - Naturopath.

ya, its ok to run everyday, most people run everyday rathar than running once in 2 days...its not a problem running everyday...but, mind u that u do not strain ur legs much, minimum of dialy running is enough. Excessive running or running more than ur routine suddenly may cause ur muscles pain.
actually it all has to do with the alleles of the past generations. blue eyes is recesive so his dad or mom must of both had blue eyes. deafness has no relation to blue eyes and can be caused by many reasons other than alleles

I have had 1 after an episode where I lost a large amount of blood...it only took me about 3 days to feel normal again.  My mother had cancer and received 2, and she felt better within 24 hours.  It depends on the reason you are having one. She was going through chemo and became anemic.  She was very weak and dizzy, kept trying to pass out and could barely stand on her own feet, let alone walk. So it was amazing to see the difference by the next day when she was able to walk without feeling weak and dizzy.  I hope this helps.
i cant believe any of you havent said this yet...MOST of the time what makes you achieve and orgasm is putting pressure on the clitoris....so if you squeeze your legs together or use your hand sit on a wash machine...whatever floats your boat...you can achieve an orgasm too with out inserting anything or breaking the hymen

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh.... your mother is wrong! Aerobic excersize does not increase muscle mass but rather burns calories, hence you lose weight.  Weight lifting increases muscle density, hence weight gain weight due to increased muscle mass....
if your mom wont help you try talking to an aunt or an older sister or even an uncle or something...try talking to another relative because they care just as much about you as your mom should and im sure they would be more than happy to help.
a mucolytic is a agent that brings about the lysis of the cough or in simple words u can say that it makes a thick cough more watery or less thick\na expectorant is a agent which helps you in bringing out the cough that is inside ur chest or u can say that it it makes u cough a bit so that u can spitout the cough that is collected inside\nit is good to take a combination of the 2 to get relief from a bad chesty cough that u have

If she loses any more weight or refuses to eat go to the doctors, there could be something seriously wrong with her.  You’re her mother, and I'm not saying force feeding her will work but your daughter not eating could just be her trying to manipulate you, so she just might need to be disciplined.  Show her that she needs to eat and that this is a serious matter, and be sure to explain this to her in words she will understand.
This is not a good sign. Something is wrong for sure, but from your description I cannot tell what it is. I'd strongly recommend you to do either of the below:\n1. Find a good teacher and show him/ her how you do the pose for diagnosis\n2. If you cannot afford #1, stop doing the pose\n\n#1 is preferred to #2 if you can afford.\n\nIf you intend to continue learning on your own, remember this: Despite all the potential benefits of yoga, it can also do harm if not careful.
I suffer from panic attacks as well as depression, and I found that Prozac made me worse. I am on anti-depressants which combat the panic attacks as well as the low moods, maybe it is worth seeing if there is anything else you can take. \nMy doctor also referred me for psychology, which in turn gave me panic attacks at the beginning because of the unknown, but it became a great help. I went to an anxiety management workshop with six other people who suffered. I was the only one who spent the first hour in tears, shaking uncontrollably, but I got through it and learnt about why I have the attacks and how to control them better. \nPLEASE talk to your doctor, and know that you are not alone, and many of us suffer.\n\nGOOD LUCK!!!!!!!

My husband passed away from lung cancer and when it was discovered it was already too late it had spread.  He never had any symptoms of being sick.  He just out of the blue developed a really nasty cough and could not catch his breath and collapsed.  I started to educate myself and many cancers can be in our bodies for many years before they are discovered or raise there ugly heads to let us know they are there.  There is really no way to detected this cancer, in order to do so you would need a CAT Scan and many insurance companies are not going to pay for you to have this done because someone thinks you may have cancer.  We now have blood test that detected cancers and with women we have mammograms and pap smears etc...Sometimes you find it by accident during a routine exam and that accident may have just saved your life.  Cancer is a sad thing and it's so hard to watch people go through this, but I'm always so happy to hear when someone beats the odds and lives.  Hopefully someday with modern medicine we can find it before it ever thinks about damaging us.
Contact the Center for Endometriosis Care at www.centerforendo.com.  They perform surgical excision, which is shown to be 85% effective for long-term relief, versus superficial surgical treatments like ablation, fulguration, vaporization, etc.  The key to treating the disease is to truly remove it all.  Endo has an autoimmune component, which you can learn more about from the Endo Research Center at www.endocenter.org.  They also have a discussion group at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/erc which you might benefit from.  Good luck and remember you don't have to suffer.  You're not alone!

Use Gentain and Dandelion root as well as Milk Thistle all together in combination, in equal parts in a tea. These are all good detox herbs. They tea will taste foul but this is the most potent way to get the herbs. Drink a cup 3-5 times daily. Keep up the vitamins and electrolytes as well. \n\nAlso on the end of the index fingernail on the inside (thumb side) is the accupuncture point for the beginning of the large intestine meridian, tap here around 20 times, then on the side of the hand where you would hit if you did a karate chop, this is the small intestine meridian point, tap here straight after tapping the index finger. keep doing this repeatedly as often as you can throughout the detox, it help tremedously.\nBest of luck.\n\nCraig - Naturopath.
First off - has it been diagnosed as a cyst?  You must be certain before you proceed with any remedial action!  If it is a tumor, either benign or malignant then other, more aggressive directions of treatment should be engaged.\n\nThomas has a very good point about anti-perspirants.  Most specifically, you should adamantly avoid aluminum chloride, which is a primary ingredient of most deodorants off the shelf.  There are some excellent enzymatic salt sticks that do a fine job of eliminating under-arm odor, which will not subject the under-arm lymphatic and breast regions to heavy metal toxicity.  Aluminum is a metal, and chlorine is toxic (by O.S.H.A.s standards), and although it's not conclusive yet, anti-perspirants are believed by many to contribute to breast cancer.\n\nLastly and most importantly - if it is a cyst, then you must remember that cysts develop as a result of an irritant.  Much in the same way that pearls develop as a result of irritants in the shell.  Unfortunately, we are not capable of turning an internal irritant into a pearl.\n\nSo, I will share with you my personal experience regarding a rather pesky ovarian cyst.   My acupuncturist (who is also a 40 year practicing herbalist, trained in a many locations around the world, including China) successfully diverted the misdirected energy that the cyst was using to grow.  And, after a few accu. treatments, my next ultrasound showed no sign of the cyst.  Remember, cysts must draw from the normal energy relegated to the area that the cyst had developed within.\n\nWhat I strongly suggest is that you find a very good TRADITIONAL acupuncturist and discuss your situation with him or her.  \n\nI would also suggest that you engage a systemic de-tox plan.  Using dietary changes and herbal de-tox assistance.  Please don't forget to attend to your liver and kidneys, as they are your body's filtration system.  \n\nGood luck.  Any anomoly regarding the breasts is terribly disconcerting.  My thoughts and prayers are with you.
there's a way to cure this.  everytime you ovulate you should call us guys to fertilize the egg or else it'll all go to waste. you can collect a trophy from us each time.
Often treatment isn't necessary and your canker sore will heal on its own and there is no quick fix. Your doctor may suggest prescription medication if your sores are large, painful or persistent. To relieve the pain and irritation of canker sores, your doctor may recommend a prescription mouthwash, a corticosteroid salve or an anesthetic solution.
warts maybe? But if they suddenly appeared consider poison ivy, dematitis or maybe a fungus.\n\nEither way, hear is the treatments: \nfor poison ivy...don't touch anything and it will clear up within a week. \nfor fungus---use athletes foot creme on the site for about a week (once daily)\nfor dematitis--- try cortisone creme for a week, twice a day. \n\nEither way, most likely it is nothing serious. If it is a wart...just use wart remover. But do this option last as it will take the longest to go away.
"I disagree with you who say they do it for attention.  Most of those who do it are very secretive and try to hide the fact that they do it, almost like an addict doing drugs would do.  I've experianced a cutter first-hand, and she would just systematically slash parts of her leg that nobody would see.  I don't think the method of self-harm has little to do with but more so the ammount of pain it brings, and how easy it is to do to one's self.  \n\nSometimes it can be done as a release, or as a ""suicidal gesture"" in which case it IS usually a last cry for help or attention.\n\nSometimes all a person knows is pain.  And I agree with kitty that: it is usually a form of release for them when they are having extreme anxiety, depression or other mental problems."
Does this really work?  Where did you find out about this practice and what evidence have you seen that this is an effective and safe method for weight loss?  I would be concerned that someone may be trying to take your money and that you may experience some sort of placebo effect from the procedure and believe it.  If this really worked, it seems that more people would be getting it done.
"The answer is not as simple, or as closed minded, as ""what the patient gets you get"".  There is no such think as ""safe"" sex, there is only safer sex.  Yes, there is a chance of receiving the HIV virus through oral sex, although it is considered to be much lower than through vaginal or anal sex.  It is also considered to be less likely for the receiving person to acquire the virus than the active person.  HIV is not the only concern, however.  Syphalis and Hepatitis, amongst many other sexually transmitted illnesses, are much more transmittable than HIV.  They do not all have the same long term consequences as HIV, but Hepatitis C has some very serious long reaching affects.  Unless you are completely certain of the sexual history and sure that the person has been recently tested (and has not been sexually active for 6 weeks prior to the test, or after the test) you cannot simply trust that someone says that they are negative for the HIV virus.  You should practice safer sex.  Here is some information from reputable websites, as well as the links below.\n\n\nYes, it is possible for either partner to become infected with HIV through performing or receiving oral sex. There have been a few cases of HIV transmission from performing oral sex on a person infected with HIV. While no one knows exactly what the degree of risk is, evidence suggests that the risk is less than that of unprotected anal or vaginal sex.\n\nIf the person performing oral sex has HIV, blood from their mouth may enter the body of the person receiving oral sex through\n\n    * the lining of the urethra (the opening at the tip of the penis);\n    * the lining of the vagina or cervix;\n    * the lining of the anus; or\n    * directly into the body through small cuts or open sores. \n\nIf the person receiving oral sex has HIV, their blood, semen (cum), pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), or vaginal fluid may contain the virus. Cells lining the mouth of the person performing oral sex may allow HIV to enter their body.\n\nThe risk of HIV transmission increases\n\n    * if the person performing oral sex has cuts or sores around or in their mouth or throat;\n    * if the person receiving oral sex ejaculates in the mouth of the person performing oral sex; or\n    * if the person receiving oral sex has another sexually transmitted disease (STD). \n\nNot having (abstaining from) sex is the most effective way to avoid HIV.\n\nIf you choose to perform oral sex, and your partner is male,\n\n    * use a latex condom on the penis; or\n    * if you or your partner is allergic to latex, plastic (polyurethane) condoms can be used. \n\nStudies have shown that latex condoms are very effective, though not perfect, in preventing HIV transmission when used correctly and consistently. If either partner is allergic to latex, plastic (polyurethane) condoms for either the male or female can be used. For more information about latex condoms, see ""Male Latex Condoms and Sexually Transmitted Diseases.""\n\nIf you choose to have oral sex, and your partner is female,\n\n    * use a latex barrier (such as a natural rubber latex sheet, a dental dam or a cut-open condom that makes a square) between your mouth and the vagina. A latex barrier such as a dental dam reduces the risk of blood or vaginal fluids entering your mouth. Plastic food wrap also can be used as a barrier. \n\nIf you choose to perform oral sex with either a male or female partner and this sex includes oral contact with your partners anus (analingus or rimming),\n\n    * use a latex barrier (such as a natural rubber latex sheet, a dental dam or a cut-open condom that makes a square) between your mouth and the anus. Plastic food wrap also can be used as a barrier."

addiction is like when u are hooked on something it could be anything that u are hooked on.
Alieve works really well but for a non-meidcated approach try ice after chewing or during a stress or flare up time.  Then before chewing or a stress full time, if possible, do a warm compress or heating pad.  Sometime even a Tylenol PM nightly will help with waking up a little less painful.
i do relaxation and breathing techniques myself. I find that works very well! also i really would suggest you do find a doctor/counselor who can help you in that area and who can maybe put you on some medication that will help with the anxiety.\n\ngood luck to you! and remember you are not alone! \n:o)
Beauty truly does come from the inside.  If you walk and talk with confidence, it makes a huge difference.  Of course, don't dress like a slob.  Find what clothes suit your body type.

Who is the one to decide whether something is normal or not. Be your own judge. If that makes you feel good, just do it
Maybe...But health wise no.
don't run, the compression will make it worse- and if you opt for surgery(try not to) you may never run normally again.  to work the same muscles, if you are training for an event- try biking and most defninietely use the eliptoglider (that skiing/ arm thing) that sucker is non impact and will keep your thighs and calves ultimately powerful!!!\nRock on, marathon man!!\nTry to cross-train by doing some laps- swimmers are some tough characters!
As with all medications and all over the counter meds  you should talk with your MD. It would depend on why you are not sleeping. Before you try medication you should look at whether or not you can change some bed time habits first. Don't consume caffeine before bed. Start to relax and let go of the day about an hour before bed. Try to meditate. If all this fails carefully try something over the counter. The main ingredient in most sleep aids is Benadryl. So before you go spending alot of money on alot of products, you might want to try simple benadryl allergy tablets. Ask your pharmacist if you have any questions.
Okay I dont know why u added that last part but okay...The persons BMI (Body Mass Index) is 28.3 so they're a lil over weight but Im sure they're okay.Oh and just to remind u just because someone is over weight doesnt mean they arent healthy.And talk to ur friend bout whateva is going on.

Getting a better, more, enriched education, to be aware of the things going on so that thy can avoid them. Without money, you cant live the life you want, and everything gets complicated, have the poor people probably died, because they commited sucicide from the stress of their debt.
no, but u can give yourself an ulcer from eating acidic foods(lemons) on an empty stomach...\nexercise instead and eat natural foods, lots of fruit and veggies and grains. eat 4-5 times daily (small meals): this will speed up your metabolism.\ndance and have lots of sex! good exercise!\ngood luck
I'd try it and if I liked it sure why not, if it's healthier...God bless
Paranoid definition: Exhibiting or characterized by extreme and irrational fear or distrust of others \n\nPessimistic definition: A tendency to stress the negative or unfavorable or to take the gloomiest possible view\n\nIt is not wrong to have such characcteristics, its just that it is negative and not healthy to have them, and they affect your life. A paranoid person would over-react to things that s/he is afraid of or have negative thoughts of. Say for example, a paranoid old lady hears a knock on the door, she thinks its a man trying to harm her that she carries a knife when opening the door, when actually, the man is a delivery boy.\n\nBeing pessimistic on the other hand, also affects a person's life. If that person keeps on thinking negatively, he will not be able to go forward or succeed in life. For example, a group of student participates in a competition against an opponent group which has a higher opportunity to win them; if the group of students feel intimidated by their better opponent and they think negatively, they will lose their fighting spirit and have no motivation to do their best to win the opponent.
No, but it's toxic, so I would avoid breathing it at all costs.
Nope.  But I will have to say that you will probably need to be more motivated if you intend to work out at home.  I tried trial memberships at gyms..and they are great for working out with a partner and if you want to use the machines.  There are pros and cons for working out at home and the gym.\n\nHowever, if you do not have much money, you can easily work out at home.  You can do pushups and bodyweight squats..or run or jog.  Those do not require any equipment at all!  I got a bench, barbell, and some dumbbells..those are great workout for weight training.  For cardio, you can run/walk or maybe get a treadmill or stationery bike (which I use).  Or use those cardio tapes to get motivated like Tae-Bo (which is a tremendous workout). The only problem with working at home is that you do not have the environment and advanced machines as gyms do to work out.  But, it is inexpensive and just as effective. \n\nIn fact, I have not signed up for a gym membership at all and I have gained about 20 lbs of muscle (home-grown).  \n\nGood luck!
"Depends on how wide the ""gap"" is and how it got there..."
find a picture online or in a magazine of someone with the body size/shape you want. put one on the fridge, one on the bathroom door and one on the inside of your bedroom door.\n\ngo buy an outfit you absolutly love: 3 sizes to small. hang it on your bedroom wall.\n\nput the bathroom scale in the kitchen, near the fridge.\n\nfind someone who will go with you, it's lots more fun when working out with a friend.
The most important thing to remember is: No matter how beautiful or talented somebody is, we all have insecurities and all want to be liked by others (maybe not ALL but 99% of us).  So don't go thinking that you're the only scared person in the room.\n\nYou'd be surprised at what feedback you receive by simply smiling at somebody, or if you go out somewhere, make an effort to make somebody else feel more comfortable or better about themselves.  \n\nSlowly you will start to feel a lot more positive about yourself, hold your head a little higher and know that you're a worthwhile person.  \n\nMake sure you are true to yourself as well, if you're trying to be somebody you're not, you'll just frustrate yourself.  Don't get yourself down if somebody says or does anything that makes you feel bad - did they really intend to hurt you?  \n\nYou're the person you'll be stuck with through all the good times and bad times in your life so you'll need to be your own coach and support, you can't expect anybody else to.  \n\nThink of yourself as a product on a shelf - you're unique, somebody out there will need it, not everybody wants it, some will use it and throw it away - but nobody's going to try it if it sits up the back where nobody can reach it.\n\nHold your chin up, act confident (even if you're really scared) and people will respond well to that, and eventually you'll believe your own act.  Good luck!
The best thing is to pour honey into warm (not boiling) tea.\n\nRepeat often. Rest your voice in the meanwhile and keep your throat warm
Sorry that no one has answered your question yet...\n\nI would suggest speaking with a manager/director over your branch.  Do they know that you are having medical problems?  What are they? \n\nThere are a lot of different criteria for every company, much less the federal government.  This may be something that you may have to fight for, possibly even hire an attorney if need be.  I'm not sure as to the particulars of your situation, so I couldn't really tell you whether or not you SHOULD get disability retirement.  Definitely go through the ranks until you get an answer...that's your best bet.
Child Birth with no pain medicine. If that didnt kill, nothing will.\n\nOn a more serious note, when I was 12 I was in a car accident on an icy country road (it was springtime). The car I was in flipped over, I think they said 2 or 3 times and we ended up in a ditch. The ditch was pretty full with water runoff from melting snow so the car was coming in the windows. I had to sit in a sit up position for like 2 hours until someone found us. That experience also gave me my first look at death. My uncle was decapitated by the roof. The roof peeled back as we rolled down the enbankment.
as a past sufferer of TMJ I can tell ya this.  If you grind your teeth, have the clicking, get the headaches you most likely need an appliance made for your mouth.  You can get one for sleep only or 24/7.  I know you said you don't have a dentist but is that because insurance doesn't cover one?  I have heard that TMJ can sometimes be covered under medical because of the symptoms.\nIf neither are an option if you want you can do this to help the pain.  Put a pencil or bic pen in your mouth.  Lay the pen on the rear molar, lightly bite down.  Doing this separates the lower mandibular from your skull.  This gives the disc an opportunity to return to it proper space.  Releasing the nerves that your are pressing on.\ngood luck!  but you really need this piece made for your mouth.
not really;but it affects ur overall health.Constant ejaculation of semen is not a healthy practise. To ejaculate, u definitely need an long-lasting erection,which enlongates ur wee-wee but sometimes extremely painful if it lasts over 4hrs....just quit masturbating or taking viagara daily.Channel ur energy  somewhere else.
Use the Following Method of Penis Enlargment rather than Pills.\n\nPenis exercises works on the basis of exercising the muscle structures of the penis know as corpus canvernosum, which makes up 2/3 of the penis. Your current penis size is determined by the maximum amount of blood that your corpus cavernosa can hold when you have an erection. With proper exercise, the corpus cavernosa can be developed to be larger and stronger so that it will be able to hold more blood, giving you an increase in penis size.\nThe corpora cavernosa, is a spongy tissue containing distensible blood spaces, which increases in size when blood is pumped into it. And it is similar in construction to the pore cells in marine life called sponges. When the the pore cells in a live sponge are stretched repeatedly, it's absorption pores will expand and heal in this expanded state. Thus, the pore cells will become larger and more capable of absorbing more water and nutrients.\nThe corpora cavernosa is a live tissue which responds similarly in the manner of a sponge. Therefore, the actual size of the erectile tissue will increase as the distensible blood spaces increase their ability to absorb more blood, under the continuous stretching and healing of exercises. Thus, a larger penis can be achieved via exercises
I couldn't tell you. I figured that at my age that I'd have it all figured out too. I started college late. I have a degree. I ended up with a crappy job, and am now job hunting again. The last job was not very fulfilling. I just know that things are going to work out. There are things that are out of my control, but there are things that are. I just focus on those things. It'll eventually work itself out. The only real successful people that I know struggled years before making it big. They just did a few things to make it happen. 1) Never took no for an answer. 2) Believed that anything could happen. 3) Never gave up on their dreams/goals. 4) Just had faith. Especially in their selves. I just believe that something will happen as long as I don't give up.
masturbating constantly
dunno abt a calenlus but a renal calculus is basically kidney stones. drink lots of water everyday. nd yea its a disease nd best to get rid of it b4 it starts causing pain nd damaging ur genitourinary system
Don't bother\nIf you want a kid adopt one
No. I was abused as a child and watching SVU gets me really mad sometimes, but I have to tell myself that they are fake stories. Plus there's usually a good ending, so that make up for it making me angry.
hi, i really dont know which language you have texted, correct me if iam wrong...\nmy understand on your question is that, you weigh 75kgs and how would you arrive 70!!! is that right?\nVery simple proceedure... drink lots of water before every meal so that your consumption of food intake is less. \ntry taking liquids like fruit juices. avoid eating pizzas and burgers in regular basis :)
it is partly, but not hard liquor as other alcoholic drinks would come under.
Weight training will not stunt your growth unless you damage your growth (Epiphyseal Cartilage) plates. This is rare and will not happen if you follow a sound exercise program. To be safe, avoid one rep maximum lifts for now and check your ego out at the door; follow sound progressive weight training practices
It depends on how course your hair is.  If really thick just a few uses.  If really fine, a month.
The smell of peppermint can alleviate headaches.  I burn peppermint incense or a peppermint candle.  There are also topically applied balms you can use to massage your temples or neck--I've got one from Bath&Body Works that helps somewhat.  The caffeine suggestion can really work,  too.
In humans and most other mammals, ammonia is produced in the bloodstream when mitochondria (the power plants of cells) break down amino acids for energy. The left over chemicals combine to form ammonia. Ammonia is normally converted to a chemical compound called urea by the liver. If the liver is not functioning in this regard, or if liver failure occurs, a high ammonia level can result. Other symptoms of liver failure include jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes).
To be safe, I had each eye done separately. Each surgery took place on a Saturday... The first time, I didn't return to work until Wednesday but, honestly, I could've gone back sooner.  After the second eye, I went back on Tuesday.  \n\nKeep in mind that it isn't as if you won't be able to *see* right away... But you're going to want to rest the first day.  On the second and maybe third days, you could, in theory, be productive -- but there might be some pain and a lot of eye-watering (and some throbbing temples).  I had to wear protective eyewear, too, which would have looked really silly had returned to work right away. :-)\n\nBest of luck! The experience will be life changing! (If you're interested, I kept a blog of the experience/recovery that I'm more than happy to share... [I just don't want to post the link here.])
The best OTC therapy for acne is a combination of products. Go for a facial wash (preferably in gel form) that contains Salicylic Acid 2%(like L'oreal Pure Zone gel face wash, or Olay Clarity Daily Face Wash). Use a facial scrub (also containing Salicylic Acid 2%) 2-3 times a week, or daily if your acne is severe (Olay Clarity Daily Facial Scrub and St Ives Medicated Scrub for Acne-prone Skin are good bets). Then treat blemishes with a spot medication containing Benzoil Peroxide 10% (Clearasil Ultra Blemish Treatment is a good alternative). If your skin tends to dry out when using any of these products, then an oil-free moisturizer formulated for acne-prone skin is in order (L'oreal Pure Zone Oil-free Moisturizer is the best one I have use to date). This regimen of combining products containing Salicylic Acid with others containing Benzoil Peroxide is the principle behind the much-advertised Proactiv Solution (developed by dermatologists Rodan & Fields). You may also use the Proactiv Solution regimen if you can afford it (it's somewhat costly; about $50:00 for a month's supply; you have to buy direct from the manufacturers because it's not sold in pharmacies).
OK, this is kind of gross.  Scabies are actually tiny insects that burrow under the skin and cause redness, rash, etc.  It's easily treatable, though, so don't cut your friend off! You may want to see your doctor if you start itching, though.

I think it depends on what your doctor decides is right for you. I'm on the 30. I weigh way more than my friend who goes to the same doctor as me and he's got her on the 37.5.\nI'm doing great on the 30 (18 lbs the first month) so I probably don't need the 37.5. \nIt could be a question of balancing the side effects with the weight loss too.  I'm thirsty, I get hot flashes, I can't fall asleep, can't stay asleep. My friend on the 37.5 gets worse hot flashes and even faints in the sun, and she's got constant dry mouth no matter how much she drinks. And she's losing weight slower than I am.\nThere's a lot of info on the phentermine official site.
I suggest that you use an SPF-50 or higher sunscreen EVERY DAY. This is the sunblock most people use on babies.
Depends on your height and gender. Check your BMI (body mass index) Google search it.
"Yes. As someone who's dealt with depression personally, I can tell you that depression is not just sadness. Depression can also cause irritability and mood swings. \n\n""Depression is a treatable illness involving an imbalance of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters. It is not a character flaw or a sign of personal weakness. You can’t make yourself well by trying to ""snap out of it."" Although it can run in families, you can’t catch it from someone else. The direct causes of the illness are unclear, however it is known that body chemistry can bring on a depressive disorder, due to experiencing a traumatic event, hormonal changes, altered health habits, the presence of another illness or substance abuse.""\n\nSymptoms of Depression \n\nProlonged sadness or unexplained crying spells \nSignificant changes in appetite and sleep patterns \nIrritability, anger, worry, agitation, anxiety \nPessimism, indifference \nLoss of energy, persistent lethargy \nFeelings of guilt, worthlessness \nInability to concentrate, indecisiveness \nInability to take pleasure in former interests, social withdrawal \nUnexplained aches and pains \nRecurring thoughts of death or suicide"

I think it depends on the sport. I'm batting about a 12% but I'm naturally rather thin and I do martial arts that is quite a heavy workout. I think if you do an endurance sport that uses a lot of reserve energy, like long distance running, triathalon etc. you'll want a bit more than something short, like Javelin or sprinting.
"According to Jeff Nightbyrd, there is testing industry data that taking 4 aspirins a few hours prior to the test might help you. "". . . aspirin interferes with the Syvia [sic] EMIT assay. It seems that aspirin absorbs at the same wavelength that NAD does which is how it interferes with the assay"" (Clin Chem 34 (90) 602-606). Two reliable sources have tested aspirin and found it to interfere with the EMIT. In the future they will try to find a way to circumvent this test flaw. Until then, I certainly recommend taking advantage of the situation and using aspirin"

For someone who isolates themselves from others it is helpful for the person to try to do something where people are involved but you don't have to talk to them like go for  a drive where people are around. Something that involves people but causes the least amount of anxiety. Once the person has no more anxiety from that move up a level. Like getting out of the car and going for a walk with few people around. Each level should involve more people, more anxiety but enough to handle in small doses until the anxiety is gone. The final test would be  going to some kind of social function. It's a gradual process that can help get rid of the anxiety. It will be slightly uncomfortable but it does work and as you or someone you are trying to help goes through this they will see as they reach each level there level of anxiety will decrease. They need to remember the thought of what could happen not what will is where the anxiety comes from. Another good thing to do is write down what you think will happen if you go out and then write down what does happen. What you think will happen most likely won't. The more you isolate yourself the worse the anxiety gets. Your basically  reinforcing your anxiety every time you avoid other people. Good Luck.
You don't have to suffer with those symptoms, which, by the way are very natural to have (just to put your mind at ease).\nPlease go see your Dr. and he/she will put you on Hormone Replacement Therapy, HRT for short.  The medication will stop all those symptoms and make you feel like your old self again :-).  \nSo please go, I guarantee you'll feel much better!
That is a very common reaction to birth control. I wouldn't worry too much unless you really think you are pregnant. Of course it's always best to be cautious; for $10 a pregnancy test wouldn't hurt.
it means you feed it some f'ed up shiite
Brush it with a brush until it hurts really lots. I dunno it works for me
sand Gnats (silent g) are little insects you usually get from the beach or other animals like pelicans. They generally live in the sand and can be afully itchy.

The body is unable to store water for any length of time and needs fresh supplies every day due to losses from lungs and skin, accounting for 50% of water loss; losses from urine and faeces account for the rest of the total losses. The amount we need depends on our metabolism, the weather, the food we eat and our activity levels. Heavy or obese people carry less body water than people of a healthy weight. As fat content increases, lean tissue decreases, leading to an overall decline in total body water. Body water is higher in men than in women and falls in both with age. Most mature adults lose about 2.5 litres (women) to 3 litres (men) per day and the elderly lose about 2 litres per day. This water loss needs to be replaced through food and beverages. Foods provide about 1 litre of fluid and the remainder must be obtained from beverages.
Seriously, you need to study reproduction and how it works.  If all you had was oral and finger sex, there is NO way you can be pregnant.

get rid of them:\nlet your skin heal, you're abusing yourself.\n\nprevent them:\nyou could try a dipilatory like neet but wait until after you've healed.  I've heard bad things about the type of hair removal systems that *pluck* your hair out.  If you're prone to ingrown hair you may want to avoid these and the dipilatory as well.  \n\nA lotion and an electronic razor may be your salvation.  They're smooth and don't cut deeply.  Your pantyhose may stick soon after shaving though but it won't look bad.\n\nGo natural?  Some men like that.  Whatever you do you'll adapt to your own body and learn what to do and when to balance being comfortable and presentable as well.  Heal first though, then try something that doesn't hurt you.  Eventually the razor burn will go away but leave your skin rougher and harder if you continue with what you're doing now.
Yes, but I'd try to vary the type of exercise to avoid injury. Alternate jogging, cycling, elliptical trainer, etc.
31 for your CO2 isn't too much over the range.  When CO2 levels are higher or lower than normal, it suggests that your body is having trouble maintaining its acid-base balance or that you have upset your electrolyte balance, perhaps by losing or retaining fluid. Both of these imbalances may be due to a wide range of dysfunctions. Your SGPT level could be high if you have liver damage from an acute viral infection such as viral hepatitis A, B, or C, or \nyou have liver damage caused by medicines you have taken. Other reasons could be drinking too much alcohol, mononucleosis, chronic liver infection or inflammation, gallbladder inflammation, such as may caused by gallstones, gallbladder infection, congested blood flow through the liver due to heart failure, liver cancer or another cancer that has spread to the liver, or you are taking certain medicines, such as: \nmedicines used to lower cholesterol levels \nantifungal medicines \nsome narcotics and barbiturates \nmethotrexate \nacetaminophen \nsalicylates (aspirin). \nYour doctor will probably do further testing to determine what the exact cause may be.

You cannot have a healthy, happy relationship with anyone else until you have one with yourself. Get help. Stop thinking happiness lies outside yourself. It does not. Be love and you will attract love. Focus on developing body, mind, and spirit. As desperate as you are, the only partner(s) you will attract will bring unhappiness. Take the focus off yourself. Get together with other folks your age and do a full range of activities like sports, dance, hiking, prayer, volunteering. Enjoy every day the way things are and guaranteed you will attract wonderful friends and, at just the right time,the love of your life.

Yes the first thing you need to ask  your self is the caffiene making my heart race? Then you have to say to your self i am me and i am above this, calm down like the other guy or girl have said, and get some water. If you really want to get better as not being too hyper do what i do and have some vitamin c. This should help you just a little bit more then a bath or water. Emergency C IS A diffanite antidote to caffiene it is caffienes enemy. Emergency is packed with enough caffiene to make you feel great and takes the caffiene out of your system  by the minerals that it contains all heathly minerals of course. To calm your self down completly you might try Brewers Yeast you can find this in the health food store and no it well not grow a root in side you as some dumb ass who didnt know what he was talking about told me false information about the product. Brewers yeast taste nasty by the way and you might get a hot flash as a side effect it is normal when taking it for the first time. It is a common caffience jumpy healer.

you don't want to go with the shot, norplant, iud, if you want to get pregnant sooner, than later.  I'm 32, and I use the ring and I love it!  What is the reason for changing your birthcontrol?  If you smoke, it'll be of concern after age 35, though you should still quit if you do.  If it was because you got pregnant on the last one, you should definitely reconsider that type.  If it's simply because your doctor thinks you've been on it too long, but it works, and you're comfortable with it, get a different doctor.  Birth control changes take time to adjust to, and shouldn't be done for no reason.
Depression is just a bad spirit. You just need to tell yourself YOU ARE NOT A DEPRESSED PERSON, and it will go away.
To apply for school you need to check online for a list of PT schools.  Check out www.apta.org for a list of schools.  Then just look on the school websites and they will tell you how to apply.\n\nThe undergrad degree you have is up to you.  It helps to have a good background in Anatomy, because if you have a good understanding of that it makes things much easier.  But the stuff you learn is going to be new and most undergrad courses will not cover it.  Some places have a Pre-Physical Therapy degree or an Exercise Science degree may help.  But it my opinion it does not matter, just as long as you know how to study you will be fine.  \n\nCheck out  http://physicaltherapist.com/ they have a message board with some good information just for students.

A 2 year old child, and indeed a 4 year old child, is a metaphorical sponge. Unless there has been a trauma, a valid set of symptoms, or some other REALLY good reason for taking a 2 year old to a psych., then I'm afraid that all it will do is suggest to the child that all problems can be solved by a doc and a pill. Not a healthy approach to raising a child to be an autonomous adult. As for inheriting the problems of the mother, these problems are not likely to be diagnosed in a small child ( most inherited depression will show up in older children or adolescents), and if such concerns exist, attentive parenting will tell when the child is in need of professional help. And, if the child is in distress via the environment created by a depressed mother, then the main focus should be to prevent the mother's parenting from hurting the child, rather than treating the child for the damage her mother's parenting is causing.
Could be your mattress or pillows are uncomfortable and making you wake up to find a comfortable position again...try replacing one or both perhaps?
"Muscles are composed of muscle fibres called actin and myosin. They are arranged overlapping, and can slide over each other. There are receptors on them, and when the central nervous system sends a signal, the muscle fibres slide over each other with the help of the ""ratchet mechanism"", which means some ratchet like molecules on actin sweeps the myosin forward, causing more overlapping.\nMore overlapping of muscle fibres cause the whole muscle to contract. Less overlapping cause it to relax.\nA movement is often done with two opposing sets of muscles (they are called antagonists). For example in your arm, when the biceps contract, the triceps relax, and vice versa. If they contract or relax at the same time, there is no movement seen."
other than age and genes, the reason most people gain weight is lack of exercise and poor food choices. if a person undergoes a liposuction procedure, he/she will lose the fat, sure, but unless that person modifies his/her eating behavior and starts exercising properly and regularly afterwards, in the long term, he/she will most definitely gain the body fat back.

Sometimes the terms STI and STD are used interchangeably. This can be confusing and not always accurate, so it helps first to understand the difference between infection and disease. Infection simply means that a germ – virus, bacteria, or parasite – that can cause disease or sickness is present inside a person’s body. An infected person does not necessarily have any symptoms or signs that the virus or bacteria is actually hurting their body (they do not necessarily feel sick). A disease means that the infection is actually causing the infected person to feel sick, or to notice something is wrong. For this reason, the term STI – which refers to infection with any germ that can cause an STD, even if the infected person has no symptoms – is a much broader term than STD. \n\nThe term STD refers only to infections that are causing symptoms or problems. Because most of the time, people don’t know they are infected with an STI until they start showing symptoms of disease, the AIDS Resource Center uses the term STD, even though the term STI is also appropriate in many cases.\n\nDepending on the STI, a person may or may not still be able to spread the infection if no signs of disease are present. For example, a person is much more likely to spread herpes infection when blisters are present (STD) than when they are absent (STI). However, a person can spread HIV infection (STI) at any time, even if they haven’t developed symptoms of AIDS (STD).

Try walking, running, moving in general for a half an hour a day. Don't let up. Pep talks always help me. Don't eat when you're not hungry and drink plenty of water. Don't deny yourself the foods you want. Just eat them in moderation and slowly your body won't want fatty or sugary foods. But if you deny yourself a candy bar or something like that, you're more likely to cheat on your diet and/or binge eat.

"Even if it sucks to have your period every month, it's bad to mess with mother nature. Even if the drug gets pass, is it really ""safe""? It could be safe for some women but harmful for others, everyone's body is different especially concerning the menstural cycle. Perhaps not having periods could lead to other health concerns, one may never know. Is it worth that risk to save money of feminine products and get rid of some emotional stress for a couple of days to a week? Sure there's probably many positive things that others can think of that would come out of not ever having periods, but that would just make us one more step closer to males."
It is a natural human reaction and feeling.
Try blowing your nose.It works for me when i have a cold.It slows down my sneezing.
I'm guessing that you are aware that anophthalmus is the absence of one or both eyeballs.  At this point, there is no treatment other than taking adaptive measures to compensate for the lack of depth perception (for unilateral cases) or blindness (for bilateral cases).  However, the absence of an eyeball can lead to growth retardation of the facial bones on that side, so surgeons will sometimes implant tissue expanders to promote more normal development and eventually put in a glass prosthesis.
It's most likely a spine problem of some sort.  The spine controls the nerves and the nerves in turn control the muscles. If the legs are weak and he/she is having back pain, most liekly their is something gong on with the spine. Take 'em to a good orthopedist.
"I haven't heard of this before with fibro - you might want to try the scientific journal databases. I would recommend searching with High Wire or PubMed (links below), although I did a quick search and couldn't find anything with the search terms (""Jo-1 antibody"" AND fibromyalgia) on PubMed...\n\nDid come across three articles on High Wire (3rd link below), including one very interesting one about ANA and fibro (will be posting that to my Yahoo group and their wiki!)\n\nGood luck."
What is White gold?\n\nWhite gold is an alloy of gold and some white metals such as silver and palladium. White gold can be 18ct, 14ct, 10ct or any karat. For example, 18ct yellow gold is made by mixing 75% gold (750 parts per thousand) with 25% (250 parts per thousand) other metals such as copper and zinc. 18ct white gold is made by mixing 75% gold with 25% other metals such as silver and palladium. So the amount of gold is the same but the alloy is different.\n\nTraditionally nickel was used in white gold, however, nickel is no longer used in most white gold made today as nickel can cause reactions with some people. We generally do not use or sell nickel in our white gold.\n\nWhen white gold rings are new they are coated with another white metal called Rhodium. Rhodium is a metal very similar to platinum and Rhodium shares many of the properties of platinum including its white color.\n\nThe rhodium plating is used to make the white gold look more white. The natural color of white gold is actually a light grey color. The Rhodium is very white and very hard, but it does wear away eventually. To keep a white gold ring looking its best it should be re-rhodium plated approximately each 12 to 18 months. \n\n \n\nWhy am I allergic to some gold jewelry? \n\nEvery year we get a few customers who believe that they cannot wear gold jewelry because they get an allergic reaction to it. Some believe that they are allergic to gold. We have never yet known anybody who was allergic to pure gold, and seems very unlikely as gold is inert and not active in the sense of corrosion or decomposition over time, nor is it acidic.\nThe most common cause of allergic reactions to jewelry is nickel contained in the alloy. Nickel is, or was, frequently used in white gold alloys because it is inexpensive, hard, and has a strong whitening effect. Better quality white gold alloys use palladium, which has excellent properties but is more expensive. \n\nCommonest Causes\nThe next commonest cause of allergies for jewelry wearers appears to be detergent or other chemicals which lodge between the jewelry, usually rings, and the skin. Hairdressers are often affected. Rinsing well can help, but it is probably best to remove rings before using any troublesome chemicals, and use a barrier cream. \n\nOther Causes\nA few jewelry wearers still seem to be slightly allergic to yellow gold's, nickel cannot be the cause because it is not used in yellow gold alloys. In most cases sufferers only experience problems with low gold content alloys such as ten carat, so upgrading to a better alloy such as eighteen carat usually solves all problems. \n\nHigher Carat Gold\nThe other common components of ten carat gold alloys are copper, silver and zinc. Zinc is usually very well tolerated, it is used in many medical preparations. Silver and copper do not usually cause allergic reactions, but both will form compounds with atmospheric pollutants which may be the cause of some reported problems. When copper and silver are present in high carat alloy such as eighteen or twenty two carat, they are more resistant to attack by chemicals, because they are bound more closely with the gold content, and this will explain why high carat alloys cause fewer problems. \n\nAnti-Perspirants\nStrange as it may seem, but using anti-Perspirants can exacerbate metal allergy problems. It has been found that the sweat of a healthy person in a sauna can contain 20 times the nickel content of blood plasma, this may help to explain why exercise can improve health. Anti-Perspirants can reduce the bodies natural way of eliminating heavy metals. Healthy natural lifestyles tend to improve health, whereas unnatural practices can cause problems.
don't feel bad..I'm very skinny too....i eat a whole bunch though...you may have a fast metabolism (or however you spell it) \nthat's what i have so don't be sad...it may catch up to you one day and you'll wish you were like that again..lol
Eat less move more.  I eat once a day and when I take my daughter to the park or whatever I get up and play with her instead of sitting on the bench like all the other mothers.  The whole 2000 cal a day is too much for anyone, you can actually gain weight on 2000 cal a day. To lose weight you want to eat more like 1200 cal a day and 1800 to maintain. Make sure you eat a healthy 1200 cals. Don't eat empty calories.
"It's an STD (Sexually Transmitted Disease). \nAs far as I know, there is no known cure for it, but there are medications that help reduce the number of ""break outs"" a person has.

Celiac sprue (AKA celiac disease or Gluten-Sensitive Enteropathy), is a chronic disease of the digestive tract.  It is a *genetic* disease that is characterized\nby autoimmune damage to the mucosal lining of the small intestine when gluten is ingested.\n\nPeople with CS cannot tolerate gluten in any form (gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, barley and some oats).  When gluten is ingested by people with the disease, the mucosa of their intestines is damaged by an immunologically mediated inflammatory response, which results in maldigestion and malabsorption.\n\nSymptoms vary but can include severe gas pain, stomach pain, malodorous and oily stools and/or profuse diarrhea, and weight loss.\n\nBecause it is a genetic, inheritable disease, there is no true prevention.  However, there are things that can be done to help manage it, most notably, dietary changes.\n\nThe Celiac Sprue Association can be very helpful to those interested in or living with the disease.  You can see them online at http://www.csaceliacs.org.  Hope that helps.
Faster but less time, definately.\n\nUsually referred to as HIT (High Intensity Training), this is a method, most people use to lose body fat.\n\nBy running at a moderate pace, you aren't challenging the body enough and while you burn calories and will see results with it, it usually takes longer than with HIT's.\n\nThe reason is that by doing HIT's, your metabolism stays raised for a longer amount of time after your workout which helps you burn more fat at least 2 hrs after you work out. As where doing moderate pace, only helps you burn fat for the duration of your workout.\n\nSome HIT activities include: Sprints, Hills, Stairs, Suicides
Lower Abs Exercise - Abominal Workout\n\nGet Your Flat Abs With Leg Raises\n\nHanging Leg Raises are becoming one of the most popular abdominal exercises, and with good reason. This intense movement is a great way to target the entire abdominal region including the difficult to hit lower abs.\n\nIf you’re not already incorporating Hanging Leg Raises into your ab routine on a regular basis, you should give them a go. Here’s the basic technique.\n\nYou begin the movement hanging from a Lat Pull-up bar. Your grip should be about shoulder width apart, and your arms should remain fully extended throughout the movement.\n\nYou want to bend your knees slightly and keep them bent throughout.\n\nNow, using your ab muscles only, raise your legs up to a point where your feet are about level with your belly button (note: you do not want to swing your legs up with your hips—focus on your abs).\n\nAs typical with abs, hold the peak contraction for a count of one or two and squeeze hard. Perform the negative portion of the movement slowly by lowering your legs resisting somewhat on the way down. Repeat for a tight set of 12-20 reps.\n\nLower Abs Workout - Training Lower Abdominals\n\nHave you tried Vertical Lying Leg Thrusts yet? These are a great target exercise for your lower abs.\n\nBegin by lying on your back; I like to do the movement on a flat bench, but it also works on the floor.\n\nNow lift your legs until they’re vertical. Tuck your hands under your buttocks, and make sure your lower back is flat on the ground.\n\nTo perform the movement concentrate on tightening up and squeezing together the muscles in your lower abs. Your legs and your lower torso should move upward toward the ceiling.\n\nRemember, the feeling you’re after is one of tightening and squeezing in your abs; and it’s this squeezing that should lift your buttocks off your hands.\n\nLower your torso back down to complete one rep. The most important thing in lower ab training is not how many reps you do but how hard you squeeze.

You are bound to die...but that is just your body, sir.  Your soul will live on and go to the next stage, depending on how you lived this life.  Your body is just a vessel, a storage facility for your most important function.  Your energy cannot die, and will live forever.  YOU choose where it will go by the choices you make in life.
there are 2 pulse points on your arms.the wrist which known as the radial pulse and the inner side at the joint between your forarm and arm which is known as the brachial pulse. there is one at your neck andthis is the most prominent pulse point and is known as the catotid pulse.\nat the lower part of your tummy there is one pulse point but it is very hard to feel it and it is known as the aortic pulse and usually clinicians seldom assess this pulse point. however it may become very prominent in a person with acute aortic anuerysm( a mediacal condtion where there is enlargement of aorta, a big artery in body, and this is a medical emergency)\nthere is one pulse point at the joint between the torsal and the leg (known as the inguinal region)and this pulse point is known as the femoral pulse. at the back of the knee joint there is also a pluse point. it is known as the popliteal pulse. it is relatively harder to be felt and in orderto have a better feeling you can actually try to relax your leg and straighten and press harder with thumb at the knee join and the three fingers pressing at the pulse point.\nthere is one pulse point at the point 2cm behind and 2cm under the ankle and it is known as the posterior tibialis pulse. the other pulse point is on foot and it is known as the dorasalis pedis pulse.all the pulse points mentioned above except forthe aortic pulse are all found at both left and right side of the body.
I'm not an expert but I did take classes in college for diet and fitness. I agree with the other poster's answers on slowing it down and taking a rest, there is one thing I'm wondering and if I knew I could answer your question more elaborately. Did you feel nauseous that morning as well? When you wake up in the morning, generally that is when your blood sugar is at it's lowest. Perhaps you had abnormally low blood sugar that morning. A rapid heart rate and shakiness are infact signs and symptoms of low blood sugar. Did you feel better after you ate? This is quite normal. Well I am not a doctor but this is my educated guess. Good Luck!
your cold would have nothing to do with losing that much body fat, my question to you is...if you are 16 WHY in the world are you measuring body fat? you are still growing, dont worry about your percentage. Worry about taking care of yourself to get over your cold, and just stay healthy. My suggestion to you would be even though you are sick, try to eat as much protein as possible, even if its just chicken broth, your body needs protein to create more cells and keep your muscle rather than burn it during a temporary reprieve from eating.
you could always invite her out as a group, like ask her to bring a friend and you bring a friend, and you all go to the movies. Let her learn some things about you and then ask her out on a date for just the two of you. You could always ask for her phone number or give her yours. you kind of have to just put yourself out there and see what happens. Don't rush her, girls usually hate that. good luck!

I'm not a doctor. What i know is angiograph is an imaging technique to visualize the blood vessels. It is not a therapeutic procedure, i.e. it cant cure you. May be your doctor mean angioplasty or other procedures with similar spelling.\n\nAnyway, i would suggest you to follow your doctor decision. He is the expert and he knows what need to be done. He is the one with all the information about your health and condition. You should consult your doctor if you have any doubt. Not asking this online. Good luck and get well soon.
Women with PCOS can have a baby, although they suffer from high rates of infertility and pregnancy loss.  Use of medications like Clomiphene pills or Gonadotropin injections can be used to help stimulate the ovary to ovulate; sometimes even IVF will be necessary.  There are surgical interventions available as well, including ovarian drilling.  A reproductive endocrinologist in your area should be able to help guide you towards the best fertility treatments for your personal case.  Good luck to you.

I was dx'd May 4, 2005 (I'll remember that date for a long time).  Mine started out with optic neuritis, but I didn't know that's what it was called (November 2002).  It lasted for about a month or two, then went away.  Then in August of '04, I developed a headache, and it lasted until January '05, at which point I became dizzy/uncoordinated.  After the dizziness went away, so did the headache.  Went for a check-up,... yadda, yadda, yadda,...I have MS. \n\nI have problems with balance/coordination, bright flashes when I move my eyes, as well as spots/squigglies when I get tired, intermittent numbness/tingling, and other things.  I've been using Copaxone, so I hope it will help.  But I'm doing pretty well, considering the diagnosis.   \n\nGood luck to you!  I hope your taking one of the ABC drugs!  If not, you need to.  I just hope you have good insurance, because they're expensive!  My Copaxone costs app. $1,500/month.  Anyway, take care!\n\nlarsonblocklin@yahoo.com
I am sure it is not recommended. It would be wise to check with the Physician who ordered it for you, perhaps he might say it is OK to have one or two drinks, but that is not for someone here to tell you.....talk to your Doctor.

depreciation is related to wear and value \nthat is why land does not depreciate\nand why depreciation is based on the useful life of the asset\n\n(I see that irish copied the def from the wiki, which I often do, but in this case the definition is not entirely correct.)
Yes
not as much as you think.\n\nYou will put your body into starvation mode and it will cling to every fat cell like grim death.
Try a chiropractor.  Also try to eat a more alkaline than acid diet:  less protein and cooked foods, more raw fruits and vegetables.\n\nDry skin brushing will help with all-over circulation:  http://healingtools.tripod.com/skinbrush.html  Be sure to use a different brush for your neck and face than for the rest of your body.  And make sure it's a natural bristle brush, not one of those plastic things.\n\nNiacin helps to bring blood to the surface of the skin.  You may need to eat more foods high in niacin:  foods high in protein, like meat, eggs, and peanuts.  B supplements need to be taken in balance.  If you can find an herbalist in your area, they can help you find a combination B suited to your needs.\n\nI hope this helps!  I can't imagine how stressful that must be.
"First of all, when a counselor or treatment center is treating an addict and they involve the family in the treatment, I've never heard of them billing the family.  It is considered part of the treatment of the addict.\n\nHowever, if there is a particular counselor who wants to be paid separately from what he or she is being paid from the insurance company for treating the addicted person, they should be willing to make payment arrangements with the family members (and make sure they aren't charging you too much - I would have to know what college degree the counselor has to give you some idea - but the MOST a PhD counselor gets from an insurance company is usually around $100 for a 50-minute session - no matter who is there).\n\nI hope this helped a little.  Whenever you are ""paying privately"" (i.e. not through insurance), doctors, dentists, counselors, etc. offer what they call a ""sliding fee scale,"" if you cannot afford their rates.  This is usually based on how much you can afford to pay and you reach a written agreement before services are provided.  Take care..."
"ABSOLUTLEY!\n\nSleep performs a restorative function for the brain and body as evidenced by the myriad symptoms of metabolic dysfunction that result when animals are deprived of sleep.\n\nTherefore, by not getting enough sleep, you are not providing your body with the neccesary ""refresh"" stage that builds hormones and chemicals needed to keep your energy high enough to lose weight. Lack of sleep puts your body into a different ""mode"" and you will have less energy, and feel less like eating right and excersizing. You might think you would be able to tell yourself you can fight that, but you cannot.\n\nSleeping also is where your mind takes your short term memory and places into long term. So, lack of sleep makes you forget things more, and your body reverts to ""insticts"". \n\nOur instincts aren't that healthy for us sometimes... for example, your brain will ask for more junk food as it makes you feel ""comfortable"" and your brain will ask for more relaxing time, even without sleep.\n\nTrust me, you will not lose weight without proper rest, and lack of sleep will only help you GAIN weight, and stress your system!"
you need to be advised by your doctor as they will give you the correct information that is required for your needs.  and will give you the right medication that will help you. also it would up date your medical files in case of an emergency.

The infection could be treated with antibiotics, but if the tooth is still there, it will likely keep coming back.  If you're wisdom tooth is impacted, it needs to be pulled anyway.  It will only cause more problems later if you don't see a dentist and let them pull it.
"There are plenty of sites that do that but they're all total BS.  Many of them will claim things like ""the average score of people who took this IQ test was 125.""  No, if the average IQ for the entire sample of a given test is not exactly 100 there's something seriously wrong with their scoring system.  And then people take them and think their IQ is like 145 (this would be less than 0.5% of the population, but I've seen several people on here claim that that's what they got) when they couldn't even figure out that online IQ tests are useless.  I talked about IQ tests specifically because there are so many of them, but the same applies to just about any online test."

Arthritis can only develop between joints that move.  Arthritis is basically when the cushion between joints is warn away and the bones begin to rub on each other eventually wearing the bone down causing severe pain or discomfort, as the teeth do not move, they can not have arthritis.
If it is bright blood it could mean hemorrhoids. I would eat more fiber. If it is old dark blood you could be loosing blood through your bowels and you should see a doctor. They will do a stool sample. Some medicines cause this. Do you take aspirin or any arthritis meds? This can be serious. You can loose enough blood to lower your RBC's (red blood count) Get checked it could be serious or just minor like hemorrhoids

Is it truly condom allergy?\nAllergy to latex condoms can cause a rash on the penis, or on the genital skin of your sexual partner. As well as redness, there may be blistering and itching. The rash usually occurs 6–48 hours after using the condom. If these are your symptoms, latex allergy could be the reason, but other things can also cause similar symptoms. For example, using a perfumed bubble bath, soap or shower gel that does not suit you can cause irritation on the genitals, or an infection such as herpes might be responsible.\n\nSome condoms contain a spermicide (usually nonoxynol-9), so your problem could be sensitivity to the spermicide, rather than to the latex rubber.\n\nTry non-latex, non-spermicide condoms\nNon-latex condoms are available, so it would make sense to try these. Check the description on the packet. Non-latex condoms will usually state that they are made from polyurethane (but there are other non-latex materials). As well as not provoking an allergic reaction, they do not have a rubbery smell. Also, they conduct body heat better so they feel thinner than they really are, which may make sex more pleasurable.\n\nDurex Avanti is a widely available polyurethane condom. \neZ.on is a polyurethane condom that is ‘bidirectional, so you can put it on inside-out. \nTactylon is another non-latex condom. \nResearch suggests that the Avanti and Tactylon condoms are as effective for contraception as the usual latex types. However, non-latex condoms are slightly more likely to break, so take extra care putting them on (see Using a condom).\n\nCheck that the condom does not contain spermicide, such as nonoxynol-9. (In fact, this is less common in condoms now, because research among women at high risk of catching HIV showed that nonoxynol-9 actually increased their risk.)\n\nLatex allergy can be serious\nLatex allergy can sometimes be much more serious than just a rash. It can cause shortness of breath, feeling faint and swelling of the skin shortly after contact with latex. Anyone with these symptoms needs immediate medical attention. If this has happened to you in the past, you need to discuss it with your doctor, because in rare cases this type of reaction can be fatal. If you have latex allergy and need a medical or surgical procedure you should inform medical staff; you should also tell your dentist.\n\nYou may have food allergies as well\nLatex comes from the sap of the rubber tree Hevea brasiliensis. (This is different from the rubber plant that you might have at home.) People who are allergic to latex may be allergic to some plant foods that contain similar chemicals, especially avocado, potato, banana, tomato and kiwi fruit.\n\nSources of information\nBeezhold DH et al.

When they flush your colon with water. It is suppose to keep you from getting intestinal viruses like stomach flu, but it will also cause problems down the road. Your body has a natural process call peristalsis that help you have a bowel movement. When you continually interrupt that you will eventually be an old person that need a laxative daily or a depends and some wipes.
In case it is caused by a medical condition (tinnitus - a subjective ringing or tinkling sound in the ear) you should consult your family physician. It can have serious implications.

have you ever checked on your blood pressures?\nmaybe you are having low blood pressure\n\nbecause i was in d same situation as urs too.
I quit smoking ages ago. I moved onto cigars then eventually stopped. Exercise is very good for taking your mind off smoking. Avoid going into bars where there are smokers. The health benefits are a bonus and of course, your clothes won't smell discusting either. Failing that, try handcuffs!
Yup.  You should see a dr immediately.
My friend Hue has this chapstick that makes you high whe nyou sniff it.
desyrel was the first brand name to make it. :)
Consult with your pediatrician. There are some good over the counter cold medicines for children, but you should check with your Dr. first on which would be best for your child, and how much and how often to give it.
He needs to go to a neurologists.  Shaky hands is a neurological disorder.  Parkisons disease is a good idea.  You need to find a right doctor.  Oh look on www.webmd.com  you can send messages to doctors there.
No, it could be worse.. yes the skin has carbs because it has flour in it.. but not as many carbs as a piece of bread.. so your OK.. The coleslaw I looked up and had 22 grams.. which is pretty equivalent to a piece of bread. But\ndon't get upset, or feel like a failure, because that will only lead you to get off your diet.. some people have off days, and eat something they shouldn't when on a diet.. but don't let it discourage you..If you feel real guilty the best thing you can do after eating carbs is go for a walk and burn some of it off..  \nThe best way to lose weight though, is to find a diet that you can live with for the rest of your life, and usually that isn't a low carb diet.. maybe cut down your calories to 1000-1200 a day, and make Sunday a cheat day, where you can eat anything you want.. remember, sometimes its not the food you eat, but the portions you take.. \nGood Luck..
Portion control.  And are you going for sight seeing?  If you will be doing alot of walking while there, that should help.\n\nBut really, as far as food goes...just watch your portions.\n\nAnd have FUN!!!!
Lift weights and take protein.

Yes, one time we picked up this guy who was bleeding really badly from a stomach wound. I put my hand in there to stop the bleeding. When we got to the hospital i found out my hand was on a BOMB! Oh, wait... that was an episode of Gray's Anatomy. Sorry!
You have a build-up of lactic acid in your legs. You need to flush it out to ease your discomfort. A massage may help, so will lots of water and moderate exercise like walking. If nothing else, your discomfort will ease in a few days.
It does..it slows it down. It slows everything down.

I have fibromyalgia. I have had MANY symptoms related to the disease, from severe allergies, asthma, GERD, pain, insomnia, and so on. I was told by 1 specialist that they are now finding that Fibro is related to many food allergies(I thought the doc was a little whacked to be honest until I saw an allergist), see an allergist to start for testing and go from there. I have multiple food allergies I never knew about and once I eliminated those foods I began to feel better. If allergies are not your problem see a rheumatologist. They usually treat the associated problems with Fibro not Fibro itself, there is currently no medication for treatment but there is one up for approval by the FDA soon. Good Luck with your quest.
everything has to do with timing. once that has been established, then everything after that falls into place.
wow and i always thought that was the way my eyes were supposed to be. aka spotted hazel eyes!\n now im gonna have to look into this. my spots are more brown than black!\n\nPigment Spots are dark brown spots appearing at random throughout the iris. These indicate liver and pancreas malfunction. High or low blood sugar conditions should be suspected.
Poor circulation is due to a number of things.  What really happens is that your blood vessels loose the ability constrict and dilate when needed.  What happens then is that the very tiny vessels loose the ability to feed all of the cells of the body lending to the deterioration of the cells.  Causes can be a hardening of the vessels which can be a plaque build up on the inside of the vessels.  The end result of poor circulation is that affected area will die or need to be amputated.  There are very few medications to help.  One that comes to mind is Trental (Pentoxptyline).  Diseases like Diabetes does cause atherosclerosis- poor circulation.  Smoking also is very debilitating to the blood vessels as nicotine is a vasoconstrictor.  There is very little you can do for poor circulation.  Be very mindful of wounds in the affected areas as they may not heal and the attention of the docotor will be needed.
it will affect you sooner than you think.you need 8 hours of sllep to function for 16 hours of waking hours.mentally you'll be drained, can't think right, like a walking zombie.
I agree, 2 to 3 months would be accurate. You can ask your dr. The age in weeks is generally written on the ultrasound picture in one of the corners.

i agree with most other comments, she still is young and her body may change a lot (and for the batter) as she grows, however, i think you shold try to get her a little more active, like taking a walk, swimming, bike riding, or getting her to tr out for a sport, that way she can get some more exercise, possibly lose some wight, but still not put her at riskfor still being young.  also, try checking her diet, a little junkfood averyday can go a long way, so maybe try taking her out to healthier places for lunch or dinner, and make it a treat for both of you so you can both, (her especially) enjoy a healtier lifestyle.\n\nhope that offers some help!!!
I have it too, but it only shows when I have a tan.  I saw a negro once with it.  They looked like a pinto person.  I have read that it is linked with an underactive thyroid.  If you have symptoms of slow thyroid, you need to have it checked.
you could try airbourne I hear it works wonders

It depends on your sex, height, and weight.  Also whether you want to maintain, lose, or gain weight.  A good calculator is http://www.caloriesperhour.com the RMR and MBR calculators.
generally, if a primary tooth exfoliates on its own (falls out) you will not see a root. the adult tooth pushes on the baby root, resorbing it, therefore allowing it to fall out. if a baby tooth is extracted, for whatever reason, you will often times be able to see the root (if it has not already been resorbed)\n\nso to answer your question: primary teeth have roots, but when it falls out, the root will no longer be there
it's not really something you should be doing while in school.  worry about your grades boys will come and go.

Pilates is fantastic. You don't have to use weights and it tones your whole body. There's plenty of classes and great home DVDs available. Just check out amazon.com. Of course, if you don't burn off the fat tissue with some form of cardio your arms won't really look any different; kind of like all those people who do hundreds of crunches but still have a fat belly. Their abs are great, but hidden under all the fat.
id grab you, rip your clothes off and have my way with you!\nthats what you'd like me to do isnt it ; )
go to the doctor don't mess round with it
oh yeah . I use it all the time . its so good for you
Jogging is one of the best things you can do to lose weight. If you are doing it along with healthy eating then you will do fine. Just make sure you eat enough, because you'll need plenty of energy to jog. Porridge for breakfast is perfect as it fills you up til lunch and provides good energy for running. Eat plenty of bananas too. Just don't skip meals as this will not help you lose weight at all. i would start off going out for 15 mins at a time, see how you feel and then the next week, increase it by 5-10 mins. You will get fitter and fitter. Just start off steady.
I think it varies from state to state.

"tight briefs i think would be worse than none. personaly i like to go the gladiator route. I wear none any chance i get\ncause it is just more comfortable to me. so, freeball as you will. it wont hurt a thing. as long as you don't catch your ""thing"" in your zipper-ouch!!"
I started a fitness plan a few weeks ago. I get bored doing the same thing all the time so I mix it up. I rotate between exercising with an exercise ball, which is great for toning and balance. Then, I do Pilate's which burns fat and tones your core while strengthening other areas. On the third day, I do yoga which improves balance and flexibility while reducing stress. I also substituted water for soda (tons of calories in soda) and reach for fresh fruit and vegetables instead of chips. So far, I have lost 9 lbs. and my clothes are starting to fit better. Sometimes, I can't resist some chips or soda but that's ok. Totally depriving yourself of what you like sets you up to give up your plans. Good luck on reaching your goals! You can do it!
Talk to your dentist to see if they have any kind of payment plan, there is a dental credit card out there called care credit that you can apply through your dentist.

The safety of coronary artery bypass graft surgery is based on a number of things, including:\n1. Patient's age\n2. Patient's overall condition\n3. Concommitent illnesses (ie: diabetes mellitus, h/o stroke)\n4. Number of bypasses that need to be performed\n5. Any other procedures that need to be performed at the same time (ie: replace or repair a heart valve)\n6. Kidney function\n7. Experience of the surgeon\n\nThe surgeon that is performing the procedure can give an individualized risk assessment based on these and many other factors.

Im guessing it's more of an anxiety attack. Panic attacks are part of a disorder and theres a bunch of stuff you need to do to avoid them. Anxiety attacks can be calmed by taking deep breathes and walking just normal relaxing techniques.
Well, you won't die. You will have horrific vitamin deficiencies. You will probably go into ketoacidosis which will eat up your muscle and damage your kidneys. Then of course your metabolism will be shot to hell for good. You will also have to be eased back onto food after, it will be hard to keep anything down. Ever see the videos from when the concentration camps were discovered? You'll look like that.
Its not unusual. One is usually lower than the other too.\n\nThere is also room for measurement error because one kidney may be lying at a slight angle relative to the other, thus foreshortening its appearance in a two-dimensional medium like ultrasound.

An unhealthy substance, also known as trans fatty acid, made through the chemical process of hydrogenation of oils. Hydrogenation solidifies liquid oils and increases the shelf life and the flavor stability of oils and foods that contain them. Trans fat is found in vegetable shortenings and in some margarines, crackers, cookies, snack foods and other foods.
The amount of time any drug can be detected in one's system can vary from person to person and test to test. It certainly can also depend on the amount of the drug taken and when it was taken relative to the time of the test. Keeping in mind that there is no 100% hard and fast rule for how long a drug will be in one's system, Cocaine can stay in your system for approximately 5 days\n\nYour whole drug history is stored in your hair until it is cut. Some types of shampoo and bleaching of hair may remove drugs from the hair.
Ask her about her activities over the 2 or 3 days before, and the day of the shin pains. I went through this with one of my children when she was in elementary school. It took about three months, but I finally spotted a pattern. The school rotated the playground activities on the lunch and recess breaks every week and about once a month the area my daughter played in for a week included the monkey bars. They were her favorite part of the playground equipment and she climbed them constantly during the time allowed. To check my theory that this was the cause, I forbid her to climb them the following month and she didn't develop the shin pains. After that she was more careful not to over extend herself on them (so that I wouldn't take away the privilege again), and all was well. We had the same problem when she got her first bicycle, until her legs got stronger.
Congrats on changing your lifestyle.\n\nLong runs  10K and longer can be very taxing on the body.  You should start to hydrate with lots of water 7-10 days before the run.  Watch your salt intake.  Increase your protein intake slightly for a day or so before the race.\n\nOn race day, don't starve.  Eat complex carbs, a banana, stay away from fats.\n\nMost of the time drinks like Gatorade contain too many salts depending on the race conditions.  Mix it 1/2 and 1/2 with water during the race and have fun.

You have several choices.  You can drink a can of coke at room temperature as fast as you can.  You can drink a glass of salt and water as warm as you can stand it. Or you can do as others have said stick your finger down the back of your throat and you will start to gag and throw up.  You can do that several times until you feel better.

"Yes they have.  Most of the time: ""I was date raped"" really means: ""I was a hooker last night and I regret what I did"".\n\nI think it's ironic that when guys get drunk and have sex with some cow their buddies make fun of them.  But when girls get drunk and have sex with some ugly guy they can whine about how they were ""raped"" and get sympathy from their friends.  Who then eat icecream with them and cry about how horrible it was later on."
Get right with yourself and your loved ones. Don't worry about hell, hell is for unempathetic jerks who use their god as a weapon, who act like they are concerned for your soul and can't begin to understand what it means to be human. Don't give up hope, life has a way of surprising you and definitely get other medical opinions. My sister was diagonosed with cancer over 4 years ago and she is in total remission. Good luck and don't let the disease become who you are, everyone should live life no matter how long.
I had the same problem (now solved). I got the advice from an allergy advice website. Ban the cat from the place your bf sleeps (even when he's not there). Vacuum floors/carpets every day when your boyfriend is out and open all the windows for at least 20 minutes afterwards. Also vacuum sofas and cushions and the cat's bed every day. Now for the mad-sounding bit - wash the cat! Every day, gently pour a jug of warm water over the cat as he/she sits in the bath/sink, then run your hands over the cat to squeeze out the excess. When dry, groom the cat for 10 minutes. Do this daily for one week, then once weekly after that. It sounds a lot of work but it all takes around half an hour a day. It definitely worked for me and my bf. Good luck!
Just like there are no drugs nor ways to enlarge a penis, there are no drugs nor means to shrink breasts.  If you really want to have your breasts smaller, then what you need to do is to go to a doctor who will let you know what proceedures are available to you - for men do have their breasts made smaller.\n\nDon't try taking any pills or medications which are not prescribed by a doctor for you can run into problems.\n\nGood Luck!
Take some deep breaths...take a warm bath...have sex...or all of the above!
Well, the only side effects are wasting your moneya nd your penis doesn't get any bigger.  Other then that knock yourself out.

Sounds like endometriosis to me. Endometriosis is where the lining of the uterus gets stuck outside. it can lead to continued bleeding and other problems, so you need to talk to your doctor as soon as you possibly can. Even if you have no insurance, the hospital emergency room cannot refuse to see you and must do all they can to help. Head to the e.r and let them take care of you!!
Yes to your 2nd question.

rub gold on it. If it doesn't go away, see a doctor who will prescribe something that will contain gold, but may be a little stronger. But try a ring or something first to save expense, the higher the carat the better
"1. Fat burning pills\nMost of them contain random herbs, caffeine, and green tea. With the exception of ephedra, common side effects would be jitters (from caffeine), alertness / insomnia, decreased appetite, and possible increased heart rate. With ephedra-based, every one of those side effects would be enhanced. I take them not for weight loss but to stay awake in the morning. Studies are mixed as to whether they actually promote weight loss. I would be cautious about exercising while taking any pill containing ephedra, especially high intensity. \n\n2. Protein\nHow ""intense"" are your weight workouts? Are you getting enough protein in your diet? 1.6g of protein per kg of bodyweight is enough, so unless you're not eating right or are training intensely I wouldn't worry about protein powder. Whey is a fast acting protein and is typically taken directly after a workout to get protein to muscle quickly. Cassein (sp) is a slower protein that would be taken during the day. I wouldn't buy soy protein unless it's already part of your diet. Protein powders can be used by anyone. Women should only avoid the hormones and prohormones on the market.\n\n3. Creatine\nCreatine won't hurt you, but unless you care about larger muscles / increased strength it's not important. Most people (that are not vegans) get enough creatine through diet ie. meat. Beware that some people are non-responders, which means consuming creatine has no effect as their muscles have enough of it. Responders see an increase in muscle size and in some cases muscle strength. There are hundreds of studies of creatine and results vary.\n\nJohn"

If you have to ask this question, she isn't.
Hi, here's an answer to your question:\n\nhttp://www.helpguide.org/life/snoring.htm\n\nEnjoy!
It means it's time to see your doctor.
"First Dramatic and Impulsive are 2 totally different things. Being dramatic to a situation usually means you are wanting attention, good or bad by taking the situation to the extreme.  Impulsive is to react without thinking, that can be to yell and get angry over ""nothing"" or to blow your entire paycheck on a pair of shoes when rents due.  To answer your question they are part of character, and can be altered.  But any behavior you don't like can be changed.  Just like your boyfriend pointed out, you can think before you react, that goes a long way.  You should do that even if you don't think your a drama queen and/or impulsive.\n\nMore importantly you are not making these changes because HE wants you to.  You have to make the change for yourself.  Otherwise it really doesn't do any good.  You'll revert back to your ""old ways"" once he's no longer with you.  If this is something you've found to be a problem then make the change, fact is no one like a drama queen only in small doses, and there are good and bad sides to being impulsive.  I'd like to see you keep a part of each and use in moderation when the time is right.\n\nGood luck!"
For men, it's absolutely necessary, at least once, or twice a month. Some sperm issue. Scientifically, masturbati-n is not detrimental in anyway, unless overdone. For girls, I guess it's fine for health too.
loosen it or lose it?\n\nregular exercise, keep active (mental and physical), don't eat unhealthy foods, etc\n\nit isn't difficult.......
Do you mean taking these actually reduces the symtoms, not increase them. I have heard good things about soy for this.
The selection of an antibiotic to treat an STD will depend on several factors. These factors include the actual bacteria causing the infection, allergies you have to various antibiotics, the severity of the infection and any resistance to antibiotics that you may have because of past treatment.\n\nFor instance, in the treatment uncomplicated chlamydial infections, doxycycline 100mg orally twice a day for 7 days or azithromycin 1,000mg orally one time is the treatment of choice. For patients who can not take these medications, or in cases where complications are apparent, oral antibiotics including erythromycin, ofloxacin, amoxicillin, and sulfisoxazole may be used. Another alternative is ceftriaxone, which is given by injection into a muscle as a one time dose.\n\nSome of the common STDs and the organisms that cause them:\n         Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)\n         Chancroid\n         Chlamydia\n         Genital Herpes/HSV\n         Genital Warts/HPV\n         Gonorrhea\n         Syphilis\n         Viral Hepatitis\n  \nListed below is a website from the Center for Disease Control with more information on the various types of STDs.

"the best place to work depends on what you are interested in and what specific field of psychology/psychiatry you want to work. there are endless places: hospitals, rehabs, private clinics, schools, various businesses, with the govt., as a professor, researcher, with adults only, with children, families, couples, etc. \n\nYou better REALLY want to do it, or you won't make it through school. Usually about 10 years all together and that is without experience. 4 years for bachelor degree, typically unless it takes you longer. then can go to grad school for masters, 2 years at least or go straight for doctorate, another 4-5 years depending on the curriculum. If you don't want a doctorate, you can stop at a masters but you are limited to where you can work and what you can do. So, get ""psyched"" up for it! \n\nthe best program would probably be in california, chicago, or NY. depends on where you are willing to go and how much you are willing to pay. professional colleges/univ. are more expensive. keep in mind, that you do NOT have to go to any of those mentioned for one of the best educations. There are many places in the US to get just as good an education. The APA organiztion (American Psychological Association) lists colleges/univ. that are accredited; you need to go to one of those or your education won't matter. unless, you want the more counseling side of it, then it can be accredited by the ACA (American Counseling Association) and they have a list of schools on their website too! the school NEEDS to be accredited! \n\nAs for different salaries, they are paid very well and if you get in a private clinic...sometimes they make their own  salary. But go to <allpsychologyschools.com> for more specific salaries. And the apa.org can help you there too."

If you can find a dentist with a small local practice, talk to him in person and see if he'll let you set up a payment plan to pay what you can when you can.

"Please Listen......\n\nI am a Psychology major and depressed.  I take Zoloft.  Academically all scientists know that depression stems from a serotonin loss.  It is biological.  My Professor in Anatomy said if she hadn't taken an anti-depressant, she would be dead.  Both her brothers killed themselves.  Yes, it may be genetic, not always.  The brothers didn't buy into the ""taking pills"" theory.  Meanwhile, she took the recommended dosage and went on to get her PH.D.\n\nI take 100 mg. of Zoloft every day .

"Studies of human sleep have established five well-defined stages, according to electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings and polysomnography:\n\n    * Non-REM sleep (NREM), accounts for 75-80% of total sleep time:\n          o Stage 1, with near-disappearance of the alpha waves seen in awake states, and appearance for the first time of theta waves. The stage is sometimes referred to as somnolence, or ""drowsy sleep"". It appears at sleep onset (as it is mostly a transition state into Stage 2), and can be associated with so-called hypnagogic hallucinations. In this period, the subject loses some muscle tone, and conscious awareness of the external environment: Stage 1 can be thought of as a gateway state between wake and sleep.\n          o Stage 2, with ""sleep spindles"" (12–16 Hz) and ""K-complexes"". The EMG lowers, and conscious awareness of the external environment all but disappears. This occupies 45-55% of total sleep.\n          o Stage 3, with delta waves, also called delta rhythms (1–2 Hz), is considered part of slow-wave sleep (SWS) and functions primarily as a transition into stage four. Overall it occupies 3-8% of total sleep time.\n          o Stage 4 is true delta sleep. It predominates the first third of the night and accounts for 10-15% of total sleep time. This is often described as the deepest stage of sleep; it is exceedingly difficult to wake a subject in this state. This is the stage in which night terrors and sleepwalking occur.\n\n    * Stage 5, or Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, associated with dreaming, especially bizarre, visual, and seemingly random dreams. REM sleep is predominant in the final third of a sleep period, its timing linked to circadian rhythm and body temperature. The EEG in this period is aroused and looks similar to stage 1, and sometimes includes beta waves.\n\nSleep proceeds in cycles of NREM and REM phases. In humans, the cycle of REM and NREM is approximately 90 minutes. Each stage may have a distinct physiological function. Drugs such as alcohol and sleeping pills can suppress certain stages of sleep (see sleep deprivation below). This can result in a sleep that exhibits loss of consciousness but does not fulfill its physiological functions.\n\nEach sleep stage is not necessarily uniform. Within a given stage, a cyclical alternating pattern may be observed."
Don't let your height be a barricade in your way of life. I am very short man, 5 feet 4 inches, but I am the most popular person here in this city (where I am working at in China) I am the most respectable, most wanted and a celebrity in the eyes of my colleagues, superiors, friends and students. And I am richer then many others :) so what did my height had to do with it? Forget it. Height is nothing, money and fame is everything. I see lots of tall people but they are failure. Look around yourself and develop your skills, get richer ok
i love you

The best thing to do is to go to his house and tell him. do it face to face. You should have told him before you got it done to give him the chance to adapt before seeing you that way. However this is not an option now. If you put it off things will just get worse with time.

"Unfortunately there is not a way to get rid of mouth ulcers very quickly.  They hurt no doubt.  Swishing with warm salt water several times a day will help with the soreness.  Don't eat anything acidic or spicy. Stay with bland foods for several days.  You can even put a wet tea bag on it for several minutes, this will sooth it.  I would not use Listerine, as it contains a high amount of alcohol and will only sting your mouth like crazy. You can take some Tylenol or Advil to help ease some of the discomfort.  The research is still out as to what causes ""canker sores"" which is different then cold sores.  It is a given that people seem to get them in higher times of stress, or when you have been eating really spicy foods.  Just be gentle in your home care, and it should resolve in about eight days.  If not ask your dentist/hygienist if there is anything else you can do."

A big part of confidence is in the way you carry yourself.  Stand up straight.  Think of a straight line going up your legs and spine straight to the top of your head and align your stance to it.  Smile when you see people, and look them in the eye (briefly, don't stare).  Think of yourself as the confident person you want to be, and imagine the positive reactions of those around you.  Make a practice of this regularly.  You may not only find this enjoyable, but there is scientific evidence it actually works to boost confidence in people who practice it regularly.  Good luck!

There is a possibility that you:\n\n1) Are anemic\n2) Have poor circulation\n3) Have Reynaud's Syndrome\n\nIf you have anemia, people may say you have tired blood. That's because anemia — a condition in which there aren't enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to your tissues — can make you feel tired.\n\n\nVarious disorders can lead to poor circulation either generally or in particular areas of circulation. Poor circulation may lead to blueness (cyanosis), pallor, and other symptoms. Poor circulation can also reduce healing effectiveness in affected areas leading to poor healing. Any needs prompt professional medical advice. Blueness can indicate cyanosis such as from lack of circulation and can be very serious. This can arise due to various severe illnesses that inhibit circulation or oxygen takeup. Localized cyanosis can also occur in areas of poor circulation such as the hands and fingers in Raynaud's phenomenon. Cyanosis may also be described as purple skin or dark skin in some cases. Any form of cyanosis, circulation symptom or circulatory disorder needs medical investigation.\n\n\nReynaud's Syndrome is a condition in which the smallest arteries that bring blood to the fingers or toes constrict (go into spasm) when exposed to cold or from an emotional upset. The small veins are usually open, so the blood drains out of the capillaries. The result is that the fingers or toes become pale, cold and numb. If there's a spasm in the small veins and blood is trapped in the capillaries, the fingers or toes turn blue as the blood loses its oxygen.
"Prostaglandins are produced as a part of having your period.  \n\n""Release of prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators in the uterus (womb) is thought to be a factor in primary dysmenorrhea (aka cramping)."" \n\nThese chemical have many functions in the body including all of the symptoms you typically have prior to and during your cycle. \n\nIbuprofen and Naproxen inhibit prostagladins and therefore are effective at reducing discomfort.  The key is to take the medication BEFORE you are having cramps as they are INHIBITORS.  If you are already having the symptoms, it is impossible to inhibit them.  Good luck."

I asked this same question.  My physical education professor at UNCW told me that you are born with a specific number of fat cells and they grow and shrink (as someone has mentioned on here).  You can ALSO obtain MORE fat cells, depending on your fluctuating weight gains.  Building lean muscle (think: dancer's body) helps to fight that fat cell growth.  Hope this helped  :)

"I recently watched a special on The History Channel or Discovery Channel. The Origin of Aids.\n\nBasically, there were two big scientist in the 1940s-50s working on a vaccine for Polio. One scientist used the right primate and the other used one that he knew had a strain of a similar virus to HIV.  The ""bad"" scientist was working on an oral polio and he tried it on a group in Africa because they had little health care.  The other scientist used injectable polio vaccine.  In the 1970's it was discovered.  The highest concentration was in Africa.  As you might know, practically the entire continent is infected.  All it takes is a few people.  They probably realized it in Homo-sexual males first because it's easier to transmit HIV through micro tears of the anus when anal sex is perfomed.\n\nSo, to eliminate one devistating disease, science risked for another.  Polio was more devistating than HIV/AIDS is now.  The real pissy thing is; the bad scientist didn't have to use chimps or oral polio, he could have used the high monkey and injectable.\n\nNotice why they don't use oral polio for pediatric vaccinations any more."

hello sk8er!\nyeah im a dentist.\nlet me tel U i was dead scared of dentists when i was small!\nn i was blessed with teeth that needed a lot of dental treatment.ive got 5 teeth Root Canal Treated,my 4 wisdom teeth had to be extracted cos they were growing slant in my jaw bone.no it wasnt funny then but i can laugh about it now.\nthe thing is i know my patients hate me cos they associate me with pain.. im trying to do my job n do it well i need my patient to co operate. it helps if U relax cos the facial muscles arent strained n its easier for me to work.\nplus the machinery we use makes this Gawd awful sound which no one appreciates-initially not me.\nwe leave u with a horrible taste in your mouth,inject u in places of your mouth u never knew existed n u cant even see what we are doing!\nso its no wonder people hate us.jokes arent taken well by most patients so we cant act funny.\nmost dentists involuntarily stare at peoples teeth even if they know them as friends-especially if they got a problem that needs to be fixed. tell your friend that it makes u kind of uneasy when she stares at your teeth.. she should take the hint.\ntry visiting the same dentist as far as possible. could help u relax. carry a good book along. eat well before u have an appointment.\nthere are medications that can be prescribed by your dentist to calm u down(anti anxiety drugs)\ntake care n keep smiling... being a dentist is a tough job but someones got to do it!

in deep sleep nothing your muscles are relaxed,in rem sleep they become paralyzed unless you have a disorder that damged that mechanism in your brain then you would sleep walk or eat during them rem cycle or act out your dream,without being conscious of your actions ,sleep occurs in cycles and stages and it the rem stage is short but gets a little longer which each progressive cycle, i think this is the phase where the body repairs itself but I am still reading up on it so dont take my word for it
Energy can also be related to how you feel about life and what people, things, stuff may be draining your energy.  Are you happy with your life, do you do something totally just for you each day???  How do you bring joy into your life.  If you do all of the above and still have lack of energy then meds is the beginning, exercise and the food you eat are the next steps.  Good luck and feel better.  Life is to short to be not feeling 100%.  Way to go to find the answers.

"The answer is in your question: foolish. \nI didn't start because my friends pushed it on me...they didn't (hey, more for them, I guess they were thinking), so I really don't know why I did. I bet a lot of people couldn't tell you why, but I can guarantee no-one is glad they did. In four months it will be 20 years that I've smoked. I WILL quit before then....I will never say ""I've smoked for over twenty years!"" YUCK! BTW, I do agree that it's horrible and it's killing people, but it's really not necessary that non-smokers insult smokers like they do. I am not gross...I'm not like that ""Maxine"" lady with a cig hanging out of my mouth with a ash a mile long. I'm a very intelligent person, a friend to anyone in need and I love my family very much....I just made a mistake.\nBTW, part of this answer was for any smoker haters that might be reading :o)"

"Well let's see.... raising melons can be a difficult and rewarding job. the standard size of a canteloupe with the proper care could be the size of a NBA regulation basketball that is if you really care for your melon. You see the canteloupe is one of the shyest melons because it has a lot to live up to being the one of the more common ones. I have found that if you spend several hours telling the melon that it is big enough and strong enoung and gosh darn it people like it, it does rather well. Now musk and honeydew are a little trickier. The tactic that has yielded the largest size in these varieties for me has been to play them against each other. I plant little seeds of jealousy like telling the honeydew that ""You know why Aunt Betty always used musk melon in her 4th of July salads dont you? Its because it was bigger than you honey, its not that it tastes better its just that you havent given it your all."" With the musk usually a comment about its name works, something like, ""Come on lets get real, just listen to your name, musk. If you had to choose between a melon named musk or honey which one would you choose?.....honey of course. I conotates a more delicious experience in every way. The only way you'll ever get picked is if you dazzle them with your size so get busy and get big"" Using this stratagey has yielded melons the size of a bowling ball. Who else loves to watch pro-bowling isnt it amazing to watch? Theres just something about those people gently scooping up those shining beauties wiping them down with the same wrag that they use on thier own sweat as the precurser to the big show, that shiny spinning beautiful warrior gracefully on its journey to meet its battle with the 10 evil white advancing monguls. Before you know it *BLAM-O* the battle is over and we see just how well our little warrior did. Ahhh, oops... I guess I got a little off track, sorry. Anyways,... as far as the sweating part it all depends on where your melon farm is located. I have had many farms in many locales. Raising melons in the heat of the Saharah can make one lose a little moisture on the brow but nothing like the Venus Vines farm I had in the 70's, I can remember bursting into flames on a few occasions. MMMM MMMM MMMM MMM MMM Toasty! Those are all problems that I solved with gallons of gatoraid mixed with pickle juice and a hat with a little teany tiny fan that I bought off and info-mercial for 5 easy payments of $19.95. Plus working in the nude helps from time to time, just remember to where your sun screen. Hope this helped. J"

Kidney stones (renal calculi or nephrolithiasis) are pieces of minerals found in the kidneys. They may stay in the kidney or travel out of the body through the urinary tract—the tubes that connect the kidney to the bladder (ureters) and lead outside the body (urethra). When traveling through the urinary tract, a stone may cause no pain or cause great pain and other symptoms. Kidney stones usually do not cause any long-term damage to the urinary tract.

You need to see a doctor as this can be more than just heartburn.  You sure didn't give much information either (age, any other pain, any relief from antacids, etc).  I suggest you go to the E.R. now and get checked over to be on the safe side.
That's interesting that you say that. I know a lot of people have said that's not normal, but I have had a similar experience.\nI am currently recovering from a period of serious depression, and I'm on anti-depressants.\nI have noticed that my memory is significantly poorer than it used to be, I really struggle to remember names  or how to drive to places I've been to a couple of times before.\nMy spelling has been really affected (I mix up the spelling of a lot of words now, where I never did before)\nHowever, I have not noticed that my speech is getting slurred. That does worry me, and you should definitely see your doctor about that.\nI went to my doctor to ask about my memory loss and concentration loss. She said that she didn't think that it was a result of the medication, and the only way to determine if it was would be to stop taking the medication, and she doesn't think that's a good idea right now.\nSo she thinks it must be side effects of the depression, but has no idea how long it will take me to get to normal, or if I will.\nObviously that really worries me!\nI wanted to let you know that you are not alone, but unfortunately I have no answers!!
That would depend on how large filling is going to be.  If they were all simple class V fillings then it could be done in 30 minutes or so.  If they were all more complex fillings involving 4 sufaces... it could take 2 1/2 hours or so.  Generally the dentist will prep all the teeth and then fill all of the teeth.

"The earliest public toilets were set up in Knossos of the Minoan civilization in the Crete island, now part of Greece. However, the earliest pay toilets were erected in Ancient Rome in 74 AD during the rule of Vespasian, after a civil war in Rome affected greatly the Roman finance. His initiative was derided by his adversaries, but his reply to these objections is now famous: ""Pecunia non olet"" (""Money does not smell"")."
Being active, especially running and jogging will be burning a lot of calories and in turn making you more hungry.

"""High blood pressure (hypertension) is a common condition. Untreated, high blood pressure will cause the heart to eventually overwork itself to the point where serious damage can occur. For instance, the heart muscle can thicken (hypertrophy) and function abnormally, or dilate and contract less forcefully (dilated cardiomyopathy). High blood pressure can cause injury to the brain, the eyes (retinopathy) and/or the kidneys (nephropathy). High blood pressure is present in about half of people having first–time heart attacks and two thirds of people having first–time strokes. Most cases of high blood pressure have no cure, but the overwhelming majority can be managed and controlled with diet and medication. "" excerts from heart center On-line.com"
If you get a prescription from your doctor, it's around $35. On the net it's more like $80. If you really need to lose weight a doctor will have no problem prescribing it for you.

Is 10lbs. a number you need to have?  You can safely lose 1-2lbs of body FAT per week by reducing your calories or increasing your activity.  That gets you about 8lbs.  If you need just the number of lbs., I was a wrestler and have been able to drop 5lbs of water weight during a couple of hours.

I have one simple suggestion that i have my clients do when they feel guilty about something they had NO CONTROL OVER!\nWrite a letter to the driver of the truck, Use any type of language that you want to.  Cuss, swear, whatever Then place the letter in an envelope seal it then throw IT away!!!! Then sit down write a nice letter to your mom telling her how you feel about what happened. Place it in an envelope, and then put it away. You will feel  a lot better!! The guilt will not be completely gone, But you will be on the right track. Then get some counseling..... Good Luck.
no, but will make your hair fall out :)
Remember next time you come in out of the sun do this Take a wet clothe and put vinegar on it. Wipe face good it will stink, but it will take the heat out of the burn. It works good. Now since you've already peeled I would get some regular burn cream and apply to face, but not in your eyes. So, sorry I bet it is painful. Good luck
Try midol because it has a diuretic and drink extra water around that time of the month.  The more water you drink, the more your body flushes out and try (though I never can) to stay away from salty foods around this time!  good luck from one bloated gal to another!
A panic attack is a sudden surge of overwhelming fear that comes without warning and without any obvious reason. It is far more intense than the feeling of being 'stressed out' that most people experience. Symptoms of a panic attack include:\n\n    * racing heartbeat\n    * difficulty breathing, feeling as though you 'can't get enough air'\n    * terror that is almost paralyzing\n    * dizziness, lightheadedness or nausea\n    * trembling, sweating, shaking\n    * choking, chest pains\n    * hot flashes, or sudden chills\n    * tingling in fingers or toes ('pins and needles')\n    * fear that you're going to go crazy or are about to die \n\nIn addition to the above symptoms, a panic attack is marked by the following conditions:\n\n    * it occurs suddenly, without any warning and without any way to stop it.\n    * the level of fear is way out of proportion to the actual situation; often, in fact, it's completely unrelated.\n    * it passes in a few minutes; the body cannot sustain the 'fight or flight' response for longer than that. However, repeated attacks can continue to recur for hours.
"In the ""Alternative Health"" circles, most will agree that the standard TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) test doesn't cut the mustard! Its the one that most docs do.  It can come back as a normal reading, but in fact the thyroid can be low.  I have run into the same situation myself.  Tests say normal, but I have all the symptoms of hypothyroid.  I'd do some research on the net.  Too much info to put it all here.\n\nYou could check out this link for starters:\n\nhttp://www.wilsonssyndrome.com/\n\nThere are also some links there to get you going.  Good luck!"

It is not necessary of gallstone, but the infection of the gallbladder. You should go on a 3 day absolute liquid diet. Do not have anything to eat you have to detoxify your system. You should drink lot of aloevera juice, natural and stabilized, and take for a month probiotic tablets. That will clean your whole system.If you don't know where to get it, write to angie45hu@yahoo.com I am not sure if not appendix, or ulcer. Ask your Dr. to send you for a stomach xray.
As many years I have been getting a pap smear all my doctors will we can only give a pap smear before are after your menstral because if we give you one during the test will more and likely not be read right because of the blood.
I would have to say that it depends on your clit. There are those that can take the roughness of it, and there are those that are pretty delicate. I knew a girl once who thought that having her clit done would highten her orgasm when she fucked, but ended up taking it out because it pulled on her skin to roughly. it depends........And if you're thinking about getting one, i would take into consideration that the safest way to keep it when you first get it, is to take a shower after everytime that you pee. Everytime you pee, the grossness in your urine gets in the peircing, which raises your risk for infection. And think, who wants to see a fucked up puss-infested clit? Gross huh?
yes, taking too much of the fat soluble vitamins: A, D, E, and K can harm your body.  Most of the water soluble vitamins will be taken out of your body by your kidneys.  This does not mean that they cannot harm you, only that it takes a large amount of these vitamins to do so.\n\nZinc (like most metals) can give you an upset stomach, nausea and vomiting.\n\nTolerance to vitamins? Not the way you are thinking, but your body can begin to manufacture/convert less of the vitamins it normally does by being overloaded with an abundance of them.

"It can be nice at times.  But other times it can be a real pain in the but*.  Women have always had to fight or connive or be better than a man to get recognized for being herself.  Some of the time you have to deal with macho men who think they are god's gift to women, and there is no way a woman doesn't want them.  I think women feel things differently then men...it's hard to explain, but being a woman is not always a picnic.  I suppose it's the same for a man too.  There's an old saying that goes ""The grass is always greener on the other side.""  Well it is, until you get there."

There are hundreds of different types of rashes, and even more possibly causes. It could be a symptom of something else, or it could be a disease all its own. Could be an allergy, could be a fungal or yeast infection, could be idiopathic (no known cause). Without a description of what the rash looks like, no one can tell you what it is. See a doctor.\n\nI assume you mean the drug cetirizine, which is the antihistamine commonly known as Zyrtec. Many people, myself included, use antihistamines daily on a long term basis, without any ill effect.
This is hard question to answer because there are so many variables to your mother's action. Like her age, is she possibly going through menopause. Or if she is older these might be the early signs or Alzheimer's. If it's menopause there isn't much you can do to help her, or yourself just steer cleer when she is having a mood swing. If you think it might be something else it's best to get her tested before it progress into something more serious.

I am familiar with these questions as I too have had the same 'dilemma'.  Here is what I was told by my dentist and representatives from several (I shopped around) tooth whitening companies:\n\n1) A residual glue that you cannot see nor can dentists/orthodontists remove by simple polishing of the teeth after the braces are removed can remain on the surface of the teeth for up to four weeks after the braces are removed.  If whitening is attempted before all of the glue comes off naturally, the potential for 'spots' or streaking on the teeth from uneven whitening increases.  Therefore, I would suggest a minimum of three to four weeks before I would use any type of strong whitening outside of toothpaste.\n\n2) Despite all of the RELATIVELY expensive tooth whitening toothpastes on the market, you can use a simple home remedy of baking soda on your toothbrush after regular brushing.  This works as good, if not better than a toothpaste, and is cheaper.  It does not taste great though.  The problem with the 'painted on' whiteners is that they do not last very long, and over the long haul, they will cost A LOT to maintain.  The alternatives to bright white from Target or Wal-mart are effective, but do not last nearly as long as those that you can buy from your dentist (Brite White and Zoom).  While these are significantly more expensive than store brands, they will last one to two years without outside maintenance, and they are more effective.  You could also do an in-office whitening which speeds up the whitening process (1 afternoon vs. 2 to 3 weeks with Bright White), and costs roughly the same.\n\nToothpastes merely remove surface stains like coffee/smoke/food from chronic build-up over the years, and only work to 'whiten' them close to back to where they were before, but Zoom or BriteWhite will whiten them well beyond what you can get from a toothpaste or naturally.

"This is the only real way to instantly cure the hiccups! Look no further! The Hughes/Green method cure's the hiccups EVERY time GUARANTEED! You will be amazed! Hundreds of instantly cured hiccuper's have sent in their testimony's of deliverance! Files are available for researchers! Carefully understand both the HOW and the WHY of this method. If you don't get the WHY you might not get the HOW. Here's how to cure the hiccups:\n\n""Hughes/Green Hiccups Cure""© 1997\n\n(1) Pour a TALL glass of water.\n\n(2) Hold your breath... ***\n\n(3) IMPORTANT...PINCH YOUR NOSE CLOSED.\n\n(4) Slowly, take 10 - 20 swallows of the water...while holding your breath with your nose pinched closed.\n\n(5) When you can't stand it any more....you'll know by that overwhelming drowning sensation -- after a gasp, take a deep breath and relax.\n\nThis cures the hiccups 99 percent of the time - guaranteed! It's a proven medical remedy! (A second treatment could be necessary for stubborn cases.)\n\n*** For stubborn cases, try EXHALING COMPLETELY and then taking 10 - 20 swallows.\n\nNOW: HERE'S WHY IT WORKS: Hiccups are caused by an uncontrollable spasm in the diaphragm, (the ""breathing"" muscle). Often, this spasm is triggered by irritable conditions in the smooth muscles of the stomach or the esophagus. The ""Hughes/Green Hiccups Cure"" forces an increase in the carbon dioxide levels in the diaphragm itself, as well as in the stomach and esophagus. By swallowing, you are making the muscles work -- so they use up their available oxygen and replace it with carbon dioxide. By temporarily discontinuing to breath, you prohibit new oxygen from entering your body and thus create an anaerobic condition in the spasming diaphragm muscle. When the spasming diaphragm and stomach are deprived temporarily of oxygen and encounter the higher levels of carbon dioxide ... you feel that scary drowning sensation! BUT this causes the spasming muscles to relax! The hiccups go away! Essentially, you are ""tricking"" your body into thinking that it's drowning ... and it decides to use it's resources for something other than hiccuping. The rather ""scary"" drowning sensation caused by this method is NECESSARY for the method to work. If it's not just a little bit difficult ... it doesn't work."

not sure but maybe your talking about sleep paralysis: you kinda feel like you're awake but you can't move or that you might fall or you try to speak but you can't sorta like you're frozen awake---maybe that wiki thing has something -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis Sleep paralysis is a condition characterized by paralysis of the body shortly after waking up (known as hypnopompic paralysis) or, less often, shortly before falling asleep (known as hypnagogic paralysis). Physiologically, it is closely related to the normal paralysis that occurs during REM sleep, also known as REM atonia.\n\n \nThe Nightmare, by Henry Fuseli (1781) is thought to be one of the classic depictions of sleep paralysis perceived as a demonic visitation.Sleep paralysis occurs when the brain is awakened from an REM state into essentially a normal fully awake state, but the bodily paralysis is still occurring. This causes the person to be fully aware, but unable to move. In addition, this state is usually accompanied by certain specific kinds of hallucinations. This state usually lasts no more than two minutes before a person is able to either return to full REM sleep or to become fully awake,(more in the article but I didn't want the post to be too long.)

NAC is the same thing as a CNA or certified nursing assistant/aide. An NAR is a registered nurses aide, so basically a CNA also. They assist nurses by performing patient care such as bathing, taking vital signs, changing soiled linens etc. \n\nAn RN is a registered nurse. RN's have either a Bachelor of science in nursing degree or an associate degree in nursing and become licensed (Registered Nurse) when they pass the state licensure examniation, the NCLEX.\n\nAn LPN and RN are required to pass the NCLEX in order to practice. Their duties vary from state to state and in some instances they cannot perform the same tasks as an RN can.
I know you said free, but if you get a subscription to a fitness magazine or shape magazine, they offer lots of tips on workout plans and it helps keep you motivated. I think they are only like $15 a year, so it's a lot cheaper than joining the gym.  You could also try a workout video like Tae Bo or Yoga Booty Ballet or Turbo jam which would really help you tone and give you some variety.  I know these aren't free, but they are good resources.
Absolutely!  I am a relatively new vegan and also somewhat new to lifting weights.  I am active on two message boards that are specifically for vegan athletes, both with large numbers of people who are vegan bodybuilders, powerlifters, strongmen, or other forms of weightlifters.  Some eat huge amounts of calories and protein to bulk up, some don't worry so much about that.  But it is entirely possible to get a lot of calories and a lot of protein, and to gain muscle, on a vegan diet.\n\nLegumes, grains, tofu and other soy products, and seitan are some examples of good vegan protein sources.  Some vegans who are seriously trying to bulk will add smoothies with vegan protein powder to their diets, just like many bodybuilding omnis will have protein drinks.  And the important part, of course, is the actual training in the gym!

While some of the above answers have slight truths to them…these are the anatomic (real medical) reasons why this happens.  Everything you described happens because when you get an infection, our body naturally tries to fight it off.  \n\nWhen we get a fever our bodies try to kill the infection by turning up our internal temperature.  Bacteria and viruses cannot live at high temps and are killed by our fever.  This is when we feel hot.  \n\nOur bodies respond by shivering to raise the temperature. Shivering produces heat in the body. Once the temperature goes up, we start to feel warm. When the fever goes away, that is when we sweat\n\nYou get a runny nose, because your body decides to make extra mucus in order to “wash” away any bacteria that could get trapped in your sinuses.\n\nI hoped that helped...I tried to get to the point and not be so “wordy”

"If you had imaging studies (specifically ultrasound), and the cysts are truely simple cysts and had none of the nine malignant characteristics, that sounds right. We make cysts in all kinds of parts of our bodies (liver, kidney, breast, ovaries to name a few). Cysts are simply fluid filled sacs. They are not cancerous in almost ALL cases. The only time a doctor will remove a cyst is if it is causing you pain or if it doesn't look like a classical cyst on imaging. Cysts come and go. If you remove a cyst, you more than likely will grow more. Aspirating a cyst with a needle is an alternative, but in 50% of the time, the cyst will return. If you are not having pain, generally we leave cysts alone. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. \n\nI am unsure of the specifics of the woman, with breast cancer, who answered ahead of me.  I can tell you that simple breast cysts do not become cancer.  Someone who has breast cysts can develop breast cancer, but that is unrelated to the cysts.  Anyone can get breast cancer, and having breast cysts does not raise your risks.\n\nHere is some things from the ""experts"":\n\n""Benign breast disease is a large group of non-cancerous conditions of the breast that includes cysts, fibroadenomas, and hyperplasia. Of all the types of benign breast disease, only hyperplasia is related to breast cancer.""\n\nhttp://www.yourdiseaserisk.harvard.edu/hccpquiz.pl?func=show&quiz=breast&page=risk_list\n\n""Virtually all breast cysts identified as “simple cysts” by ultrasound are benign and remain so. It is estimated that perhaps 1 in 1,000 cysts may harbor a tumor (not necessarily malignant). These can usually be identified by their ultrasound appearance. Women with cysts are not at greater risk for the development of cancer although this risk may be minimally elevated if there is a positive family history for breast cancer (mother, sister, daughter).""\n\nhttp://www.cpmc.org/services/women/breast/breast_cyst.html"

Lose the weight for yourself not to just look good when you meet your father for the first time.  Start by changing your eating habits.  Then drink plenty of water and coffee and tea aren't one of them.  Then you should start and exercise program maybe even just walking 3 or 4 times a week. And if you really want to lose that weight limit the evening eating say no eating after 6 or 6:30pm  Good luck with your weight loss.
Psoriasis is a common skin disease, affecting approximately 2 percent to 4 percent of the U.S. population. Skin cells grow too quickly, causing lesions of red, raised patches that are covered with silvery scales. Complete recovery is rare. \n \n   \n  Steps:  \n1.   Reduce stress. Psoriasis is significantly aggravated by stress.  \n  \n2.   Apply topical ointments, twice each day, to slow down the overactive growth of skin cells. Ointments that contain tar preparations, anthralin and salicylic acid work well. Try corticosteroid creams. These are most effective when covered with a piece of saran wrap. It enhances the drug's penetration into the skin. Use it twice a day, wipe it off at bedtime, and then apply the tar preparation or anthralin at night.  \n  \n3.   Avoid injuring the skin. This aggravates psoriasis.  \n  \n4.   Avoid exposure to cold. This also aggravates psoriasis.  \n  \n5.   Keep your skin from drying out. Dry skin causes psoriasis to worsen.  \n  \n6.   Avoid washing your skin excessively. This makes skin feel sore and scaly. Use lukewarm water when washing.  \n  \n7.   Reduce itching by soaking for 15 minutes in water containing a tar solution or Epsom salts.  \n  \n8.   Remove thick scalp plaques by applying a 10 percent salicylic acid in mineral oil with a toothbrush before going to bed. Wear a shower cap when you sleep. Wash out the 10 percent acid with a tar-based shampoo the next morning.  \n  \n9.   Consider a more aggressive treatment if your condition is severe. Exposure to ultraviolet light or a course of drug therapy are options.  Exposure to the sun must be absolutely avoided when you are receiving treatment with ultraviolet light\n  \n  \n  Tips:  \nMineral oil and baking soda paste \nMix a small amount of baking soda and mineral oil into a paste; about a 3:1 ratio. Apply the paste to the area and cover with Cling Wrap or waterproof tape if the area is small. Leave on overnight. Remove wrap and wash paste residue off in the morning, then apply some cocoa butter or perfume free moisturizer.

Every woman is different. This all depends on when you hit puperty. Some girls hit puperty early and their breast will develope and continue to grow until their late teens, Others hit puperty later and their breast will not stop growing until their early 20's. Also, when a woman becomes pregnant her breast will grow larger to produce the milk needed for when the baby is born. Once she stops breast feeding and the milk dries up her breast should go back to the same size they were before she was pregnant or slightly larger.

I feel for you, although I do not work nights my mom is a nurse that works the exact shift you do.  She has trouble with sleep and working it around a semi-normal excercise and eating schedule.  But she does it just like you would do it the other way, she eats several small meals at night and doesn't eat during the day, she sleeps then.  Gets up before work has dinner (or breakfast I guess to her) then excercises (or vice versa) and gets ready for work.  She does it the exact way she would do it if she worked the day shift.
No.  In fact highly recommended along with the yearly influenza vaccination.\n\nThanks for your question.
ok. i know you're hoping everyone tells you that yes it can work. But don't let anyone fool you, this is not possible. Now i dont know how much weight you need to lose, but the more excess weight you carry the faster it is to lose. I'll tell you my opinion based on what i know and people i work with everyday. Doing that, which is totally unhealthy, i think you could lose up to 5 pounds in the first week if your body has enough weight to lose(meaning if you are significantly overweight you can drop 5), and the second week you could lose about 4. But the minute you are off this liquid diet most of the weight will come back. So i think you could lose up to 10 pounds at the most but that it will just come back. \nYou will probably try doing it no matter what answer you get from myself or anyone else. It is unhealthy as you know and this kind of diet will make you very irritable and extremely hungry. A good alternative to try if you really need to diet and fast is to incorporate slim fast into 1 meal a day. it is a good way to control your calorie intake. And if you are going to follow through with this liquid diet maybe you could try and do it on 3 to 4 slim fast drinks daily. That way you will get some essential nutrients while still consuming far less calories than usual. Some people will disagree with that advice but the truth is that you are going to try some method of crash dieting wether i tell you this or not.\ngood luck

"what do you need this for?\n\nBackground: The word emphysema is derived from Greek and means ""to blow into,"" hence ""air containing"" or ""air inflated."" The term emphysema was initially applied to air within the tissues (ie, subcutaneous emphysema). In 1721, Ruysch described large air spaces in lung specimens of humans as emphysema. In 1799, Matthew Bailey subsequently provided the first clear illustration and description of emphysema as enlarged air spaces. Laennec contributed considerably to the understanding of emphysema and recognized that emphysema is associated with chronic bronchitis. In 1939, Cournand introduced the notion that emphysema causes airflow obstruction.\n\nEmphysema is defined as abnormal permanent enlargement of air spaces distal to the terminal bronchioles, accompanied by the destruction of the walls and without obvious fibrosis. The 3 described morphological types of emphysema are centriacinar, panacinar, and paraseptal.\n\nThe first type, centriacinar emphysema, begins in the respiratory bronchioles and spreads peripherally. Also called centrilobular emphysema, this form is associated with long-standing cigarette smoking and predominantly involves the upper half of the lungs.\n\nThe second type is panacinar emphysema, which destroys the entire alveolus uniformly and is predominant in the lower half of the lungs. This type of emphysema generally is observed in patients with homozygous alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency. In people who smoke, focal panacinar emphysema at the lung bases may accompany centriacinar emphysema.\n\nThe third type, distal acinar emphysema (also known as paraseptal emphysema), preferentially involves the distal airway structures, alveolar ducts, and alveolar sacs. The process is localized around the septae of the lungs or pleura. Although airflow frequently is preserved, the apical bullae may lead to spontaneous pneumothorax. Giant bullae occasionally cause severe compression of adjacent lung tissue.\n\nPathophysiology: Emphysema commonly presents with chronic bronchitis, and the pathological changes occur not only in the lung parenchyma but also in the large and small airways. Chronic bronchitis is characterized by mucous gland enlargement, focal squamous metaplasia, ciliary abnormalities, variable amounts of airway smooth muscle hyperplasia, inflammation, and bronchial wall thickening. The respiratory bronchioles display a mononuclear inflammatory process, lumen occlusion by mucus plugging, goblet cell metaplasia, smooth muscle hyperplasia, and distortion due to fibrosis. These changes, combined with loss of supporting alveolar attachments, cause airflow limitation by allowing airway walls to deform and narrow the airway lumen.\n\nEmphysema, on the other hand, is characterized by focal destruction limited to the airspaces distal to the respiratory bronchioles. Both emphysematous destruction and small airway inflammation often are found in combination in individual patients. When emphysema is moderate or severe, loss of elastic recoil, rather than bronchiolar disease, is the mechanism of airflow limitation. By contrast, when emphysema is mild, bronchiolar abnormalities are most responsible for the airflow limitation. Although air flow obstruction in emphysema is virtually irreversible, bronchoconstriction due to inflammation accounts for a limited amount of reversibility.\n\nPathogenesis\n\nPathologically, various lesions may be found in the airways of emphysematous lungs. Some are the lesions of chronic bronchitis; others affect the small airways. The vascular changes develop simultaneously. Abnormal longitudinal muscle appears in the intima of arterioles and arteries; these may show intimal fibrosis and thickening of the muscular media. Enlargement of bronchial arteries and veins occurs in some patients. Bronchial venous enlargement may cause shunting of systemic venous blood to the left atrium.\n\nCigarette smoking\n\nCigarette smoking leads to neu"

It is called post-partem depression. It is a serious illness that can lead to unwanted thoughts and could cause your wife harm. She needs to be evaluated by a psychiatrist and then be referred to a psychologist as soon a s possible. There is a lot of information about post-partem depression on the internet. My suggestion would be to check it out at webmd.com,and see if the symptoms that are listed there are what you are seeing in your wife's behavior. Also,if she will not go to see someone,then you need to go for her and find out what you can do to help her. I strongly advise that she be seen though. Good luck. Zoya.
I am a type two diabetic, and my blood sugar was 540 the first time they took it.  Although, 183 is high, that can be controlled by what you eat.  If you cut the sugar out of most of what you eat it would be a good thing.  I mean the sugar you add yourself, as everything you eat has sugar in it.  And you need to watch your carbohydrates.  \n\nLook on any can or box and it will tell you the carbohydrates in a serving.  I was told that I could have 45 carbohydrates per meal and 15 for each snack, only 3 snacks a day.  Carbohydrates turn to sugar in your system.\n\nThis may help your blood sugar, but the wisest advice I can give is to see a doctor, I do not like to see them either, but had I not gone to one, I might have died from mine, and it is always better to know.  They can prescribe medicene in pill form to help keep your blood sugar low.\n\nGood luck to you.
"You need a good, clean razor, first and foremost.  Mach 3 is good. Get a loofah, or even a ""shower puff"" and gently scrub the area you intend to shave.  In other words, do a light exfoliation.  Make sure you've been under a warm shower or bath for a while.  Apply shower gel or shaving cream.  First shave in the direction of the hair growth (not much hair goes, this is ok).  Then shave against the direction of the hair growth.  Follow with cool water AND lotion.\n\nI have very sensitive skin, I live in a warm climate, so I am in shorts or a bathing suit about 9 months out of the year.  No bumps and my skin stays smooth as silk."

Hi, just delete the cookies on your explorer options.. goodluck.. =)
I'll tell you what.  I swear by this.\n\nMy girlfriend who was really heavy asked me one day to go speed walking , not jogging, with her.  She was doing this as part of a lose weight thing.  So I agreed.\n\nNow, I am only 120 lbs and did not need to lose weight, however doing this I LOST 7 LBS THE FIRST SIX DAYS!!!!\n\nAll it is , is you walk fast, seven days a week at 2miles a day in 20 minutes....you'll notice the first few days you will feel sore and simply like dying, and especially with those little muscles you didn't realize you had at the top of the feet, but continue and don't quit.\n\nSo, you'll notice your heartbeat is faster the few days as it gets used to the exercise, then the soreness goes away, the heartbeat lowers and after a week of this committment you should lose a lot of weight.  You can cut it down to five days, after the first month................
Hughes appeared to close friends as having bizarre habits and personal tics. He had major deafness from childhood and couldn't hear the conversations around him, but he did not share that information to many people. He did business by telephone because it was easier for him to hear. Hughes had syphilis, and in his later years he developed neurosyphilis, which causes profound degeneration of brain cells that can lead to paranoia. Also, as a test pilot he was involved in many plane crashes that probably caused brain injury. Because of severe pain, he became addicted to codeine, and addiction lasted until death. And, yes, he did have the OCD. All of these facts are 'after the fact', so I am not certain if he ever had a complete dignosis while living.
I have just been to the dentist a few weeks ago. It was only for a cleaning which is not so bad. It is the drill I hate, and in order to get over my anxiety I use deep breathing techniques and it really keeps me calm during a procedure.
ok this is a quick fix, ALWAYS works for me (it even helps stop coughs and chest pains really fast)\n\nTake 2 spoons of Black Seed Oil\nand right after that take one spoon of honey (real honey, not fake sugar manmade honey)\n\nAfter that, drink warm water (if u want raelly fast results that last, put some ginger in the water (grind the ginger/smash it first, and let the water boil in a tea kettle/pot etc)\n\n100% sure that will work

Please get checked out by a dr. Don't lose your job over this. By the way not so easy to get on social security either.
If you are looking to lose weight fast just dont eat many carbs dont cut them out completly. Start exercising so the few carbs you do eat you will luse them.  Then you start lusing your fat because your fat is your long term energy storage.  So your body breaks down your fat for the energy.  So it is very important to exercise and try to stay away from the carbs. Green Tee is very good to drink during this because it will give you a little energy with out many carbs.

Trust me, take it from the mom of the world's pickiest 2 1/2 year old, your baby will survive.  As long as you make sure they have enough fluids and the food you can get into them is healthy, they really will be fine. \n\nYou could also try putting some food out on a plate and let them pick it up and eat it as they come by, it works for my little girl.
in your 20's. you have your whole adult life ahead of you, and are getting married and starting families.
If you really want to look good, believe me, dont go on your exterior. However good or bad looking you might be, but one really loves you, because not that you are beautiful but because you have good heart. Because you are not concerned with what the whole world says to you, instead be confident in yourself i.e. be confident about what you wear, how you talk etc.\nBecause you are not confident it looks in your eyes and makes your personality really bad. So just chear up. Never be confused about your exterior look but just try to improve your interior i.e. try to improve your attitude and nature.\nBy the way do you have any information about RUCHA VAIDYA smallest yet the brightest star?

You could but I wouldn't recommend it,If you set yourself a goal of losing 2 lbs of body fat a week by lowering your calorie intake.\n1. Don't radically reduce your food just break it up into several smaller meals.\n2. When your used to eating less drop a meal.\n3. Stick to eating 5 small meals a day.\n4. Change to skimmed milk, sweetener instead of sugar etc.\n5. Don't let yourself get to hungry that's when you go for fast food and they contain the most calories.
Weave is a type of hair extension used by people who want to try another style.  It is used when you either don't have enough hair, want your hair to be fuller, or just don't want to cut your hair to that style.  Weave can be glued in or sewed in, depending on what you like.  There are many celebrities who get hair extensions (weave) such as Paris Hilton, Beyonce, etc.  Its definitely in........ you should definitely try it at least once.

Oh OWIE! That sounds awful! \n\nIf it's been two days, and you've seen no improvement, you probably need to have it looked at.\n\nI've suffered multiple knee injuries & surgries, and my doc always tells me to alternate ice and heat every 15-20 minutes for an hour, then take a break. (Say an hour or so...) Also, you need to be taking an anti inflammatory, such as Ibuprofin (Advil).\n\nI hope you feel better!
Lupus is very unfortunate to have because it attacks your immune system. This behavior you are experiencing is characteristic of lupus patients, but remember that you still have a survival rate. Live life to its fullest and gradually you will become happier...extending the life span.\n\nDiet and excercise wouldn't hurt either.
Yes. It depends on how good or how clean the filters are, how old the machine is, whether it's a window unit or central air, etc. And pollen can get into a house many other ways... not just through air conditioners. People bring it in on their clothing, pets bring it in, it can come through cracks in doors and windows, etc. Go ahead and use the air conditioner. It probably won't make much difference in the pollen count inside the house.
Go to your GP as soon as possible and ask about NORETHISTERONE - it won't speed up your cycle, it will delay it. You take three tablets a day from a few days before your period is due and continue taking them until you want your period to come. Hope you enjoy your prom!
Contact lenses that are not properly cared for can be very harmful to the health of your eyes. As long as you clean them properly, no negative effects. The only adverse effect to wearing wired bras, is when I take mine off, my boobs droop.
how old are u? contact me!
Can't tell you - it's a secret. Get it? Really the best deodorant is different for everyone. I can't use anti-perspirant - allergic. I like High Endurance deo. \n  How about trial and error? When I was a kid we had to go out and try stuff. We couldn't just ask the computer and have someone else do all the work for us. That's cheating.
if your old enough either the pill which you take every time you have a period they will slow down im on the depo injection as my periods were nasty long and heavy and painful now i havent had a period for 5 months just slight blobs here and there injections are one every three months
i would suggest meditation....for relaxation, it helps me a lot
The eliptical machine is a great workout when you're pregnant. It's low impact but you can still get an intense workout if you want to. Staying in shape during your pregnancy will make your birth go a lot more smoothly by making your body better equipped to handle such a physically demanding process.
Nope. The reason is - we haven't yet discovered ALL the essential nutrients yet. Let's take carotenoids, for example. Science has found hundreds of new ones in just the last couple years and continues to find new ones regularly. Our bodies are extremely complex systems which have evolved to eat a variety of foods from nature.\n\nThe best thing you can do to ensure you get what your body needs to be healthy is to eat a wide range of real foods. Brightly colored fruits and vegetables are always good choices - color generally equals nutrients (with a few exceptions like cauliflower - no color but lots of vitamins and minerals).\n\nAlso, you missed on thing - essential fatty acids. Your body can't live or produce new cells without Omega-3 and Omega-6 fats.
It is below average height for caucasians in western countries. Is it too short? There's not a lot that can be done about it so no, I wouldn't worry about it. Some people (who I think are possibly insane) have their legs broken and spend months with external fixators applying traction to leave them with weakend bone, long scars, lots of pain and an increase in height of a few inches. And in case anyone suggests it growth hormone is not indicated for short stature. \n\nHeight may be indicative of other problems (rarely) - compare yourself to your parents' height to see if it is normal for you.
I'm not sure about the UK specifically but across teh world, the most common colour is brown. Green eyes are the least common colour, although (fact fans!) Hungarians have the highest percentage of green eyes of any population!

Clove oil,any med like orajel and aspirin or ibuprofren.\nHope you feel better-toothaches are the pits.\nDon't get clove oil on your lips or mouth because it burns!

It depends on your RMR or Resting Metabolic Rate, which has many variants...age, sex, size, etc.
If you are referring to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) no it isn't curable at this stage. It is a virus that attacks the immune system and causes joint inflammation and permanent damage to the joints. Currently Methatrexate (cancer drug) is being used by specialists to stave off the growth of RA. Apart from that, there is no cure. You can try Royal Jelly capsules and Glucosamine capsules for joint inflammation. I hope this helps - Kay.
There are no technical terms for a person who is suspicious about his/her significant other. There may be psychological theories about such behavior, but psychology/psychiatry as cannons of study do not institutionally recognize a single term. Don't believe me, search the DSM-IV-TR or the ICD-9, but you won't find anything. If the significant other's suspicion is problematic to the marriage and seems to interfere with daily functioning, then perhaps this suspicion is a symptom of a larger problem, but much more detail would be needed for a diagnosis.
Do you mean like a website? www.aka1908.org\nor do you mean online as in going thru the intake process..that would depend on the school you are at.
it stands for Sulfadiazine and Trimethoprim (common brand names include bactrim and septra). it is a medication used to treat infection, primarilary urinary tract infections.
The wife should not be obeying her husband in disobeying God. Shaving the head and the eyebrows is forbidden by God.
Sit down and tell them how you are feeling, hopeless, sad for no reason, crying spells things like that.  Tell them what your thoughts are throughout the day.  Be honest as you can be.  Tell them what has changed, like school grades, no feeling energetic anymore, cutting off from friends.  I know sounds like depression, but that is just an example.
I have heard that men with cancer there have had it removed.
Accept your skin as it is, it's going to be a lot cheper than any cream ...
YOU DIDN'T SAY WHAT STATE YOU LIVE IN BUT CHECK SITE BELOW.  ALSO, CAN TYPE IN CF LUNG TRANSPLANT AND SEARCH WEB.  SITE BELOW IS #1 FOR THIS.  CLARIAN IS IN INDIANA.
that is completely false. Eat healthily and get excersize and you will be fine. I cannot understand why people think tht enemas and diahrea are good things, they are not. The body has the ability to pruge wastes, it doen't need help, these products can be dangerous.
Tepid teabag, especially black tea, lay it on the sore for approximately 5-10 minutes at a time.
"People with persistent problems such as addiction, depression, troubled relationships and chronic dissatisfaction can transform their lives with Inner Child Work and find a new joy and energy in living. \nThe source of their problems can be in past events which get triggered in the present. We’re made up of many parts and inside we still have the little child and adolescent we were with all its experiences and feelings. This can lead to this Inner Child / adolescent part of us reacting strongly to certain experiences and situations and the feelings we’re having in the present can be the feelings of this little child / adolescent from the past. The process of opening to the world of you Inner Child and getting to know where these feelings come from can change that and enhance your choices in miraculous ways. \nCarl Jung called it the ""Divine Child"" and Emmet Fox called it the ""Wonder Child."" Some psychotherapists call it the “True Self” and Charles Whitfield called it the “Child Within”. \nThe Inner Child refers to that part of each of us which is ultimately alive, \nThe Inner Child is the emotional self. It is where our feelings live. When we experience joy, sadness, anger, fear, or affection our Child Within is coming out. When we are being playful, spontaneous, creative, intuitive and surrendering to the spiritual self, our Genuine Authentic Self, who we know deep within us, our Real Self is being welcomed and encouraged to be present. We all have an inner child and the wounds our inner child received can and do continue to contaminate our adult lives. Our parents helped create this Inner Child part of us, society also helped with the creation. When this child self is not allowed to be heard or even acknowledged as being real, a false or co-dependent self emerges. We begin to live our lives as victims. \nThen we have situations that arise in our lives which develop into unresolved emotional traumas. The gradual accumulation of unfinished mental and emotional business can lead to and fuel chronic anxiety, fear, confusion, emptiness and unhappiness through all of our life. \nBesides the Inner Child / adolescent part, we have many other selves which are trying to be heard and take control, without us really hearing the voices until we make an effort to do so. Initially, it is very important to tame the Inner Critic part of us. That voice from the past often keeps beating up our Inner Child. This voice invades whatever trauma and pain there was in our childhood. The wise Nurturing Self part of us can learn to stand as a protector self for the Inner Child. It’s the job of the Nurturer to be loving and self-affirming. This part of us can also teach the Inner Critic a new job of support instead of beating the Child self up, and can love the Inner Critic so that the Inner Child self can relax and not have to work so hard. \nThis is often where the internal battle begins. The Inner Critic has been keeping the Inner Child muffled and secluded. Often, it is a case of transforming the Inner Critic to be a good internal parent, beginning to listen to the Inner Child and to allow it to have fun and be heard. \nDenial of the Inner Child and the co-dependent self are particularly common among children and adults who grew up in troubled or dysfunctional families. This is where chronic physical mental illness, rigidity, frigidity or lack of nurturing is common. Yet, there is a way out. There is a way to discover and to heal our Inner Child / adolescent part and to break free of the bondage and suffering of our co-dependent or false self. \nThrough Inner Child Work with Elevated Therapy, it’s the easiest thing in the world to turn our feelings inwards and connect directly with that part of us that can offer comfort and support. \nThis is called self-nurturing or re-parenting which allows us to reclaim that wounded child.  We can provide for ourselves all the love and support and positive regard we never had "
I guess everybody has their fetish.\n\nIf you are not comfortable with it, plain and simple dont do it.  Urine is supposedly one of the cleanest things on earth so if your into it, so be it.
Blood tests will not show imminent heart attack.  High cholesterol readings put one at risk, but not imminently.  There are symptoms that can foreshadow a heart attack, however.  These are most often bouts of fleeting chest pain or chest pressure associated with some shortness of breath.  They can occur with increased frequency and severity over period of weeks to give one a warning.  On the other hand, many heart attacks are sudden and without warning.  There are stress tests to perform in order to see whether the arteries are blocked and high risk of heart attack exists. Talk to your doctor about these.
Your body sounds just fine....not at all a problem.  But you may want to check where your insecurity comes from.  You should feel as comfortable with yourself as you seem to look.
used to, not any more, You are fine, just raging hormones.  It will go away as you get older.
always eat breakfast, EXERCISE, drink lots of water, eat small meals throughout the day.  the laxatives have slowed your metabolism now that your body wasn't doing the work, the laxatives were.  laxatives should be used sparingly, as you found out the hard way by getting addicted.  try the above to regulate your metabolism all over again.  also your metabolism will increase if you exercise and gain muscle, which in turn helps you not be constipated.  but water is very very important as well......
Walking, jogging swimming and cycling are good for all time!

doubtful. there are no food supliments or foods that make people lose fat, and this is coming from a nutritionist's point of view.
protein needs training to function well on the muscle, and creation works as a power enhancer that gives u higher performance in gym ...\n\nI tried both, and i gained 10 kilos after using them in 3 month. You have to watch out for the recommandations and know what to use according to your condition.\n\nBut yet for weight gain i suggest whey proteins, and creatin wait untill u need to push more in gym start taking it, and for more effective result there is some kind of proteins that work in making the muscle keep its new size and not lose it if u had to stop gym for a while (maybe such stuff might be added with the creatin you are using)\n\nOne last note: dont use liquid creatin its not effective at all, and its having defects.
Let's see...they've taken about 20 years to get this far when all they had to do was buy much of what is needed...and all the instruction manuals had already been written.  The United States developed nuclear power in less than 4 years and had to invent everything along the way.  \n\nSo no, the Iranian scientists don't impress me much.
I would check with a doctor first, you don't want to go taking advice on things that could harm someone from this site trust me half of us on here are smart asses who think they know it all and the rest are pervs.\nI'm not sayin' which one I am :)
I hate when that happens.\n\nIf I only knew what to tell you to avoid that.\n\nsorry\n\ni dont think anyone knows.  \nIf doctors knew they would tell us right??
Karat refers to the proportion of gold in your jewelery.  The higher the karat, the more gold it contains.  24 karat is 100 percent gold, while 9 karat is only 37 percent gold.  The rest of it is made from zinc, copper, nickel, etc.  You are most likely allergic to the nickel, many people are.  Gold is actually a very bio-compatible metal.  The most common symptoms are a rash and itching.\n\nhttp://jewelry.about.com/od/jewelrymetals/a/gold_jewelry.htm\nhttp://www.aocd.org/skin/dermatologic_diseases/nickel_allergy.html
that happends to me ALOT. If u want them to go away,like,now,you could just take a sip of water,but you have to swallow it 2 times with your head back.
"you need to boost your calorie use in relation to your calorie intake.  Here's how:  \n\nFOOD - don't eat in between meal snacks, instead, plan them.  have an apple or orange or similar low fat snack every 1.5 to 2 hours between meals.  When you eat a meal, eat it all at once, (don't keep eating all afternoon!).  Try to avoid the deep fried things for brekkie or lunch.  Have anything you want for dinner.  Eat no snacks between dinner and bed.\n\nEXERCISE - in addition to what you normally do simply add 15 to 20 minutes of aerobic exercise every morning.  This could be ""power"" walking, jogging, swimming, bicycling, stationary bicycle, etc.\n\nyou will lose 1 to 5 pounds  (i'm american btw) per week depending on how well you stick to the rules.  The weight loss will taper off as you approach the ideal weight for your height."
"ask someone at home who is ""allergitic"" to alarm sounds to use your clocks and wake u up at that time. if you dont find any one, the best way is to try different irritating sounds of alarms or a talking alarm............"
Your best bet is to seek medical attention. If you can't see someone right away, keep a log on the type of pain and any other symptoms that accompany it. These other things may be important to a proper diagnosis.
No it doesn't make you fat. Water contains no calories or fat. You should drink lots of it for clear skin, shiny hair and general good health. Try to drink 2 litres a day.
There is absolutly no reason why having a brazilian wax would harm your baby if you ensure you get the waxing done by professional salon staff.  I would not risk getting it done by a trainee, a friend, or doing it yourself as there is far more risk of making an mistake with the hot wax.\nWhen the baby is born the midwife will probably give you a nice complment about how neat you keep things down there!
Uterine fibroids, adenomyosis and a hormone imbalance are 3 major causes of heavy menstrual bleeding.  Given your cramping, I would suspect the first two.  You are bleeding far too much and it does need to be addressed in order to protect your health.  Treatments include medical and surgical options, like oral contraceptives, endometrial ablation and/or surgical treatment of the fibroids or adenomyosis (if they prove to be the cause).  The cure for adenomyosis is a hysterectomy, but sometimes endometrial ablation can help some women with the disorder.  A local women's clinic, Planned Parenthood or similar organization should be able to help you with diagnosis and treatment on a sliding scale basis if lack of insurance is an issue.  Good luck!
You have to really think about this question.  Have you ever been in a waiting room in a radiology department/facility?  Have you seen all the pregnant women sitting there, waiting for their ultrasounds?  Did you ever think this was a health risk for them?\n\nAny room that is used to take x-rays is shielded with lead in the walls.  You could be on the other side of a wall that x-rays were directed at and have no measurable dose. You could be in a bathroom that shares a wall with a x-ray room and get no dose.  The x-ray room is completely shielded so radiation cannot pass through it.  Don't you think x-ray workers would all be dying of cancer, or at least all have cataracts if this wasn't the case?\n\nHave you ever had a loved one in the ICU?  We also do x-rays in surgery and the emergency department. We do x-rays on portable machines on a regular basis.  If you are not right in the path of the x-ray beam, and if you are not close to that path, there is no exposure.  X-rays do not travel for eternity...they dissipate.  \n\nThe use of x-rays and the rules that surround them are above and beyond what is necessary to protect the public.  These things are tested on an annual basis.  If we don't pass, we don't do x-rays anymore.  \n\nSo, you should feel safe living next to an imaging center.
get a BJ or a bottle of good lotion and rub your penis.
Mine would have to be surviving cancer and lymphedema along with other health stuff and going on to getting disability.  I worked 2 jobs through most of the health issues.

I've heard about 4 days.\n\nWhen I quit smoking several years ago... here's what I did.  I took a two liter bottle of water and went into a sauna.  I kept on drinking water.  When I started to sweat heavily, I would exit the sauna and take a quick shower... rinsing the sweat off of me.  \n\nI would then return to the sauna and repeat the procedure until I had drank all the water.\n\nI felt great!  That first day went fairly easily.  The next day was pure torture.  I think I sweated out all the nicotine that first day and had massive withdrawels on the second.  Still, my withdrawel lasted a much shorter time than other times I attempting quitting.\n\nGood luck!

Hello,\n\nHere are the following tips that I can tell you:\n\nFollow your foods pyramid that tells you how much servings you need for each group of foods. \n\nExercise at least 60 minutes\n\nDo not starve yourself--it does not help to lose weigh, it increases your weigh.\n\nSleep 8-10 hours, it helps to burn calories\n\nEat small portion of foods for every two hours--it claims that it help to burn calories faster. \n\nDo not eat until you're full, eat when you're satisfied. \n\nUse the computer for only two hours—you’ve got legs to move around, be an active person. \n\nDrink plenty of water & real fruit juices\n\nYou will need to put a lot of effort to lose 30 pounds and if you do, it could result faster than you expect.\n\n\n\nBest of luck!

If you sleep with wet hair it attracts allergens in the air.  If you have allergies you become More susceptible to them becoming aggravated because the wet hair attracts the dander(depending on the kind of allergy you have).  About the headaches, not so sure, have you ever gotten a sinus infection and your head was banging?  Did you also have wet hair at the time?
A doc can zap it with cryo-surgery (freezing) in no time and it won't even hurt or smell like icky wart medicine.  Good luck!
"Yes, it may cover most of the bacteria that typically cause oral abcesses.  However, it does not cover what we call ""anaerobic organisms"".  If you do not feel better after 24-48 hours, or if it gets worse in the next 24 hours, talk to your doctor to get an alternative (clindamycin or augmentin).  Also, septra has a sulfa component, so please do not take it if you have had a severe allergic reaction to sulfa in the past."
Yes, it is possible for a twelve year old to have depression (I personally had depression at age 12). Some major symptoms of depression, depending on severity, include apathy, significant weight gain/loss, sleeping excessively or insufficiently, hopelessness, suicidal thoughts (please, get help if you do have these:  www.hopeline.com)... there are many more. As you have mentioned, bouts of crying are also indicative of depression. \nOf course, being a teenager, mood swings are also possible, but since you've somewhat expressed that you're upset because of your parents' relationship, ... maybe it would be good to talk to a mentor or couneslor. Good luck.
depends if you're hacking mucous on people or not. but if it is being treated with an antibiotic, should not be contagious after 3-7 days
You correct in recognizing this as a dangerous habit. Isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol is quite toxic. When ingested your body breaks it down in to acetone, a chemical commonly found in nail polish remover. Clearly this is not safe. Your friend is abusing a substance. There are some commonalities in people who abuse substances. Primarily being that they are using the substance for an effect that aides them in escaping reality. Your Friend is a drug addict. He/she must desire to help himself/herself. You cannot force them into recovery no matter what you say, but this does not mean that you should not push your friend to seek help. Perhaps your friends does not know that treatment options are available. They are. The National Institute on Drug abuse has many paths that will help you to talk to your friend about the substance abuse as well as  centers for treatment. They can be found here: http://www.nida.nih.gov/
my son has classic pku, he is 21 months old and the amount has not changed, he was born about 6 pounds and is now about 32. the safe range is approximately between \n2 and 10 mg/dl (phenylalanine), your doctor should be keeping a close eye on him, and with regular blood tests (weekly till 2 years)\nlevels should not be to high. i am sure they will tell you if they were concened.\nI live in australia so things may be differant between us, but please if you are at all concerned talk to the doctors/dieticians. good luck.
yes its very healthy its a good source of calcium and for Vaginal yeast infections affect nearly 12 million women each year. Research suggests that when eaten regularly, yogurt-containing L. acidophilus, a culture found in some yogurts, may decrease yeast growth and infection\n\n0ne out of two women and one out of eight men will develop osteoporosis. Studies show that a diet high in calcium can help slow bone loss, thereby preserving bone mass and reducing the risk of developing this debilitating disease. Calcium-rich yogurt may also lessen the effects of osteoporosis among the elderly.\n\n As many as 50 million Americans suffer from hypertension, or high blood pressure, which increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease. When your family eats lowfat yogurt, they're getting calcium, potassium, and magnesium - three nutrients that have been shown to reduce hypertension\n\nNew studies indicate that calcium may reduce the risk of colon cancer. Furthermore, other studies have found that populations that eat large amounts of yogurt, or other fermented milk products, seem to have a lower risk of developing certain types of cancer, especially colon cancer

Sorry, to answer your question, I would need more information regarding the underlying reason for the internal bleeding.  Many things can lead to internal bleeding.  Some, such as trauma, may not pose any future threat of rebleeding.  Others, such as arteriovenous malformations in the GI tract, may put a patient at significant risk for recurrent bleeding.  Similarly, some causes can be avoided, such as the use of blood thinners.  Others, such as the aforementioned GI AV malformations, can be more difficult to manage.
I know this is strange but, this is the best way to describe it: A wonderful pressure builds up inside you. When it lets go..it feels like a good sneeze. You know, the tickle, the anticipation of a sneeze,, then..ACHOOO!! You feel better? An orgasm feels like a sneeze between your legs.
Vinegar in the diet goes back well over 3000 years. The Roman army issued it to it's troops. Egyptians also used it in their diet even before that..I don't know what it does but I was raised half my life on a farm by an Aunt and Uncle..I have learned many things from them over the years.(Old remedies and such) My Uncle gets up every morning and and drinks a mixture of Cranberry apple juice with a tblspn of Apple cider vinegar in it...

"Ofcourse you can't change fat into muscle, you need to lose the fat first. I'm not sure if there are any diets where you lose fat from your belly first except Jorge Cruise's 3-hour diet, because with that diet you eat every 3 hours which keeps your metablolism revved up. I quote Cruise, "" In the New England journal of medicine, they published a study. In the study they specifically showed that eating every three hours reduced the stress hormone called cortisol. That's why belly fat goes down -- the reduction in cortisol. When you have high levels of this cortisol hormone, it's closely associated to abdominal fat. In this study it was shown that in as little as two weeks, individuals who ate frequent small meals, as opposed to three large meals, containing the same amount of calories, just breaking them down over time, over six meals versus three, they were able to reduce cortisol levels by more than 17%. That was just in the first two weeks -- it was wonderful. When you do this long term, the body gets efficient at staying low in cortisol level and that's what you want. That the how you stay slim and trim; with belly fat especially, it's all about removing the stress hormone cortisol. ""\nCheck out the diet.. its actually very easy because you're never hungrey and you don't eliminate any kind of food.\n\nAfter you lose the fat fom your belly, you need to start doin excercises that target the belly area and thus build muscle.\nGood luck!"
I tried it and I did feel great.  It completely got rid of my appetite.  The only thing is that I put in more maple syrup than was in the recipe and that is the reason that after twelve days I only lost 2 pounds.  But I did not do it to lose weight.  I did it for the cleansing value.  It was remarkable that I never felt edgy or out of sorts. Whenever I was feeling a little hungry I drank another glass.  It really felt good and since it was the first time that I have ever fasted in all of my 50 years I think that I was a great experience which I will continue to do on a quarterly basis.  If I ever want to skip a meal it is very effective and does not cause any negative side effects that I experienced.  Try it you'll like it. I did.
If it's a first date or something then I wouldn't say anything.  If they go out on a few dates and things look like they might be going good then I would tell them.  I also agree with telling the guy that she is on meds and she is doing well with no recent episodes.  There are guys out there that are caring and considerate.  If this scares them off then they weren't worth the time.  Good luck to you sister!

In my understanding, love handles are nothing but extra belly fat. SO all exercises where you can burn that extra fat would be helpful. Those would be high intensity abdominals strengthening ( curl ups etc. ) , jogging/running with high steps ( as already said).\nGOOD LUCK.
K out of those that answered I can honestly say that I am the most qualified to give advice on this one LOL no disrespect to you folks.  Okay, a shin splint is where some of your muscles on one side of your leg become stronger than the adjacent mucsles on the other side whereby the mucsles are acually pulling away from the bone.  Extremely painful in some instances, I've been a track runner for many years and at one point I would acually cry after practice.  This was in college mind you.  \n\nSo what to do, first of all stretch.  Probably the most important thing you can do, before engaging in any physical activity especially involving any amount of running is STRETCH. Stretch your hamstrings, quads, and glutes.  Stretch your gastrochnemious IE CALVES and your feet.  Stretch everytime, perhaps two times a day for five mins at a time.  Warm up a bit, get the blood flowing perhaps from a brisk walk or very light jog, and then stretch.\n\nK, so now that I emphasized stretching LOL, now use a heating pad or something warm to massage your sore shins BEFORE exercise.  Don't ever ice before engaging in physcal activity, this will lead you to be more prone to injury!\n\nAlways use the heating pad or ice for twenty mins, no longer and no shorter twenty mins. After icing, allow the numbness to dissapate before walking.  Don't switch back and forth either.  \n\nWarm before exercise\n\nIce afterward.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nAlso you might want to get some foam pads to insert into your shoes, helped me get through track season one year.\n\nAlso if you can, avoid running on concrete and asphalt (hard surfaces) look to running on a well finished track or nice green plush grass:) Good Luck!  Hope I helped
The cream a person uses to remove hair, can be very Harsh to some ,who are allergic to it. Sore, red skin. itchy, a person should take a test sample first. Rub some on a small area and wait 24 Hrs to see if you have a reaction to it, simular to the patch test for color for thr Hair on the head...

If ur pregnant you shouldnt be having stomach pains that hurt really bad. when you are pregnant you get these mild cramps that are like menstral cramps, they come and go instead of being constant, and not so sharp. Although you do get discharge while you are in the first trimester, its like raw egg white. its clear, slimy and there everytime you wipe. usually there from the first week of a missed period till about 3 weeks after. by then u know ur pregnant. You should consider taking a test if you really think you are. get a good one. EPT is the best one there is. each test picks up different levels of HCG. the further along u are the more HCG there will be in your urine. If nothing ever comes of the test I would see a doctor soon because something is not right especially with the back pain and stomach pains. I have heard of some STD's giving the same symptoms. Make sure you talk to ur partner about this. this is all about ur life and his, from raising a child or an STD no matter how you look at it. hope things  go ok. good luck
"Swelling occurs when ligaments are injured because the ligaments are intimately connected with the functioning of the joints. Ligaments hold our joints together, helping to maintain the structural integrity of the skeletal system. When a ligament is strained, the synovial membrane of the joint where the ligament is located is ""told"" by the brain to produce more fluid than is required for proper functioning. This increase in synovial fluid causes the joint to swell. This swelling is our body's way of sending us a strong and important message. The body is saying, ""Don't move me too quickly or too vigorously, or I will send pain signals to remind you that I need to rest in order to heal."""
THe pain is part of the exsperience. Just stay calm and keep breathing, close your eyes and let your mind kinda drift away. Trust me, it isn't that unpleasant.

"Alzheimer's Disease is a FORM of dementia. There are other types.  It's a physical deterioration of the brain--the neurons are in ""tangles"" and covered with ""plaque"" (those are the scientific words) which is a geometrical progression downhill--as more neurons die and become tangles, the surrounding neurons can't communicate with any other ones, and they die too.\nIt is not DIRECTLY fatal like cancer is.  What happens is, as the person's brain deteriorates, that person forgets how to do more and more essential functions. Eventually AD patients forget how to eat and starve or choke or aspirate their food into their lungs (causing infection and death), or they forget to breathe and just die.  In the earlier stages a person can die through carelessness--forgetting to look both ways when crossing the street and getting hit by a car, or leaving a pan on the stove and burning down the house.\nIt's an awful terrible disease. My dad has it."
Women who are atrracted to women. It comes from greek. A young lady teacher (dont remmember her name) would right poems about her girl students. She either was really happy with them.... or she was just that kind of girl who liked girls. So they started calling people like her by her name (ex: Stacyians). Her name was not Stacy but again I dont remmember her name. Eventually they started to call people like her on the island she lived. It was called Lesbo. Hence the name Lesbian.
"Actually this is quite common for women who are very close to ""sync"" and have their menstrual cycles at the same time.  Hey, it could be a good thing.  They're all gonna get PMS at once, so just bring in chocolate that time of the month and they'll be happy.  *smile*"

I do believe that you are referring to ADHD. ADHD stands for this: Attention - Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder. ADHD is a developmental and behavioral disorder that normally affects school-age children. The statistics are usually between 3% to 5% of school-aged children. The condition usually manifests in childhood, but it could persist into adulthood as well. It causes difficulties at school and at work if not treated properly. Experts estimate that ADHD effects about 60% of adults who had ADHD in their childhood. The main symptoms of ADHD include inattention, impulsiveness and hyperactivity that are inappropriate for a person's age level. \n\nI hope this helped you out. Good luck!!
It can be hard, but cheer up, your writing seems completely fine, you can use it as an expression of your thoughts.\nAs for the names, ignore them. People are like that. They call names to anyone who's even the slightest bit different. But you know, you should just appreciate Life as it is, because imagine how a blind person would feel, not being able to see the world and it's beauty.\nThere's always someone else less fortunate than we are, we should always stop to give our thanks for the blessing we have.\nIf they really get on your nerve, I bet there's one sign language you can show them. It's so universal that even a 5 year old kid would know it. Just point your third finger. \n\nI think you should write. It will get so many things, thoughts, and emotions off your chest. Write a diary. Write a short story. \nReally, it will not only improve your english, but maybe you'd even get an award-winning book one day!\n\nWriting for me is a great way to express what the spoken word cannot.

Do the following:\n1) Break up exam study sessions into chunks less than 2 hours each.  \n2) Study one topic at a time and make yourself a good schedule and stick to it.\n3) Between sessions, take a 10-15 minute break to relax or do something you like.\n4) Make sure you get 8 hours of sleep a night and take sleep aids if you have to\n5) Avoid stimulants like coffee and cigarettes.  Instead, eat healthy things like herbs, fruits, and fiber.  They will give your body real mental and physical power.

It's not *bad* for you but you still need some pure water every day.  Juices typically contain a lot sugar and, even though they DO hydrate you, the added sugar has to be processed in the body, too.  So water is still important.
"Please don't be like most of America (and a previous answer) and go running for the antibiotics right away. That is not the best way to go about things. The only time you need antibiotics is when you know you have a bacterial infection of some sort. Antibiotics don't do anything for viral infections. Having said that, a slightly raised white blood cell count may not mean anything, but there is a chance that you have an infection of some type. This could be something simple like an allergen in your system, or you've encountered a type of virus/bacteria that you have already fought off once before and the ""memory cells"" are doing they're job to ensure it doesn't make you sick again. There is a small chance that it could be something more serious, but just be aware of your condition and take the proper steps if needed. Nobody knows how you feel better than you do! Good luck."

Change your diet and exercise regularly.  Only your doctor should rule out medication.
talk to your doctor about a healthy plan for you, but please, don't obsess over this, just eat healthy foods and get exercise (play a sport, swim, walk the dog everyday, participate in gym class, etc.).  drink plenty of water, try replacing unhealthy snacks (potato chips, chocolate bars) with better ones (carrots, bananas, yogurt, an egg, wheat crackers, you get the idea). if you are obese, your doctor should tell you how to safely get to a healthy weight. if you are just trying to lose a few pounds, relax, your body is okay, after puberty, if you continue to have a healthy lifestyle, your body will look better (a little fat is common, and even good, so don't worry). if you are concerned about your weight, talk to your doctor or a nutritionist. and whatever you do, don't starve yourself, force yourself to vomit, use laxatives to lose weight, etc. it's very unhealthy and can kill you.\nGood luck, and stay healthy!
i would say if you are not used to them, you should stick with your norm. unless you want to try out tampons today and see how that goes, some women take awhile to get used to not feeling them, others don't hardly notice. but whichever you choose if you are going to be that active, i would slip an extra in the bottom of your purse and switch it out half way through the night to avoid the embarrasement of leakage. you really can not see a string dangling unless you know it is there, as long as you are wearing undies you'll be fine. you might also opt for some control top pantyhose, that way if you have a little leak or accident it won't be too detrimental to your dress...\nthe most important thing is to not stress about it and use whichever you are more comfortable with.

As far as I know, RA is thought to shorten the lifespan of a person by 10 - 15 years.  This is probably due more to the medications you have to take and decreased quality of life and inability to exercise and rest properly that has shortened the lifespan, not the disease itself.  \n\nHowever, with some of the newer biologic meds, like Enbrel, I think this may become less of an issue in the future because damage to the joints can be slowed and prevented, leading to a better quality of life, thereby increasing the quantity. (Just my guess... I'm not a doctor, but it seems logical.)\n\nYou can check out http://www.arthritis.org for info on RA, and there is a very helpful discussion board there as well.

Therefore everyone hears their own voice different than everyone else hears it.  As for the pictures, yes because we all have a perceived image of ourselves in our minds, when we see that still image, if it differs from the perceived image that we have of ourselves, then it appears funny to us.

"Some questions, no matter how simple, don't have one knowable answer. Though a number of ""explanations"" exist for this custom, nothing points to any one of them being its origin. \n\nCommon among these explanations are: \n\n\nAt one time people believed a man's soul could be inadvertently thrust from his body by an explosive sneeze, thus ""Bless you!"" was a protective oath uttered to safeguard the temporarily expelled and vulnerable soul from being snatched up by Satan (who was always lurking nearby). The purpose of the oath was to cast a temporary shield over the flung-out soul which would protect it just long enough to regain the protection of the corporeal body. \n\nConversely, the sneeze itself was the expulsion of a demon or evil spirit which had taken up residence in a person. Therefore, although the ""Bless you!"" was again a protective charm meant to protect the sneezer from evil, in this version it was meant to ward off the re-entry of an evil spirit which a tormented soul had just rid itself of. \n\nThe heart was believed to momentarily stop during a sneeze (it doesn't), thus the ""Bless you!"" was uttered either as a supplication for life to return or as a congratulation upon its successful restart. \n\nOthers claim an association of the practice with particular dire diseases (most often the bubonic plague, or ""Black Death,"" as it is sometimes known). They say an infected person's sneeze was sure sign he'd soon be pushing up daisies, thus the ""Bless you!"" was intended as a benediction to the nearly-departed, a way of commending his soul to the care of God now that he was beyond the help of anything in the mortal world. \n\nYet other folks echo the theme of other superstitions about sneezes, that these expulsions are either in themselves lucky or foretell good fortune coming the sneezer's way. For them, the ""Bless you!"" is a recognition of incoming good luck, possibly even an attempt on the blesser's part to attract a bit of it to himself. \n\nFinally, some see the sneeze as a blessing bestowed by the sneezer upon the sneezed-upon. Answering a sneeze with ""Bless you!"" is seen as nothing more remarkable than replying ""Good morning!"" to the person who had just greeted you with the same phrase."
By the other responses, you can see there are lots of opinions but few facts.  Pork is a general term and more specifically I would recommend avoiding meats with high saturated fat content (solid fat at room temperature). That would include bacon and most processed/prepared meats.  The pork loin is very lean and is a good source of lowfat protein.  In general look for the LOIN in beef and pork products (sirloin, tenderloin, loin chops).  It makes sense to vary your diet and eat from different food sources.  Once or twice a week should be part of a healthy diet.

well it could be because u have nasal polyps, bloody noses and headaches are common signs and symptoms.  poylps are just little outgrowths of tissue, you can get them anywhere in your body where there is tissue.  Another sign/symptom is snoring - ask your significant other if u snore at night.  but either way, u should get it looked at.  these types of polyps can be removed by nasal sprays or by outpatient surgery.  deffinatly get it looked at!

Ovarian cysts can be associated with infertility and irregular menstrual bleeding in some women, but the good news is, they are easily treatable.  In a lot of women, they can even be functional or asymptomatic, and are often diagnosed as an incidental finding during diagnostic tests done for other reasons.  Lower abdominal pain is the most common sign; it is important to watch for *acute, debilitating pain* often accompanied by nausea or vomiting, as those can be signs of a ruptured cyst.  Depending on the type of cyst (follicular, hemorrhagic, dermoid, endometrioma, etc.) and the symptoms you are having, your doc can offer you advice and treatment options based on what's right for you, ranging from medications to surgery.  Good luck and feel better.

The bicycle crunch is THE single most effective ab exercise out there. I read this on a list that studied all ab excercises plus ab machines and such. Oh I found the link!! You should check this out! http://www.ginmiller.com/gmf04/artinfo/bestabsintro1.htm\nAnd for how to do the bicycle crunch if you don't know go here \nhttp://www.toneteen.com/exercises/abs_bicyclecrunch.htm\nI also recommend 8 Minute Abs! the excerise dvd. It only takes 8 minutes a day!

Ok I'll start off by saying I'm NOT a doctor - but I have worked out in the past with the goal of bulking up and sliming down. There are some basics to meeting your goals ... if you want to slim down, you have to cut calories and exercise more - if you want to bulk up - you have to eat like there's no tomorrow and exercise/lift weights/etc. When I was in slim down mode I cut calories (easy stuff like cut cokes (>150 calories a piece) out of my diet and I started on an eliptical - that took about 10 lbs off - but I stayed at that weight until I tried a different type of exercise - I got on a treadmill and lost another 5 - just by doing a different type of exercise. Also - DON'T worry about putting on any muscle - you want to loose body fat and build muscle - which burns body fat - you have got to eat enough to sustain your muscle mass - if you stop eating and restrict calories too much then you will actually burn muscle and put on fat. Be sensible and MOVE more than the lazy person in the cube next to you at work - most people put on weight just because they don't move enough to burn what they take in every day.\n\nEat sensible.\nCut the stupid stuff out (get a bottle of water instead of a coke and if you can stay away from the man-made sweeteners)\nMove. Stairs, park farther away, do a minimum of 30 minutes a day on that treadmill.\n\nDon't give up hope - you'll see results more quickly than you think!!
80% of taste is smell.  We only have 5 types of taste buds: sweet, sour, bitter, salt, and umami (new one just dicovered that responds to an amino acid high in beef).  Life would be pretty boring if that was all we tasted.  Meanwhile we can smell about 10,000 different things, so your tastebuds and olfacory receptors work together.  Unless your olfactory receptors are covered in mucous!  I find that I use a lot more salt when I'm stuffy, probably because I can taste that.
This is an excellent website on the subject:\nhttp://www.halls.md/chart/height-weight.htm
I'm so sorry to hear about your husband.  I also feel for you and your situation.  Here's my advice:\n\n1. Find a male friend of his, a councilor or possibly your pastor that he can work with to solve his drug problem.  YOU DID NOT CAUSE THIS PROBLEM!! and YOU CANNOT SOLVE THIS PROBLEM! Read those two lines again and again.  Realize that you do not believe these two absolutely true lines.  \n\n2. Stick by him by allowing him to take responsibility for himself.  There is nothing wrong with telling him you love him and wish him well in his own recovery, but that you will NOT be the one to get him off drugs.\n\n3. Do NOT stand for any abusive yelling, name calling, or threats!  You do not deserve this type of thing and no one does.  Do not stand for this for one second!\n\n4. You may need to move out temporarily so that he can put his life back in order without blaming you.  Do not do this in a moment of anger, but in a moment of love.  Tell him you have faith in him and you will be there for pleasant phone calls.  But remind him that you cannot solve his problem.\n\n5. You may need to council with your pastor or with a professional so you can understand the truth of the situation.\n\n6. You need to repent to your husband for 1) allowing him to manipulate and talk unkindly to you and 2) for trying to shield him from the consequences of his actions.  These things have made him less able to change.\n\nGood luck my friend.\n\nJ
No, that's a myth that's been going around and there's no truth to it.
Cold water.  It's important to cool it as soon as possible to stop the burning.  In addition, cold is anti-inflammatory. Taking aspirin or ibuprofen can also cut down the damage. NEVER butter or anything greasy or oily.\n\nCan someone give me a reference for that warm water idea?  I can't find it anywhere, I've never heard it from anyone credible, AND it doesn't make sense.
Not just masturbation: every form of sex leads to more pimples. So like anger and stress, because all of them cause the body to secrete more serum, what leads to pimples.\n\nBut don't worry. No matter how chast are you, abstinence won't save you from the horrible pimples. As a teenager (assuming you're a teen, I hope I'm right) you're secreting tons of hormones whether you have sex or not so the difference is very small. The effect is minimal.

The biggest challenge definitely has to be figuring out the right answer for this question. You can literally see the smoke coming out of my ears as I ponder over this. Its hurting a bit, but in a good way.
long answer but worth the read.  Don't do cardio leave that to co come from your lacrosse practice and .....\nbuilding mass eat lots of healthy food (tuna, chicken breast/tenderloins, salmon, greens ect) sleep 7-8 hrs\nnegative training\nTo perform negatives with enough weight to make it effective you won’t be able to execute as many reps as u do concentrically.  Control the descent rate will set the target.  \n·Target goal 8 reps\n·Target speed 3-5 sec durring desent\n·Sets Large muscle groups legs, chest, back 2-3 sets: Small muscle groups arms, shoulders, calves 1-2 sets\n·Rest - due to intensity of negative training increase rest 3-5 min between sets\nmix negative training for each muscle group into your week and take a 2-3 month break and concetrate on muscle building techniques ie hammer curls for bicepts, french curls for triceps, ect.  And mix up your training instead of sticking with the same old routine.
Either, but eat them with cheese or peanut butter for protein.
http://www.doctoryourself.com\nThe most effective therapy I know of is saturation of vitamin C along with the use of  calcium/magnesium supplements.  This is a too easy answer to a problem that so many have really suffered with, I know.  Yet just ask anyone you know with fibromyalgia this single question: Have you tried it yet?  If they still have the condition, Ill bet they havent. Saturation (bowel tolerence) of vitamin C is easily reached through frequent oral doses, and is fully described in these articles: \nhttp://doctoryourself.com/titration.html  \nhttp://doctoryourself.com/vitaminc.html \nhttp://doctoryourself.com/vitaminc2.html \nhttp://doctoryourself.com/ortho_c.html \nhttp://doctoryourself.com/klenner_table.html
"Try waxing..but it is hard to do yourself, and ""Mom"" will probably be able to tell (you go all pink).  Another thing is ""depilatory cream"".  It is kind of like ""Neat"" (for shaving your legs), but is made for facial hair.  :)\n\nPS...Hair is ALWAYS going to grow back.  Waxing pulls it from the root, so it takes longer to grow back.  Shaving & the cream I was talking about just takes off the surface part of the hair.  You have to go ""electrolysis"" to get rid of it forever...costly :)"

"u can go to gym and make squats with heavy weights and there re also a lot of exercises for that, but it won't be ""immediate"" result. it takes for a woman not less than a year"
Don't worry over it and buy hundreds of expensive creams. Spend time outdoors ( but protect yourself sensibly if its sunny) , drink lots of water, eat well- lots of fruit and veg and excercise and RELAX! I know women who have followed a clean, good lifestyle and in thier 60's are so beautiful with not much more than laughter lines. Please, love yourself and grow older naturally, you only live once and why stress over potions and lotions, life is for living and as long as you live well you'll look great!
It depends on the type of arrhythmia. Usually arrhythmias result from problems with the way electricity flows through the heart, and electrophysiology studies (EPS for short), which map the current flow in the heart, are more helpful.\n\nA nuclear stress test shows pictures of the blood flow to various parts of the heart. They take one set of pictures when you are resting, and another set when the heart is under stress--either from running on a treadmill, or injecting a chemical to stress the heart. \n\nIf your arrhythmia is from part of your heart not getting enough blood, then the nuclear stress test might help figure it out.\n\nVery few doctors will order tests without a sound reason, but if you have reservations, you should get a second opinion from a Cardiologist. If your first doc has a problem with you getting a second opinion, you need a new doctor.\n\nGood luck.
I think it all depends on the dream...they are definately a window to your soul.\nYou just have to interpret them in different ways. It could be your worse fear,your greatest dream,something thats going to happen,something that has happened...it just all depends on the dream and where you are in your life.
Well, a second opinion is always good!
why in the heck would you squirt soap, LEMON JUICE, and vinegar in your penis? Are you that freakin bored???  J@ck-0ff don't put acids in your penis dude.....  Oh go to the doctor
Maybe her hair follicles have a bacteria or something.  Has she been checked out by a doctor?  There has to be an underlying cause of the smell, and smells are often due to some type of infection.
really there is no way to say without knowing all of the inforamtion such as type of hair loss, etc.  You really should consult an expert. (and then let me know too) lol
Try doing crunches, i do 100 every morning before i go to school, usually the earlier you do exercise, the better because during the morning your metabolism is at its highest, and therefore you will loose more calories. You should also try just exercising like 30 minutes a day. People usually tend to loose fat from the stomach area the last.

It won't damage it, but there are chemicals you use to put into them that keep them clear of germs.. these chemicals are expensive.\n\nIt is a good idea to bathe before using the hot tub to keep it cleaner.
Rheumatoid arthritis is an auto immune disease.  Unlike osteoarthritis, which is pain from joints that are already damaged, RA is inflammation from your immune system attacking your joints.  Even when you aren't having any symptoms, your immune system is attacking and deteriorating your joints.  In order to slow this damage, you  need to be on prescription medications as guided by your rheumatologist.  Drugs like Enbrel, Remicade, and Humira are new biological agents that work wonders in many patients.  I have been on Enbrel on six months and am in full remission, I have little pain, no inflammation, and no morning stiffness.\n\nIf you rely solely on home remedies, you are ignoring permanent, debilitating damage that may be being done to your joints.  RA causes disability in many people.\n\nIf you are already on prescription medications, ask your doctor what supplements he reccomends you explore for additional relief.  Be sure to talk to your doctor, because some supplements may counteract your current treatment.\n\nFor the most part, many supplements are not proven, and rely on skeptical data.  Some may offer some relief, but the best way to supplement your prescription medication is with a healthy lifestyle.  Healthy diet and exercise will help your immune system become more healthy.  Remember, this isn't something you get because you are old, this is a disease caused by the immune system going haywire, that effects people of all ages.  Talk to your doctor about what kind of exercises are ok for you, eat healthy, and make sure you are taking care of your unbalanced immune system with the medication your doctor prescribes.\n\nGood luck with your treatment, and visit http://www.arthritis.org for more info, and a discussion board where you can get lots of feedback and support.

I think  green tea ,berries and fruits having red colour /anthocyanes/
No, absolutely!\nOtherwise we all should have problem or be impotent even!\nOn the contrary, scientists says that a regular sexual life (mastu*bation too) helps the reproductive system to keep healthy, increasing the performance (libido) too.\nSomebody even plays more time in a day and there’s no correlation with impotency or erection.\nSo, don’t worry for that, while you only ought to care to don’t become too much addicted.\nMastu*bation is a normal event, and with the age and stable relation should decrease till vanish.\nOKAY?
Ideally away from meals. If you're really thirsty, have a big glass of water about 15-20 minutes before eating, and then another one after. During your day, you should drink half your weight in oz of water, it helps a lot with the diet. Good luck!
you're not doing it right.
Lana, I don't know if you are religious or not but speaking to a priest or a minister could be help-full. I'm not religious myself, but I know these are good and caring people and have access to many resources. Please don't do anything to hurt you self, I'm sure there are people that love you and it would hurt them as well.\n\nGood Luck

Relax.  Occasionally monitoring via echocardiogram would be appropriate - no more frequently than 1 per year, if that.  Also if you have more symptoms - new shortness of breath with activity, chest pain, etc, then have it looked into.  Other than that try to work out strategies to help dissipate the anxiety - like vigorous physical exercise.
No.  And stretching should not make your muscles worse unless you are doing it wrong.\nIt would be best if you could find a trainer to go over stretching with you, or get a exercise CD that covers stretching well.\nPosture is important, stretch only until you feel resistance, not pain, and NEVER BOUNCE.  Hold the stretched position for a count of 30, unless pain starts, then release and try later with less extension.

Usually these durgs kick in, generally speaking, within 4-6 weeks or even earlier. Alternative drug should be considered if desired effect hasnt been obtained from  Luvox (Fluvoxamine) after 12 weeks of starting therapy, and it is 4-6 weeks in case of Lithium. Effectiveness of drugs also depend on the dose. It is unlikely for a drug to show any effect if the dose is suboptimal. However, u should consult the prescriber for dose adjustment or other options if you think u have been taking them for long enough. Hope it helps.
because you have filled your stomach with water and it is stecthed
I recommend the herbs Brahmi, Ginseng, Gingko Biloba, Blue Cohosh, Anise.\nDrink plenty of water and eat a good balanced diet. There is evidence to show that increasing fish and fish oils in the diet greatly improve memory also. Vitamin B Complex and an amino acid complex help greatly also. Try to get your protein from nuts, grains, legumes, brewer's yeast, brown rice, millet, nuts, soy, instead of red meats.\n\nAvoid refined sugary and fatty foods, these damage the brain. Get plenty of rest and sleep, at least the recommended 8 hours.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nCraig - Naturopath.
A few shots of Scotch whiskey.  Stops the pain and makes you feel happy.
according to my eye doctor the answer is no. they do focus your vision so it will seem better sometimes but there is no long term effect.
When you're in water, aka a bathtub, or in a pool, your body senses water, so your cervix closes up making blood not come out anymore.  The reason why people wear tampons when they go swimming isn't because of the actual time in the water, but when you get out of the water, you'd have to make a mad dash to the bathroom because your body responds quickly to you not being in water.  I'm guessing while you're in the shower it's the same way.  I've also noticed that while I shower and I don't have my period it doesn't seem to drip.

I have had several of these, unfortunately. They put you under so you don't feel a thing. However, you will be uncomfortable for a few days afterward. I had mine on a Friday and was back at work Monday (and took it easy over the weekend; no heavy lifting). \n\nThe Monday after was still tender; but Tuesday I felt fine. Everyone's body is different. I hope you don't have much pain. I only had the feeling of bad cramps. \n\nD&C's are also done to help reduce heavy menstrual bleeding and to check for endometrial cancer as well.\n\nI hope all goes well for you. Best wishes.
have sex!
"Yes.  Anytime you have unprotected sex, you run the risk of getting pregnant.  Unless your periods are ""textbook"" and are regular like clockwork, you can ovulate at any time.  ""Textbook"" cycles work like this:  The first day of your period is Day 1 of your cycle.  You are most fertile Day 14 thru 21.  So if your period started on, for example the 1st, then you would be on day 11 of your cycle when you had sex.  If you ovulated 3 days early, it would be possible to get pregnant. In all my experience working OB/GYN I would say to NEVER NEVER have unprotected sex unless you want to get pregnant."
"You should eat a balanced diet according to the Food Guide Pyramid.  Your system does not need any ""cleansing"" other than that."
About the same as being hit by a car.
Check out NAMI you might even have one in your area they are a great resource for books, tapes, support groups also.
From personal experience, I started stretching my neck back a few times a day & noticed that my double-chin had gone away within a month or 2. I'm not overweight, but still had the double chin until I started stretching my neck muscles on a daily basis.

"Thanks for being such a good friend to her....  There really isn't anything you can tell her to make her believe she isn't fat.  She has to find it out for herself.  I have been a ""big girl"" since I hit junior high.  No matter what others tell you, you have to decide to believe in yourself.  It took me many years to accept my body and be happy. ( I'm omly a sz 14 too!)  Let me tell you girls, someday life will be about more than who likes you or if someone thinks you are fat.  It sounds like she has a real friend in you, someone who sees all the really wonderful things about her.  That is what will get you both through all the trials in your life.  In the mean time, just be her friend best you can.  If she is thinking about changing her diet and exercise make sure she sees her doctor first.  I don't want to seem ""preachy"", but I hope she knows God made her just the way she is supposed to be."
Do a variety of hip adduction exercises (movements that bring your leg sideways across your body). You can do this by squeezing a stability ball between your legs. You can use a multi-hip machine or hip adduction machine at the gym. You can also use a resistance band; connect one end securely around an object, such as the leg of a bed. Connect the other end around your ankle. Stand with your side to the place where the resistance band is connected and with the ankle that has the resistance closer to the wall (other foot out). Stand far enough from the wall so that there is some resistance to moving your foot. Now slowly bring your foot with the resistance band forward and across in front of your other leg (so your legs are crossed) and bring it back to regular standing position. Use the wall/bed/furniture for balance.

Because people can be very ignorant about certain things, and very closed- minded.  Being overweight can be caused by many things, but even unfortunately news stories you hear, all they talk about is people being overweight because of overeating- they don't mention those of us who are overweight because of other reasons. I am the same way myself- not overweight by choice, and no medical problems except being overweight, and exercise does nothing for my weight at all.  I eat no junk food and don't overeat at all but I just have a sluggish metabolism.
I would suggest either of these two products\nGigi Brazilian Bikini Wax Microwave Kit ($14.95) or\nSurgi-Cream Bikini & Leg Hair Remover ($5.95).\n\nThe website has some other products that would work as well, I just prefer either of the two I mentioned. And they aren't too expensive. You can buy from the website or in local stores like CVS, riteaid, etc.
She should go to her gynecologist right away. Some yeast infections need extra strength medication only a doctor can prescribe and she should have tests done because it may not be just a yeast infection. Is she taking antibiotics? This can bring on  a yeast infection. Also, a home remedy that my friend swears by is a plain yogurt douche. My friend says that rubbing it on the irritated skin, soothes it too. She should wear loose clothing and cotton panties. Yeast infections can occur due to stress. Make sure she is not too stressed.

You should have that check out by an ultrasound. When you press on the lump does it hurt?  How big would you estimate the lump is?  How long have you had it?  And does it hurt when you swallow?\nSome lumps are benign, but some may be cancerous.  If you have a swollen neck, you might have thyroid hormone problems.  Either way (lump or swollen gland), it should be treated as a serious problem.\nI had felt 2 lumps in my neck.  I had it checked out with an ultrasound.  It was benign, but it was caused from pimple/acne drainage.  The thyroid and lympatic system are all very sensitive areas for women.\nPlease have it checked by a physician.  You don't want it to grow to be a bigger problem.
It is probably a harmless osteochondroma. An MRI can tell this, but also rule out a life and limb threatening osteosarcoma - this cancer can be deadly. Even though you are probably fine you need to follow through with the MRI as soon as possible. Get it rescheduled!
Yes it is a disability. In fact the military considers it a disability also, giving retires  a precentage of their retirement tax free. You have to have severe high blood pressure, and complications that prohibit you from being able to do normal life activities. You can look up the A.D.A (americans with disabilities act) and read up on additional information.

You can't live that long without food, let alone water. so you would die. Just remember to Decrease food intake, Increase activity/exercise and lots of water... When you starve your body of nutrition your body will start to slow your metabolism down to reserve and store nutrients for later. Then if you don't use that nutrients stored, it turns to fat. So keep moving... exercise increases metabolism, eating CERTAIN foods can increase your metabolism. FYI: Just 3% below average hydration/water in your body can cause your metabolism to slow down. Drink lots of water.  I hope this helps, remember dramatic change in diet can make your skin breakout, menestral cycle abnormal, and make your hair more brittle. Take care of yourself the rightway and you'll look healthier.

Consult your nearest naturopath or herbalist for some natural remedies. There are many that are as good or better than prescription medication. Most have no side effects and can be taken with her heart medication. This will need to be seen to by the therapist though to ensure no contraindications. The herbalist will most probably make her up one on the spot.\n\nI have treated many people with a great deal of success with herbal medicines.\n\nCraig - Naturopath.
It's very very difficult to lose weight while taking prednisone, and even after you stop taking it, you might find the pounds hard to lose. \n\nThat said, I've been on prednisone many times over the years, and gained a LOT of weight from it. I'm still taking pred, actually, am on a maintenance dose of 5mg/day, and have been on it non-stop for about 5 years now. (I was started at 60mg/day and slowly tapered down.)  Once I was tapered down to 10mg/day, I was able to start losing weight with the South Beach Diet. It's a very sensible diet, high in complex carbs (veggies, fruits, whole grains) and proteins. Combine it with exercise for best results. In just over 2 years, I've lost about 60 pounds.
consider waxing.. it dont grow the next day compare to shaving. plus the hair grows finer.
Several pounds a day? Sorry honey, aint gonna happen. The HEALTHY rate to lose pounds is about 2 a week. Weightloss isn't to be rushed or you will most likely fail. Invest in a gym pass, hire a trainer and a nutritionist who will give you a strict diet.

I don't think you can be born without it. It could be life threatening because that's where blood cells mature and it also secretes hormones.\nHowever, it could be surgically removed. In that case, you would have to take supplements.

3 Pounds?  That's a lot.  And to lose that much that quickly isn't healthy.\n\nBut I'm still gonig to answer your question...\n\nDrink a LOT of water, exercise (cardio... no weights... you don't want to gain muscle mass), don't eat anything.\n\nLike I said, it's not healthy.  Looks like you should've started the diet a little earlier in the week.  Regardless, there's my opinion.
Check the medicine cabinet. You put it there before, remember?\nDon't forget to pick up the girls from dance class. I'll be late coming home from work. Lasagna is in the fridge. Just warm it up.
"There are actually quite a few, so the easiest thing to do is to cut and paste from Medlineplus (the NIH's website).  HGH should never be taken without the supervision of a physician.\n\nSide Effects of This Medicine\n\nLeukemia has been reported in a few patients after treatment with growth hormone. However, it is not definitely known whether the leukemia was caused by the growth hormone. Leukemia has also been reported in patients whose bodies do not make enough growth hormone and who have not yet been treated with man-made growth hormone. However, discuss this possible effect with your doctor.\n\nIf growth hormone is given to children or adults with normal growth, who do not need growth hormone, serious unwanted effects may occur because levels in the body become too high. These effects include the development of diabetes; abnormal growth of bones and internal organs such as the heart, kidneys, and liver; atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries); and hypertension (high blood pressure).\n\nAlong with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention. Check with your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur:\n\no More common: Abnormal or decreased touch sensation;  blurred vision;  burning, crawling, itching, numbness, prickling, ""pins and needles"", or tingling feelings;  dizziness;  ear infection or other ear problems (in patients with Turner's syndrome);  nervousness;  pounding in the ears;  severe headache ;  slow or fast heartbeat \n\no Less common: Chest pain \n\no Rare: Abdominal pain or bloating;  changes in vision;  depression of skin at place of injection ;  headache;  limp;  nausea and vomiting;  pain and swelling at place of injection;  pain in hip or knee;  skin rash or itching \n\nOther side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. However, check with your doctor if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome:\n\no More common: Back pain;  chills;  cough or cough producing mucus;  constipation ;  depressed mood;  diarrhea ;  difficulty in breathing;  difficulty in moving;  dizziness;  dry skin and hair;  ear congestion;  feeling cold;  fever;  general feeling of discomfort or illness;  hair loss;  hoarseness or husky voice;  loss of appetite ;  loss of voice;  runny nose ;  shivering;  shortness of breath;  sore throat;  slowed heartbeat;  sneezing;  stuffy nose;  sweating;  swollen joints;  tightness in chest;  trouble sleeping;  weight gain;  wheezing \n\no Less common or rare: Carpal tunnel syndrome;  discouragement ;  enlargement of breasts;  feeling sad or empty;  increased growth of birthmarks ;  irritability;  joint pain ;  loss of interest or pleasure;  muscle pain, cramps, or stiffness;  skeletal pain ;  sleepiness;  swelling of hands, feet, or lower legs;  trouble concentrating ;  unable to sleep;  unusual tiredness or weakness"
Better than average \n\naverage is usually set to 100 and standard deviation around 16 \n\nso you would be in the top 40% of people \n\nan IQ of 124 would generally get you through an undergraduate degree at an average college\n\nmasters degree would  normally require about 132 or more\n\nremember though IQ  aint everything - better to have a nice mix of EQ (emotional intelligence) and BQ (body intelligence - ability to move etc) than just a real high IQ
It's not a rash...I get it too in all of those conditions plus when I'm excited or drinking.  My sister also gets it.  I think it is genetic.  She had to wear a high necked wedding gown so it wouldn't show if she got nervous. Some people just blush more obviously than others.  I really don't think there's anything you can do.
Join the group sweetie!...Literally you should try to find a support group.  IF you can afford weight watchers, it's a great weight loss group.  (It's like $11.00 a week).  Talk to a Dr. about depression!!!
Yes its very normal.  You are on your third month of the pill and your body IS still getting used to it.  Usually after the third month there are no more problems with the spotting and cramps before the period.  Some birth control even reduces your menstrual pain drastically  after the 3rd month.
If she's making sure each of them wears a condom every single time, then it reduces the risk of contracting an STD.\n\nIs it ethically OK?  Only if she's honest about what she's doing, and she's doing it because she's trying to fulfill a sexual need, not an emotional one.
muscle contraction.............. avoid it as much as possible.if symptoms persists consult your girlfriend
sadness and emotional pain can cause alot of pains throughout your body. you may need to go to a doctor to check your pain out wheather it is caused from stress or not. try and cheer up, and take care of your body! :)
some put 'em for entertainment and some r mentally frustrated to put up such stupid questions!!:-L
The most healthy way is to start doing regular, anaerobic excercise (i.e. Weight training) while taking those high calory protein drink things.
well the best way to loose wait its either like some of my friends have rapped them selves in bubble rap and gone into a sona or put on 3-4 sweat suits and go jogging i know its not healthy but if u do it once it aint that bad and then after most of ur body fat is gone you will be pure muscle and will be eaiser to gain muscle so just go to a gym or reccenter and dont be scared people are gonna make fun of you i dont think ive ever see some one get made fun of if you want a good rip go for about 45min to a hour a day but it you want to look like the guys in bloodsport like jean claude van dame then go for 3 hours youll notice muscel difference in about 2 weeks to a month\nalso never do same parts for 2 days in a row like first day do upper body (benching,curling,ect..) then day 2 do lower body and ab (crunches, leg press,ect..) then after day 2 go back to day 1 also you could always pick up a martial art like taekwondo (the way of the hand and the foot) or something else and please dont do steroids they will screw you up and you can get big chunks of muscle in weird blaces (ive seen a muscles the size of a leg muscle on a guys ab it looked like a big boil)

Just got over the worst case. The doctor gave me some type of 6 day packet of steroid medicine. Worked like a charm. It was terrible after 2-1/2 weeks, still spreading & with 4 days, no problem. He said calamine lotion was useless but the Bentdral extra strength would help with itching - not enough for me. The steroids did the job.
yeah if you want to look like a freak, and set off metal detectors at airports. go for it!
I would slowly decrease your sleeping hours so that your body doesn't feel deprived. You only need eight to function well. I would cut off maybe 15 minutes of sleep a night until you are down to eight. Do you actually sleep for ten full hours each night or are you including the time it takes you to fall asleep and the time it takes for you to get out of bed when the alarm goes off in the morning? Slepping pills like Lunesta are made to get you to sleep for eight hours only. If you can't do it naturally, I would think about using sleep aides that pretty much wake you up after your body has slept for eight hours.
yes
it may be an abnormality in your autonomous nervous system. You must consult with a neurologist and a vascular surgeon.
Of course NOT...That is plain old silly. Your friend needs to get better info before he/she spews forth nonsense.
Hello:\nThis is in response to the question you posted about curing hemorrhoids.\nActually, there is really no cure for them, except maybe for surgery where they basically take a rubber band and place it around the lesion until it dies and falls off but there are other forms of surgery as well.\nAS I said, there is really no cure but there a many things you can do to either prevent recurrence or the amount of time between exacerbations.\nProbably the most important is increasing the amount of fiber in your diet. If you are like most Americans, I diet is horrendous and we dont get nearly the amount of fiber we need. You can supplement with either Konsyl-D, Benefiber, Metamucil (I find personally that benefiber is the best because it doesnt have a bad taste and it doesnt turn into a gelatinous material that you have to force down.\nOther things that can exacerbate hemorrhoids are heavy lifting and sitting too long without getting up and walking around. Especially on airplanes or long car trips. The other thing that is a must is lots and lots of water at least eight glasses of water per day minimum.\nI dont know what kind of hemorrhoids you have. There are actually two forms: internal and external. The external are the ones you can actually see hanging out and are very painful, itchy and down right aggravating. Then the internal ones which are completely painless and tend to bleed more. Most of the time people dont even know they have internal hemorrhoids until they go to their doctors complaining of blood in their stool, then a colonscopy is done and thats when they find them.\nTry as best as you can to keep from getting constipated. The pushing and straining you do can worsen hemorrhoids. That is where the plenty of water and fiber come into play.\nAny food that is high in fiber will help. Bran, oats, wheat germ, celery, corn (yes even popcorn without the butter and salt of course).\nI hope this helped you with your question. it was my pleasure to answer it for you.\nWarren Shaffer, M.D.
Yes... smell of amonia is normal but unless someone has been putting ground up matches in your beer i think you might have a problem.
Thats funny... \n\nno, it's a nervous or boredom thing, has nothing to do with sexual desire.
run alot.use a treadmill
no more often than every other day. A good workout is to alternate an upper body workout with a lower body work for six days and then rest on the seventh.
Mine too.  Triglycerides are the chemical form in which most fat exists in food as well as in the body. They're also present in blood plasma and, in association with cholesterol, form the plasma lipids. \n\nTriglycerides in plasma are derived from fats eaten in foods or made in the body from other energy sources like carbohydrates. Calories ingested in a meal and not used immediately by tissues are converted to triglycerides and transported to fat cells to be stored. Hormones regulate the release of triglycerides from fat tissue so they meet the body's needs for energy between meals.\n\nHow is an excess of triglycerides harmful?\n\nExcess triglycerides in plasma is called hypertriglyceridemia. It's linked to the occurrence of coronary artery disease in some people. Elevated triglycerides may be a consequence of other disease, such as untreated diabetes mellitus. Like cholesterol, increases in triglyceride levels can be detected by plasma measurements. These measurements should be made after an overnight food and alcohol fast.

Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that causes stiffness and pain in the joints. Osteoarthritis involves growth of bone spurs and degeneration of cartilage at a joint. It is very common in adults older than 45 and can cause joint pain.\n\nJoint pain may also be caused by bursitis (inflammation of the bursae). The bursae are fluid-filled sacs that cushion and pad bony prominences, allowing muscles and tendons to move freely over the bone.\n\nCommon Causes  \n\nUnusual exertion or overuse, including strains or sprains \nInjury, including fracture \nGout (especially found in the big toe) \nOsteoarthritis \nSeptic arthritis \nTendonitis \nBursitis \nInfectious diseases, including \nInfluenza \nMeasles (rubeola) \nRheumatic fever \nEpstein-Barr viral syndrome \nHepatitis \nMumps \nRubella (German measles) \nVaricella (chickenpox) \nChondromalacia patellae \nOsteomyelitis \nAutoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus

There are no cold packs or ice packs that I know of that are at temperatures above freezing.  36 degrees F is just a few degrees above freezing.  The mopst important thing is that you do not freeze the Byetta.  You could put the in an insulated constainer with cold packs but make sure there is separation between the medication and the ice packs.  You need to inulate the medication so that it does not freeze.  Ideally you would get a device that plugs into the cigarette lighter in the car that has a controlled temperature at refridgerator levels.  They make them in many shapes and sizes and are getting cheaper.  But if you have to use ice and an ice chest just make sure u separate the ice form the medicine to prevent freezing.
I would say fluoride toothpaste is much more effective in the long run than bicarbonate. Fluoride has the ability to be incorporated into your enamel to make it even harder and less prone to caries. It also has the ability to help remineralize incipient caries. Another factor that makes fluoride a good choice is its antiseptic properties vs. bacteria. Fluoride will diffuse into bacterial cells and inhibit enolase, a protein used by bacteria to breakdown glucose into energy. Without a way to metabolize fuel, the bacteria will die.\n\nFluorinated water is usually in concentrations of about 1 part per million (ppm), which is great for children who still have developing teeth. Children can drink this low level of fluoride and some will be used to help form teeth. Studies have shown however that systemic fluoride does very little to prevent tooth decay in adults because our teeth have stopped developing. Topical fluoride treatment is much more effective for adult teeth and a typical fluoride toothpaste has about 1000 ppm.\n\nBicarbonate toothpastes are great for neutralizing the decay-causing acid secreted by the bacteria in your mouth. The problem is they only work while the toothpaste is in your mouth. There are no lasting effects and as soon you eat again, just as much acid will form. Unless you are willing to brush immediately after every time you eat, it won't likely serve as a great a benefit as fluoride.
"I'm no doctor, but I am a 21 year old college student, and I know a thing or two about this from learning about it in classes and from past girlfriends. Every girl is born with a hymen, more commonly called a cherry, hence the ""popping"" of the cherry. It is a blood filled membrane located on the entrance of the vagina. Many girls experience cherry popping while doing things other than having sex, for instance rigorous physical activity or from using tampons. However, if you have never experienced this, you will more than likely experience it during sex. Don't worry, it's normal. Funny story, some of one of my ex-girlfriends friends used to call me a cherry picker after I fingered my girlfriend and her cherry popped. Anyways, when you're having sex I guess it hurts like hell the first time. Your vagina has to stretch out a lot, unless your banging some guy with a pencil dick. if you've ever stuck three or four fingers up our crotch you would know what a penis would feel like. Anyways, i've heard from a couple other chicks that it hurts like shit, but after you've had sex a couple times it goes from pain to pleasure. Its not gonna feel good the first time, but dont worry about banging guys, just get used to it quickly."
If you are concerned with this, and your family doc cannot answer your question, perhaps it is time to see that heart specialist.
It sure is. Cycling for 20 miles every other day ( Id drop dead ) is awesome. Your heart rate will be accelerated, that in itself starts a chain reaction of your glucose meant for fuel, being used quickly. When that is depleted, your body will need another source, fat. \n\nIf you want to lose weight and all you are doing is cycling , it should be fine. But if you are looking to really tone your body all over, id try some weights. You are working your legs with cycling. This leaves the rest of you that will not be as toned. So if all over toning is what you are looking for, add some light weights.\n\nDiet. Lean meats and veggies, seeds , nuts this sort of thing will make your weight loss efforts much much quicker. You will also need these lean proteins to re build muscle.

Nausea doesn't usually accompany menopause.  You could be pregnant.  Home pregnancy kit may be in order.
pray to god and search for a religion that will make me go to heaven like Islam
i am a big woman and have never had a problem with men. as a matter of fact it has been my experience whether or not they admit it most men like a bigger woman. just because society today makes it out like if your not skinny or the perfect size then no one will find you attractive. well thats just not true. beauty comes from within. you could be the prettiest woman in the world. but if you no personality or think you are gods gift to the world you wont be very attractive. And as for whether or not someone would be friends with a woman who was large in size. What FRIEND would judge your worth based on your looks. That person would have to be pretty shallow and therefore not worth having as a friend.
You can share utensils - you can share plates and even share food - HIV is not going to be transmitted this way.\n\nYou do not have wash the plates & stuff in extra hot water & antibacterial soap.  Water kills the virus, air kills it, regular soap kills it - anyways - how would you become infected from washing the dishes?  Not at all.\n\nHIV dies as soon as it hits the air.\n\nChemicals in food, natural and not, will kill the virus.\n\nHow likely is it that you'd get their blood in your mouth, and you have a cut or a way for the virus to get in you?  Not likey, right?\n\nHIV is not an airborne disease.  The following fluids do not transmit HIV;\nSaliva, sweat, tears, urine, feces, and vomit.\n\nLighten up and stop worrying.  HIV is not as easy to get as you might think.
try your white pages.there have to be one near you.
it doesn't matter Color , Race if you are a women do self exams each time you get out of the shower you never know . I know they say monthly self exams are good but it doesn't hurt to do it after you take an shower .
My mom (i do too) just drinks vegetable juices (you need juicer machine) 2x daily and avoids meats, milk & milk products, table salt, sugar, etc. and just eats natural foods (fruits included). Under normal conditions her bp is under control (unless she gets upset, of course, etc.) Vegetable juice drink will include the basic mixture -- carrots, cucumber, apple (only fruit can be added for added sweetness), celery. Sometimes you can add fresh spinach to the mix. Green leafy veggies, kale, broccoli (all parts), etc. can be added too. I suggest get the organic ones if you can.

Absolutely!  I bounce off the walls if I have too much candy or sweets.  It's great to eat some sugar before cleaning the house! :)  No fun, though for others around me because I babble like crazy.  I have never outgrown these sugar highs & no, I'm not diabetic.
I would buy a calorie counter book so you can keep it in your bag. Best thing to do is to plan your meals in advance and write down all the low calorie, low fat and low carb foods and menu plan from here. I have put something together that I hope you have use. \n\nIf you want to do this it is for life so you need to totally change your way of eating and exercising. This is not a diet rather than a healthy eating plan for life. So no more talking diet cause it means time limit. \n\nHere are the golden rules: \nInitially cut down to 1200 calories. \nExercise 6 times per week for 1 hours a day. Do three weight sessions and three cardio sessions. No gym involved. \nDon't eat carbs after 4pm, never eat carbs within 2 hours of exercise or within 1 hour of exercise. \nDrink 3 litres of water per day. You can have a green tea at the end of the day. \nLimit your fruit in take to 2 pieces per day. \nNever eat dinner after 6pm.\nAdopt of low GI eating plan this is sustainable for life!\nMake low fat dairy choices \n\nFollow this menu plan as a suggestion: \nBreakfast 7am - 1 cup hot water w lemon\n20 minutes later have a bowel of oats w water (no honey) OR\nfruit salad w low GI soy yogurt\nSnack 10am - pear or apple (both low GI)\nLunch 12.30pm - muligrain sandwich w 50g tuna & salad (no butter)\nSnack 3pm - low GI yogurt OR skim berry smoothie (no honey or banana) plenty of ice, 1/2 cup skim milk & 1/4 cup yogurt\nDinner 5.30pm - 120g grilled lean meat/fish/prawns/tofu patties (not fried) w spinach salad & mixed vegies (no whites, carbs) OR 3 egg white/soy omlette with ham, cheese and tomato\nSnack - 1 scoop of low cal low fat ice cream (if hungry)\n\nExercise is must be intense. Refer to www.bodybuilding.com for your weights routine. Never do weights two consecutive days have a cardio day in between. \n\nCardio needs to include running, go hard up stair wells and cycling. You get the most benefits from exercise when your body is totally fatigued and this is when you see changes. \n\nTo maintain you can increase calories to 1500 and reduce exercise sessions to 3-4 times per week. If weight creeps up again due to holiday period etc.. go back to 1200 cal and 6 sessions again. \n\nGood luck it worked for me it can work for anyone.
stay off it, and ice the thing, it can be anything.. but if it hurts that bad, you know where to go.....
Well it depends on the substance...but here's the link
Definition\n\nYour body needs carbohydrates to keep it going. Carbohydrates, a form of energy, are broken down into a simple sugar called glucose, which every cell in your body needs to survive. Glucose passes from the small intestine into the bloodstream. Cells require the hormone insulin, produced by the pancreas, which allows glucose to pass from the blood into cells. In type 2 diabetes, the body's cells are resistant to the actions of insulin and the pancreas produces too little insulin. Glucose builds up in the blood and spills into the urine. High blood glucose levels cause the health problems, such as heart disease, associated with diabetes.\n\nThis form of diabetes accounts for 90 to 95 percent of all cases in the United States. People with type 2 diabetes usually develop the condition after age 45, and the risk for getting it increases with age. About 18 percent of the U.S. population 65 and older has diabetes. However, the number of children with type 2 diabetes is increasing rapidly along with their rising obesity rates.\n\nPrognosis\n\nDiabetes does not have a cure. However, the disease can be controlled. Treatment includes dietary changes, exercise, weight loss and usually oral medications or insulin injections.
what happened? did you miss payments? why haven't you gone?\n\n   Missing appointments means a longer time in your braces. Just go, and keep them very clean until you get there. \n\n  Don't fret the consequences, just go :)
eat more veggies and drink more water......but your genetics may play a role in how much you can improve
what's the patient's medical history? because it's no use treating the symptoms themselves as it may post side effects that may complicate his current condition.
It may be something that she is eating. You may be allergic to it. Maybe an over the counter drug, or some kind of fish. Does something similar happen to you when you kiss her, or if she goes down on you? It is most likely just something she is taking that is not good for YOU. Not that she is cheating. Have you both had STD tests?
Oh shitt dude. Get some medical attention for that, buddy
Treatment for psoriasis can be divided into 3 basic categories: \n1. topical treatment - Anthralin, Calcipotriene, Salicylic acid, Tazarotene \n2. phototherapy ( artificial ultraviolet light)this is used for people with moderate to severe psoriasis who are not responding to topical treatment \n3. systemic medications/ injection. These are use for pustular psoriasis - Oral retinoids, Biologics, Cyclosporine. http://www.webMD.com
It is hard to say, because things affect everyone differently. I would go for it though. Side effects are rare, and if you dont take it you will be too ill to concentrate anyway. Good luck!
Could be several things. You could be pregnant, or you could just be late. SOmetimes when I am stressed out, I skip my period for that month. Wait and see if you get it in a couple of weeks, otherwise I would check with your doctor if it's really bothering you.
Ask your doctor.  If it is an outer ear problem, he can give you drops that will clear them out in no time.  If it is inner ear, then you really want the doctor to take care of it for you as it could eventually cause damage.

yaz is a birth control pill, for those that do not know.
it sounds like a cry for attention, or that you feel bad on the inside, and have an urge to act it out on yourself on the outside. first off, i'd recommend not cutting. if you really need to do something like that, put your hand into a cup of ice, it's not gonna feel good, but it wont scar or cause permanent damage. second, you need to figure out why you dont feel good about yourself, and address it. what you're doing is a temporary solution to a problem that isnt going away. without going a lot deeper than that, its gonna be hard to get better without talking to a therapist. maybe you should talk to some of your close friends/ family/ guidance counseler about it.
High protein...avoid breads as much as possible, a lot of greens, a lot of water, daily vitamins. Good amount of exercise, and you should be okay. Also, don't completely steer clear of the foods you love, allow yourself a good treat once a week or so, but eat in moderation. Do muscle increasing exercises, muscle burns more calories then fat, so you can burn more calories while doing sedative actions.
It doesn't work that way.  First, thoroughly develop your idea and document it professionally, clearly, and in great detail.\n\nThen, apply for a patent through the US patent office.  If it isn't similar to a product already patented, then they will give you a patent for it.\n\nOnly then should you approach a company.  If your idea has merit, they will buy the patent from you and develop it themselves.
I assume we're talking about chronic stuffiness, right?  If so, I find that, in my personal experience, it's not so much what I eat as it is what I avoid.\n\nIf you were my client, I'd suggest that you keep a food diary for a couple of weeks and see if you spot any patterns.  Common foods that cause stuffiness include refined starches, rice and dairy.  (A plate of spaghetti will do it to me every time!)\n\nBest wishes.
It's probably just some soft tissue damage and a minor contusion. You should be sore for a while, but you should be ok. Just use your motrin and some ice if needed for swelling. Oh and tell your brother to keep his feet away from you ;).
No, that's not normal.  The only time that it would be normal is if you just gave birth.  If I were you I'd go to your local OBGYN & get it checked out.
Here is what you need to do, if you are serious about losing weight and keeping it off. Eat 6 small meals a day about every 4 hours. Here what that will do for you, your metabolism will increase (i.e. Loose weight) and you will have  more engry. If you go on a diet and eat less, your metabolism will slow down and store to fat. That is why diets dont work. Only the size of your fist, carbs (examples:baked potato, pasta, oatmeal, beans, corn, melon, apples, fat free yogurt, whole wheat breads)in one and protien (examples:chicken breast, swordfish, shrimp, turkey breast) in the other. You can also eat vegetables and salads with any meal, they dont have none or little fat). 30min cardo exercise every day. Any of these(examples: walking, jogging, swimming,running, biking, ect), Monday cardo, tues upper body, wed cardo, thurs lower body, fri cardo, sat upper. Sunday eat anything you want and dont exercising, you do this on sunday so your body doesnt go into starvation mode. YOU NEED TO TAKE SUNDAY OFF. If you stilck with this you will have a great body. also drink aleast 8oz of water daily! Stay away from Mcdonals, Wendys, ect because there is nothing good for you on the menu's even the salads are bad (beaon bits, cheeze, dressing, ect) Good Luck :)
"yes, sometimes from changes in the weather so that air pressure changes trigger them and I have to take pain-killers and a sedative to pass out to get away from the pain. Sometimes I get cluster headaches which are worse than migraines.\n\nWhat are cluster headaches?\n\nCluster headaches are severe, one-sided headaches that recur in groups, or ""clusters,"" over a period of weeks to months. While common headaches can be painful, cluster headaches can be debilitating. Cluster headaches are sometimes referred to as ""suicide headaches"" because they are unbearably painful. Although cluster headaches can be temporarily disabling, they do not cause permanent damage.\n\nCluster headaches are relatively rare, and are one of the few types of headaches that affect men more often than women."

lood in stool can be caused by hemorrhoids, anal fissures, polyps, Crohn's Disease, peptic ulcer disease, and diverticulitis. Generally, the closer the bleeding site is to the anus, the blood will be a brighter red. Thus, bleeding from the anus, rectum, and the sigmoid colon tend to be bright red, whereas bleeding from the transverse colon and the right colon (transverse and right colon are several feet away from the anus) tend to be dark red or maroon colored. Stomach ulcers caused by ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin are common causes of upper GI bleeding. A testicular lump can be due to Hernia, Varicocele, Epididymal cyst, Spermatocele, Hydrocele, Tunica albuginea cyst .All other masses of the testicle are to be considered tumor until proven otherwise. A urologist can usually differentiate between the various lesions on physical examination. An ultrasound of the scrotum will generally be done if the diagnosis is not obvious or there is concern about tumor. \nPlease see your doctor to determine what the exact cause may be.
Yoga is union. Yoga is not just physical (Hatha) but complete union, enunciated in its 8 branches, so beautifull by Patanjali.\n\nAnyways, on more practical terms: Yes, yoga, the union is necessary for stress relief, achieving freedom from thoughts.\n\nYoga is union... of what with what? Within is an arrangement since birth: Kundalini (Divine Feminine) and Atma (Spirit) which are separate and need to unite to create the joy and bliss. The fallout of this yoga/union is bliss, relief from all concerns, pains and tensions.\n\nThe Kundalini needs to traverse the path of the central channel before touching the spirit which resides in the physical heart. \n\nOne exercise, a guided meditation I can recommend is by H. H. Shri Mataji and its quite likely that at the end of this short meditation, you'll be quite blissed:\nhttp://www.sahajayoga.com.au/info/experience/default.asp.shtml\n\nGood Day, Mate!
A sore throat is often caused by a nasal drip. My husband's doctor told him to use nasal spray and it helped a great deal. Also Tylenol Sore Throat is wonderful. We use both together
I'm not sure if there are any places that have illustrations, but many sites give descriptions of medications as far as color, numbers, shapes, etc. If you have a pill and don't know it's identity, you should trash it, plain and simple. Unless of course, you found it in your child's (or someone you take care of) belongings, and want to get down to a possible problem. If you want pictures, head to the library or a book store - everyone has The Pill Book - Guide to prescription medications. It has pictures and descriptions for meds. Good luck!

"Read the book ""Body for Life"" by Bill Phillips.  If you already work out, this book is for you.  My wife and I read the book and did the workout routine and eating routine.  She was already small like you and could not lose any more pounds until she did like the book said.  It is a very good book because I personally do not like reading but I read this whole book.  You can purchase the book pretty cheap on Ebay or it is about 25 dollars at your local book store.  The key is the eating part so you really need to look into it.  I know you say that you eat healthy but according to the book (which works) you have to eat 6 times a day.  The book recommends that you use supplemental shakes for meals and they obviously recommend their shakes.  But, you can use any type of health supplement shake.  During the six meals a day, I would usually supplement at least 3 of them with shakes (my wife used Slim Fast shakes as her supplement meals).  Check it out, it is great if you really want to get to your ideal weight."
If there ARE any foods that make your butt bigger I hope I don't come across any of them, I've got enough butt for both of us.  I think exercises could definitely help, but I sure wouldn't eat a lot of fatty foods.  That might make your butt bigger, but it would likely make the rest of you bigger as well (not to mention what it would do to your general physiological health, I don't think you want to clog your arteries or anything like that).  But maybe you need to gain some weight?  Are you too thin?
Take care of yourself hunny especially the vision.  I am an ER nurse I say go to the doctor immediately. Get a full CT done of the head.
Nope but I take Lipitor and eat what I want and smoke like a chimney and still have good numbers on my LDL and HDL!
See a Dr! Duh.
One of the most concerning side effects of amiodorone is pulmonary fibrosis, although hepatotoxicity and arrhythmias (ironically) can also be side effects.  Let me ask you, what are you, or someone else, taking the amiodorone for?  Other than for emergency situations, there are other choices of antiarrhythmics you can take.

There is no way to break up with him without hurting him, but the best thing to do would be being completley honest and straight forward with him. Tell him you want out of the relationship and why. it is kind of like taking a band aid off you can do it slowly and drag it out or you can just rip it off and be done with it.
There is NO diet pill that works.\n\nIf you want to lose weight, then change your diet and eat healthy foods, no fast food, no soda no processed crap. once you have change your eating habits start exercising.\n\nWeight loss is simple, burn more calories than you take in and you will lose weight.
"I know when they rush in sometimes, they may say ""Get me 1 and 5!"" or ""2 and 10""... this means 1 mg. of Ativan (anti-anxiety drug) and 5 mg. of Hadol(antipsychotic drug).  That combo usually knocks 'em out."
It's not just females. More than half of all people (male and female) will have an STD at some point in their lifetime. Each year, one in four teens (M and f) contracts an STD. One in two sexually active persons will contact an STD by age 25. Women are more susceptible to STDs than men, and 60% of females dont know that. All I can say is get tested for STDs if you or your partner have had other partners.
Sure. For example, If you get it on the first and your cycle is 28 days, you'll get it again on the 29th. It's happened to me. Kind of an extra monthly bonus, lol.
"Rather than measure per minute it would be better to measure by game or by frame, or more accurately per ball thrown. The only workout will be getting up picking up your ball and chucking it down the alley. It will depend on how you do it too. An old guy will stand out there by the line, swing his body and let go. A young pro will stand with his heels dangling off the back taking 5 giant steps and grunting louder than a footabll cheerleader caught in a tackle as he hurks it out there at 25 miles an hour. \n\nYou can get someone to give you a table that shows estimates, but that estimate will vary wildly. Are there 5 people on your lane for that hour so they slowed you down, etc. \n\nHere is what I would do to estimate. Its 12 feet from the first dots or 15 feet from the second, those feet I do twice as much workout as normal walking cause I am carrying a 16 pound ball and walking funny. The rest of the feet from the seat to the ball and back I walk normal. I get about 4 strikes per game average so in 10 frames I throw 2 balls 6 times one ball 4 times. \n\nThe walking trips from:\n the seat to the ball 15 ft\n bowl is 12ft for me times 2\n  the end back to the ball 12ft\n  bowl again 12ft times 2\n back to my seat 15ft alley plus 15ft to seat\n\n so either 69ft per strike or 105 ft per spare/open.\n\neach game then is 6*105+4*69= 906ft or about 1/6th a mile\n\nmy treadmill says I burned about 22 calories in a sixth of a mile, so that would be my estimate, 22 calories per game. \n\nIf the game is played with 5 people it will take about 50 minutes so thats about 10 minutes a game. If you are playing alone though you will have to go back to your seat between each frame for these calculations to work.\n\nSo that is about 2.2 calories a minute for me, but I am only active one minute of every 5 during my leaague. If my basal metabolic rate is 2400 calories per day, then I will burn an average of 1.6 calories a minute doing nothing. That average is skewed by the digesting of the food, and actually doing nothing in the bowling alley would be more like 1.2 calories per minute. \n\nSo when I bowl with my league I am burning 1.2 calories 4 of every 5 minutes and 2.2 calories the fifth minute for 150 minutes. I burn 210 calories while bowling, or an average of 1.4 calories per minute.\n\nIf you are there to workout try doing these things to make it a better workout....\n\nSit farther from the alley. The seats up behind the setee area where food and drink is served will get you walking farther.\n\nIf you don't care as much about the bowling as the workout take the whole 15 foot approach, have a high backswing and release the ball with as much velocity as you can. This will burn more.\n\nIf you do care about your bowling then add things like picking the ball up a couple of times, raise it up above your head as part of your ""ritual"" before you bowl, or take it back to your seat every third frame to clean it. This extra heaving around of the ball will take more energy.\n\nYou can also walk down to the other end of the alley when its not your turn to talk with friends there or just check out all the scores and other bowling styles while getting the extra walk. You can even try kegel exercises while in your seat. (yes that was a joke)\n\ngood luck bowling off those pounds!"
In the west, pig is associated with gluttony. Incidentally, all the animals that you quote are not found naturally in Europe or America. So I can imagine that the people who coined that term did not consider those terms. That may explain why?\n\nIts also funny how the same animal gives rise to different opinions amongst folks.\nCalling a person a cow in Europe is highly derogatory. The same opinion in India doesnt hold too derogatory an insuniation, since that person is considered docile/well behaved.\nOwl is considered to be a wise bird in Europe. Indians use owl as an insult! :-)\n\nJust two cents of an Indian who grew up trying to make sense of such abject dichotomy!!
She might need to be on insulin and/or medications to control her Blood Sugar Level (BSL) adequately - its especially so in case of Diabetes in young people. \n\nIt is very important to have strict control of the BSL. Without adequate control, many of the body's organs start getting damaged within a few years- these include the eyes, kidneys, limbs and the nervous system. Eventually the damage may become very severe and it may lead to blindness and the person may need to be on dialysis for life.\n\nBut with a good control over the BSL right from the beginning, a person can lead a virtually normal and healthy life. One may need to bring about a few lifestyle changes such as exercise and diet control too, but doing so ensures a complication free life.\n\nSo make your friend understand this point that although Diabetes has severe complications, with strict BSL control and routine check-ups, one can delay or even prevent most of these complications. Once the damage is done, it cannot be reversed. \n\nSo better to be safe than sorry... get her to visit her doc- he/she will explain in greater detail about this.
some cancers are, some arent. you can reduce risks though by maintaining a healthy weight, staying away from tobacco, eating a diet low in fat and red meats, and staying away from alcohol or drinking it in moderation, and taking reasonable precautions in the sun/not tanning regularly. no matter how hard you try, you cant completely eliminate your risks of cancer but doing what i mentioned can cut your risk in half. dont go crazy though trying to be cancer free.... have some fun in life.
Get a picture, you'll feel better about yourself.
in Eygpt women who were on their period would go to a special tent. They would sit around naked and bleed onto special mats.
Hi there\n\nThe tests showed things were normal, that's a good thing! Have you had an exam at a gynocologist?  You should have an exam and also a pap smear.  The pain on your right side could be from the constipation, straining or possibly a pocket in the intestine.  You need to drink more water and make sure you eat or drink fruits/juices/veggies that will make you go to the bathroom better.  The discomfort in the abdomen may be from not going to the bathroom right.  Try drinking a 12 ounce of cranberry juice a day, that will help you alot to go if your not a veggie eater.  Any fruits or fruit drinks, natural ones, will help too.

there is nothing wrong with having big feet. Besides,no one looks at anyone elses feet.
You're at risk of STDs, but not from HIV. HIV is mainly transmitted because during intercourse, the vaginal lining gets minute splits and cuts in it, and when the penis ejaculates, the mix of fluids is the cause of infection. However, with STDs, it can just be contact and you have it
They can be easily transmitted to other sexual partners.  If they're anal they can lead to cancer of the colon.  Best to remove them early.  They can be frozen off or they have salves than can remove them.
I'm on it now, but if you only have 25 lbs to lose, you don't need it.  It's a serious drug--DRUG--with side effects--including addiction. (I have one friend who is addicted.)  It's NOT for losing 25 lbs.  Were you checked out by a doctor first?  \nI've lost almost 40 lbs since February on it, but I'm morbidly obese. The drug was designed for people like me--not you.\nI wouldn't subject my body to insomnia, headaches, dry eyes, thirst, hot flashes and now withdrawal if I only had to lose 25 lbs.  \nBe careful, that's all I can say.

The two most common food allergies are shellfish, and dairy.  Your friend is allergic.  He should see his doctor, who in turn should refer him to an allergist.  No more eating those foods until he sees the doctor.  Subsequent exposure to allergens can increase the risk of a serious reaction!
This is completely a natural thing that all women have. It if really bothers you as you say try wearing a panty liner when this happens.

Our heart is myogenic. That is it can beat on its own. If you take out your heart and put it in a solution with the right concentration of sodium, potassium and calcium, it can still beat. This is because, there are a group of cells known as the pacemakers in the SAN,AVN and Purkinjie fibres. They auto depolarise and start an electtrical impulse that travels down a certain pathway so that the 2 atria contracts before the 2 ventricles. \n\nHowever the rate of heart beat is controlled by the medulla of the brain. It either speeds up (sympathetic) or slows down (parasympathetic via vagus and glossopharyngeal) depending on the needs of the body.

Do you mean actually having the ambiguous genatalia in adolescence? Or previously having an inter-sex conditions, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen insensitivity?\n\nHaving ambiguous genatalia is very rare, as it is usually corrected at birth. The only example I know of in this area is the case of the Guevedoces, in the dominacan republic. \n\nThese children have XY chromosomes, but because of a genetic mutation their bodies do not produce the hormone dihydrotestosterone, responsible for a male appearance at birth. During puberty their bodies begin to produce testosterone, which causes them to go through a typically male adolescence. \n\nWhat they had assumed was a clitoris begins to grow into a penis, their testicles descend, their voices deepen, and their bodies develop a masculine musculature. The most interesting aspect of the guevedoces is that after twelve years of being brought up thinking they were girls, they suddenly develop masculine identities, express sexual desires for women, get married, and raise normal families.  We cannot yet tell whether this dramatic change is due to the biological changes their bodies undergo at this time, or to the different expectations of their peers with respect to their sexual identity, but one thing seems very clear--a person's sexual identity can change fairly easily, even after twelve years of upbringing. Theories about adult sex roles that have recourse exclusively to childhood influences may need to be revised.\n\n\n\nNow, if you are indeed refering to intersex conditions that are rectified, but are wondering about the psychosocial development during adolescence, here's one journal that's quite interesting\n\n•We assessed core gender identity, sexual orientation, and recalled childhood gender role behavior in 16 women and 9 men with CAH and in 15 unaffected female and 10 unaffected male relatives, all between the ages of 18 and 44 years. Women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) recalled significantly more male-typical play behavior as children than did unaffected women, whereas men with and without CAH did not differ. Women with CAH also reported significantly less satisfaction with the female sex of assignment and less heterosexual interest than did unaffected women. Again, men with CAH did not differ significantly from unaffected men in these respects. Our results for women with CAH are consistent with numerous prior reports indicating that girls with CAH show increased male-typical play behavior. They also support the hypotheses that these women show reduced heterosexual interest and reduced satisfaction with the female sex of assignment. Our results for males are consistent with most prior reports that boys with CAH do not show a general alteration in childhood play behavior. In addition, they provide initial evidence that core gender identity and sexual orientation are unaffected in men with CAH. Finally, among women with CAH, we found that recalled male-typical play in childhood correlated with reduced satisfaction with the female gender and reduced heterosexual interest in adulthood. Although prospective studies are needed, these results suggest that those girls with CAH who show the greatest alterations in childhood play behavior may be the most likely to develop a bisexual or homosexual orientation as adults and to be dissatisfied with the female sex of assignment. (Hines et al., 2004)\n\n\nAnd finally, if you are not refering to intersex conditions at all, but instead boys raised as girls, etc because of accidents, here's the classic example:\n\nIn 1972 Money and Ehrhardt reported the case of a 7 month old baby boy - one of a pair of twins - born in 1963 whose penis was removed after an operation for circumcision damaged the child's penis. At 22 months old the child was surgically reassigned as a girl and brought up according to the prevailing view at the time that we are psychosexually neutral at birth. This case entered the

I wonder if you mean Relacore?  I discovered that there is a diet pill by the name of Relacore.  Lots more on that at site below.
I take it for my thyroid also. I have PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrom) which has a lot of different symptoms, hypothyroidism is one of the symptoms. I have a book about PCOS that states that healthy diet and exercise along with weight loss can help control just about everything. In fact most people that change their lifestyle with better eating and exercising can go off of almost any medication. It lowers your blood pressure, makes your body absorb insulin better so a lot of diabetics are able to go off or decrease their meds, people with heart disease improve their chances of not having heart attacks with just 30 minutes of walking a day. I am on the journey to get off my meds. I take levothyroxine, hydrochlorothiazide and birth control (to regulate my periods mostly). It may take a while, but it will work! I feel pretty good on the drug. No side effects I can tell. Good luck!
The same reason most get shivers when someone touches their ears. There are nerve endings that connect to your spine and\n brain and send spacific signals.
sweat by itself has no smell. it is the bacterias that is in your under arm feed on your sweat and produce waste, which is the stink that you smell. so wash  deoderant deodrant wash. and wear cotton clothes.
No, if the cyst is going to rupture it will, regardless of your activity.
I also get a back ache from most chairs causing you to lean forward. I tested about 20 chairs before I found the right one for my computer desk I think alot of it has to do with being able to adjust the height right for you. I think they should make adjustable desks or chairs as everyone is different in height, weight, and posture.
My doctor has told me I am suffering from a rare disease called Answeritis.  It's caused by asking to many questions, sitting in front of a computer for 18-20 hours a day, having a diet that consists of Martini’s, Cheetos, Mountain Dew & Twinkies, not getting much sleep, avoiding the outside world, and not working.  He did give me some good news; apparently he saved 20% on his car insurance from GEICO.
I think so...
First of all, you most likely weren't pregnant.  It is very rare for a woman to have a normal menstrual cycle during pregnancy (though not impossible).  You should go to your doctor and ask for a pregnancy test if you have any doubts.  Depo Provera is changing the way your body works, and you will likely experience some strange effects from it at first.  The first time I took Depo Provera, my period became very heavy and lasted a very long time.  After that, I had no side effects.\n\nDepo Provera uses progesterone to stop your ovulation.  Progesterone is less dangerous to a fetus than estrogen, which can cause abortion, sexual complications, etc in the unborn child.\n\nIf you are pregnant, you will need to consult your OB/GYN and let him or her know that you have received this injection so that tests can be done to ensure the safety and development of your child.\n\nAs for the effects you are having right now, ride them out.  If they don't go away, consult your doctor before the next injection.  You may have to change the form of birth control you are using.
you obviously have an over active imagination. or you might possibly have ADD causing you to not be able to concentrate on what you are doing and there fore making you incapable of remembering whta you did causing your brain to make up something. I suggest you take an ADD test online or go to a docter. medicine can help with this.
If you find yourself in love with someone who does not love you, be gentle with yourself. There is nothing wrong with you. Love just didn't choose to rest in the other person's heart. \n  \nIf you find someone else in love with you and you don't love him/her, feel honored that love came and called at your door, but gently refuse the gift you cannot return, do not take advantage, do not cause pain. \n  \nHow you deal with love is how you deal with you, and all our hearts feel the same pains and joys, even if our lives and ways are different. \n  \nIf you fall in love with another, and he/she falls in love with you, and then love chooses to leave, do not try to reclaim it or to assess blame, let it go. There is a reason and there is a meaning. You will know in time . \n  \nRemember that you don't choose love. Love chooses you. All you can really do is accept it for all its mystery when it comes into your life. Feel the way it fills you to overflowing, then reach out and give it away. \n  \nGive it back to the person who brought it alive in you. Give it to others who deem it poor in spirit. Give it to the world around you in anyway you can. There is where many lovers go wrong. Having been so long without love, they understand love only as a need. They see their hearts as empty places that will be filled by love, and they begin to look at love as something that flows to them rather than from them. \n  \nThe first blush of new love is filled to overflowing, but as their love cools, they revert to seeing their love as need. They cease to be someone who generates love and instead become someone who seeks love. \n  \nThey forget that the secret of love is that it is a gift, and that it can be made to grow only by giving it away. \n  \nRemember this, and keep it to your heart. Love has its own time, its own seasons, and its own reason for coming and going. You cannot bribe it or coerce it, or reason it into saying. You can only embrace it when it arrives and give it away when it comes to you. But if it chooses to leave from your heart or from the heart of your lover, there is nothing you can do and there is nothing you should do. \n  \nLove always has been and always will be a mystery. Be glad that it came to live for a moment in your life......
Interferon and ribavirin are two drugs licensed for the treatment of persons with chronic hepatitis C.  \nIn therapeutic doses, interferon can be hard to tolerate because of the side-effects, with flu-like symptoms such as fatigue, headache and aches and, less regularly, low thyroid activity, arthritis, low platelet count and depression which can attain suicidal proportions.

Um, yes, women do have a urethra.  If a woman doesn't have one, there is something major wrong.\n\nUrethra: The transport tube leading from the bladder to discharge urine outside the body. In males, the urethra travels through the penis, and carries semen as well as urine. In females, the urethra is shorter than in the male and emerges above the vaginal opening.\n\nEdit: About the previous post regarding anti-biotics & yeast infections, you can take pro-biotics while on anti-biotics to prevent that from happening.

"Well, a good therapist can help you find the self-confidence that you need but if you just can't bring yourself to see a professional, try volunteering.  I'm sure you have a number of opportunities in your area--visiting nursing homes, working in a shelter, etc.  It's amazing what a sense of purpose you can get by donating just a few hours a week to something like that.\n\nAre you surrounded by people who keep you down or cause you to question yourself?  Distance yourself from them.  This can be hard--especially if we're talking about your parents but sometimes you just need to say ""You know, I'm not going to listen to any more of that"" and walk away.\n\nGood Luck!"
Meditation which is mentioned by you is reaching an advancedv stage where you go into depth . It needs personal supervision.\nSince you go into some sort of autosuggestion it is more than sound sleep. \nI do it and enjoy it but I would not venture to teach you over YAHOO ANSERS. Because initiation has to be thro some GURU(Master) It is worth the money you spend\nOr study books on it Watch any Video clippins.Practise PRANAYAMA DEEP BREATHING EXERCISES Then go in for Meditation.
optimum nutrition 100% whey is probably the most popular.\nbesides just the protein, it has a bunch of other stuff like BCAAs.  the taste is pretty good for a whey protein that is almost all protein (almost no sugar).\n\ncheck out bodybuilding.com...they got a list of all the top whey proteins.\n\nyou should get about 1g of protein for every pound u weigh.  you shouldn't get all your protein from protein shakes tho.    1 serving of optimum nutrition whey has 24g of protein...so u do the math.
There is no doubt that ecstasy feels good, but there is a price to pay. I work with drug addicts and they suffer from damaged immune systems, chills, fevers for no reason, depression, anxiety, infections, weight loss, memory loss, blurred vision because ecstasy stretches the eye muscles when they over-react to the drug, etc. Even 6 years after they stopped taking the drugs they experience these symptoms. Ecstasy messes your hormones around and damages the neurons in the brain and throws your brain chemicals out of balance. If you know of anyone who is suffering from these symptoms after using drugs, L-tyrosine capsules (a natural amino acid) helps to increase Dopamine in the brain (a natural chemical to help with depression and memory). It takes about 2 weeks to start working. It might help (but first speak to a doctor before taking supplements). People who used drugs lose their sharp thinking and don't feel the same as they did before they took it. I would stay away from drugs if you want to live a normal and fulfilling life and not suffer from mental/health problems later in life.

You may have something completely different, so get it checked out first. \n\nDuring pregnancy, your abdominal muscles ""split"" and move sideways to accomodate the baby. after pregnancy these muscles are very weak, and may take a while to move back to their proper position. They may even not be able to do their job in keeping your intestines where they belong!

Yes, although rare, it does happen.
Pilates is a great way to tone and strengthen the abs.  It is not just the in thing right now but has a lot of scientific basis.\n\nThe easiest way to learn is to go to a class a couple of times to learn the correct positions and modifications according to your RA so you can safely perform them.  Don't start off with an exercise tape - I have had too many patients who tried to learn this way and ended up injuring themselves.\n\nI am a physical therapist who incorporates Pilates into my rehab as appropriate.  If you can find someone similar in your area, it would be well worth while.  They can then understand your disease better and advise you accordingly.\n\nGood luck!

It has nothing to do with masterbating.  It might be because you are going to be a candidate for viagra.  You should go see a doctor and maybe a psycologist.  From the way you phrase your question I guess you are very young...so this should not be a problem.  GO SEE A DOCTOR!!!

I've had this same feeling all my life.  It used to bother me for a very long time, but I tend to be one who marches to the beat of his own drum.  We are all different, but sometimes some feel more differently than others.  Unless someone points this out to us, then we should simply be ourselves and we'll find that we attract all kinds of people.\n\nYou and I may feel like we never belong, but no one has ever pointed that out to me - that I don't belong.\nPerhaps we just feel inferior to others - perhaps it is our low self esteem, and maybe we just fear that we never belong.\n\nThe feelings never changed for me...I still feel differently from others - but is that truly a bad thing? I think not.  I try to be social and do things with people, and I am content and happy - that is what you should strive for - to be content and happy.\n\nGood Luck!
myotatic reflex\nn.\nTonic contraction of the muscles in response to a stretching force, due to stimulation of muscle proprioceptors. Also called deep tendon reflex, stretch reflex.
I love girls who sees things differently... Girls who know where they stand and what to do in times of hardships and challenges. I love girls who are strong willed and with deep sense of perspective of life... Girls like that are rare nowadays...
When I used to smoke and worked before I had kids and quit, I used to go outside first thing in the morning--I got there a little early for this, had three cigarettes, then worked all day with no cigarette break. Then I'd smoke on the way home. It was hard the first week, but amazingly my body adjusted to it pretty quickly, and it ultimately was the biggest help when I quit b/c I knew how much of the smoking was mental not physical craving. As long as I was busy I wasn't thinking of needing a cigarette.\n\nAfter the first three, though, I used a simple but pretty effective method to de-stink myself: Calgon body spray. They come in a WIDE variety of scents and are kind of like Febreze for the body, cleansing your skin and even your hair if you put it on your brush and then brush your hair. My favorite was the Morning Glory scent. They are cheap and plentiful.\n\nActually, Febreze is also a solution since it doesn't stain clothes and really does eliminate, not just cover up odors.
With all these answers, I am surprised no one has mentioned Aloe Vera. It is simply the best!\n\nCertainly taking antacids will only make the condition worse and baking soda is not much better.\n\nJust as Aloe Vera helps heal outside skin conditions, it also soothes your inside skin conditions such as heartburn. I recommend about three ounces in a glass and you should feel relief within about ten minute.\n\nUnlike antacids, Aloe Vera also has a side benefit of helping alkalizing your system. If you are familiar with the PH balancing Alkaline Diet, you will see that Aloe Vera as most herbs is a very alkalizing food. Over time eating alkalizing foods will reduce your acidity.\n\nHope this helps.
I like a woman with a big nose. I find it attractive.\nI'm not kidding. Those perky cutsy noses that you can fit in a bottle cap just gives me the creeps.
constipation!  cannot poop!!!
Your blood just has to take the poisons away. Add heat. That  is all you can do.
Stop using hair spray gels etc. if you use them. Hair-spray and gels clog the hair pores and can cause balding. See a dermatologist.
I believe that California and Oregon are the only states to have passed medical marijuana laws.  These laws conflict with federal laws and various cases are currently working through the courts to determine if the legality of marijuana is a states rights issue.
Go see your Doctor! It's not healthy to poo all the time!
many people poop alot. It all depends on your body and your diet. If you are concerned talk to your doctor.
there are numerous possibilities \n\nyou may have slightly pulled one of the upper back muscles such as the trapezius that run up and into the neck - if you posture is slightly off when you load this can happen \n\nice the area, use ibuprofen and lay off for a day or two\n\nyou may have slightly irritated a disc in your neck  same as above for treatment but if it persists or you have any pins and needles in your shoulders, arms or your neck mobility is reduced seek medical attention\n\nI am assuming you squat with a bar on your neck? When you squat try and have the bar back and down slightly off your neck so the weight distributes across the shoulders - have your arm grip wide to keep it stabilised and make sure or learn to squat with perfect form - head up not down - your upper back should be locked steady - the only rotation is through pelvis, hips and legs \n\nif you still have a problem try to learn to front squat or do one leg squats with dumbells
I am a scientist and all I can say is :\ndaily consumption of artificial food will increase your chances.
technically yes, but this can be dangerous because excessive weight loss due to sweating alone can make you dehydrated which can cause a lot of health complications because with sweat you lose essential body salts also - minor problems can be cramps, fainting, weakness and major can be a toll on your kidney and your beauty if your skin sags. \nSweating during normal workouts is alright but then a target weight loss of more than 2 kgs per week in unsupervised condition is dangerous.\nSo as a matter of precaution, no matter how quickly you want to lose weight don't ever wear a plastic body suit.
"I too have been diagnosed as bi-polar.  I would strongly suggest you stay on the med. unless your Dr. tells you otherwise.  I have gone the same rout as you are suggesting and it always leads to getting ""deeper in the hole"".\n\nAll His best,\n\nJimmy"
it depends on how it effects you.  i lost a few pounds but not a ton.  i didn't find it very effective.

Look in the phone book. There is an referral institution which specializes in giving that information.
Because when you put it in there, it starts to itch very badly and they move back and forth to rub off that itch.
Well, the whole whitening with gum is all psychological. If it makes you feel better about your smile, then chew it! But if you want whiter and brighter teeth that will last then I suggest Zoom! You can get it in select dental offices, or you can use one of the many products in many superstores!
"I take lithium,effexor, and xanax for depression and bi-polar(I like the cold weather sometimes). If you can get away with no medication, that is your best bet. Every couple of months my meds need ""tweaked"" and the side effects are not worth it. I don't feel as sharp as I use to be. My wife says this is the only way she can tolerate me. If I try to go cold turkey, I get really out of whack and miss like a whole week of work. It is not worth it. If you are dead set on getting on medication, find a doctor you trust and take what he tells you to take.\n\nBTW, I can't believe you got this many responses so quickly!"
No leave it, Just get a stylish cut, ask a hairdresser when your there what is the best cut for your looks.  Hair is allways nice to run fingers thru.
"lol...you don't need a gyno exam till you're either 18 or you've had sex. If you've had sex you need one EVERY 2 years...same as once you've turned 18! No, they don't hurt. There is some minor discomfort but nothing worse than very very very mild period pain. A lot of girls start seeing a gyno when they're 16 or 17 just so they get comfortable with them before their first exam. This makes it a less frightening experience. I think you're friends are as confused as you are, because very few people experience PAIN! At 15 you shouldn't be worrying about this, and in all seriousness, if you're scared of the exam and people seeing ""down there"" I would strongly recommend holding off on having sex for a few years! You need yo be confortable with your own body before you start sharing it around!\n\nAlso, to the person with ovarian cysts, I have these too and there is no ned to go scaring people! These are extremely normal and unless they get to a ridiculous size nothing needs to be done about it. They will break up on their own. The pill will help with this, and will prevent a recurrance. Even if you go to a gyno, they won't detect them (unless they're very large) without ultrasound! This poor girl is only 15, she has no need to go to a gyno quite yet, and she doesn't need you people freaking her out any more!"
Yeah, that is if you don't crawl through your skin from all of that caffeine first.
HIV/AIDS can but NOT ALWAYS have flu like symptoms for 3 days to two weeks upon contracting it.  After that time period, there are none.  However, other diseases easily caught when someone's immune system is compromised are a telltale sign.  They ususally appear in advanced stages of HIV/AIDS.  Caposi's sarcoma, a skin cancer, can appear in lesions on the skin.  Thrush, or a yeast infection in the mouth can appear (looks like a thick white coating on the toungue).  Pneumonia is common.  Diarrhea for lengthy stretches is also common.  Most people have no symptoms until AIDS develops fully, which is why it's important to get tested often so that HIV can be treated with drugs early.
no not me . but what is wrong .you never said what was wrong with you.
Have you had the actual miscarriage yet? It's possible you are still technically pregnant but just having passed the deceased baby through yet. You may need a DNC if it doesn't happen soon.\nIt's interesting that your HCG levels are still rising though, they usually go down considerably pretty much right away.\nI would ask your doctor about this. It's also possible that you have an ectopic pregnancy, which would be why it wouldn't show up in your uterus. \nIf you have further questions and you feel your doctor isn't helping you, I strongly suggest getting a second opinion form a doctor in a different practice or hospital.
i have the same problem....try walking 2000 steps or more a day or walking or running in pace for thirty minutes
Sweetie don't hate yourself. 135 pounds is not heavy. You are beautiful no matter what your weight is. \nNo there are not any creams for cellulite removal or stretch marks. No matter what anyone says, cremes can not help to smooth out skin or help to fix the stretch marks. All that can help the cellulite is doing exercises that will help firm up your legs. Do alot of running and leg squats. Firming up areas where cellulite and stretch marks are, can help them look lighter.
when i was pregnant my husband complained that he had morning sickness...when i had a yeast infection he was convinced that he had that problem.  i had natural child birth and i though he was going to pass out in the delivery room. poor baby :)
"I like the looks of fat people! try this!....\n\nDisclaimer \nThe following section is cobbled together from various readings and research, dealing with my kid's allergies and nutritional difficulties, and my own experiences with refeeding, digestive problems, orthorexia and pregnancy. I did not keep track of all the sources. I do therefore encourage you to take any information you may find in here and look it up yourself so you can make your own decisions and reach your own conclusions. Please keep in mind that I'm not a medical or nutritional professional of any sort.\n\n \nRefeeding \n-or- \nHow To Gain Weight \n\n\n\nThis one seems like a no-brainer, eh? How do you gain weight? You eat. You cannot gain weight without eating... in the exact opposite of losing weight, actually, you cannot gain weight without consuming more calories than you burn off. \n\nThe bigger question, in our weight-loss worshipping world, is why would you want to gain weight? Fact is that sometimes we become too thin, dangerously so, to the point where we begin to suffer all these negative side effects and eventually death. Sometimes gaining weight is a pretty attractive option by comparison. Being at a healthy weight helps every system of our body function better, allows us to heal from damage, and gives us reserves as protection against stress or illness as well. \n\nThe tougher part of weight-gain is how to do it in a healthy manner. Just as rapid weight-loss can be dangerous, so can rapid weight gain. Many EDs who go through rapid recovery end up with too high a bodyfat percentage, too much fat stored around their internal organs, compromised health, and high cholesterol. This is in part because traditional anorexic ""recovery"" diets are aimed at bulking up the patient as quickly as possible by fat-loading everything they eat with no thought for the health quality of the food being given. \n\nIt's safer to aim for a gain of one or two pounds a week so as to not put undue stress on your recovering system and to know that you're rebuilding bone, muscle, and nutrient stores instead of just frantically storing fat. It's more important to restore your body's protein, elemental, vitamin, water, fat and sugar balances than to simply send the numbers on the scale up. Once you do this, given sufficient raw materials your body will rebuild itself more strongly. \n\n\n \nIn The Beginning\n\nIf you're deciding to gain weight, odds are it's because you're underweight. If you're underweight, barring a purely illness-related weight-loss problem which should really be addressed by a doctor instead, you have probably not been eating enough. If you haven't been eating enough for a while, your digestive system will need to be retrained. Same goes for extended or extensive purging... it screws with your entire system, and there will need to be plenty of time devoted to patience and healing. \n\nExtended periods of time with insufficient solid food intake causes your entire digestive system to slow down and lose efficiency. Amounts of digestive chemicals in production may drop, and the tiny fingerlike cilia that absorb foods in your small intestine may become paralyzed or die off. The peristaltic muscles that move food through your system may weaken or atrophy. Large meals or a lot of food at once may confuse your stomach and intestines to the point where they cramp up and have trouble remembering what to do at all. All this will need to be repaired slowly, given time to reaccustom itself to the concept of processing and utilizing food again. \n\nStart with liquids. Rehydration is extremely important, since without food our overall water content drops significantly, and the digestive process requires a great deal of water. In the first few days of refeeding you may notice a sudden gain of several pounds... this is most likely, if you're doing everything right, your water balance trying to straighten itself out. "

OMG!!  This is a really good question.  Its totally made me think and shocked me a bit aswell! Definitely worth me putting this on my watch list and if I find anything out about ill get back to you.\n\nIm very interested in the answers you get to this question.

Cholesterol is not supposed to be over 200. So this is a definite no-no. May seek out a low fat diet for that. And the BP is what docs might call borderline high bp. Pulse rate varies from person to person depending on if they work out on a routine basis. If he is that concerned please seek the advice of a doctor. I am a nurse but no doctor. im saing most of the time normal heart rates run between 80-120, but that depends on the physical fitness as well. check with the doctor to be sure about this.

When you get your period, you bleed down there sweetie.  A girl becomes a young woman when she gets her period.  We have periods because we were born to reproduce.  So every month, your body makes an egg, if you don't use your egg, like (if you don't get pregnant) then your egg sheds, and that's where the blood comes from.  This shedding can lasts from 3-7 days.  If you have cramps really bad in your stomach area, take a couple of Aleve tablets.  They work really well for me.
"""Rx"" and ""medical prescription"" are sometimes used interchangeably. The use of Rx in prescriptions originated as an astrological symbol that was written for talismanic reasons at the start of medical prescriptions. Later it changed into ℞ (an uppercase R with its tail crossed), and was used as an abbreviation for the Latin word recipe = ""take"" (imperative), i.e. an instruction to the pharmacist to take the items listed in order to prepare the medicine. When printing came, it was rendered as ""Rx""."

You can, but if you do the next period you have will be heavier since you skipped a period.  It is not recommended to do frequently- only once in a while.
"Your egg is only viable for about 24 hours after ovulation, but sperm can live for about 3 days in your vagina.  The problem with ""ovulation dates"" is that you can't depend on them.  Your body reacts to stress and other factors which can cause you to ovulate early or late.  The best way to tell you are ""ripe and ready"" is by your cervical discharge. When it looks like egg whites (thick, clear or whitish, and stretchy) you are ready for insemination.  You can check your cervical discharge with a finger inserted near your cervix or (for the squeamish) by checking your tissue after you wipe."
keep that tattoo as clean as possible. the salt from your sweat i would imagine would get into the fresh wound and sorta exfoliate it and may dull the color and/or cause infection. talk to a tattoo artist for the best answer. also, you dont want your clothes to be rubbing on the fresh tattoo. that will irritate it and can cause infection. i suggest if you get the tattoo on friday to stay away from dancing for a few weeks.
...quite a bit to read, but skip to the bottom if you prefer...\n\n\nBackground\n\nFew topics to do with kid's health arouse more controversy than Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder – or ADHD (also called Attention Deficit Disorder, or ADD).\n\nDoctors vary in the way they apply the definition of the condition to individual children. Some experts argue that it's a set of behavioural characteristics and not a medical condition at all.\n\nAlso, it is usually treated with a class of drugs – psychostimulants – that are considered to be addictive and dangerous in adults.\n\nBut many people who have lived with ADHD, or have kids with it, say that since they were diagnosed and treated, their lives have been transformed. Where once they were unmanageable, they can now lead normal lives.\n\nTreatment\n\nChildren diagnosed with ADHD are given a management plan, with the aim of reducing the effects of ADHD on the child's social, emotional and academic functioning.\n\nThe most common treatment for ADHD is psychostimulant medication such as dexamphetamine (trade name Dexadrine) or methylphenidate (Attenta, Ritalin). These are thought to act by normalising the imbalance in the brain's neurotransmitter chemicals. In general, only psychiatrists and paediatricians are allowed to prescribe them. They are given daily (in two to three doses) in tablet form and may need to be continued for months or years.\n\nRitalin LA (long-acting capsules) have recently been released in Australia. They only need to be taken once a day.\n\nIn many cases (about three-quarters of cases where the child has been correctly diagnosed) they work wonders – the child becomes much calmer and more controlled. Teachers especially notice the difference as the child is much more focussed on their work (although there's no evidence that school performance is actually improved).\n\nLike all medications the stimulants can have side effects. The most common include loss of appetite and difficulty falling asleep. Some children initially become irritable, teary and withdrawn – this usually settles. In general, side effects are less common with methylphenidate (Ritalin) than with dexamphetamine. Children taking stimulant medication should be monitored.\n\nThe long-term effect on the development of the child's brain and nervous systems isn't known. And this is cause for concern amongst parents and some paediatricians, who worry that too many children are being treated with stimulants. Australia has about 50,000 children taking stimulants for ADHD, which makes it (per capita) the third highest consumer in the world after the United States and Canada. Consumption is especially high in Western Australia, where there are five times as many as children on stimulants than in Victoria.\n\nSome paediatricians believe this is too high and that there should be more effort made to look at other possible social causes of the child's symptoms. If there are problems in the family or at school, then these need to be addressed, rather than having the child put on stimulants.\n\nSome people turn to alternative therapies, and a diverse range of complementary and alternative therapies are used. None have been subjected to scientific research trials. Some of these therapies can be expensive, and some practitioners offer parents unrealistic hopes of a cure.\n\nNot all children with ADHD require medication and those that do shouldn't be treated with medication alone. Parenting behaviours may need to change. Some suggestions for parents of a child diagnosed with ADHD include:\n\nAccept the situation; be patient. \nSet non-negotiable rules for behaviour and clearly state the consequences of not following the rules. If the rule is broken, warn, then act calmly and without argument. \nSet a routine and stick to it. \nGive praise and rewards for good behaviour. \nBe tolerant; ignore all but the important misbehaviours.

Sunlight.  I naturally wake up at sunrise, whatever time that is.  When I try to override that and set an alarm to force myself to get up in the dark, it makes me feel fatigued, stressed, and irritable all day.  Now that I run my own business and can set my own hours, I have stopped trying to override my body's natural response to daylight and seasons, and now just plan for it and go with it.  The result is that I am MUCH happier, healthier, and calmer person.

Spleen is an organ in the body that 'recycles' blood. It destroys the worn out RBCs (which carry oxygen and carbon dioxide). LESION=any structural change in an organ associated with alteration in function. I don't know what's the splenic leion that u r suffering from- seems like u r quating an uktrasonography report.\nU could be suffering from 'hypersplenism', in which case there is increased destruction of RBCs resulting in anemia with enlargement of spleen (located to the left slightly above the stomach) and is treated by removal of spleen (splenectomy). Splenectomy, I guess, is a pretty safe procedure, and one of its complications could be recurrent infections.\nIf ur spleen is enlarged u'll experience heaviness and pain/discomfort in the above-mentioned region. Don't neglect this condition, since an enlarged spleen is prone to rupture, which results in heavy blood loss and can be instantaneously fatal.

There is not a operation called that, It's just called back surgery, But someone can get Scoliosis. I had a 49 degree curve in my back, and I got surgery which consisted of two 11 inch rods and 16 2 inch screws. Now my curve is down to 11 degrees, and I no longer lean to my left! I had my surgery done 5 years ago. If you met today you would never guess that I had scoliosis unless I told you. But there are few restrictions like someone was saying. I am unable to go on roller coasters, or anything similar that would put alot of force upon my back.
"""Cell Phone-Brain Tumor Link Still Inconclusive\n\nMonday , April 11, 2005\n\nBy Miranda Hitti\n \nCell phones don't cause brain tumors, as far as scientists can tell at this point, says a study in Neurology's April 12 edition.\n\nThe findings echo previous research. ""These results are in line with other large studies on this question,"" says Christoffer Johansen, MD, PhD, DMSc, in a news release.\n\n""There have been a few studies that found an increased risk of brain tumors with cell phone use, but those studies have been criticized for problems with the study design,"" says Johansen, who works at the Danish Cancer Society in Copenhagen.\n\nLong-term effects of cell phone use aren't known yet, Johansen cautions. Hardly anyone in his study had used a cell phone for more than a decade.\n\nLatest Results\n\nParticipants were 427 Danish brain cancer patients and 822 randomly selected Danes without brain tumors.\n\nThe researchers had access to almost all recorded brain cancer cases in Denmark. All brain tumor patients were adults diagnosed from 2000-2002.\n\nThe researchers were able to obtain the number of incoming and outgoing calls among two small groups — 27 brain tumor patients and 47 without brain cancer. No association was seen between cell phone use and brain tumors.\n\nIn the brain cancer patients, the tumors didn't favor the side of the head where people usually held their cell phones.\n\nOther countries are also participating in the project. Their findings aren't in yet.\n\nDouble-Checking Data\n\nIt's easy to lose track of how long you've chatted or how many calls you make or take. That's why the researchers compared the participants' reported cell phone use with cell phone company records.\n\nEveryone accurately remembered how many calls they made. However, both groups were a little fuzzier about how long they'd chatted.\n\n""In our study, few people reported regular cell phone use for 10 years or more,"" says Johansen in the news release.

"Did you ever injure yourself in the ribcage? Are you thin and smoke? Torn muscles between the ribs will cause pain for years. If you are thin and smoke, you may have what is known as ""friction rub"". It's when the lining of your lungs rub agains the walls of your chest cavity. See a doctor soon."
I am circumcised. My father isn't. He took medical advice prevalent at the time that circumcision was beneficial but which has since been proved incorrect. If I could have my foreskin back, I would take it any day.\n\nThese days there are NO hygenic reasons for circumcision if you bathe at least once a day. There will therefore be no smell. Accusations otherwise are just born out of ignorance. If you consider most of European men, for instance, are uncircumcised, don't you think they would have moved to circumcision en masse long ago if circumcision was the most hygenic and correct thing to do?\n\nAlmost all other reasons for circumcision are now medically treatable and therefore, circumcision is unneccessary.\n\nFor women, an intact penis is DESIGNED to work better that a circumcised one because the foreskin allows for greater movement during sexual intercourse and less lubrication is required.\n\nIt is also better for the man because his glans is soft and sensitive - the glans on circumcised penises gets thick and hard over the years and decreases sensitivity and can even lead to erection problems.

It is an ear infection to the outer ear canal but since you have a perforated eardrum, stay away from ear drops of any kind.  With no ear drum protecting your inner ear, any medicated drops will drain to your inner ear, which may cause some nasty symptoms and possible damage.  Opt for oral antibiotics instead.
Because Your Not Watching What Your Doing.
First of all, it is recommended that you undergo a physical examination with you doctor to check for an underlying disorder.  You may have a health problem that requires treatment.\n\nHere are some general guidelines, although this may vary depending on your weight and height:\n\nEat a diet consisting of at least 300 grams of complex carbohydrates, 100 grams of protein, and 2,500-3,000 calories a day.  Include starchy vegetables such as potatoes and beans, as well as grains, turkey, chicken, fish, eggs, avocados, safflower oil, raw cheeses, nuts and seeds.  Eat only whole-grain/ whole-wheat breads, pasta, crackers, and cereals.\n\nBut remember, do not eat fried foods or junk foods for extra calories.  Also eliminate coffee, tea, soft drinks and anything else with caffeine.\n\nGood luck!

"There are three main types of juices - citrus juicers, centrifugal juicers, and masticating juicers.\n\nThe citrus juicers are for citrus only - oranges, grapefruits and the like.\n\nMost juicers are probably the centrifugal type - they have an internal basket that goes around in a circle. These types are good for carrots, apples, etc.\n\nThe third type is generally considered the best - the masticating juicers. These juicers more or less ""chew"" up the vegetables and they produce more juice of better quality than the centrifugal - 24 ounces more juice per 10 pounds of carrots. \n\nThe Breville juicers are very high end centrifugal juicers and cost around $200 to $400. (800JEXL) They have a wide mouth that will fit an entire apple without cutting it first. I used a Waring JEX328 for more than two years and it worked very well for me at a much cheaper price - around $60.\n\nI recently bought a Champion 2000+ juicer, and I like it much better than the Waring juicer, and I liked the Waring juicer a lot. The Champion juicer is a masticating juicer and runs around $250. One of the nice features is that the pulp comes out the end of the tube, so you can set a large bowl there to collect it and can easily dump it and continue juicing. It's also easier to clean.\n\nI mostly juice carrots and similar vegetables. I've heard other juicers work better for wheat grass. You can also buy an attachment for the champion juicer to make nut butters and even to make flour from grains; however, if that is your primary purpose, there might be a better specialized machine.\n\nIn summary, if budget allows, I would recommend a champion juicer, and if you are on a tight budget, i would recommend the Waring centrifugal juicer."

"Why Fast?\n\nWater fasting eliminates addictions, bad habits and unhealthy thought patterns. During the fast, the palate recovers its natural sensitivity to simple foods. Salt, sugar, fats and processed foods become naturally unattractive. Fasting is an ideal time to be introspective and honest with oneself. It is conducive to quiet observation of thought patterns and values.\nFree your body from disease or accumulated toxins.\n\nFasting is surgery without a knife. It allows nature and her healing power to take control of our being and do her cleansing and repair work. Fasting is a medical procedure, restoring homeostasis, strengthening the immune system and healing many illnesses\n\nFree your mind from unnecessary boundaries.\n\nFasting is also an ancient spiritual practice, withdrawing the energy from doing and transferring it into being in the moment. Fasting takes us to our truth, allows old wounds to heal, addictions to fade, and our ego to die to be reborn into our spirit.\n\nFasting brings the ultimate rest.\n\nFasting provides a framework in which change is effortless and comes from the deep self.\n\nWho can do it?\n\nFasting is beneficial to almost everybody with the exclusion of a few medical conditions.\nFasting may be practiced preventively to attain better health and longevity.\n\n\n Periodic fasting provides the rest for your digestive system. It allows your digestive system to recuperate from the rough treatment that you may have given it by overeating or eating the wrong foods or eating at the wrong time.\n\nIn addition fasting also provides an opportunity to eliminate many toxins from your body.\n Some people think that fasting is difficult. If you prepare yourself for fasting it is not difficult. Prepare yourself physically by taking enough food and also plenty of liquids the day before. Prepare yourself mentally by deciding the night before fasting: ""Tomorrow is fasting day, and I am not going to eat anything."" If you take this mental determination prior to the fasting day, you will not be hungry during the fasting day. If you don’t make a prior determination, during the fasting day you will start to think “Maybe I should eat, and fast another day!” Decide before hand and you will be able to complete your fast..\n\nAll in all, fasting is one of the best practices for maintaining physical, mental and spiritual health. I highly recommend it."

Periods are gross, penises are lovely.
Research shows that metabolic rate is 4 - 5% lower in those people who do not have this meal, and therefore even with a low calorie intake you will relatively have less chance of losing weight than someone who eats the same calories but has some of those at breakfast time.\nThat's because the breakfast meal acts as a kick start to the metabolism for the rest of the day.\nYou should ensure ensure that you use the mind and your brain sensibly.\nOne classical thing to do is to remove temptation.\nFor instance if you eat as a family you may be used to having serving dishes and having 'just one more spoonful' whilst eating from the serving dish.\nRather than having to stop temptation simply remove temptation by serving on individual plates.\nIn addition try to gradually reduce portion size a little, if done over time you and your body will adjust and losing weight in a sustainable way will be easier to achieve.To approach a diet in the best possible way, you need to be realistic up front about what you will achieve.\nNothing demotivates more than setting really hard targets and not meeting them.\nSome will set a sweeping target such as losing a stone in a few weeks or something else that is just impossible to obtain at least in a healthy way and then give up on the diet disillusioned.\nTherefore you should be sure to set ultra realistic targets at least at the start. When you meet them you will be encouraged. Set small, realistic targets often for the best chance of diet success and continued motivation during the course of your diet.These days, dieting is all the rage. The companies that make the products and books make billions of pounds and dollars a year - it's a massive industry. Which means only one thing - they want it to sound really hard to lose weight, so as you buy their products. But that's where you can go wrong.\nThere is one simple truth to losing weight that you don't need a book to tell you, but it's the only one that matters. If you take in less than you use, there is no way that can gain weight - in fact you will lose weight. All this talk of Atkins Diets and eating no carbohydrate (which is not at all healthy) is not relevant.\nThe two golden rules of losing weight are so breathtakingly simple, yet people spend thousands on expensive dieting videos, expensive diet foods and all sorts.\n(1) You must do decent amounts of exercise. If you can introduce 30 minutes exercise into your daily routine, whether this be a brisk walk, perhaps a swim at lunchtime or a jog at the weekend, and eat the same amount as you always have, after 6 weeks the results will be breathtaking. Not only will you lose weight, you will also feel fantastic.\n(2) Cut out the snacks. If you look at most people's meals, who are not happy with their weight, it's just not true that they are eating meals full of calories. In fact if you just add up their main meals it often adds up to less than the daily calorie limits. So where does it go wrong? SNACKS!!! It's been shown time and again that all the snacking through the day vastly increases the amount of calories that people take in - a bag of crisps here, a chocolate bar there - and before you know it you've added another 1,000 calories to your day's intake.\nSo the second rule is simple - continue to eat your main meals and drinks, breakfast, lunch and dinner. But stop the snacking. You could save as much as 1,000 calories a day like this. It's only when you stop snacking that you probably will realise how often you do snack without realising it. So stay disciplined - you get three lovely meals a day, just cut out the snacking OK?\nIf you follow these two recommendations above for six weeks, you will feel great and have lost weight. And because it is not at all a punishing program, with points or starving or deprivation of certain food types (how could that be healthy?) you will be able to maintain this program long term without too much difficult

i would compare this to a stomach. from personal experience i do a lot of crunches but i still have a somewhat beer belly. the muscle embedded inside the fat which the fat is much bigger and on top. so when you burn the fat for energy/sugar it just goes away and the muscle there 'comes out.' anerobic exercise will def increase size of muscle :) this answer is prob very vague and disorganized but i believe the body works the same way all around.

Most antidepressants take 6-8 weeks to completely kick in.  Depending on what kind of Wellbutrin you're taking, SR or XL, the time of day does matter.  If you only have to take Wellbutrin SR once a day, take it in the morning.  If you are taking Wellbutrin XL, I would take it in the morning, if it doesn't make you too drowsy.  But I don't think it makes that big of a difference.  \nIf it doesn't work in the next few weeks, go back to your doctor.  Some antidepressants don't work for some people.  There are so many different ones and there may be a medication that works better.
No they dont.  Tney do however have very strict codes of food handling and hygiene. (Thats for everyone, not just people with HIV/AIDS.)\n\nIf any worker cuts themselves the full batch of food is thrown away.\n\nPeople with HIV/AIDS are not any kind of risk to anyone in most jobs as the virus cannot be passed on like that.  Obviously the exceptions are in the medical industry, as an accident with a scalpel/sharp could easily cut the practitioner and the patient.\n\nFor most jobs a person wouldnt have to declare they had HIV/AIDS and quite rightly too. Unfortunately there is a still a social stigma attached to people diagnosed as HIV positive. But the truth is these people pose no risk to us in everyday life.  We however pose a great risk to them if we have any form of infectious illness and they are at a stage where their immune systems are suppressed because of the condition.
Probably not, but if you want to naturally soothe your heart burn, drink some coconut milk and/or aloe vera juice before each meal, and hot tea is good after meals...\n\nAlso eat more meals each day (6-8 snack/meals), but less quantity...

Basophils are a group of white blood cells which are normally in charge of producing immunoglobulins related to allergic reactions. Their numbers are the least among all white cells (about 100 to 200 per cubic mm of blood). SOmetimes blood tests aren't sensitive enough to detect circulating levels of basophils (they may be residing in certain other tissues in your body), and thus the absolute basophil count may turn out as zero. So don't be too worried about it; if the other indices in your blood work are normal, there shouldn't be a problem.
you can apply vaseline in the daytime.  this will cool the pain and lessen the swoll and prevent scarring.  then apply toothpaste (the paste, not the gel) at night to dry it out. it will start to flake off (yea gross, i know) so that way they will shrink and eventually disappear.  it will go away if you do this for four nights to a week.  good luck!

Liver and Kidney Yin Vacuity \nThis pattern appears as the combined Yin deficient symptoms of both the Liver and Kidney, and is common in depleted or older patients. Aging, reproduction, and excessive sexual activity deplete the Kidney, while the stresses of life and emotional challenges tax the Liver. Together, the diminishment of these two vital substances is responsible for numerous natural phases such as menopause, and the overall aging process. Deficient Yin of these combined organs will result in dryness of all their associated bodily tissues, including the skin, hair, eyes, and diminishment of sexual fluids. As the Liver rules the eyes, visual problems such as loss of acuity, blurry vision and dry eyes result. As the Kidneys rule the ears hearing problems, such as tinnitus or hearing loss develop. Other symptoms include dizziness, dry mouth and throat, seminal emission, insomnia, and low back or knee ache. Also included will be heat signs due to Empty Fire rising out of Yin vacuity, such as warmth in the palms of the hands, soles of the feet or the chest center. The tongue will be red, possibly with cracking, and have little coating. The pulse will be fine and weak.
Yes - vivid dreams are a known side-effect of many anti-depressants.\n\nDepending on how distressful you find these dreams, the tablet you are taking may not be the best one for you.

Often they will be able to offer you advice or an alternative.\n\nGood luck.

"There is no way to be happy all day every day, if you were happy absolutly all the time you would probably be the most envied person on earth.\nThe trick is not to try to be happy aLl the time because that it unrealistic - imagine saying ""I'm so happy my dog has died"" or ""I lost my job today, which was nice"".  You should try to be happy most of the time.\n\nYou should not bother seeing a doctor about depression - all they will do is send you to a psychiatrist who will perscribe antidepressants almost before you sit down.  Antidepressants basically work by altering your brain chemistry to ensure you do not feel emotional extremes, unfortuantly this means you can't really enjoy anything fully, get angry, or even feel empathy.  I've tried antidepressants and would rather burn my own hands off then take them again.\n\nWhat you should do is:\n- drink more fruit juice and eat more fruit.\n- drink more water.\n- work less hours at your job unless you enjoy your job in which case work more.\n- watch less TV and go out more.\n- never stay in the house alone, if you don't know anyone in your town then go out and meet people.\n- get a pet.\n\nMost people suffer from depression because they don't have anything worthwhile to do.  They work, eat, and watch crap on TV.  This is a worthless life and very unfufilling.  You need to do good and benificial things and make worthwhile achievements.  \nIt may seem easier to be miserable and alone all the time with only the TV, and your own depression for company but actually it takes far less effort to go out and have fun.  It took me five years to realise the simple truth that I am loneliest when I am alone and most miserable when I have time to be miserable.  If you are busy and with friends you will have fun, if you are having fun you are happy.\nEven if you are a hermit, or a misanthrope then you can have fun with a dog, or cat, or trained fighting monkey - just go places and do stuff."

You can actually contaminate others with the radiation. However the risk is small and it depends on how much radiation therapy you recieved as well. \n\nRadio Active Iodine (RAI) is passed out of the body through all bodily fluids such as stool, urine, saliva and sweat therefore these are all potential forms of contamination. \n\nRadiation exposure is directly related to the amount of time you spend with another person as well as how intimate and close your contact is with them. Avoid prolonged, intimate physical contact with babies, children and pregnant women. \n\nFor a pretty easy site to follow, try http://cpmcnet.columbia.edu/dept/thyroid/raiprep.html\n\nGood luck with your treatment and get well soon!

The most basic way to build up the arms are the push-up and bicep curls.  I recommend a pair of light dumbells for the bicep curl. \nhttp://www.womensheartfoundation.org/images/c4.gif\nFor the triceps do as many pushups as you can with your hands at a close grip.  Most women find this very hard to do,  so you may want to try the modified version - http://www.givstrength.com/presents/exercise/images/originalpushups/modified%20pushups/modified-pushups-1.jpg.  Notice her arm tone! The standard pushup alone will tone the triceps but will also tone the chest and front of the shoulders as well.  The push up is probably one of the best excercises for the upper body because you can do them so many different ways,  and I've never heard of anyone getting hurt while doing them.  I hope this helps,  and train safe.
Hair loss in women can betransient (synonyms = temporary / telogen effluvium / non-genetic) orpermanent (genetic / androgenetic alopecia). To determine whichcategory you fall under, please read this web page to learn more.\n\nBefore learning about female hair loss, one must understand the human hair growth cycle.\n\nThe average person loses 50-100 hairs a day. Hair loss only occurs when the number of shedding hairs exceeds the number of new hairs coming in. Normal hair growth is a three stage cycle:\n[a] Anagen - Growth Phase Approximately 85% of all hairs arein the growing phase at any one time. The Anagen phase or growth phasecan vary from two to six years. Hair grows approximately 10 cm per yearand any individual hair is unlikely to grow more than one meter long.\n\n[b] Catagen - Transitional phase At the end of theAnagen phase the hairs enters into a Catagen phase which lasts aboutone or two weeks, during the Catagen phase the hair follicle shrinks toabout 1/6 of the normal length. The lower part is destroyed and thedermal papilla breaks away to rest below.\n\n[c] Telogen - Resting Phase The resting phase followsthe catagen phase and normally lasts about 5-6 weeks. During this timethe hair does not grow but stays attached to the follicle while thedermal papilla stays in a resting phase below.\n\nApproximately 10-15 percent of all hairs are in this phase atan one time. At the end of the Telogen phase the hair folliclere-enters the Anagen phase. The dermal papilla and the base of thefollicle join together again and a new hair begins to form. If the oldhair has not already been shed the new hair pushes the old one out andthe growth cycle starts all over again. Each hair passes through thephases independent of the neighboring hairs.

I have the same phobia and currently see a therapist who specializes in phobias. I have had the same phobia for twenty years too. If you want to e-mail me you are more than welcome too and i can tell you what my doctor has taught me.
Anything is possible in medicine and science.  I mean anything.  People have been known to be allergic to Benedryl!  So Agent Orange causing diabetes...possible.  My guess would be not, but what I would do would be to research for any studies linking Agent Orange to physical harm in humans.  I would go to my local university library and research things to take to a lawyer.  The lawyer can then review your research and tell you if any other proceedings have occured due to agent orange.  Good luck sir.
1)put a hot water bottle on your stomach (thats the best thing) or one of them bean bags you warm up in the microwave,also have a hot bubble bath. \n2)A warm bath followed by massaging the pelvic & lower back area with a few drops of lavender blened with some warmed oil\n3)Excerise & stretching can also help to prevent them.\n\nalso try this link:\nhttp://www.regenerativenutrition.com/content.asp?id=238
It seems to be normal these days. I can understand why you would get a rush. You are getting attention and that is why it feels so great. You may end up getting negative attention too though so be careful and don't do it too much. You don't want to get a bad reputation...
You're still young and you haven't had your period for that long.  Sometimes it takes a couple of years for your body to adjust itself.  Keep track of when you get your periods on a calendar or a pocket planner.  Mark how long you go for, then after you're done count 28 days from your last day and mark that day.  When you get close, pay attention and see how close you are to that.  Hopefully this will help guess when your next cycle will be.  And always keep some pads or tampons in your purse and backpack and locker so you have some available when you need them.  Don't worry about it too much.  Every chick goes through the same thing at some point or another.  Enjoy your womanhood! :)

only water weight, the only way to actually lose fat weight is by doing cardovascular exercise, so running, biking, swimming, rollerblading.  Be your own trainer and nutritionist, the basic rules to losing weight are no soda, no fast food, lots of chicken, fish, fruits, vegies, whole wheat stuff, yogurt. Not so many cakes and donuts and cookies. Basic common sense for eating, you just need to enforce it. Get all the bad stuff out of the house right away, just toss it or give it away while your still motivated. No alcohol if that applies. Some juice but make sure its all natural, because the ones that aren't are loaded with sugar and a leading cause in diabetes in children and adults. Lots of water, 3-4 liters a day, not all at once, but spread out. Its really easy to down a liter or two while your watching tv or on the computer. Also drink some after you eat the bigger meals of the day, it helps your body pick out the nutrients in food when your food is more spread apart.  These rules may be hard to adapt to at first so start with cutting out the things you know you can live without.  Then work to there.  Remember these are  perfect eating habits, it can take you a while to work into it.  If you know you can’t live without your one treat a day, don’t fight it by trying to eat something else, just eat it and make sure that’s the only one you cheat on a day.  Otherwise you’ll get depressed and quit.\nAs for exercise, lots of cardio. Find something you like. If you have never exercised much before, start with walking 30 minutes a day at a brisk pace. Move on to different terrains that include hills and increase the time spent. After a week or two, try jogging the route. No matter what find an activity you enjoy. Walking to jogging is just an example, try hiking, rollerblading, biking. Once you get into a regular routine, if your not happy with the level of difficulty, try signing up with a gym. Spinning, pilates or kickboxing classes are great. It will also introduce you to working with weights. Talk to a trainer for instruction before using any weights. A cheap investment is a balance ball, it works you stomach while your just sitting on it, like at your computer and its great for posture. There are hundreds of exercises you can use it for for your entire body. I can give you some ideas if you want, just email me. Also for more info on the benefits of water go to www.watercure.com Good Luck!
there are no pills that will do this, I've tried for years and spent alot of money on them 2, only to find that some actually made me gain weight, its a mind over matter thing, you pop a pill and carry on eating you automatically think that the pill will take the the food away, eventually i gave up and ate normally but smaller and often and healthier I've shed 2 stone in a year, exercises are good 2 do and keeps you fit,
"First off, I read that the question was about an upset stomach, not about cramps.  Cramps is a completely different thing.\n\nMenstrual cramps are pain or discomfort in the lower abdomen just before or during a menstrual period. Dysmenorrhea is the medical term for menstrual cramps. \n\nAn upset stomach is just that.  The symptoms of an upset stomach include occasional heartburn, indigestion, a taste of bile in the mouth, pains in the stomach, nausea and then there is Gastritis - meaning inflammation of the stomach.\n \nWhen you menstruate your hormones can over-stimulate the emesis centers of the brainstem resulting in frequent upset stomach. In pregnancy this is known as ""morning sickness"", this uncomfortable problem tends to be worse when you first wake up, but can happen any time of the day.  Try eating crackers or smaller, more frequent meals.  Try to keep track of what you eat and see if a particular food might be causing it.  Some of the ""troublesome foods are coffee, citrus fruits, fatty foods, spicy foods, onions, alcohol and chocolate."

it isnt gross. in highschool for gym we had to swim and my dumb self didnt wear flip flops and i noticed bout a month later this callous type thing on the bottom of my foot. it kept getting bigger and got to the point where it hurt to walk. well i went to the doctor, and he tried freezing and burning it off  never worked. i am bout 90% sure what u have are what u call planter's warts and they are sooo painful. sadly the only way to get rid of them id to go to the doctor, have the doc numb the area and have him dig it out. planter having to do with plant means they have to cut the root out. i guarentee u after the first day u will have a lil soreness, but after that u will feel better. there will be a small scar, but who looks at the bottom of ur foot and there is a slim to none chance of it coming back. i am 27 yrs old and i had it removed at 17 if that tells u anything. if u nd anymore info email me at genler100@yahoo.com. dont be embarrased. its human life. they do suck and are annoying. hope i could help. if u use messenger and wanna chat genler10 not 100 on mess take care.
Does your husband suffer with allergies?  It could be a reaction to something he came in contact with.  Does he rub the eye a good bit?  It may be caused by something he was working with and by rubbing his eye he may have accidentally rubbed something in it.  Does his eye burn or water at all?  If his eye problem does not go away in the next day, tell him he should see a eye doctor.  It could be more serious than allergies.  Eye sight is a precious gift we all have.  If the problem persists, he should get it looked at and taken care of ASAP.  Good luck!

Very odd.  I'd seek another opinion.\n\nGo to an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist.
Almost any hormonal kind of birth control can be used to regulate you period. I am on the nuva ring and frequently regulate me period. I also did when I was using the patch. If it's just the timing of your period you can have it early or have it later if your on birth control. If you aren't taking birth control or are not willing to be on birth control there is no way to regulate your period.
They are tiny, cloudy, clumps of cells that appear in the otherwise clear fluid (vitreous) that fills the back three-fourths of the eye. People see floaters as small specks, cobwebs, or clouds moving in their field of vision. The specks appear to be in the air out in front of the eye because they cast a shadow on the retina. They range from being a nuisance that can be ignored, to interfering with essential daily activities such as reading or driving. Floaters that are not close to other ocular structures are ideal for laser disruption because they have no blood supply and can not bleed.\nHOPE THIS HELPS
You'd have to ask the person who prescribed the Chinese medicine to you, but probably you can.
The BMI can fluctuate to a point. It sounds like you're doing all the right things with your diet and exercise. Don't worry too much about it...you are still growing and could just have a high metabolism rate. If you started to lose weight or not gain weight properly,then there would be cause for concern. As long as your energy level is fine and you continue with your regular routine,Don't get too worked up over it.
Do what makes you feel good, girl.
Not very well, it mainly consists of B vitamins. You'd be better off drinking a lot of water, and maybe doing some moderate exercise. Better yet, stop using drugs. :)
"Hi Jade!\nFrom my knowledge, yes it can be done, but not really safely. Remember, the trick isn't to get ""skinny,"" but healthy. Diet pills can be very dangerous. They can cause health problems, addiction, and most trick your mind into believing your not hungry when you actually are. Starving yourself is defiantly not the answer. \nThe best thing to do is to watch out for your food portions. Follow along with the food pyramid, and incorporate more fruits and vegetables into your diet. Also, include exercise into your daily routine. Don't start off with anything big. I recommend Leslie Sansone's ""Walk Away the Pounds"" videos. She has different stages, from One mile up to three. They are all done inside your home and is more of an aerobics. I've been using them for a while, and am quite pleased. However, the trick is finding what fits YOU best. \nAlways remember that when you start a new exercise routine, you will more than likely gain weight. A lot of people get discouraged by this because they don't understand what it means. Your body is simply retaining more water, and it will start to pass through in a few weeks. Also, muscle weights more than fat. So if the fat is being replaced by muscle mass, then your weight will go up. Just hang in there. You'll soon start to see the scale dropping. \nThe best way to loose weight is by doing it smart. \nHope this helps, and best of luck to you!\n-Pegasus"
There are teenagers that get pregnant but it's not all of them.

Probably normal risks associated with any pregnancy.  You shouldn't have sex 1-2 weeks after an abortion.  There may be a higher risk of infection.\n\nIf you just had an abortion, make sure you're using contraceptives (condoms, IUDs, the Pill, etc) so you can avoid another abortion.  Prevention and protection is the best way to go.  Abortion should not be used as a repetitive contraceptive.\n\nTalk with your physician or head back to the clinic where you had your abortion.
No.
While your reasons would be religious, these days there are NO hygenic reasons for circumcision if you bathe at least once a day. There will therefore be no smell. Accusations otherwise are just born out of ignorance. If you consider most of European men, for instance, are uncircumcised, don't you think they would have moved to circumcision en masse long ago if circumcision was the most hygenic and correct thing to do? The poster who says that it will make your penis 'healthier' is in denial. It is simply untrue and he has no medical evidence to back this up.\n\nAlmost all other reasons for circumcision are now medically treatable and therefore, circumcision is unneccessary.\n\nFor women, an intact penis is DESIGNED to work better that a circumcised one because the foreskin allows for greater movement during sexual intercourse and less lubrication is required.\n\nIt is also better for the man because his glans is soft and sensitive - the glans on circumcised penises gets thick and hard over the years and decreases sensitivity and can even lead to erection problems.\n\nI am writing this as someone who IS circumcised and I am appalled that a fully functional part of me was trimmed off for no real reason and which has, subsequently, given me a less satisfactory sex life than my uncut counterparts.
no, it is a chemical imbalance.
wear cotton garments when ur out..\nif in house hope u need not wear any..
It's a matter of finding the right sized pad for you. Some people wear the over nights all day long (my sister). If you're plus sized, they make pads for your size. They cover more area for larger sizes. It all depends on the brands you're using too. When I used to use pads I hated Always, and used Kotex all the time. My sister had the problem of it going up the back of her butt...kinda gross, but that's how she described it, she went to larger pads and I haven't had to hear her complain since.
GO BACK TO YOUR DOCTOR..IF THEY ARE CHANGING, YOU NEED TO BE SEEN. IF HE SAYS THEY ARE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, ASK HIM TO RECOMMEND AN ENDO-DOCTOR..AT THE VERY LEAST, I WOULD WANT THEM NEEDLE BIOPSIED. Stay well.... :)       From my heart to yours....................
"It is always best to look for and treat the cause of a condition, rather than trying to 'cover it up' with drugs.  Sherry Rogers, M.D. has written an excellent book that explains the causes of mood disorders (bi-polar, major depression, OCD, etc.) and how to identify and fix the many causes.\n\nThe book is called: ""Depression Cured At Last!"".  She documents everything in the book with over 1000 medical research references.  The book is available at Amazon.com or from the publisher at 1-800-846-6687.

KEEP NURSING! I am a mother of two boys I lost all the baby weight after nursing for about 4 to 5 months. Which in my case was 30lbs! Weight loss varies from woman to woman. If you gained 150lbs during pregnancy Nursing alone will not cut it. You will definetly need to include excercise (a walk with the baby in the stroller)and change your eating habits. Nursing also makes your uterus contract which sometimes causes cramp like feelings (at least for me it did)this is your body returning to its regular shape and size, but keep at it and soon enough you will back to your old self. Nursing is good for the baby and it will help you lose the weight faster. Just eat healthy for you and your baby. Good luck
A stye is caused by an infected eyelash, usually removal of the offending eyelash will take care of it. The best thing to do to prevent them is keeping the hands away from the eyes.

rock chick suck i would not recommenf to nobody cause they break easy

Frozen is much better. Canned is processed, just look at the labels on the side. Also, look for salt. Buy frozen.
Yes, very invasive.
You have 2 brains?
I personally would say get them on both the top and bottom. When you have to go through the annoyances associated with braces (ie. getting check ups, avoiding certain foods like gum), it's better to get everything fixed in one go. If you don't want to get both, I would say get the top, since they are generally more noticeable than the bottom. But in all events, just do what feels right to you. Hope this helps.
From http://www.womens-health.co.uk/retrover.asp\n\nA retroverted uterus is the name given to a uterus that is tilted backwards inside of the pelvis. Normally, women are born with a uterus that is located in a straight up and down position inside of the pelvis, or with a uterus that tips slightly forwards, towards the stomach. However, some women have a uterus that tilts backwards, pointing towards the spine. Commonly referred to as a tipped uterus, this condition affects more than 20% of women worldwide. Generally associated with no health complications, a retroverted uterus can occasionally cause painful symptoms or signal an underlying health disorder.\n\nWhat Causes a Retroverted Uterus?\n\nIn the vast majority of women with retroverted uteruses, causes are completely genetic. Many women are simply born with a uterus that is tipped in this position, and this is entirely normal. However, certain factors can cause a uterus that is in a normal placement to become retroverted. These causes include:\n\nPregnancy: During pregnancy, the uterus becomes enlarged and the ligaments that hold the uterus in place become weakened. As a result, many women find that their uterus becomes retroverted after they have delivered their babies. \nMenopause: During menopause, estrogen levels drop rapidly in women. As with pregnancy, this can cause the ligaments that hold the uterus in place to weaken, allowing it to slip into a retroverted position. \nReproductive Health Problems: Certain reproductive health issues, including pelvic inflammatory disease and endometriosis, can cause the uterus to tilt backwards. This is because these illnesses can lead to scar tissue formation on the inside of the abdomen, forcing the uterus out of position.\n\nWhat are the Symptoms of a Retroverted Uterus?\n\nGenerally, the majority of women suffering from a retroverted uterus experience no symptoms. However, if symptoms do present, the two most commonly-occurring symptoms include:\n\n\npain during sexual intercourse, particularly vaginal intercourse (dyspareunia) \npain during menstruation (dysmenorrhea)\n\nThis pain and discomfort is the result of pressure that the retroverted uterus places on the rectum and the ligaments around the tailbone.\n\nRare symptoms associated with a retroverted uterus include:\n\nlower back pain \nincreased number of urinary tract infections \nincontinence \npain while using tampons \nfertility difficulties\n\nDiagnosing a Retroverted Uterus\n\nIf you are experiencing symptoms of a retroverted uterus, you may want to make an appointment with your health care provider for an examination. By performing a few simple tests, your health care provider can easily diagnose the condition. Diagnosis usually consists of:\n\na pelvic exam \nan abdominal ultrasound\n\nOccasionally, it is difficult to differentiate a retroverted uterus from a pelvic tumor. In this case, your health care provider may have to perform a rectovaginal exam.\n\nAre There Any Health Complications Associated with a Retroverted Uterus?\n\nFew women with retroverted uteruses experience health complications as a result of their condition. However, sometimes a retroverted uterus can be a warning sign of another underlying reproductive issue, including pelvic inflammatory disease or endometriosis. Be sure to contact your health care provider if you are experiencing:\n\nsevere abdominal or pelvic pain \nirregular menstrual periods \nirregular ovulation or infertility\n\nIf left untreated, these conditions can have dangerous effects on your reproductive organs and overall health.\n\nWill A Retroverted Uterus Affect Fertility?\n\nMany women who have a retroverted uterus worry that it will affect their future fertility. However, this condition does not appear to affect conception in any way, and most women with retroverted uteruses will go on to experience healthy pregnancies. If you are experiencing difficulties getting pregnant, it could be a sign of an underlying reproductive p
"Yes, negativity is very unhealthy, both mentally and physically (diseases such as cancer and heart-disease have been linked to a negative, pessimistic attitude, seriously!) Although it takes effort, the method for eliminating negativity is relatively simple: Thought Replacement. For the next week, keep a notebook with you at all times, and, when you catch yourself having a negative thought, write it down. Then, write down a positive replacement for that thought. For example; If your negative thought is ""I look awful, today!"" Replace that with something positive like ""Hey, at least my hair looks good, and if I put on my favourite shirt, I'll feel even better about my appearance."" Or, if your thought is ""I am so overwhelmed, I'm not going to be able to get everything done!"" Replace that with ""I'm just going to put one foot in front of the other and do what I can. There's always tomorrow if I don't finish this today!"" Your replacement thoughts don't have to be perfect. The point is, to get yourself into the habit of thinking and reacting more positively. If you find this difficult, try writing your replacement thoughts from the point of view of a best friend (who has your best interests at heart, of course). For example, if your thought is ""That new guy I went out with last week still hasn't called me back. He must think I'm boring and unattractive!"" , your ""inner best friend"" might say: ""I'm sure he's just been really busy, and so what if he doesn't call back?! You're an amazing woman and if he can't see that, he doesn't deserve you!"" After a week, practice replacing your thoughts without writing them down...just think them! It will get easier and more automatic until one day <POOF!>, you're a positive person! Positive thinking is the greatest gift you can give yourself! Enjoy!"
Can you please elaborate your question with a few details so we can get a better picture of your condition and look for the appropriate remedy in Homeopathy !\nTake care and God Bless !

I was not circumcised until I was 50.  You have great sense in the head of the penis when you are not circumcised.  You have great feeling inthe head that way when having sex.  once circumcised it feels diffrent and I dont find it any better.  I miss my foreskin.  You dont have to worry about sex or anything   just keep it clean and enjoy it.  many women get turned on by it and some dont like it.  Your doctor will check the foreskin to make sure it goes back but that is no problem.  Unless you have a medicla reason do not get it done.  KEEP THAT FORESKIN,  I MISS MINE
"If you are experiencing depression, social anxiety, and body dysmorphia, your values of yourself seem quite low and/or negative.\n\nI imagine these medications you're on cloud those particular values you have for yourself.  As a result, they make you feel alienated from yourself, that self that is consistently negative toward itself.  :)  This is in theory ""for the better,"" but if you don't mentally understand why, the chemicals you're injesting will, I surmise, only ""hollowly"" pick you up, leaving you feeling alienated and without guidance on where to go after feeling this ""elevation.""\n\nYou'll have to be more specific what you mean by ""maintaining friendships when getting used to an anti-depressant.""  Are you having trouble maintaining ones you already have and have had for a while given your new state?  Are you simply having problems sustaining relationship with people you just met?  You can see your question is a bit vague to get a precise answer.\n\nHowever, I am like another Answerer who suggests seeking advice from your counselor.  In particular, it should be known very explicitly to your psychiatrist that you are having trouble maintaining friendships, and have had this experience in the time you've been getting used to your anti-depressant.  If this is new for you, this experience, there may be a direct relationship between the two that alarms the psychiatrist.  Or, it may be a small symptom of taking the medication.  It's probably partially up to your psychiatrist to decide, and partially up to you.\n\nI would generally recommend taking your time maintaining friendships, whether you're depressed, on medication, or whatever your condition might or might not be.  Friendships when forced can turn the friends off to each other.  Letting friendships form naturally, meaning letting them form or not form, is a nice alternate recommendation.  A better recommendation is seeking out a support group, especially one that socializes after the meeting.  That way you'll be able to maintain friendships via consistent meetings, and learn about others interests, plus your own, and then make friends via the understanding of common interests.  More than likely, if people are attending a support group for mental illnesses, they have plenty of common interests, not to mention common experiences very much like your own with respect to getting used to anti-depressants!\n\nI hope some of these thoughts are helpful for you.  Get well soon!  :)"

I have been taking prozac for a long time. DO NOT ever skip days without taking. the level of medicine in your body can get out of whack and you can have side effects that are not good. thoughts of suicide,bad nightmares, bouts of extreme depression. also the prozac might need to be adjusted. You really need to talk with your doctor.

Been there, done that.  Home remedies didn't work for me.  I had to go the podiotrist to have it removed.

I opted to have it cut out, and yes, it hurt badly for about a week.
Of course you already know you have to relax, but you have to be really ready too.  Ready for sex in general, not just anal.  Watch some videos or read a book, have a drink, flirt - get all worked up.  Then, start out with small toys or fingers (with plenty of lube - that cavity doesn't lube itself.)  Try moving up to larger toys during several sessions (if he knows what's good for him, he will be patient.)  You will know when you are ready for him.  I find it enjoyable but not all the time.  You have to want to.
Busy yourself with something that will keep you from thinking about sex sex sex.

Too much time is really a subjective question, some people spend all their time on the internet, either because it is a part of their job, or because they are house bound and it is their only link to the outside world.  For many it's easier to socialise remotely than physically.  On the other hand if a healthy and easygoing person is becoming depressed and chronically obese because (s)he has developed an obsession with internet access, this could be a symptom of some deeper emotional problem.

Common causes for abdominal bloating are:\n\nOvereating (gastric distension) \nLactose intolerance, fructose intolerance and other food intolerances \nFood allergy \nAerophagia (air swallowing, a nervous habit) \nAlvarez' syndrome, hysterical or neurotic abdominal bloating without excess of gas in the digestive tract \nIrritable bowel syndrome \nPartial bowel obstruction \nGastric dumping syndrome or rapid gastric emptying \nThe ingestion of some gas-producing foods \nConstipation \nSplenic-flexure syndrome \nMenstruation, dysmenorrhea and premenstrual stress syndrome \nPolycystic ovary syndrome and ovarian cysts \nMassive infestation with intestinal parasites, such as worms (e.g, Ascaris lumbricoides) \nDiverticulosis \nImportant but uncommon causes of abdominal bloating include large intra-abdominal tumors, such as those arising from ovarian, liver, uterus and stomach cancer; and megacolon, an abnormal dilation of the colon, due to some diseases, such as Chagas disease, a parasitic infection.\n\nGaseous bloating may be a consequence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedures, due to the artificial mouth-to-mouth insuflation of air.\n\nPostmortem bloating occurs in cadavers, due to the formation of gases by bacterial action and putrefaction of the internal tissues of the abdomen and the inside of the intestines.\n\nIn some animals, like cats, dogs and cattle, gastric dilatation-volvulus, or bloat also occurs when gas is trapped inside the stomach and a gastric torsion or volvulus prevents it from escaping.

Tendonitis of the elbow is often referred to as tennis elbow due to its common occurrence in tennis players, but in fact any sport or activity that requires gripping can cause this problem. \n\nA more precise definition of Tennis elbow is that it is an inflammation of several structures of the elbow. These include muscles, tendons, bursa, periosteum, and epicondyle (bony projections on the outside and inside of the elbow, where muscles of the forearm attach to the bone of the upper arm). This condition is also called epicondylitis, lateral epicondylitis, medial epicondylitis, or golfer's elbow, where pain is present at the inside epicondyle. Such pain is usually more noticeable during or after stressful use of the arm. In sever cases, lifting and grasping even light things may be very painful. \n\nTreatment may include stopping or limiting activities that cause the pain, such as heavy lifting with the palm facing down. Sometimes a band wrapped around the forearm near the elbow is used to protect the injured muscles as they are healing. In some cases, the wearing of a wrist splint may be recommended for the same purpose. \n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as naproxen or ibuprofen may be given for pain. Injections of cortisone may also be used to relieve the pain. A tennis elbow band may be advised. \n\nIn severe or long-lasting episodes, an injection of medication into the area may relieve the discomfort. Your hand surgeon may recommend exercises that stretch and strengthen the muscles to help prevent the condition from returning. Some patients respond to additional treatment through therapy. As the condition improves, there is usually a slow return to normal activities. Recurrence of this condition is common. \n\nIf no surgical forms of treatment do not eliminate the pain of this condition, surgery may be recommended. Your hand surgeon can advise you on the surgical treatments for lateral epicondylitis and the possible outcomes. Lateral epicondylitis is often a nagging or chronic condition sometimes requiring many months for healing to occur.

Its called the Refractory period and it can last anywhere from minutes to a day.\n\nIt is not that you lose your hormones (in fact, testosterone levels actually rise after orgasm), instead, during an orgasm certain hormones are released into your system which suppress further sexual arousal.  \n\nThe amount of the hormone released determines how long the refractory period will be.  Once the hormones are gone, there is nothing preventing you from being sexually aroused again and you will be able to have sex again.  \n\nHope this helps.
First stop kissing your boyfriend to see if it stops.  Then go to a doctor.

"LOL... My mother and I thought this was funny.  Should we be worried?  Here is a joke that I had stashed away for just such an occasion:\n\nA man and his newlywed check into a mountain resort by a lake. The desk clerk notices the ""Just Married"" sign still on the car. As soon as the man gets the luggage out of the car, he hops in a boat to go fishing.\n\nHe is out all day, comes back for a quick supper, picks up his lantern and goes back out at night. This goes on for a couple of days when the man happens to stop by the desk.

I hope Im along the right lines here as my work is more in the field of social services.  \n\nA specific assessment is something that deals with an issue. (eg continence). So the assessment will assess continence and give us a guide as to how this should be treat/managed in terms of care.\n\nThe global assessment will give a more broader view (eg the continence assessment would need to be placed within the context of the full careplan).  So it would then link into how the person should be assisted to move, the times the management of continence will occur. Who will be involved. How many staff. Do they need training. How often the assessment will be reviewed. What if the environment changes. If the person is to be taken out on an outing, will dealing with the incontinence be enough? Will they maybe need specialist equipment or a cathetor to enable them to have their continence needs managed in addition to their (just as important) social needs.\n\nThats the definition of specific and global in my work. Hope it helps but apologies if Im off on a tangent. :)

"I remember being your age...sometime during the Roman Empire...  Had those same leg cramps.  Mom the R.N. told me they were ""growing pains"" and to eat bananas and drink plenty of water during the day.  It worked.  Also, to relieve a cramp, try tensing those muscles up as if you were trying to MAKE a cramp.  Seems counter-intuitive, but give it a try, it works for many.\n\nLight stretching before bed might relieve stiffness that exacerbates cramping.  And if worse comes to worst, a benedryl will help you sleep through just about anything your legs can dish out.\n\nBest wishes."

Essential Fatty Acids! Look for a supplement with Omega 3 and Omega 6 along with Borage Oil or something similar. Happens alot when people drastically reduce calories. Make sure you still eat 3 meals and at least 1-2 small snacks a day. Also, don't stick with any diet too long that takes certain foods out of your diet. Moderation not starvation is key. Hair loss may be your indication that you are not eating enough. But check with purchasing EFA's anyway. Any drug store, GNC, Wal-Mart should have them.
The chances are still good that she will get pregnant. The concern would be more if she will successfully carry a pregnancy. Once women get scarred with things such as endometriosis or infections, they are more likely to have ectopic pregnancies (pregnancies that happen outside the uterus). These are pregnancies which can not be sustained as they will do severe harm to the mother, even death if untreated. And the pregnancy would not survive past the first few weeks anyway. I am not saying she will have this problem, but it is a possibility.

Since your question id very specific so I presume here that you have clear idea about what is Edema...Now here I shall be explaining the relationship of edema and heart diseases.\n\nEdema is basically a condition which develops when there is leakage of clear fluid(plasma) out of our blood vessels(veins) and their collection/stagnation in the interestitial space(which is the space in between the veins and the tissues)...In short anything that increases the pressure in veins(thus forcing more fluid to move out and collect) makes edema which is apparent as swelling of our body parts, specailly dependent part eg legs, ankle(its so because due to gravity these fluid try to settle down)..\n\nNow lets discuss what kind of heart diseases makes edema...Diseases of the heart which has anything to do with increasing the back-pressure in the veins (which are draining inthe heart) makes the increased pressure in veins ....like if there is congestive heart failure then the heart functions less than what it should ideally do, which means that all the blood which is trying to enter heart is not able to enter fully and this makes inceasing back-pressure in these big veins which leads to sepage of fluids into interestitial space leading to Edema..........\n\n\nNow my dear friends, there are plenty of reasons of edema...and also different diseases of heart has different mechanism of edema making ....but its difficult to explain all of them here.....but if there is any particular disease then you can simply ask me..I hope I could answer your query.But since I guess you have posted 3 similar questions ..but my answer is common..In case you find my answer reasonably good then  I  hope that I might gain 10 points each from 3 questions..lol.Take care

What you need to do is work backwards. Firstly get a piece of paper and write down what your goals are. Then look at your goals and write down what you need to do to reach them. Focus on one task at a time and start acting each step to reach your goal. Don't think it's too hard. The most successful people in the world have a daily to do list and know what they need to do. Start and prepare yourself mentally for what action you need to take. \n\nGood luck we all go through this so don't get flustered just work at it like a jigsaw rather than not knowing where to start cause it can seem over whelming at times.
Oh my sounds as though you have low self-esteem.  Get out and spend time with someone who has a positive outlook on life.

You will meet some inspiring people as you go along.  At the rate you are going, you are only placing yourself in a depressed state and that is so unhealthy.  Lot's of luck to you.

As it is normal to `shed' hair, I would be concerned if you are loosing HEAPS of hair, as this could indicate a medical condition. If that is the case, you need to visit your local GP! and get diagnosed. That's the safe thing to do. Next, the condition of your hair, nails, skin, etc CAN be affected by your nutrition intake....meaning, if you live on junk food....hmmmm...that would need fixing!! Also, visit the health food shop, or Chemist, and get a good vitamin suppliment for your problem. Ask, as there ARE supplements available for exacly what you are talking about! good luck.

How erectile dysfunction is treated depends on what things are causing it. After your doctor checks you for medical problems and medicines that might cause erectile dysfunction, he or she may have you try a medicine to help with erectile dysfunction. Some of these medicines are injected into your penis. Other medicines are taken by mouth. Not everyone can use these medicines. Your doctor will help you decide if you can try them.
Starvation dieting always works in the short term. Unless you are only trying to lose weight for an occasion ( like fitting into your wedding dress..) the weight will come back on and probably MORE than you actually will lose. Our bodies will begin to store all foods eaten as a stored fat because of the month long starvation. You'd be better eating 3 meals in smaller portions and only drinking 8 glasses of water if you wanna lose quick and KEEP it off.

Some, yes. For example, a new vaccine is now promising to significantly reduce the cases of cervical cancer. It is estimated that as many as 2/3 of the cases of cervical cancer are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). It follows, therefore, that reducing the incidence of infection from HPV will also reduce the incidence of cervical cancer. Viruses as well as bacteria have been implicated in a number of other cancers. Heliobacter pylori (H Pylori) infections in the gastrointestinal tract have been linked to certain lymphomas of the gut. \n\nViruses sometimes work indirectly in causing cancers. For example, both AIDS and hepatitis are caused by viruses and they subsequently weaken the body and make it more susceptible to cancer. AIDS destroys the immune system and makes it harder for the body to ward off viruses, bacteria, and cancer cells.  Sadly, people suffering from AIDS are at a much higher risk for a multitude of cancers which the body would normally be able to protect itself from (including viruses like Epstein-Barr and certain herpesviruses that are themselves linked to cancer). Hepatitis increases the likelihood of liver cancer.\n\nHopefully, researchers will one day find an effective vaccine against viruses that are in one way or another linked to cancer.
wow..i have hypothyriodism also...when was the last time you had your levels checked?...the only weight program i recommend is weight watchers...good luck!
Research has proven that suppliments probably do little if any good. If you want instant weight gain, use Creatine...will add about 5 pounds of water to the average person, wets the muscles and helps them heal. Other than that, IF you get a good diet, suppliments are pretty much a waste of your money. Regardless of all the hype you see, old fashioned hard work and a good balanced diet is the only way it is going to happen. You do NOT want to put on fat, so stick with a good diet of meat, carbs, oils, in all, a balanced diet. There will be plenty who tell you >>>protein shakes, protein bars, etc...waste of money, period. But if it makes you feel like you are doing something, then do what ever you want. Good luck

Get some tissues or a damp cloth to catch the blood. \nSit or stand so your head is above your heart. \nTilt your head forward and pinch your nostrils together just below the bony center part of your nose. Applying pressure helps stop the blood flow and the nosebleed will usually stop with 10 full minutes of steady pressure - don't keep checking to see if the bleeding has stopped. \nApply a cold compress, such as ice wrapped in a cloth or paper towel, to the area around the nose. Applying pressure with a cotton pad inside the upper lip may also help.\nIf you get a nosebleed, don't blow your nose. Doing so can cause additional nosebleeds. Also, don't tilt your head back. This common practice will cause blood to run into your throat. If you swallow the blood, you might throw up. \n\nIf you've tried the steps above twice and the bleeding continues after 10 minutes, you'll need to see your school nurse or your doctor. \n\nOnce you've stopped the initial nosebleed, don't lift heavy objects or do other activities that cause you to strain, and don't blow your nose for 24 hours. Also, keep your head elevated above your heart.\n\n********************\n\nNow, if your nosebleeds are constant, won't stop, or if they happen often, you need to see a doctor. It could be an indication of something more serious.
It is quite understandable to feel bad all the way around for hours after an asthma attack. First, your body is not getting as much oxygen as it needs during the attack, and this will make you feel run down and lousy. Second, you sound like a busy person who is into sports, etc...I think it would be perfectly normal to even experience some mild depression after an attack. Think about it...you like to be active and busy and now you are drained and can't do what you want. It bites! I have sarcoidosis and I have breathing difficulty at times. I am a busy active person and this, like asthma leaves me drained. Sometimes I get bummed about it but pick myself up by my boot straps and move on once I have allowed myself the time to rest.(and allowing yourself to rest, although difficult, is necessary.) Be kind to yourself afterward.
it's a good start.  But it also depends on your diet and exercise regimine.

"What is depression?\nDepression is a mood disorder that causes you to feel sad or hopeless for an extended period of time. More than just a bout of ""the blues"" or temporary feelings of grief or low energy, depression can have a significant impact on your enjoyment of life, your work, your health, and the people you care about. \n\nDepression affects people differently. Some feel down for extended periods of time; for others the feelings of depression come and go. If you have short episodes of mild depression, you may be able to continue to work and take care of daily activities. However, if you do not seek some form of treatment for your depression, you are at risk for getting more depressed or becoming physically ill. In severe cases, depression can cause people to become incapable of communicating, unable to do routine activities, or suicidal. In these cases, it is essential to seek medical attention.\n\nPeople with depression may be reluctant to seek help because they feel that it is a sign of personal weakness or a character flaw or that they should be able to ""pull out of it"" on their own. We now know that depression, like other medical conditions, has a chemical and biological basis. Treatment for depression is safe and usually effective even for severely depressed people.\n\nIf you think you may have depression, take a short quiz to evaluate your symptoms:\n\nInteractive Tool: Are you depressed? \nWhat causes depression?\nDepression may be triggered by stressful life events, other illnesses, certain drugs or medications, or inherited traits. Although causes of depression are not entirely understood, we know it is linked to an imbalance in brain chemistry. Once the imbalance is corrected, symptoms of depression generally improve.\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\nDepression is more than just the normal, temporary feelings of sadness and hopelessness associated with difficult life events. The symptoms of depression are often subtle at first. It can be hard to recognize that symptoms may be connected and that you might have depression. Common symptoms include:\n\nDepressed mood. \nInability to enjoy activities. \nProblems concentrating. \nChanges in eating habits or appetite. \nWeight gain or weight loss. \nChanges in sleeping habits. \nDifficulty going to work or taking care of your daily responsibilities because of a lack of energy. \nFeelings of guilt and hopelessness; wondering if life is worth living (common). \nSlowed thoughts and speech. \nPreoccupation with thoughts of death or suicide. \nComplaints that have no physical cause (somatic complaints) such as headache and stomachache. \nAll of these symptoms can interfere with your quality of life. Even if you don't have major depression, if you have experienced a few of these symptoms for at least 2 weeks you may have a less severe form of depression that still requires treatment.\n\nHow is it treated?\nDepression is usually treated successfully with professional counseling, antidepressant medication, or a combination of the two. Often a combination of the two is most effective. People with depression usually can be treated as outpatients, but in severe cases a period of hospitalization may be necessary.\n\nIf you have mild or moderate depression, you may be diagnosed and treated by your family health professional and a therapist or psychologist. If you have severe depression or other psychological disorders or do not respond to treatment, a psychiatrist, a doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of mental health problems, may be helpful.\n\nLet your health professional know if you suspect that you have depression, because it is often overlooked. If you are diagnosed with depression, you and your health professional can decide on the best treatment. The earlier you are treated, the more quickly you will recover. 1 \n\nHow common is depression?\nIf you have symptoms of depression, you are not alone. In the United States, an estimated 15% "

deal with the anxiety before you stop, go see a professional counseller or pychotherpaist. Most alcoholics often drink BECAUSE of the anxiety they feel with whatever is the issue. Get rid of that, then your subconscious will not feel the need to get drunk to forget what it is you are anxious about.\n\nThere is always another way, but you need help. Its important to get things done the right way round. The drinking is often a SYMPTOM and not the cause. Get rid of the cause and it will help you come off the drink.\n\nGood luck and best wishes
Yes, I'm always like that ever since I can remember and I'm pretty young too. Even if you sit at a desk all day it's enough stress to make you completely exhausted. I usually take a short nap after work, if I have enough time. One thing I noticed that helped me is drinking plenty of water, watching what I eat, and exercising. Your diet is one of the most important things though. You would be AMAZED at how different you feel just by eliminating processed and sugary fat stuff and eating more raw natural fruits and veggies. Also too much caffeine can make you burn out at the end of the day. Of course if you notice that your way too tired and this has come on suddenly you should make an appoinment to see your doctor. I don't mean to scare you but you could have other problems.
You seem to have a combination of unassociated problems. Having TMJ (Tempo Mandibular Joint Syndrome) may be part of the problem (grinding your teeth) \n\nIf you are getting poor sleep (cause you are grinding your teeth and also because you are in pain from the headache)) it can raise your blood pressure as well.\n\nTachycardia arythemia (sp) is the irregular heartbeats where it races and then slows. I am not sure what would cause this in relation to the other mentioned problems. However, I would strongly advise you to see a physician who can narrow down some of the causes of your issues. Sooner than later would be best. Good luck!
Maybe you should try 'Semenax', I heard this pill is the best for what you want.
It is totally possible to be afraid of too much control.  With control comes responsibility, and often times people don't want to take responsibility.  If you have low self-esteem, you may think you're not good enough to do things right, and you'd rather have someone else do them.  You may simply be afraid of having to take the blame if you screw things up.  You might also be afraid of not being able to handle things...afraid that you might lose control.\n\nHope that makes sense.  Don't worry about it too much...control is really just an illusion anyway.  Just try to be aware of what's going on inside yourself, try to understand why, and when you're ready try to face your fears.  Take control, and see what happens.  You're far more capable than you think.\n\nGood luck!
No, it doesn't.  But it does make it appear this way. Before you shave the hair is different lengths and some of it lighter.  When you shave and it grows back it is all the same length and darker because it hasn't had a chance to get bleaced by the sun, therefore it looks like it is thicker and darker.  Shaving can not change the way hair grows out from the pores, it cuts it off at the surface.

Get a new outlook on things, I use to worry like that for 15 years..........Man life is to short. OK just say she is, what would you do???????? You would go on, cry for while, be miserable for a while, feel like you were gonna die for a while, but eventually you would go on. Maybe it would be even better next time. Surely you wouldn't consider suicide. Nothing is that bad!!!!!!! Now, say she is not or never did it was just your insecurities playing tricks on you.. I have those tricky monsters too. And every time I've listened to them I have been wrong, and ended up feeling really stupid it ruined my first marriage. I just started imagining stuff and it was a miserable life, after years I had messed it all  up and it was unrepairable we ended up divorced. I remarried and my new life is so much lighter and real. So that's probably the case now you are being paranoid. Go to sleep!!!!!!!! Just find out the facts tomorrow and stop jumping to conclusions it can ruin a good marriage!!!!!!!!!!!!

They reduce inflammation in your body, and inflammation is linked to many diseases from heart disease to diabetes and cancer.  They are especially good for your brain, since most of the cells in your brain are made up of Omega 3 fatty acids.

"ANSWER: Strangulation, or more precisely called ""Autoerotic Asphyxia"" (AEA), purportedly is used by people seeking to experiment sexual thrills in combination with a pseudo-masochistic fantasy of bondage and pain. The risk of sudden death may also serve to increase the sexual pleasure by adding a strong component of mortal danger.  \n\nThis is an ***EXTREMELY DANGEROUS*** method of having sexual thrills, in my opinion.  Several deaths have been attributed to AEA, including that of a British minister in 1994.\n\nComplete information can be found at the link below:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoerotic_asphyxiation"

"the thing with all the ""diets"" is that once you go off of them you will gain it back because you didn't learn how to live a normal life while losing weight.  instead of a diet, learn how to change your eating habits in a healthy way.  fruits, veggies, whole grains, and lean meat and fish.  also begin an exercise program.  but you can't just change your diet until you lose the weight, you have to change your lifestyle."

Anita - At this point, the differential diagnosis is quite broad and certainly not restricted to liver disease.  If you are truly having fevers of up to 103.0, you need to continue your evaluation by your physician.  Although the first set of laboratory tests may be normal, that just means more tests need to be done to figure out what is causing these fevers.  It is certainly not normal, and I would not jump to the conclusion that it is related to your liver unless your liver studies come back abnormal.  Good luck...
12 to 16, i am not a nurse but i still know that
If you want to do this it is for life so you need to totally change your way of eating and exercising. This is not a diet rather than a healthy eating plan for life. So no more talking diet cause it means time limit. You will get the results you are after if you stick to this regime it is up to you. \n\nHere are the golden rules: \nInitially cut down to 1200 calories. \nExercise 6 times per week for 1 hours a day. Do three weight sessions and three cardio sessions. No gym involved. \nDon't eat carbs after 4pm, never eat carbs within 2 hours of exercise or within 1 hour of exercise. \nDrink 3 litres of water per day. You can have a green tea at the end of the day. \nLimit your fruit in take to 2 pieces per day. \nNever eat dinner after 6pm.\nAdopt of low GI eating plan this is sustainable for life!\nMake low fat dairy choices \n\nFollow this menu plan as a suggestion: \nBreakfast 7am - 1 cup hot water w lemon\n20 minutes later have a bowel of oats w water (no honey) OR\nfruit salad w low GI soy yogurt\nSnack 10am - pear or apple (both low GI)\nLunch 12.30pm - muligrain sandwich w 50g tuna & salad (no butter)\nSnack 3pm - low GI yogurt OR skim berry smoothie (no honey or banana) plenty of ice, 1/2 cup skim milk & 1/4 cup yogurt\nDinner 5.30pm - 120g grilled lean meat/fish/prawns/tofu patties (not fried) w spinach salad & mixed vegies (no whites, carbs) OR 3 egg white/soy omlette with ham, cheese and tomato\nSnack - 1 scoop of low cal low fat ice cream (if hungry)\n\nExercise is must be intense. Refer to www.bodybuilding.com for your weights routine. Never do weights two consecutive days have a cardio day in between. \n\nCardio needs to include running, go hard up stair wells and cycling. You get the most benefits from exercise when your body is totally fatigued and this is when you see changes. \n\nTo maintain you can increase calories to 1500 and reduce exercise sessions to 3-4 times per week. If weight creeps up again due to holiday period etc.. go back to 1200 cal and 6 sessions again. \n\nGood luck it worked for me it can work for anyone.

I am a Type I diabetic, and I find it to be a pretty serious condition. From a medical stand-point, it's something that requires constant care and vigilance, and you have no idea how old that gets after about twenty years of it. Three injections per day, blood sugar testing, not fun stuff.\n\nI'm managing my own care (no insurance), but diabetics who don't generally see a doctor every three months for lots of blood work and being bitched at by fat men in lab coats. The reason for the visits is pretty much to avoid complications, like neuropathy, retinopathy, kidney damage, and so forth. I still have all of my original parts; however, I have known since I was eleven that some day, I will probably lose one or both of my feet. No, it is not a matter of control; the best diabetic I know got a weird, random infection and chop, minus two toes.\n\nFrom a social point of view, I think it's even worse. Kids teased me school for not eating sweets; teachers made me sit in the corner during class parties. On my hall my freshman year at college, none of my dorm mates would wait for me to give my injections before going out to the dining hall. It was too much of a hassle to give me five minutes notice or wait for me. Yeah, those are tiny things, but tiny unrelenting insults eventually cause pain. I've given up the idea of having non-diabetic friends.\n\nRomantically, it's been tough too. Few guys are willing to hang around once they knew I'm unwilling to risk having children. Sorry, but I don't like children; I do like my eye-sight and kidney function. Very much in fact. Even other diabetic men are pretty unforgiving. They just don't understand that the cost is higher for me than them.\n\nBasically, my point here is that it affects every area of a person's life. Diabetes is a chronic condition. No matter what any of us do, it's there with us. No, it's not MS or ALS or AIDS, but it still impacts quality of life in ways normal people can't even think of.\n\nI'm not sure if you would call that input or venting.

a test result is an indication of how much alcohol is in your system and has nothing to do with the size of your stomach.  I can tell you this from experience, a smaller stomach means you absorb alcohol much faster therefore getting drunk a lot quicker!
first why do you think you have water weight?  Your body consists of 60% water and it is essential that you have enough water for your body to maintain a healthy lifestyle.\nWhen you are having your period or close to it you may retain some water, but it quickly goes away.  Check out the link below for more information on the importance of water.
If you mean a vaginal yeast infection, it's probably the result of taking an antibiotic.  Get Monostat 3 or 7-day at the drug store.  It will have a tube of itch cream that you might want to keep in your purse.  Yogurt does have microorganisms in it, but not nearly enought.  You also can buy Acidopholus in the vitamin section.  Try to find a brand that doesn't say to refrigerate after opening.  My doc has okayed me to take 3 times the dose on the label each day.  Normally I take one every other day.
So her doc is thinking she may have Antiphospholipid syndrome, right? So this disease is diagnosed by checking for anti-cardiolipin antibodies. Antibodies have 2 main types: IgG and IgM. Since her IgG is increased it may suggest a rheumatic disease, like Anti-phospholipid syndrome, or it could be a ton of other diseases, that's why she should see a rheumathologist, s/he is more capable of making the diagnosis of a rheumatic or collagen disease. These include: Rheumatic arthitis, Sjorgen's Syndrome,  Lupus (many types, not all of them ANAS +), and so son.
"No, you should be more scared of not hearing things properly and then responding incorrectly.

I agree with the previous posts...don't know of a way to make it come sooner.  For future reference, there is a new birth control pill out called Seasonale (or something similar to that name), and you only have a period four times a year.  If you don't want to do that, just take your regular pills, skipping the 7 different colored placebos at the end of the pack, and going directly to a new pack.  Using this method, you will skip your period until you take the sugar pills.  Granted, it might take your body a little while to adjust to that new routine.
agreed with previous reply. The drug industry wants your money and a dozen office visits. Apple Cider Vinegar takes a few bucks and a willingness to learn the sour truth. Check my blog out about Acid Reflux. I would suggest adding Apple Cider Vinegar to a cup of grape juice, apple juice, or carrot juice because they will help you get used to the strong taste and add a teaspoon of cinnamon and a dash of cayenne three times a day. Plus drink at least six glasses of water a day. When your urine is clear, you are on the right track.\nhttp://curezone.com/blogs/m.asp?f=179&i=33

Unless it's just your id here, i will suppose you're asian. For most asians, it's a sign of disrespect to look at someone, particularly older people or persons of authority, straight in the eye. It's in the culture. Also, most asians would only look at someone in the eye only when an intimate relationship has been formed. It's not really dishonesty or insincerity or guilt on your part.

"Short of some very unreliable and very expensive genetic testing - which may or may not provide a reliable answer, the best answer I can give you is to know yourself and your family history.\n\nYour odds of addition increase if you have any family member with an addiction problem. Your odds increase if you suffer from addiction to any other substance, item, relationship etc (meaning you have a so called ""addictive personality""). Your odds also drastically increase if you are hanging around with others involved in such things, as familiarity breeds laxity in this case. Another physiological indication is if you have any problems with tolerance with any prescription meds such as pain killers - whether they dont affect you very much or kick your butt a lot  (both increasing your odds). Also, if there is a class of painkiller you dont respond to well - such as the 'caine family (lidocaine, lanocaine, supracaine - usually used by dentists) you can know something about your response to particular drug families (in this case, cocaine). \n\nI'm sorry this answer isnt more precise - but there is not a precise answer to your question."

Well, I was actually listening to a talk radio the other day and someone called in and asked almost the same question.  Blood in urine, no pain.  Basically the doctor told him to go to the doctor and have his kidney's checked.  Go to a doctor that does that for a living, not just a family doctor.  He said to go to a specialist who looks at internal organs.  He also asked if the man had ever been hit in the kidneys, like when he was younger and the man said that kidney punches were the thing back then.  Maybe an idea to check out the kidneys.  Good Luck.

"Dietitians are licensed, The term ""nutritionist"" does not always indicate licensure or specific qualifications. See below for more detail. \n\n""Dietitians"" (the preferred spelling in the United States) make up the majority of nutrition counselors who see patients in hospitals, clinics or other medical settings. In order to become a ""Registered Dietitian"" (R.D.), a person is usually licensed by a state government after passing the Registration Examination for Dietitians. In order to qualify to take this examination, an aspiring dietitian needs to complete four years of college, including required coursework in food science, food safety, chemistry, biology, anatomy and several other course areas that are specified by the Commission on the Accreditation for Dietetics Education. They also need to complete 900 hours of apprentice work in a clinical setting. This clinical work can be built into a specially designed undergraduate program or can be completed separately, as an internship program in dietetics. With somewhat less training, a person can qualify for the title, ""Dietetic Technician, Registered"" (DTR).\n\nThe term ""nutritionist"" does not always indicate licensure or specific qualifications. Many dietitians casually call themselves ""nutritionists,"" because they counsel people about nutrition. Some people use the term ""nutritionist"" to describe people who are educated in the field of dietetics or nutrition, but are not licensed to provide care to medical patients. There are many people who design food plans for communities or cafeterias who are not licensed as providers, but who provide an invaluable service by highlighting healthy eating practices in our communities.\n\nThank you for the question I learned something too."
"ha. i'm glad that someone addressed that. i think it's a combination of both-- people are just naturally insecure and look for others for affirmation. and as far as attention goes, people feel good when others take the time to respond to them (and their whining). it makes them feel special. \n\nbtw, i hope people understand your ""question""..."

Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that gradually steal sight without warning. In the early stages of the disease, there may be no symptoms. Experts estimate that half of the people affected by glaucoma may not know they have it.\n\nVision loss is caused by damage to the optic nerve. This nerve acts like an electric cable with over a million wires. It is responsible for carrying images from the eye to the brain.\n\nThere is no cure for glaucoma—yet. However, medication or surgery can slow or prevent further vision loss. The appropriate treatment depends upon the type of glaucoma among other factors. Early detection is vital to stopping the progress of the disease.\n\nIt was once thought that high pressure within the eye, also known as intraocular pressure or IOP, is the main cause of this optic nerve damage. Although IOP is clearly a risk factor, we now know that other factors must also be involved because even people with “normal” levels of pressure can experience vision loss from glaucoma.
No!

Well part of it depends on where you are. Prices vary from region to region.  My husband recently had laproscopic gall bladder surgery and the final cost was around 14,000.

"Are you sure it's ""wheezing""?  Some people have orthopnea.  That is a condition in which it is difficult to breathe when lying down.  Some people have excess fluid in their body, and when they lay down, the fluid accumulates around the lung area and central abdominal area... which makes it harder to breathe. This would explain why the person would cough when they sit up.. the fluid is in the lungs.. and that is an autonomic response-- to cough the secretions out.  It may sound like wheezing.. but it may be ""crackles"" or ""rhonchi"" fluid rattling in the lungs.   Sometimes, weight plays an issue.  It can depend how much weight is pressing on the chest.. it compresses the lungs making it harder to breathe.  I suggest sleeping on several pillows to decrease the fluid in the lungs.. and/or the weight on the chest. I hope this helps!  :-)"

I do believe the cell phone causes cancer.  My father is a healthy older man, but he uses a cell phone all the time, and stores it on his belt and got both prostate cancer, and cancer of the scalp.  Coincidence?  I doubt it.  I can feel the radiation going through my head every time I use one.  The fact that science can't put 2+2 together just says that scientific researchers are idiots, not that cell phones don't cause cancer.\n\nBy the time they realize the damage it does to cells, it'll be too late to take back all those years of people's lives.
This is complicated for a variety of reasons, but I won't go int o all of that. The thing is: Chicken is better than turkey unless you're trying to fall asleep. The tryptophan in turkey will make you tired. Pigs are extremely smart animals and they don't taste very good, so why eat 'em? Another fact about pork, is that it is marbled with fat, which means that it is worse for you than chicken. Birds do not have fat marbled into their muscle like most other animals do, if you take the skin off, chicken is nearly fat-free. They carry it only in their skin and in trace amounts in their bloodstream. Beef is not as healthy for humans to eat as chicken is, because beef is much higher in artery-clogging fat and cholesterol, so, nutritionally, chicken is the smarter choice. However, humans like variety and that means that beef is okay once in a while.

"Everyone poops.\n\n""Everyone Poops by Taro Gomi is part biology textbook, part sociological treatise and all celebration of a very natural process. Both my daughters begged me to read the book over and over again. They marveled at the enormity of the elephant's poop and searched with the skill of a scientist for the tiny specks which represent bug poop. The text is simple and straightforward but not without humor. 'An elephant makes a big poop,' the book begins. 'A mouse makes a tiny poop. A one-hump camel makes a one-hump poop, And a two-hump camel makes a two-hump poop. Only kidding!' The colorful illustrations are eye-catching and deceptively detailed. The poop of each animal species is very distinctive in size, shape and color…A book which doesn't have any preachy overtones but merely explains where and how each living creature poops seems to work for my two-year-old.

What speed are you running at?\n\nIf you are a beginner, try running at a slow to moderate speed 10-12 min/mile. After a couple of weeks try intervel runs - 30 sec of fast sprints and 2 minutes of slow jogging. You'll see results real fast
Night sweats, fatigue and reoccurring fevers along with mild temporary disorientation.
You wouldn't. But your doctor would. Make an appointment.
WRONG! The simple surgical procedure does not effect the man, except made his pride in any way. After my husband had a vasectomy we had more sex than before, because he was much less worried it would result in another pregnancy.  Tell him to suck it up and be a man, and get the operation, or you could have your tubes tied, which cost 3 times as much, he could take time off his job to care for the children and household chores while you recuperate for about 6 weeks! And absolutely no sex for at least 6 weeks, if you have to have the operation.......Seriously, they are only uncomfortable for maybe a couple of days!

Rare cases of muscle problems and liver problems have been associated with the use of fluvastatin and other similar medicines. Contact your doctor immediately if you experience unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, especially if accompanied by a fever or flulike symptoms or yellowing of the skin or eyes, abdominal pain, unexplained fatigue, dark colored urine or pale colored stools. These may be early symptoms of muscle or liver problems. \n If you experience any of the following serious side effects, stop taking fluvastatin and seek emergency medical attention or contact your doctor immediately: \nan allergic reaction (difficulty breathing; closing of the throat; swelling of the lips, tongue, or face; or hives); \ndecreased urine or rust-colored urine; or \nblurred vision.
Lift weights (they don't have to be too heavy), walk 30 minutes a day, walk up and down stairs 15 minutes a day and, if possible, swim. Good luck.

"Hello! I have been in exactly the same boat...I believe some of us are just born extra sensitive. I am always hyper-aware of what others may think of me, and what I think about myself. I just had to tell myself that I don't care what others think! I spent too many years of my life with that worry and it was hindering me in all aspects of my life. Once you come to that realization, you will feel like a weight has been lifted off of your shoulders. That is one step you can make in a positive direction. Don't let what others say bother you...I know that is easier said than done. I just got upset the other day about what my boyfriend's father said about me. But I was able to talk myself through the situation, and I realized I was overreacting. It is not something that we can get rid of, rather we can put our emotions in check and realize we can change how we approach things. Know you are a valuable person. You are not ""crazy""! Just think that your sensitivity is a gift, and there is nothing wrong with you for being that way. You will feel so much better when you realize that you are a wonderful person. You have a good job and are going to get married. That is an accomplishment right there! Good luck to you!"
Hi Piglet,!!\nI'm a man of 58, and I have had artherosclerocis for some time.\nIt's time you saw your GP and talk to him about what you have to do to , first reduce any high cholesterol that you may have, and also ask him/her about products that relax the muscles of the affected arteries and also the heart muscle.You are at risk of heart attack or stroke if you don;t start some life changes, including some drug therapy.\nDon't waste any time, your life could depend on it.\nOnce you have got your cholesterol under control, and your doctor has given you some drug therapy to follow, a change to eating healthy food, and a regular cardiovascular workout, usually a good brisk walk for about 20minutes a day will keep you pretty right, and reduce your risks of heart attack or stroke.\nFirst see your doctor`.\nRegards and good luck\n\nPS. don't smoke.\n\npa69oldfart.

Get your blood sugar checked now. That happened when diabetes first manifested in me.
I would think that you falling alseep all the time has something to do with you not getting the proper nutrition.  Can you take some sort of multi-vitamin during this time?  If you are still feeling nauseated, start with dry toast.  See how you keep that down.  Go from there.  Stay away from fatty, greasy, or fried foods.  Is this what you are looking for?  You seem to know that you need to stick to a low fat diet.  Soup, toast, chicken breast & rice, salads with fat free dressing..........
Quite safe. Actually probably safer than having the baby. Abortion during the first 12 weeks is one of the safest surgical procedures there is.
If you don't feel tired during the day, you just might be one of those people who doesn't need a lot of sleep.\nIf you are tired during the day, see a doctor for a sleep study. You might have some kind of condition.

Prostatic acid phosphatase is an enyme that is sometimes secreted by the prostrate, usually when the gland is under pressure.  It used to be used as a marker to indicate the possibility of prostate cancer, however with the advent of new and more specific testing, Prostatic Specific Antigen, it is no longer used.  The thruth is that it was a very nonspecific test and only indicated that the prostate gland was under some sort of pressure.  True a prostatic tumor could cause this pressure but so could tumors or other types of masses actually affecting nearby organs such as the adrenals if they grew large enough to press on the prostate.  In short, clinically there is little or no significance to prostatic acid phosphatase.
The home freeze stuff never worked for me.  Get some duct tape, and tape over the wart.  Change the tape every 48 hours until the wart is gone.  It's inconvenient, but it works every time.

There are lots of reasons to miss a period, not just pregnancy.  Have you lost or gained a lot of weight?  Have you been sick?  Have you been under a lot of stress?  Has your diet changed radically?  Have you gone on or off the pill?  Have you started or stopped any other medications?\n\nThere are lots of medical reasons to miss periods: UTIs, PID, STDs, cancer, hormonal imbalances....\n\nI would chill for this month.  If your period is not back to normal next month, I would see your doctor.
i guess the opening will stretch over time, especially after childbirth. that's why you have to do your kegel exercises daily. It doesn't take long.
1. Local anesthesia is injected just into the area to be operated on- as for dental work. \n2. Regional anesthesia anesthetizes a nerve or nerve plexus, like a brachial block for an arm procedure. \n3. Spinal anesthesia involves puncturing the dura, the fibrous covering of the spinal cord, introducing anesthetic into the fluid bathing the spinal cord. Spinal head aches can result from leak of spinal fluid. Generally there is loss of motor function of the legs until it wears off.\n4. Epidural does not puncture the dura- anesthetic is intruduced outside the dura, so it bathes the nerves coming off the spinal cord. Gives good pain relief, sometimes unilateral (which is less helpful).\n5. General anesthetic- produces a loss of consciousness. Can be inhalational or intravenous. A paralytic is often used with inhalational general anesthetic, and an endotracheal tube (a breating tube) is used.

Hi,\nThat is about average, but you most likely will grow another inch or two. You'll stop growing taller when you reach pubuerty. If height is your concern, excercise and eat a healthy diet. A few extra pounds will show on you, so make certain you excersie regularly. An overweight body always looks shorter than a slim build.
"In this, I assume ""our nation"" is the Philippines?\n\nThe thing to remember is that such a drastic change in the way you are governed will have long-term effects.  The strongest anti-ChaCha argument I've seen is that local members of the House are often chosen because they have the backing of local oligarchs and prominent families.  With a unicameral legislature, and no nationally-elected President, a coalition of faction can rule the nation until the next election."

"Probably referring to the fact that you see each other less and less and eventually it could become once a year; you also could have mis-heard him.  The more you dwell on these kind of things the worse it seems- you should have called him soon after and laughed, saying ""See you next year?! Very funny!"".  That would have broken the ice- you can still do this if it hasn't been too long..."
Well, I do know for a fact that a cardio exercise will burn fat. Step aerobics, walking on a treadmill, & dance these all burn calories. But you must do a cardio exercise at least 30 min 3 times a week. To see rapid results a hour 5 days a week. The Weight lifting also burns calories but also builds muscle. If you eat right & exercise you can turn fat calories into fuel and gain muscle and trim your self. Remember muscle weights more than fat. So if you get on the scale and you don't see a dramatic change at first don't get discouraged. If I were you I would do a combo of both cardio for 20-30min then lift for 40-30min. You should notice a change within 3-5 weeks.
That is crazy. Think about what you are saying.\n\n1) you are 13--extremely dangerous to start at such a young age.\n\n2) you weigh 98 pounds at 5'2! WOW!

..Firstly, I think you have made a clear decision to come out clean and away from alcohol. Congrats.\n\nI do not have personal experience in it, however I would like to encourage you to think long term as oppose to quick fix.\n\nYou have certain skill set from your past experince as a bodybuilder, so i guese you know what it takes to stay in a gym. Get a few friends who are interested to work out with you. I am sure, they can learn something from your experience. Its time you give or teach others something positive.
I had the same problem sometimes too.\n\nNow I drink at least five glasses of water a day to stay hydrated (but don't drink a lot just before running though).\n\nAlso, I eat at least one banana every day (usually in the morning with breakfast).  Bananas contain lots of potassium, which helps prevent cramps.\n\nAlso, do a full-body stretch (not just your legs) before -- and after -- running.  Besides stretching your legs, also stretch your arms, shoulders, back, and obliques (sides).  \n\nTo stretch the obliques, clasp your fingers together and then put them above your head, with your palms facing up.  Then dip your left shoulder down to stretch your right obliques.  Dip your right shoulder down to stretch the left obliques.

the taste and smell of sperm relates to what you eat and go with your body like you said. Healthy sperm does have a more distinct flavor than toxic sperm. They do make pills you can get on the net that are highly concentrated fruit poweder, so your man's cum, if he eats the pilss 2 hours before sex, can tast like bannana or oranges. You can also eat lots of those fruits and your cum will taste sweet and smell good.

Treatment consists of forcing use of the amblyopic eye either by patching or instilling topical atropine in the eye with better vision [4].\n\nAlthough the best outcome is achieved if treatment is started before age 5, research has shown that children older than age 10 and some adults can show improvement in the affected eye. Children from 7 to 12 who wore an eye patch and performed near point activities (vision therapy) were four times as likely to show a two line improvement on a standard 11 line eye chart than amblyopic children who did not receive treatment. Children 13 to 17 showed improvement as well, albeit in smaller amounts than younger children. (NEI-funded Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group, 2005)\n\nPeople with amblyopia have difficulty seeing the three-dimensional images in autostereograms such as Magic Eye.\n\nSome claim that the Bates Method can reverse amblyopia [5]\nTreatment:\n• Lack of vitamins B1 and B12 appears to be a primary cause. Smoke from cigarettes and cigars is another significant cause. These problems need to be solved. \n\n• B12 intermuscularly at a rate of 1,000 mcg/day for a total of 20,000 mcg generally solves the problem, along with an adequate supply of vitamin D and calcium.

It's possible that you can get pregnant. But my advise to you is do not give it an abortion. Your boyfriend will be responsible for this baby, so make sure he will find out a way  to support you and the baby. But if it is hopeless, and you can't raise your child, give him/her to the adoption center.
Ideally you want to take your body weight times 12 or 13 to get the number of daily calories for weight loss.  So for example if you weigh 150 you would need to eat 1800 calories a day (150 x 12).  You can divide this over 5-6 meals a day so you would have 300 calories for each of your 6 meals.  Eating smaller meals every 2 to 2.5 hours will help in keeping you feeling full throughout the day and you should be drinking plenty of water as well.  These meals should consist of protein, healthy carbs, and healthy fats (olive oil, avocado, small amount of nuts), these are monosaturated, and healthy fats, which aid in weight loss.  Cut out saturated and trans fat.  Cut out all processed and fast food and alot of sugar and white bread, and rice, etc.  This will get you on track to lose 1-2 lbs a week, if you're losing more than that add more calories, if you're losing less than 1lb a week, slowly cut the calories a bit ; like 250-300 per day.  Good luck
You really should have started trying a few days ago. The best time would be about 2 days before ovulation to give the sperm time to reach the egg. Sperm are not very fast and could use the extra time especially since the egg has limited viability (24-48 hours). If you don't get pregnant this month, you may want to test next month with a predictor that gives you a day or two advanced notice. If I find the exact speed for sperm I'll modify my answer to give you a more exact idea. Good luck.
"OMG - WHERE on earth did Meshelle get her information?!\n\n  Cellulose is an indigestible fiber that can be ingested. Cellulose itself does not absorb fat. It passes through your digestive system relatively unchanged.  Cellulose is used by many dieters because it add's ""bulk"" to the system and makes you feel full. It is also widely used in fiber-type laxatives (like Fibercon)\n\nThere are compounds that do absorb fat - available only by PRESCRIPTION (The drug is called Xenical and will absorb about 30% of dietary fat in the colon).  There are lots of over the counter diet aids that will claim to absorb fat (Chitosan is one) but clinical trials have proven that this is an out and out lie.  They can continue to claim this in their advertising though because they are considered ""dietary supplements"" and not drugs. Don't waste your money.\n\nNow CELLULITE, is another story. It's the dimpled areas on our butts and thighs. It causes by a tightening of the connective tissue the crisscrosses everyone's fat.  It is hereditary and gets worse as we age. It can be broken down mechanically by a process called ENDERMOLOGY. (Basically a big vibrating roller is massaged across the areas to break down the cellulite."
Cut out your carbs. Eat more protein. Do more cardio in the gym; running, biking, swimming are all great. Work out with weights, but be careful and consult a doctor before starting any new workout routine. \n\nOne other thing for quick results; and I DO NOT recommend this, but one way wrestlers drop weight quickly is by doing a hard workout wearing a rubber suit under sweats. You can use plastic trash bags in place of the rubber suit. The down sides to this method are 1) it is not healthy, you could become dehydrated, and 2) this is not a long term solution because all you are losing is water weight.

Each person has two genes that determine their blood type. with an A+, they would have either two A+'s, or an A+ and an A-. It is the same with B+. They will have either two B+'s, or a B+ and a B-. Each parent will contribute one gene to their child. So if the parents each contribute a negative blood type (B- and A-) then the child will be AB-. Negative blood types are recessive, and need two of them to be present in order for the blood type to be the dominant one. in all other scenarios (parents both donating positive blood A+ and B+, or one parent donating positive, the other negative A+ B-, or A- B+) the child will have AB+ blood type.\n\noh, there is a possibility that each parent is carrying a recessive O gene. in the case that both parents give the child an O gene, the child will have type O blood.\n\n\ni hope this answered your question, but i am unsure what you are talking about with the 7?
I was a patient in a Spanish hospital about 5 years ago.  I had cut my foot badly while running and needed sutures. This was in Seville.  Compared to a U.S. hospital, I felt like I was about 50 years back in time.  The wheelchairs were wooden, the doctor sewing me did not have an assistant, they used silk suture which is not modern, and the anesthetic injections were quite painful. \nBut, the people were friendly, they did give me a tetanus shot, my foot healed eventually, and it was all free.

As with all surgery there are inherant risks but prostate surgery does not lead to urinary incontinence all of the time. It all depends on the procedure as there are different forms of prostate surgery. The greatest risk of urinary incontince would follow a prostatectomy- which is the complete removal of the prostate gland. It is not the removal of the prostate itself which causes the incontince but the possible destruction of detrusor muscles at the neck of the bladder during removal of the prostate. This leads to having no control of the sphincter muscles in the bladder and thus incontinence. Other forms of prostate surgery include trans urethral resection of prostate- a key hole operation to 'shave' away excess prostate growth that occurs in cancer of the prostate or benign prostatic hyperplasia.Urinary incontinence is far less common in this treatment.

Colds are caused by viruses. These viruses affect the upper respiratory tract consisting of the nose,mouth and throat. There is proximity and actual connection between the respiratory tract and the ear thus maikng it easy for the spread of the virus to the ear. The virus causes inflamation of the eyes (conjuctivitis), nose (rhinitis), throat(laryngitis), and if it spreads to the ear(otitis).\nInfalmation causes the release of histamines which cause itching to release sites eg itchy ears, throat, etc.

I am amazed by the amount of misinformation in the responses thus far.  Although statistics vary, current estimates are that between 15% and 35% of the time HIV will be perinatally passed from pregnant women to their children.\n\nThe rate of perinatal transmission among babies studied since 1986 by the NYC-based maternal transmission study is 28%, which follows the rule that not every exposure leads to HIV infection. There is some evidence that transmission is more likely if the woman is HIV symptomatic, but asymptomatic women can also pass the virus to their children.\n\nInfants born to HIV positive women will test HIV antibody positive at birth due to passive immunity - being born with some of their mother's antibodies. As infants develop their own immune systems (including antibodies) they replace the passive immunity antibodies with their own antibodies.\n\nThis process is usually completed by 8-10 months of age, but not later than 15 months. Most medical practitioners use 18 months as the cut-off point for a definitive antibody test result.\n\nBottom Line:\nThere is no way for a male to infect a fetus directly. However, every sexual encounter you have while attempting to impregnate a women increases her risk of contracting HIV from you. If she becomes infected then there is a chance 15-30% chance that she may transmit it to her fetus. Regardless, if you plan on having children, both you and your partner need to have serious discussions with experts in the field of HIV medicine.
I haven't heard anything, but the best thing I've taken for my lupus is a product called ambrotose. I don't have to take the recommended drugs thanks to ambrotose, and my hair has grown back, my skin has cleared up and I haven't had a flare up in five years. It's all natural but it's not a cure all, it builds your immune system and helps promote cell to cell communication. Basically it gives your body a fighting chance whether you have lupus, cancer, ms,diabetes or any other health issue.Here are some sites if you would like to check it out: www.glycostory.com/teamval and for a more scientific review www.glycoscience.org, here you can check out the disease specific review.

A herniated disk is a rupture of the intervertebral disc of the spine. When this occurs, the cushion that sits between the spinal vertebra is pushed outside its normal position. A herniated disc would not be a problem so often if it weren't for the spinal nerves that are very close to the edge of the intervertebral disc.

(The cardiologist that placed the device should provide instructions).\n3) Do not shower until allowed to do so.\n4) Report any signs/symptoms of infection. (redness around incision, discharge from incision, fever, etc.)\n5) Take prescribed pain meds as needed/directed

Did you know that one hamburger can be made up from as many as 400 heads of cattle?  They just keep grinding and grinding and grinding...god help us if one of those cows is diseased, it can end up in a helluva lot of burgers.  *barf*
If they are specifically labeled for men then they probably contain specific minerals that men require for their health and the same goes for women; women require more calcium to prevent bone loss.  If they have a general label then they can be taken by men or women.

Start setting your alarm after 9 hours and see how you feel. You might not feel well rested the first week, however keep doing it for another week, and see how you feel. I think you may be getting to much sleep. Try that and see how it works!

Some hymens are easy to tear, only a thin band of tissue. Some are very hard to get rid of and can even require surgery to cut it. Most hymens are moderate. A lot of girls break them with actual penatrative sex (as in, penis or some other object inside the vagina). I'm sorry people are harassing you for your grammar. I assume english is not your first language? It's ok. You're understandable enough, and your typing probably isn't helped by you being upset. Don't worry ok? The rest of this is just a copy and paste of my previous answer.\n\nNo, orgasm cannot tear the hymen of a virgin girl, if she does actually have a hymen. Some women are born without one. Many tear it using tampons, horseback riding, even bicycling. Again, your hymen should still be intact after an orgasm provided it was in the first place and you have inserted nothing into you.

"If, when asked to recite the alphabet, one says ""a"" followed by ""z"" and then stops, that person has not multi-tasked because the task has not been completed regardless of sequencing issues.  Multi-tasking only occurs when the given task is executed to completion.  Either your example is flawed or the assumption of multi-tasking is flawed.\n\nIn computing, multi-tasking requires a minimum of 3 processes: two processes that share the assigned work and one that supervises the functional tasks to insure that they are performed in sequence (and sequencing does matter) and monitors for completion of tasks A and B.  These processes can be assigned to three different CPUs.  While the human brain does have multiple parts, I have not heard of cognition occuring separately in the parts.\n\nIs it possible to think two distinctly different thoughts simultaneously?  My inclination is to say no, the subject is merely jumping from one thought to another and back rapidly - not truly multi-tasking.  Can you cite the basis and origin(s) of the multi-tasking diagnosis?  Would very much like to follow up on this interesting line of thought."

do an entire ab routine every night before bed consisting of 50 sit ups, 45 crunches, 40 leg lifts while on back, 30 circular leg lifts while on back, then raise your legs 6 inches off the floor for as long as you possibley can. you probably wont be able to do all this on your first night, but stick with it and i promise you a leaner tummy.
I'm sure you know the answer to this is you should see a health professional immediately.  There are several reasons you might get dizzy and pass out for awhile; you didn't eat that day, you have some type of virus, you're under stress - to name a few.  It could also be something serious.  Don't wait, go see someone as soon as you can!

Dude, it really doesn't take that long to get a six-pack.  I started working out in January, and have one now (after not working out for years).  Here's what you do:\n\nWork out 3 times a week, doing about 20 mins of cardio (rowing machine is great for abs, and upper body) and 40-70 minutes of weights (including abs).  Target each muscle group in your weight-training workout, doing about 3 sets of 9-12 reps on each muscle group except abs (chest, back, shoulders, biceps, triceps, quads, hamstrings, and calves).  Focussing on proper form instead of heavier weight, will cause you to grow and be cut a lot better and faster.\n\nFor abs specifically, use a decline-situp bench, and do as many twist crunches as you can (twist to one side at the top of each crunch, then twist to the other side, alternating).  Then use an ab roller, going straight, for as many reps as you can.  Next, do leg-lefts (keeping your legs straight) to target your lower abs.\n\nIn a few weeks, you should have a great 6-pack!  : )
yes you can. there is no shot for hep-c. and one thing to let you know hep is a blood to blood transfer. stay away for needles drugs or tatoos that is how most of the hep-c is spread. my wife had hep-c and we were very active in the bedroom without protection. after 2 years i never got it myself and she got it from drug use years ago. so don't let that stop you from loving someone.

It sounds like multiple chemical sensitivity, Your immune system is getting weakened by the toxic chemicals that todays manufacturers are using in their products. It is not all uncommon, my wife suffered from migrains until the day I found out about these chemicals and the myrad of problems they cause.

The links below will give you some idea about the chemicals used.

Surgery is a rapid and effective treatment. The surgeon reaches the pituitary through an incision in the nose and, with special tools, removes the tumor tissue in a procedure called transsphenoidal surgery. This procedure promptly relieves the pressure on the surrounding brain regions and leads to a lowering of GH levels. If the surgery is successful, facial appearance and soft tissue swelling improve within a few days. Surgery is most successful in patients with blood GH levels below 40 ng/ml before the operation and with pituitary tumors no larger than 10 mm in diameter. Success depends on the skill and experience of the surgeon. The success rate also depends on what level of GH is defined as a cure. The best measure of surgical success is normalization of GH and IGF-1 levels. Ideally, GH should be less than 2 ng/ml after an oral glucose load. Complications of surgery may include cerebrospinal fluid leaks, meningitis, or damage to the surrounding normal pituitary tissue, requiring lifelong pituitary hormone replacement. Even when surgery is successful and hormone levels return to normal, patients must be carefully monitored for years for possible recurrence. More commonly, hormone levels may improve, but not return completely to normal. These patients may then require additional treatment, usually with medications.
15 lbs in 4 months is a very good pace. . . thats only about 3 or four lbs a month.  Basically you will need to eat about 500 calories less per day than what you need.  So lets say you are 180 lbs, and want to be 165.  you probably want to eat about 1800-1900 calories a day to maintain that weight.  so you want to eat about 1600-1700 day to lose weight gracefully.\n\n3500 calories=1 lbs.  adn to lose 15 lbs in four months, you should try to lose about 1 lb. a week!  Good luck!
Anxiety attacks are never easy. When you find yourself in a situation where you feel one coming on get tough with yourself, I am serious tell yourself to get over it. We are all afraid of things it is pure fear and being scared of being away from your safety zone, I would bet you do not get them when you are home alone. Perhaps you fear people judge you for being in a wheel chair? Well they don't, they might look and wonder but judge no. Try meditation and relaxation techniques to the point where they come naturally when you feel one come on. I too have suffered from anxiety attacks and became a recluse due to them. I finally put my foot down and said no way is this going to rule my life. If you are not already get yourself into counseling, find out what it is that has made you so fearful. Check and see if PTSD or BPD could be the cause (post traumatic stress disorder/border line personality disorder) Ask your counselor if EMDR is something that might help you. I wish you well in the future and I hope besides the drugs you are going to counseling you seriously need to get to the root of this problem. Good luck hun.
Sounds nutritious enough, I'd say go for it. I fully believe in rapid weight loss. Why let it rule your life for months. Get the body you want and go on with life. Good luck!
"Gain weight or muscles ? \nAnyway there are two ways:\nOne is the organic, the other in-organic.\nFor organic growth check out heredity: parents, grand parents etc., If they had been heavy built there is every chance you may yourself become so, with good diet.\nWell, inorganic way is by abusing your consumption with fatty/ high protein based diet or administering ""steriods"" like the WWF wrestlers. Still if your body type is 'mesomorph', you wouldn't gain weight but burn all consumed calories and eventually load your liver and kidneys. Take care. I am not a Dr / Nutritionist."

Most cross-dressers are not gay.  most are heterosexuals who feel sexual excitement from wearing women's clothes.  \n\nGays sometimes cross-dress also.  But most cross-dressers are not gay.

All the people I have known including myself like Body for Life; teaches them about healthy eating and resistance training.  The interval cardio workouts are great.  The results vary from person to person, but significant changes can be made in 12 weeks, though most are not near the pictures in the book.  An average of about 10lbs was lost, but they also added muscle and felt much better.  It's a good beginners book :); I'm not a beginner and didn't have much to lose, but this book helped me get motivated again and helped me get back into the gym.  good luck
Are you seeing results, I have been using probiotics for the last 8 months. I can can tell when I forget to take them within 24 hours, and when I do take them I can eat anything. The most important things to look for are the amount of live cultures (mine has 5 billion) are they acid resistant. Pay attention to the expiration date also. I get mine direct from a manufacturer for $12.99 for a 30 day supply and it also has a prebiotic in them to encourage the growth of the probiotic. Good luck finding a good one for the price!
the best way is to just go up and tell which ever parent you feel the most comfortable talking to.  the best thing that you could do to help with the depression is to see a professional.  i am bi-polar and i was ashamed and upset for a good many years that i didnt have to be.  after i sought professional help it was not long after that that i felt like a whole new person.  i have to take medicine but it is like night and day from how i used to be.  please talk to your parents and let them know what is going on so that they can help you.

Life is full of lies. It's never justifiable but look it's life. Not reason to go back to square one. Chances are it's not going to be better there. Accept it. Chances are love grows.

lipo 6 is a thermogenic fat burner.  it probably does make you alert.  it's got caffeine and yohimbe hcl (increase bloodflow).  although i hear it works pretty well, i've also heard some bad stuff about it...namely that it raises blood pressure.  also, guggulsterones (another ingredient in it) look to be harmful to both gains and even slightly to health (by blocking the receptor that produces testosterone and activating the progesterone receptor).  \n\ntry scorch v3.  i've never had to use a fat burner but this one seems to be popular and doesn't have the guggulsterones in it.

If you are suffering from this you should be seeing a medical professional. Bipolar usually required medication which you need to get from a doctor. How come your doctor is not giving you any information about the logorrhea? Next time you go, make sure you ask for infor about it!\n\nAlso, are you sure you are spelling it right? Maybe that's why you can't find any info on it?\n\nIf you still can't find the info you're after, go to yahoo groups and find a group for bipolar. I'm sure you would be able to find someone with info on there.\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/search?query=bipolar
Nope! I don't hate it. My wife and I laugh and giggle when it happens but I can understand that it can be embarrassing on a first date! \nIf you are concerned about it, avoid the positions where the man is behind and the woman on hands and knees.
As much as you want.  Actually its perfectly healthy!!!
If you are having severe pain in your breasts it could be something worth checking out. I would go to the doctor and have him/her check you out. \nIf it's just normal period PMS crap...you can use motrin to help with the PMS symptoms....Good luck!!
Sounds like a good height.
If you want to gain weight quickly you need to consider your carbs and proteins. Eggs are great for increasing fat in your body but not necessarily weight cause they are low calories. \n\nRefer to higher calorie and higher fat foods. Go for the following diet: \n\nBreakfast - 3 oranges squeezed + 2 pieces of toast w baked beans and butter\nSnack - 2 long savoury type biscuit w butter cheese & tomato\nLunch - 2 soy & linseed sandwiches w butter, ham, cheese, tomato gilled OR 3 egg omlette w cheese, ham, tomato.\nSnack -  banana & honey smoothie (full cream milk)   \nDinner - always eat rice/noodle or pasta based meals with plenty of vegies\n\nThis should do it.

the eye doctor can look at your glasses and tell you the prescription that they are so you can get a new pair.  or, if you pick out a new frame that will fit the lenses you have, you can have them trimmed to fit and that way you can save some money as you won't have to buy new lenses.  but, if it's been more than a year or two, the doctor may have you take a new exam anyway.  i have to do it every year to get my contact perscription refilled even though the scrip hasn't changed in over 5 years.

The best way to lose weight is through a balance of proper nutrition and exercise.  Its an easy formula and most people know it but let me briefly restate.  If you burn more calories than you eat then you will burn off excess fat.\n\nNow, saying it is one thing, the real challenge is doing it.  It would be nice if there was a quick fix but there isn't.  The good news is that changing your lifestyle is nowhere near as boring or as painful as people think.\n\nPlease don't go on a diet, they simply don't work.  The very idea of depriving yourself of food for a limited period and then returning to your 'normal' lifestyle doesn't work no matter how much people talk about it.\n\nEat everything you like but slowly decrease the amount and slowly substitute healthier foods.  Tastes change and I now actually like things that I never thought I would.\n\nI've been an exercise consultant and people often ask me: 'Whats the best kind of exercise?' and I often tell them: 'The best kind of exercise is one that you will do.'\n\nThere is no best exercise or best diet.  The best exercise is any exercise that you like and that fits your daily schedule.  The best diet is to eat things you like but slowly evolve towards healthier choices.\n\nBe patient.  Be determined.  Enjoy.  Good Luck.

You should have her try inserting her fingers into you to stimulate your G spot while she pleases you orally.  This is probably the little extra you need.  Also, if that doesn't work, they do sell the part of the anatomy she is missing in a double header, you could try that.
"Masturbation is the act of getting yourself to reach orgasm without sexual intercourse, or oral stimulation(oral sex). Terms suchs as ""jacking off"" and ""beating off"" are the most common slang words for the act of masturbation.\n\nScientific answer:\n\nMasturbation is the manual excitation of the sexual organs, most often to the point of orgasm. It can refer to excitation either by oneself or by another (see mutual masturbation). It is part of a larger set of activities known as autoeroticism, which also includes the use of sex toys and non-genital stimulation. There are also masturbation machines used to simulate intercourse. Masturbation and sexual intercourse are the two most common sexual practices, but they are not mutually exclusive (for example, many people find the sight of their partner masturbating highly erotic). Some people are able to achieve orgasm only through masturbation and not sexual intercourse. In the animal kingdom, masturbation has been observed in many mammalian species, both in the wild and in captivity."

Is it possible that you are pregnant if you have missed your period? Yes it is. So are a lot of other things possible. If you are concerned, go to the doctor and find out exactly what the cause is (it could be something as simple as losing a few pounds).

First of all, it is the absolutely most painful thing you'll ever feel, even more than having a baby c-section. It takes about 6-weeks to recover. Your breasts will be beautiful and perky but the scars are pretty bad and very noticeable. It is worth it if you have problems though!
I cannot help but wonder when I see questions of this sort how :1) You came up with the time period, did you consider less or more than five years for instance?\n     2) You decided what the reward would be,for instance couldnt the dreams be  once or twice a week instead of whenever you wanted?\n     3) You paired these two things up?\nAnyway! , For me the answer would definitely be no!
Excess salt is secreted in pretty much every bodily fluid. Some is normal, you sweat and as it dries it leaves behind a residue.\nIf you think this is a lot, then try cutting down your salt intake. Read labels, some foods contain lots and you just don't realise it.\nDehydration can also cause this, as the salt is secreted with less water and therefore is more concentrated.\nAs always, if you have any genuine concerns see a doctor.
About a month, depending on how extensive the surgery was.
I have the same condition, it is called temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome.  The most common underlying causes of TMJ syndrome are stress and a poor bite, together with clenching and grinding of the teeth (bruxism), especially at night.  \n\nYou might want to consider wearing a special mouth guard at night, which your dentist can make for you.  \n\nAlso, avoid high-stress foods: refined sugar, all white-flour products, all junk foods, candy, colas, potato chips, pies and fast foods.  Do not consume high alcoholic beverages as these are common contributing factor in teeth grinding.\n\nTMJ syndrome has also been caused by bad posture, habits such as cradling the telephone between the shoulder and jaw, repeated or hard blows to the jaw and chin, or whiplash.  Poor dental work and orthodontia may also aggravate the problem, as can habits such as gum-chewing, thumb-sucking and chewing excessively on one side of the mouth.

6 hours is fine if you still feel good during your waking hours and your brain is working the way it should.

I've had 2 so far. The first one I didn't feel at all. They numbed it up so I couldn't feel it. I was so comfortable i could of went to sleep.\nThe second one had complications. The dentist couldn't get all the root out. It had calcified. He got out most of it but I could feel it when he was trying to get it out even though he numbed me up. i think it was cause of the complication. It was pain but not enough to make me cry. I just let him know I felt it.

I guess you need to be careful when learning about the introverts. And I find this question is a bit offensive, because you measure us from an extrovert point of view.\n\nYou must know, that most of the psychological criteria just list the condition of certain mental illnesses or disorders. There are no clear words or lines in the DMS-IV-TR, says that we introverts are prone to suffer from Neurosis.\n\nI believe there are many different reasons behind for people to suffer depression, anxiety, low sense of self-worth, and so on. Having such conditions, doesn't really mean that a person suffering from Neurosis.\n\nWhy we introverts have similar conditions? Is just simply from excessive loneliness that we experiencing, which cause by incapable of making and keeping friends.

I had a dream I saw Jesus in Jerusalem when I was a very little girl.  I lived in the mid-west, but in the dream we were in Jerusalem.  I thought I saw something, so I left my mother and went into an alley.  The alley was really dark, and every so often there were people who were playing out Jesus's life.  When I got to the end, he was there.  He held out his hand, and I woke up.\nI only had this dream once, but boy do I remember it!

It is most important to keep the skin scrupulously clean.\n\n1.Use an oatmeal or almond mask throughly to cleanse your face. Mix either oatmeal or almond powder with enough rose water to make a soft paste that spreads easily on the skin. Rub it on your skin with your fingertips, paying special attention the problem areas. Leave to dry for about 15 minutes and then rinse off with cold water.\n\n2.Apply undiluted lemon juice, two to three times a day, on the affected areas.\n\n3.A solution made out of one and a half cups of hot water and half a tablespoon of boric powder is an ideal concoction for blackheads, Saturate a face napkin in this hot solution and press on to the skin, repeat twice. Extract blackheads carefully with a blackhead remover and sterilized cottonwool. Pat on an astrigent.\n\n4.Warm a little honey and apply on the trouble spots. Wash off after 10-15 minutes.
Whitening toothpastes only work up to a point (usually only remove surface stains, and only partially because they work by abrasion). If you really want to whiten your teeth, get some sort of tooth whitening product, or better yet, go see you dentist.\n\nOne additional note on tooth whitening products. The main active ingredient in them is hydrogen peroxide, the maximum level of which is regulated in the EU. The problem is that in the case of cosmetics products (basically anything you can buy in a regular shop) the maximum level allowed is not enough to actually whiten teeth. So whatever you find on shop shelves either doesn't really work, or if it does, it's not entirely legal. Regulations in the US are different and peroxide levels in products there are much higher.

Have you ever been tested for PCOS? It can cause cyst and missed periods. About 5 to 10% of women have it and is the most common hormonal reproductive problem in women of childbearing age. Pelvic pain and infrequent menstrual periods are a symptom. You should do to a gyno and find out what is going on. If its just a Cyst they may put you on the pill to get it to leave, and to make you have a period every month so that you will not have any more.\n\nLinks about pcos:\nhttp://www.pcosupport.org/medical/whatis.php\nhttp://www.webmd.com/hw/womens_conditions/tw9104.asp

Yes, she could possibly still have part of her hymen, particularly if she didn't bleed--either she didn't have one to begin with, or it didn't get stretched or torn enough.  \n\nHave you tried using lubricants?  That might help--there's a lot of friction down there, it could hurt without a good lube.    \n\nIs it possible that she's nervous...maybe worried that someone else will hear, worried about getting pregnant, anything.  If she's not relaxed, the muscles down there will tighten up and make things painful.\n\nThis is something she should ask her gynocologist about, if nothing seems to help.  Don't worry, gynocologists hear this sort of thing all the time.  They will be able to tell if there's a physiological problem.  \n\nSex is both a mental and a physical thing.  If she's worried, nervous, thinking about something else, has a hormonal problem, still has her hymen, doesn't have enough lubricant...all of those things and more can contribute to it.

I had a similar problem about two years ago. It turned out that I had a weird bladder infection. It cleared up with two weeks of antibiotics but it was worrisome and frustrating when I didn't know what it was.\n\nReally, only a doctor can diagnosis WHAT it is. Possiblities include bladder infection, kidney infection, ovreactive bladder, diabetes and a bunch of other stuff.\n\nThings you can do to cope are limit your fluid intake (which you are already doing) and maybe even look into adult diapers (I know it's embarassing but it's better to have protection then get caught standing in a puddle in the middle of the super market). I think they make large super absorbant pads that are a little like wearing a menstral pad but thicker. Those might be less embarassing than adult diapers.\n\nGood luck, I know it's frustrating to wait to get into the specialist.
Any medication can cause side-effects. Whether it's a known one or not, you should consult your doctor about this.
Bipolar's are on meds for the rest of their life and a doctor to do their med check.  They should also have therapy pretty regular and a really good support group for then to lean on.
What do you need to know? I've been on it most of my adult life.
I believe you're talking about mad cow disease. Very contagious through contact with any bodily fluid.
Eat food more than 3 times a day. Make sure thst it is rich in carbohydrates and fats. Always have a midnight snack. Right after you wake up eat foods. You can also do what sumo wrestlers do. Right after they eat their food they go to sleep. Make sure that you do not do plenty of activities.
"Do you mean chikungunya?\nChikungunya is a relatively rare form of viral fever caused by an alphavirus that is spread by mosquito bites from the Aedes aegypti mosquito. The name is derived from the Makonde word meaning ""that which bends up"" in reference to the stooped posture developed as a result of the arthritic symptoms of the disease. The disease was first described by Marion Robinson[1] and W.H.R. Lumsden[2] in 1955, following an outbreak on the Makonde Plateau, along the border between Tanganyika and Mozambique, in 1952. Chikungunya is closely related to O'nyong'nyong virus[3].\n\nChikungunya is not considered to be fatal. However, in 2005-2006, 77 deaths have been associated with chikungunya on Réunion island.\n\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms of chikungunya include fever which can reach 39 °C, a petechial or maculopapular rash usually involving the limbs and trunk, and arthralgia or arthritis affecting multiple joints which can be debilitating. There can also be headache, conjunctival injection and slight photophobia."
Its not really a case of right or wrong, but are the risks worth it?\n\nSince we live in an appearance based society the risks of plastic surgery would be justified in extreme cases of birth defects or deformaties due to accidents. Using it to perfect ones already better than average looks is nothing more than feeding the ego.
this is bad. you should go see a doctor. i have s light case of bulimia. i only purge when i get mad though. but you know that when yuo throw up you damage your throat because of the acid that comes up from your stomach.

It could very well delay or skip for many reasons.  I am not Diabetic, but I have PCOS (polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) and I take metformin which control blood suger so I follow diabetic standards to reduce risk.  But just the stress of finding out, sudden weight gain or loss can cause one to prolong or skip.  It will all level out I promise.  If you are worried find some diabetic groups in your area, they are always very welcoming.
Sweetheart be GRATEFUL you haven't had your period! Everyone starts at different times! WHen you do you cramp, have backaches, headaches, your tired, your cranky, your bloated. trus me when I say there is NOTHING exciting about getting your monthly visitor, unless you did something stupide, and you are glad she came!
the problem could be the formaldehyde in the plastics of the AC units... try letting it run a few times all day long while you are gone to work or school or someplace... \n\nthe new in your ac should go away sooner or later so that you can stand to be in the same room with it...\n\nanother idea- try changing the filter - the one that came on it may be full of lint and dust from shipping\n\ngood luck- \nsusan
Yes, I have chronic Pancreatitis, i had to have two major surgeries on my pancreas. This can be very dangerous so i would keep a eye on him if he gets worse take him to the emergency room. Also if he drinks alcohol have him quit as this can be very bad fot the pancreas. And you have to be on a low fat diet also. I would take him to see a gastrologist to see what is going on.
Put red dots all over your face and arms with a felt tipped marker, and tell your folks that they'd better stay away because you think you have measles.
soak in an Aveeno Oatmeal bath.  Wash your sheets in an unscented/no dye detergent, as well as the rest of your clothes.  sounds like an allergic reaction to a soap.

Could be some sort of inflammation or infection of your sinuses. Couldnt say for sure since the only symptom you describe is pain behind your eyes. If you are able to, try a decongestant, like Sudafed, and see if that relieves any of the pain/pressure. If so, you may need to get some medication for your sinuses, like antibiotics, or antihistamines if this is cause by allergies.
LOL...a kidney stone is definitely NOT likely to cause her to test postively for meth.  \n\nOn the other hand, doing METH and lying about it to family and friends, well...yes, THAT will cause a true positive every time.
Removing a wisdom teeth can be either a simple extraction or a surgical extraction.Upper wisdom teeth are usually a simple extraction.For our bones in the maxilla(our upper jaw)is porous,which makes it the upper wisdom teeth to remove easily.Where as the lower wisdom teeth,bones in the mandible(our lower jaw)are dense,which make it harder to remove it.And lower wisdom teeth are usually impacted,though not all,so that means taking a impacted wisdom teeth will involve making a flap(cutting your gums)and sectioning(splitting the tooth into 2 or more)the tooth.and a stitches will be put on,a disolvable.There are some risk factor in taking a wisdom teeth,that you should be aware of.One is,there are some nerves involve in taking a lower wisdom teeth that will cause a permanent numbness.And some will have a broken jaw.Discuss further about wisdom teeth to your Dentist before the operation.
muscle weighs more than fat.\n\nDon't worry about the number on the scale. Instead, focus on how your body FEELS, or how your clothes fit on you. That way, you'll see that you're gaining endurance and strength, and looking and feeling better, no matter what your absolute weight.
I also think you are. But believe, life can still be great. I was 17 when a gave birth to my first son. I can to drop out of college and all. But I had plan to do something with my live. I still finish my degree in accounting. And now I have three sons, maybe trying for a fourth.Things look bad when your in it, but go with your heart. My son was born with cancer and has had 23 operation before he was 6. Anything is possible, you just set yourself goals and work for it. Good luck little mother. Let me know what are the out comes.
he needs to inquire with her care giver there, what happened and why.\n\nif he is given the run-around, then he needs to get an attorney and file-malpractice suit with the institution or Dr. she was with.\n\nEVERY SINGLE thing that was done to her, given to her, etc should be documented in her medical file at the state hospital.  if not, then they were negligent and can be held accountable.  also, he needs to be able to prove with dental records that those teeth were present and hadn't been pulled prior to her stay with the state.\n\ngood luck and take care.
It is very hard to keep braces clean in the first place. I suppose the best thing to do is to brush always with a baking soda/peroxide toothpaste...and perhaps find a similar concotion to submerge your rubber bands in.
"Depending on the type and size of a heart attack, and how it was treated, the damage done by a heart attack can be reversed.  Sometimes, if the heart attack is small enough and is treated with clot busting agents quickly enough, there can be something called ""reperfusion"" of the heart muscles.  With reperfusion, sometimes the heart muscle can be saved.  \n\nAlthough tests (echocardiogram or treadmill) can be abnormal in the period immediately following this type of small, well treated heart attack, sometimes the heart muscle ""hibernates"" and is not actually dead.  Return of function can be seen months later.\n\nThe best way to encourage this return to function, would be to follow your doctor's advice and engage in a good cardiac rehabilitation program.  Even if you have had a heart attack where some of the muscle has died, a cardiac rehab program can put you on the path to recovery."
If you can get acrylic its less expensive and more durable. You'll still have to get them replaced in about 10 years, but the risk of breakage is less.\n\nMy EX-dentist had convinced me to use porcelain. I should have known better than to go to someone who was proud of his celebrity clientele. The veneers were hand made in a lab, which I had to go to in person so the labtech could check for himself shade and shape.  It was overkill--it felt like I kept going back for visits both to the dentist and the lab week after week until it was finally done....When it was done, I could see the blue-grey tinge of the metallic post underneath the porcelain, and it was NOT attractive. \n\nThen within three years one of them cracked and fell off! I was already very careful with them (hardly ever biting with them if I could avoid it) so I was really upset. I had to find a dentist quickly and the new dentist got the job done in just two visits, using acrylic--not porcelain. It looks even better than the original and it was a fraction of the cost (hundreds vs. thousands)\n\nSo research who you use and compare costs--try the website below--and if you do decide to do it, don't let anyone talk you into getting something way more involved and expensive than necessary. \n\nGood luck!
"I've heard it before that someone would pretend to be a disabled and try to kidnap/rape you. I also once saw such ""scam"" in a movie. However, if he were really a disabled and needed such help, it would look as if we're all very indifferent and didn't care about lending a helping hand. So my suggest would be if you heard such a request, ask him to wait for a moment. You then ask a security guy or cop/policeman nearby to accompany you to go together."

In my country (and in most others, I believe), a person needs to be a registered psychologist, psychiatrist or other mental health/intelligence professional. This will generally involve a bare minimum of 6 years of full-time training.\nThere are a number of intelligence tests out there, however, none of them are really that good.\n\nMost intelligence tests are pen-and-paper tests. The Weschler Intelligence Scale is probably the most widely used, or the Stanford-Binet. They are both pen and paper and consist of a number of exercises. You do the test and then it is marked and your scores are compared to standardized test norms. Then an overall IQ score is given - but good testers will give you a range that they are 95% certain that your 'real' intelligence would fit in.\n\nMost intelligence tests out there are really poor in theory and only measure a few different types of intelligence that should be measured. For example, the WISC-IV for children only measures 4-5 of the 10 types of intelligence that have been proposed by what is currently seen as the best theory of intelligence. \nSimilar things apply to adult intelligence testing.\n\nAny intelligence test can ONLY be a rough guide and while there are a number of standardized scales, none of them really do the job well. If you want to get given a test, ask your assessor if they use a cross-battery approach to determine your intelligence. If they do, it means that they will assess more different aspects of your intelligence than if they simply give a single test. \n\nThe tester should look at how you perform in a number of different areas. Some of these are things like reading and writing or general knowledge (Crystallized intelligence, really based in culture and education), while others are more things such as reaction time and processing speed. \n\nI think that it is labelling. In some ways, it can be very beneficial to have a label - for example, a child who has severe developmental delays. Without having that label, the child is not likely to be able to get the special help that she or he may need to suceed at life and instead be pushed through a standardized system that he/she just can't cope with.\nOn the other side of the coin is the gifted child who is bored out of their minds at school because they already kinow everything they're being taught. If they want to get into a gifted program, they might need that label!\n\nOf course, it could also be limiting - someone who scored as below-average when younger might have simply been in a different developmental stage and really be set to grow up with normal levels of intelligence but will instead always think that they're more 'stupid' than others and thus never really strive.\n\nI hope that helps to answer your question.
The short answer is that yes, it could be a sign of depression, but only if combined with several other factors.  I would advise you to go to the doctor and get checked out for physical problems - then if none are found, you should probably go to a psychiatrist for a consultation.  In addition, a full battery of psychological testing would be a good idea, if possible.  Check out the link below for the signs of depression - you have to have 4 or 5 most of the time, for at least 2 weeks, without a situational cause.
not 'EXTREME' but anything with caffeine can cause a certain amount harm to your unborn child. the doctor will tell you to avoid certain foods high in caffeine and sugar. (like coffee and soda)
Why haven't you taken her to a dermatologist or to her physician?  You should get medical advice regarding this, not laymen answers.  \n\nIt may be nothing or it could be a significant indication of something...seek medical treatment soon.
Run a search and type in Cardiologists in Glasgow, Scotland.  I did...it works.
"No! It's against the LAW for a doctor to explore any PART of your body while you're under, that is not a required field for surgery.\n\nI'm an RN and can tell you, that a female nurse MUST be present at all times during a female patient's surgery or gynochological exam.  The same applies for dental.\n\nWhat will happen when you go to sleep is a mind blower.\nYou never, ever feel yourself falling asleep because it happens so fast.\nYou won't feel scared or have a clue as to when you fell asleep.  It happens quickly.\n\nYou'll be talking and in the middle of a sentence, you'll wake up and ask ""What happened?  I thought you were going to perform surgery on me.""\n\nThe reply you'll get is, ""Sweetheart we already did it.\nYour brain enterprates that only a split second has passed.\n\nThey are going to put you to sleep with an anesthesia, we call ""twilight sleep.""  It's mild but keeps you asleep so you don't feel any pain.  You wake up quickly from it and will be able to go home as soon as you can walk without falling down.\n\nIt has a tendancy to make you a little wobbly for about a half hour after you wake up.\n\nTrust me, you will probably get a kick out of this.  It's over before you know it and you won't have any scarey feelings.\n\nYou will however probably feel just a tiny bit of nausea(sick to your stomach) for about half an hour after waking up as well.\nThis is normal and it goes away quickly.\n\nAny jittery or nervousness you will feel, is just the anesthesia wearing off and that too passes quickly.\n\nOnce you go through this experience, you will never be frighted again.\n\nI promise.  If ANYTHING, you'll probably get a kick out of it, like I mentioned earlier.\n\nThe only thing you'll remember is feeling REALLY GREAT before it's nighty night time, which takes only seconds."
I dislike giving oral but my man loves it so I oblige him sometimes....its my job to please him and of course HE PLEASES ME...REALLY REALLY GOOD...remember what goes around, comes around!
It depends on your age body chemsitry and what is causing your GAD\n\nI have been on a bunch of things and zoloft worked best for me but that doens't mean it would wourk best for everyone \n\nIf you talk to a doctor they will evaluate you and find out what you shoudl be on... You Myay not even need medicine at all, tehrapy could work for you it works for a lot of people with GAD\n\nwhatever medicine you do end up taking should be taken in conjuntion with seeing a therapist to find out how to cope with anxiety.
haha...its #2.  But ok.  There is this thing you can buy.. it is call Kefir...if you have an HEB where you live, I know you can find it there.  It is a yogurt type drink that has active bacteria cultures that aid in your digestive tract.. and help things run more smoothly.  Drink prune juice...that may help.  Also, look for a really good health food store...there are things that you can buy that help replace/ad the proper bacteria and such that you need in your colon.  I know there is a form of it that comes in powder.  You really have to search, and see what you can find in the natural foods/supplements area, especially if the doctors aren't going to help.\nGood luck.\n:)
DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU PUT THEM
A study done by researchers suggested that prolonged interaction between soft drinks and cavity like material does cause erosion...\n\nBut who keeps the soft drinks in their mouth for prolonged periods of time :-)
not unless you have an open sore. you should be more carful with things like that. Go get tested but no you can't get in unless you have an open sore.
That pretty much sums up how I feel at this exact moment!  I just want to crawl under the covers and not deal with anything or anybody, but I feel that I am responsible for all this stuff and if I don't do what I feel that I need to do, I will let everyone down.\n\nGlad to know I am not the only one!
Any kind of surgery requires any precautions.\nThe best ones are to follow your surgeon's and doctor's\norders.\nNever take you friends advice, because not everyone goes through the same kind of surgeries.\nAnd remember, just because a friend of yours went through LASIK, and it went fabulous for her or him, does not necessarily mean that they did not take any precautions.\nIf you see something unusual, consult your physician.\nThank you.
Sounds like hives...which I happen to have a case of myself.  The little circles they form are called wheals.  Do a google on urticaria...the formal name for hives.\n\nIf you have hives, treat them with antihistamines...ie, benadryl.  If you have an extrememly bad case...you may need need something from your doctor...perhaps, a prednisone injection.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nFeel better soon!
My step-dad went to an old indian women in southern califirnia and gave him this treatment. And yes it REALLY REALLY WORKS. Every morning swallow 2 tablespoons honey and 1/4 cup brown apple cider vinger.
"The brighter the red, the quicker its come directly from the cervix.

Most likely a cyst.
Been there, done that.  Although it can take quite a while with therapy, it's very likely you'll have to have surgury eventually.  After the surgury, it takes almost one year to fully recover and have normal usage again, but it's well worth it!
Well... The answer I am going to give you is not what you are wanting to hear! You have do what you didnt want to! Control your portions. Your stomach is only the size of your fist, so if you eat a cheeseburger, fries, and 24oz. of Coke, you have essentially eaten 6 times what your body should naturally be digesting at one time! Believe me, you would be surprised how full you really are when you eat like that. Also get used to eating 4 times a day instead of two big meals. This will supercharge your metabolism, which is what controls your whole body's energy and calorie distribution. \n     Secondly, you have to exercise, after all the body is a temple and its the only thing you truly have, so why not take care of it? You should do some sort of cardiovascular exercise and active activity for 4 hours spread out over a week. For example one day go for a walk for 30 minutes, the next day do some push ups, etc... Anything you can do to stay active and try to keep your heart rate elevated for the time you do exercise. Keep your head in it and remember to incorporate it into your life, and it wont seem so mundane! \nP.S. I strongly suggest you check with your doctor before taking any of this advice, because that is just what it is. Advice!!!! It worked for me when I weighed 240lbs. I now weigh 175! So good luck!
It could be both. Try smashing it up into a powder and taking it like BC or Goody's if it still is hard to get down, mix it with some peanut butter. If it's still to hard... it could be psychological.
try using cool cucumber.. just place them on ur closed eye.. alternatively, u can use a mix of curd around the area as well.. leave it for sometime and then wash it off.. best thing drink a lot of water and Sleep a lot.. also, since ur a female, u can apply light foundation if it helps!
You may be suffering from a medical condition that is called sleep apnea.. \nDo you snore? Heavily?\nIf then, you might want to see a doctor as it could be serious.\nCheck out the website http://www.sleepapnea.org/ for more information whether this could be it...
There are so many different reasons for it to be irregular. The biggest ones are not eating right and not getting enough nutrients, and also stress. I went through the same thing when I went through a very hard time in my last marriage. The stress didn't help and then also worrying about why I was not getting my period made it even worse. So make sure you are taking care of yourself!
Your nickname will be Daddy!!! Really though she should just take it the next day.

The only difference I know is that someone who is gay and has HIV or full blown AIDS is more proactive instead of reactive with their disease. They're more likely to get out there yelling and marching trying to get funding for research. A staight person generally shuts himself away and waits to die.

i think chlorine has bleaching properties... ;p\n\nwhen chlorinated water is regularly used such as in indoor pools or in taking baths and showers, it could eventually lighten your skin color...\n\nbut i'm not sure it works the same way when chlorinated water is used in outdoor pools. i think the supposedly effect of the treated water would eventually be negligible because of the exposure to the sun...
Yes... and the longer exposure to agent orange, the worse the problems are. \n\nI have relatives in Vietnam that have all kind of health and mental issues because of prolong exposure to agent orange what was prevalent in the water and food supply for years after the war ended. \n\nAgent orange was som ereal bad stuff, and shoudl never ever be used again.

The reason behind synchronous menstruation is that women (and men) secrete odorless molecules, called pheromones, in a manner as common as sweating. In fact, the sweat of many mammals contains pheromone chemicals. The molecules from one woman bounce and jiggle their way airborne and waft to another. Receptors in the nose detect the pheromones and the second woman responds by shortening or lengthening her menstrual period. Gradually, over the course of a few months, the periods of all the women living together synchronize in this way.\nMen have an effect too, men's pheromones also affect women's menstrual periods. Women respond to these pheromones by shortening their periods and having them more regularly. This was noted among women who had lengthy cycles pre-marriage and once they got married their menstrual cycles became shorter and regular.

Well your body stores fat in certain areas before others due primarily to genetics.  That's partially why you can see similarities among family members' body types, regardless of whether they are overweight or not. Men do tend to store fat in the belly region first, and something interesting is that women usually lose fat in their breasts before anywhere else. I'm sure you look fine - have fun working out!
Group insurance is the health insurance that you get from work. It is where the liability is spread over a group of people. In an individial policy the policyholder takes out the policy by themselves and they bare the risk. By risk I mean that when you get very sick an individual policy may raise the rates, in a group policy it is spread over the members of the group so one person getting sick does not affect the overall premium.,

I pulled my back years ago and have recurrent back aches, so I empathize with you.  Its hard to stand when you're sitting, hard to sit when you're standing, hard to walk, hard to turn to look back, etc. etc.  First of all, you should see a doctor to rule out a slipped disk, ligament tear, etc..   Second, and until you can get attention, the best help for back pain is to stay off the back, and that means lying down flat on your back on a firm mat/mattress (not hard floor or soft couch or mattress).  Don't put a pillow under your head.  Tent your legs at the knee and stay that way, for as long as you can. That is the best.  You may want to take an analagesic or something, and if you have a heating pad, heat helps reduce the muscle spasm.  I use a muscle relaxant tablets and an anti-inflamatory cream, heat and stay off my back at every opportunity till it eases.  Don't exercise and try pulling your knees up to your chest until the acute phase of the spasm has eased or you ease pulling the muscle and have years of pain.  Also, if you have to sit, be sure it is a firm chair, don't slouch and try to keep your back perpendicular to your lap.  Hope the pain eases soon for you

you should always pull down to your chest not behind your neck - if you pulldown behind your neck you will eventually wreck your shoulders - pull down to the chest works the same muscles - the latissimus dorsi or lats \n\npullups (chins) using a wide grip palms away from you are better for mass building than lat pull downs,  as are bent rows - either dumbell or barbell
Do pilates! It really works! In 9 days you'll notice your body getting leaner and longer! I love Pilates! Also try to eat more protein instead of carbs. and 3 sets of basic crunches twice/week wouldn't hurt either!
YES.
You need to let them heal.  Once they are healed, begin walking again, at a slower pace and for shorter distances. Make sure to wear proper walking shoes.\n\nOther exercises such as bicycling will get you in good shape without the worry about shin splints.\n\nIf you continue to have problems, see a doctor.

My mother has chrone's disease.  She lost 60 pounds in 3 months.  It got so bad that she could not hold anything in (she had to wait for insurance to get it treated).  She would be walking home from work sometimes and her waste would run down her leg.  It was horrible, I didn't know what was wrong with her for the longest time.  She looked like a skeleton by the time she went to the ER.  If you have Chrone's disease, you sorta KNOW there's something wrong.

Introduction\n\nThere is no special diet that will prevent or control lymphedema; however, good nutrition promotes good health and this helps the body manage with the stresses related to lymphedema. When other conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes, are present the diet must be adjusted to accommodate the specialized needs of these conditions.\n\nDietary Protein\n\nSince the fluid associated with lymphedema is protein-rich a question that often arises is, “Should I stop eating protein so there won’t be protein in this fluid?” The answer to this question is, “No! Do not stop eating protein. It won’t solve your problem because proteins are essential nutrients.”\n\nDietary proteins are present in the foods we eat and are important to good health because:\n# Proteins are the building blocks of the body.\n# Proteins are the only nutrients that can repair worn-out tissue and build new ones.\n# Proteins are used by the body in manufacturing hormones.\n# Proteins have a role in building antibodies to fight infections.\n# Proteins aid the blood in transporting oxygen and nutrients.\n# Proteins are essential to the clotting of blood.\n\nWhen There is a Shortage of Dietary Proteins\n\nThe goal for each individual should be to eat the appropriate amount of dietary protein to meet nutritional needs. This protein should come from a variety of sources, not only meat, and include only a minimum of fat.\n\nWhen there are not enough dietary proteins available to meet the daily needs of the body, proteins are taken from the tissues and muscles to maintain the proper protein level of the blood. A severe shortage of dietary proteins will weaken connective tissues and causes them to swell. This is known as hunger edema and it can be seen in the swollen bellies of starving children.\n\nSeriously restricting the intake of dietary protein in an effort to control the swelling of lymphedema does not help. It has just the opposite effect: It increases the amount of swelling that is present. It also weakens the muscles and other tissues.\n\nStaying Hydrated\n\nThe term hydrated describes the state of having adequate fluids in the body. Maintaining this state helps the body remove impurities from the blood and this is important to good health.\n\nDrinking plenty of fluids, particularly water, is essential to maintaining this balance within the body. Cutting back on fluid intake in an effort to reduce the swelling of lymphedema doesn’t work! Instead of the desired effect, the protein-rich lymph of lymphedema attracts more fluid from the other parts of the body. This can cause increased swelling in the affected area.\n\nDrinking eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day is recommended to maintain good health; however this need increases in hot weather, or in very dry conditions, when the body looses fluids more rapidly.\n\nBeing well hydrated, by drinking plenty of water, is particularly important after an MLD or pump treatment because it is necessary to flush out the impurities that were moved during treatment.\n\nCaffeine, which is a mild diuretic, reduces the level of body fluids by encouraging the kidneys to excrete more urine. For this reason caffeine containing substances (coffee, tea, chocolate and many soft drinks) should be consumed only in moderation.\n\nAlcohol also has a diuretic effect that stimulates the kidneys to excrete more water and thereby increasing dehydration.\n\nEating a Balanced Diet\n\nEating a well-balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits and vegetables is recommended for maintaining good general health. It also aids the body in coping with the added stress caused by lymphedema.\n\nHigh salt foods, which encourage the body to retain fluids, are not part of a recommended healthy diet.\n\nMaintaining Normal Weight\n\nMaintaining the normal weight for your height and age is also an important part of managing lymphedema. The mechanism of how excess fat interacts with the development of lymphedema is not yet clear

You really want to watch the sugar in your cereal. That's really the culprit. Most cereal ingredients list sugar 2nd or 3rd in the ingredients. This is not good!! Even Special K ladies... Anyway Kashi is a good choice because it does not have all the sugar. Try Kashi Go Lean Crunch (taste like Sugar Smacks) or Kashi Heart to Heart (taste like Honey Nut Cheerios!) Regular cereal you'll be stuck with something like Grape Nuts, Shredded Wheat etc YUCK! Also, no higher than 2% Milk but if you can stand it try Skim Milk. Only 1 cup and try not to eat it as a late night snack.
130 is average for that height, but that is just a general.  There are other factors to consider.  146 may be perfect for you.
Keep you blood alkaline rather than acidic and your chances of getting cancer is very low.  Check some of the web sites concerning alkaline vs acidic and you will find tons of information on it.
You could have breathed in some mold that's made you sick. Usually, you have to have long exposure to it. Maybe you just have the flu?\n\nIf you don't feel any better in a few days, go to the doc just in case it's something serious. Hope you feel better soon!
It's gone, behind you, over. Just go on with life, be as clean as you can, but don't feel sad. Sometimes bad stuff happens, to the best people. Sometimes we feel sad after something happens that we regret. But life goes on, you're okay. Be strong and just carry on. You'll be alright.
more proteins, less carbohydrates, zero fats, plenty of vegetable salads, regular exercise(like shuttle, tennis) plenty of water.......\n\n vegetable salads should fill atleast 80% of ur  stomach, the rest with proteins........\n\nthis is the magic formula......

yep - scar tissue.  you can certainly ask a dermatologist though!  you never know.  they might have a way to at least diminish the appearance of the scarring.
a true breath holding spell is not uncommon and is not a cause for concern. usually the child will turn red faced and still show good muscle tone. A child who turns blue or goes limp however need further evaluation
a heating pad either on her back or abdomen, rub her feet as there are reflexology points in the feet to help releive menstrual pain.\n\nNo caffeine as this may worsen pain.
Go for a walk with your parents.  Then you get the exercise and they can stay a part of your life.  They love you.

About 20% of all women experience Mittelschmerz.  You're not alone!  As long as it is truly the cause of your pain (pelvic exam and diagnostic tests have shown no abnormalities and ruled out other causes), it is usually just treated with analgesics.  You can also ask your doc about oral or injectible contraceptives that will prevent ovulation, thereby alleviating the pain. I am not aware of any herbs or alternative therapies that will do that. Good luck to you both.

Try this: draw a circle on a piece of paper. That's you.\n\nthen draw little circles that just touch your circle at one point.\n\nDraw some other circles that don't touch at all.\n\nThese are other people. They are in their own circle, and only bump onto your circle briefly.\n\nLet's say you belch loudly in front of the minister in church. Oooops! Embarrassing. But he's in his own circle. He will forget about that belch in minutes. Because it isn't about him.\n\nMost people are so caught up in themselves, they don't really think about you at all.\n\nSo next time you worry what someone will think, picture that big circle with the little circles barely touching.

Count your calories. Yes, it sounds old fashioned, but that really is the best way. Remember what a calorie is--energy! Measure the energy in and make sure that the energy that goes out is higher. For me, about 1900 calories a day is maintenance weight, meaning that the calories in=calories out. My dieting calorie count is 1500. You need to have a daily calorie target, but you can be slightly over or under each day. Small fluctuations don't hurt anything. For me, I always craved a beer, a glass of wine, and/or a snack about 9 PM. Now, I have just one of those things, and that's the only thing (with calories) I eat or drink after dinner. Drink lots of water, eat breakfast, and watch your portion control! Make sure that you eat a balanced diet--the food you eat needs to count nutritionally.

NO \nIf you use nitrate drugs , commonly used to control chest pain (also known as angina), don't take Viagra. Since Viagra also reduces blood pressure, your blood pressure could suddenly drop to an unsafe or life-threatening level.

"No one can diagnose over the Internet from a 2nd hand description. Your friend should see a doctor.\n\nThe usual treatment if it's not broken would be the ""RICE"" method: Rest, Ice, Compress, Elevate.

A few men continue to grow until their late 20s (but not many!) - at 23 it is possible he might still get an extra 1/2 inch or so of height but more likely he has finished growing upwards.\n\nThere are no non-prescription remedies to grow taller short of breaking your leg bones inserting a gap with rods and waiting for the bone to cover the gap!  Growth hormone treatment will make you taller prior to the end of your height spurt - after this it will just turn you into a short big foot!!\n\n\nAt 5' 9'' your friend is not short and height is an attitude as well as a physical reality.   I am 6' 3'' but have friends who are 5'9'' and look 6 ' to me because they have developed their bodies and carry themselves with confidence.
It's a metabolism thing...you need to start regulating yourself and eating more regularly, both in time (eat at the same times each day) and in amount. Ever wonder why you feel hungry right after a big meal sometimes? It's your metabolism speeding up to cope with a big meal and digesting quickly. Then the next day you don't feel like eating anything because your metabolism is sluggish after the indulgence.\n\nSo, start eating more in routine, and the ups and downs of your appetite should regulate.
Sweetie?  Swollen lymph nodes are very serious.  You didn't say what the underlying problem is.  You need to go back to your doctor and ask for pain medication if it is that serious.  I am truly frightened for you because a lot of very serious illnesses are the primary cause of swollen lymph nodes.  Can you give us the skinny on the primary cause?  Go back to the doctor.  Please?  Keep me updated.  E-mail me, okay?  I care.  My Mom died because she waited for the last symptom of her illness (breast cancer) to arise, which was terribly painful lymph nodes in her armpits.  I am not trying to scare you.  Go back to the doctor.  NOW!
well you can go down to Tiajuana and buy pills there for like $7 a pill if you want to try...or talk to your doctor and ask for a sample pack the drug reps usually always leave sample packs at their offices. However....If you don't have a problem in that area then i would steer clear of those types of medications....what they do is increase the bloodflow to the vascular tisue of the penis. increasing the bloodflow for someone who doesn't have blood flow issues can possible stretch out the blood vessles in the penis, permanently damaging it...then the bloodflow that you usually had won't cause the penis to become errect and you'll be unable to maintain an erection without the aid of viagra...hence fowarth becomming dependant on it to fill the larger blood vessles. can also cause pyrines disease which is a curvature of the penis causes by stretching and scaring of the blood vessles in the penis.....just be careful bro.
I know that there is feline HIV\nOverview \nFeline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) causes an infectious disease in domestic cats and cheetahs similar to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV infection) in humans. It attacks and weakens the bodys immune system, making the animal susceptible to infections and diseases that don't affect healthy cats. There is neither a cure nor a vaccine for FIV. Though eventually fatal, an FIV-positive cat can live for many years without any signs of illness. \n\nFIV is a lentivirus, a virus that causes slowly developing disease. \n\nPrevalence \nFIV occurs worldwide and its prevalence varies geographically. About 1.5% to 3% of cats in the United States are infected with FIV. About 5% of FIV-positive cats also have feline leukemia virus (FeLV). \n\nRisk Factors \n\nRisk factors for FIV include \n\nage, \ngender, \nillness, and \ntime spent outdoors. \nOlder cats are more likely to be infected. The average age of cats with FIV is 5 years at the time of diagnosis. \nAggressive male cats that roam and fight with other cats are more likely to be infected than females and nonaggressive males. \n\nSick cats are much more likely to have FIV. In the United States, about 15% of all cats that show clinical signs of another disease are also infected with FIV. \n\nFree-roaming cats are more likely to be infected than indoor cats. \n\nTransmission \n\nFIV is transmitted primarily through deep, penetrating bite wounds. A mother cat may transmit the virus to her newborn kittens during gestation, passage through the birth canal, or nursing. FIV can also be transmitted through the transfusion of contaminated blood. \n\nFIV affects only felines. Some of the pathogens (i.e., bacteria, parasites) that cause opportunistic infections in FIV-positive cats may be transmitted from animals to humans and could cause illness in people with compromised immune systems.   Not sure about dogs though....research it or call your veterinarian!! And I am also not sure if humans can contract HIV from animals?  Although some people believe HIV developed in the human race after people in a third world country ate some infected monkeys, many years ago.

"you sweat all the time, it's just noticeable when you have foundation on is one half.\n\nthe other half is that you actually get warmer, because the foundation is a little bit of a ""blanket""\n\nThe solution might be to let your other parts of your body cool you more efficiently so, fewer layers, clothing that can breathe, no head covering, short sleaves... keep shedding stuff (or stay in air conditioning) till you are cool enough that your body doesn't want to sweat."
Push-ups seem to work for me. 150 a day, it'll hurt at first, but hey, you'll get fairly toned and your chest will be a bit harder. Also, for your forarms, chin-ups and squeezing things is good. I personally like the Harley suggestion =P
is this true false?  my answer is no.
well for healthy living i think the following are:\n1.soy- it can reduce bad cholesterol, has isoflavones w/c have estrogen-like effect on the body\n2.fish- especially fatty fish like tuna, salmon, swordfish and mackerel w/c are swimming with omega-3 which havee been linked to the prevention of heart disease\n3.green tea- filled with antioxidants and is also believed to stave off various cancers (also helps if you're on a diet)\n4.garlic- guards against heart disease, dramatically lowers bad cholesterol also fights bacteria and gives your immune system a boost\n5.blueberries- filled with antioxidants and unique bacteria-fighting properties, may prevent and relieve bladder infections, they contain compounds called anthocyanosides that have beeen shown to slow down vision loss\n6.spinach- has a lot of calcium, beta-carotene and vitamin c and also rich in fiber\n7.flaxseed- has high amounts of phytoestrogens as well as omega-3 fatty acids, helps prevent heart disease while keeping your eyes, your brain and your reproductive system healthy\n8.oatmeal- lowers bad cholesterol, also has fiber\n9.broccoli- is packed with disease fighting nutrients, loaded with antioxidants like beta-carotene and vitamin c, may help protect against cancer of the colon, lungs and breast\n10.nuts- are a great preventive tool in the fight against cancer and heart disease, walnuts and almonds contain antioxidants that help keep arteries healthy while reducing cholesterol, also contains omega-3 fatty acids\n\nthats it!!! i hope i contributed something...

there is no definite time course for mononucleosis, but it can last several months.  when I had it in college it lasted about a month and a half and was mostly just a sore throat, but symptoms vary.\n\nthere are no antibiotics that will help, so treatment is mainly just rest and some analgesics.  however, the most important thing if you do have mono is to avoid contact sports as your spleen is very delicate and prone to rupture while you have mono.
Well.. I'm hard of hearing. SO I value all the hearing i DO have... and I'd still prefer to stay the same. I wouldn't have met the people I know now if it weren't for the hearing loss. I'm a very visual person due to this. I do listen to and love music though! \n\n:) Good question to ask.
um..i have never listened to hannibal lectur music before so i can't say much about your choice.But can never judge a person by the music he likes and the thing he eats.eg hitler was a veggie!! i hope you got the idea.
If you are in love, you know it.  The main thing is that you can't imagine living without that person in your life.  That person is more important to you than anyone else...including yourself.
I think so its safe. Actually it works in the normal radio spectrum .
Recovery from injury follows something called Wolf's Law, which basically means that your body adapts based on the stresses put on it....up to a certain point where additional stress causes injury.  This includes recovery from injury.\n\nLet's say you break your leg.  Should you immobilize it so that it can rest and heal?  Most people would think so....but this is a very, VERY bad idea.  An immobilized limb will start to atrophy in a matter of days (hell, a matter of hours).  Worse, the injury won't heal correctly without a certain amount of stress placed on the leg.  You need to work the leg a certain amount (not so much as to cause further injury) so that it heals strong instead of weak.  Immobiliztion of the leg is to be kept to an absolute minimum.  Very important to work with your doctor to understand how much is needed and how much is too much.  Very important to do your rehab.

yes it will but only short term,Here is what you need to do, if you are serious about losing weight and keeping it off. Eat 6 small meals a day about every 4 hours. Only the size of your fist, carbs in one and protien in the other. 30min cardo exercise every day. Any of these(walking, jogging, running, biking, ect), Monday cardo, tues upper body, wed cardo, thurs lower body, fri cardo, sat upper. Sunday eat anything you want and dont exercising, you do this on sunday so your body doesnt freak out. if you stilck with this you will have a great body. also drink aleast 8oz of water daily!
Sugar (as in the normal stuff you buy in bags from the store) is a good source of energy and rather than make you slow will in fact make you fast.  A better option would be glucose (one of the several different types of sugar) as the body breaks this down into energy very quickly.  Many top atheletes use glucose to boost their performance.  It's best taken in the run up to the game and during the game as well.  You can take it in powdered form, diluted in water, syrup or as candy.
Yes, completely normal! Obviously we're not talking corkscrews here but a little curvature is perfectly normal. And I shouldn't think women would bother about it - I certainly wouldn't - I think personality and humour are more important. Anyway, presumably someone that's seeing it already likes you quite a lot anyway. lol. Seriously, don't worry - my boyfriend's goes slightly to one side (although I won't tell him I wrote that down). There have been some interesting studies done in which researchers morphed faces to be more or less symmetrical. The findings were that we like things more or less symmetrical - but not completely - subjects described feeling uneasy when looking at faces that were completely symmetrical. A little asymmetry apparently puts the mind at rest. Maybe it makes us more trustworthy and more approachable?

"Definately on the bus. People really freak out, it is ""intense"""
Although you may be nervous, you need to just buck up and go see a doctor.  Remember, this is what they went to school before and they have seen hundreds of other girls just like you.  It could be something as minor as a yeast infection, or it could be a STD or other infection that could leave you infertile or cause other permanent damage.  Trust me, we have all been there at one point, but you need to put your health and well-being over your nervousness.
There's the Facial Feedback Hypothesis which basically says that when you laugh naturally you use the orbicularis oculi  and zygomatic muscles (a fake laugh just uses the the zygomatic muscles). When you laugh, the muscles are stimulated and it sends feedback to you're brain where it will make a physiological change, such as produce more (or less)  neurotransmitters.

I had mine out a couple of years ago. I didn't have a choice on it. My condition was a life or death situation.

So far my liver seems to have recovered ok. I was incorrectly diagnosed twice before I ended up in the emergency room near death. \n\nThe negative for having it removed is that you have to watch your diet.

"Perhaps you have sleep apnea or some other sleeping or breathing disorder.  Consult your doctor and they can run some tests to find out.\n\n\n\n\n\nSleep apnea (alternatively sleep apnoea) is a common sleep disorder characterized by brief interruptions of breathing during sleep. These episodes, called apneas, last 10 seconds or more and occur repeatedly throughout the night. People with sleep apnea partially awaken as they struggle to breathe, but in the morning they may not be aware of the disturbances in their sleep.\n\nThe most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), caused by relaxation of soft tissue in the back of the throat that blocks the passage of air. \nCentral sleep apnea (CSA) is caused by irregularities in the brain’s normal signals to breathe. \n\n\nSymptoms\nThe hallmark symptom of the disorder is excessive daytime sleepiness. Additional symptoms of sleep apnea include restless sleep, loud snoring (with periods of silence followed by gasps), falling asleep during the day, morning headaches, trouble concentrating, irritability, forgetfulness, mood or behavior changes, weight gain, increased heart rate, anxiety, and depression. Obstructive Sleep Apnea is more likely to occur in men than in women, and in people who are overweight or obese.\n\n[edit]\nHistory\nConsidering how common a condition it is, it is remarkable that the first reports of what is now called obstructive sleep apnea date only from 1965 when it was independently described by French and German investigators. The term “Pickwickian syndrome”, inspired by Charles Dickens' account in The Pickwick Papers of Joe, the fat boy, has been used in medicine to describe various conditions associated with obesity, excessive appetite and sleepiness and it was once presumed to be due to an endocrine problem. “Pickwickian syndrome” soon became the descriptor for the newly identified disorder but as more cases were recognized it became clear that neither obesity nor somnolence were necessarily present. “Pickwickian” was later reserved for “the obesity-hypoventilation syndrome” and today the term is best avoided because of its ill-defined meaning.\n\nThe early reports of sleep apnea described individuals who were very severely affected, often presenting with severe hypoxemia, hypercapnia and congestive heart failure. Tracheostomy was the recommended treatment and, though it could be life-saving, post-operative complications in the stoma were frequent in these very obese and short-necked individuals.\n\nThe management of obstructive sleep apnea was revolutionized with the introduction of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), first described in 1981 by Colin Sullivan and associates in Sydney, Australia. The first models were bulky and noisy but the design was rapidly improved and by the late 1980s CPAP was widely adopted. The availability of an effective treatment stimulated an aggressive search for affected individuals and led to the establishment of hundreds of specialized clinics dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. Though many types of sleep problems are recognized, the vast majority of patients attending these centers have sleep disordered breathing.\n\n[edit]\nObstructive sleep apnea (OSA)\n \nTwo minute epoch representing continuous OSA. Click on this image for larger version.Most people with sleep apnea have obstructive apnea, in which the person stops breathing during sleep due to airway blockage. Sufferers usually resume breathing within a few seconds, but periods of as long as sixty seconds are not uncommon in serious cases. It is more common amongst people who snore, who are obese, who consume alcohol, or who have anatomical abnormalities of the jaw or soft palate.

No!  I've never heard that before. in four years of dental school and countless continuing education seminars. \n\nAbsalutely not, \nBrushing generates saliva and rinsing,  all this activity in your mouth can only help dilute the sugars, and the fluoride\nwill integrate with the enamel even more after a meal.  \n\ncan't get into specifics without regurgitating the first year tooth chemistry, but please ya gots ta believe me.  that is not true. \n\nNow go brush yer teeth
all of the above!!
Before going to bed try swabbing with hydrogen peroxide, let it dry then put on a little bit of antibiotic ointment, If it's still red in the morning, put a little dab of hydrocortizone cream. try that twice a day. usually works within 24 hrs. and the hydrocortizone cream at least makes the redness go away, so it's less visible until the antibiotic ointment works.\nAlso, i use tea tree oil and it's gone in about 5 hrs.\nyou can buy all thos products over the counter. try health food store for tea tree oil.\ngood luck.

Yes, go see a Doctor and tell him/her how much pain your breast is causing you.  When the doctor send your claim to the insurance company ask them if you can send a letter explaining the pain and need of this surgery....know one can explain your pain like you.   \n\nI was able to get surgery paid for that way. The doctor wanted me to send a letter of my pain because the insurance company see my surgery as cosmetic..... and we know they don't pay for cosmetic surgery.
I think it is because the injection goes intramuscular.  A muscle bruise is typically more painful and longer lasting than an epidermis or skin bruise.

depends on age, height, bone size, etc.\n'normal' is an objective word.\nsome say its 100 lbs at 5 ft, and then 5 pounds per in. after that. so 5'1 = 105lbs, 5'3= 115 lbs, 5'6= 130 lbs... but keep in mind this does not take into account different bone structures. also remember, muscle weight more than fat, so someone can be leaner, more muscular and weigh more than someone of the same build, just more fat.  \nits all objective...
Drink extra water, take stool softener gels, and a laxative if you need to.
Because your last bf liked them so much that he stole them from you;) LOL
yes, the blood type is based on the genes of the parents, so there are 2 parts. being positive is a dominant trait and being negative is recessive.  so the you also have to look at the grandparents.  if one of them had both recessive genes and the other had postive, that would mean that one of the parents could have passed on the recessive gene and the other a dominant making that person be positive, but still able to pass on the recessive gene.
You cant know for sure without going to a doctor. You should go to a doctor, and if they want to give you medication you can say no. You can go to a holistic practitioner as well, which is all natural, but they cant diagnose clinical depression.
the food and drug administaration should have what you are looking for and if not you could contact the makers for the drug if you are doing resrch on ti they should be able to give you an estamated number.

I managed an La Weight Loss center for 4 years until I married last year. Yes LAWL does work but so do alot of other programs. The key with LAWL is Lifestyle change!!! You must be willing to make lifelong changes not temporary ones and the program will work. Let me see what tips I can give you.... Write down everything you eat, this sucks, but truly helps and this is a big part of LA program. Also eat often and never forget breakfast. Watch portions- especially starches and certain proteins. Eat veggies and fruits everyday. Stay away from processed foods, carry water with you everywhere and stop eating 2 hours before bedtime. Good luck and stay positive.!
not unless you set it on fire or let a child/infant breathe it down into thier lungs.

Sleep early, and maintain a healthy life.

Women have a choice of whether they want to shave their pubic hair or not.  Some women do it as it looks better shaved, others don't shave at all- it is really variable, and not a necessity.  I know some women that do it as they can't stand it, so shave it all off.
NOW you see what the GOVERNMENT does to people?\n\n~BrAiNwAsHiNg!~
"Please speak to your doctor, or to your school nurse if you cannot get your parents to make a doctor's appointment for you.  You are on the right path with the smaller portions & exercise, good for you! Be sure that you are eating meals that are well-balanced, too, not just less food. At your age, believe it or not, your body still requires somewhere in the neighborhood of at least 1600 calories a day (that is an approximate minimum). Keep in mind that as you begin to lose weight, some of the weight will be retained water, especially if you drink lots of soda and eat lots of salty stuff; but weight loss at your age should be supervised by a medical professional, and whatever you lose or don't lose, DO NOT become obsessed by your weight/body image.  It really is true, the outside is not as important as the inside.  I'm not just spouting spiel, my daughter was borderline anorexic and down to 90 lbs (she's 5'6"")before I realized what was going on as she does not run around less than fully dressed.  It's pretty scary and a real eye-opener. If you want to see what can happen, go to Entertainment Tonight's website and search for pics of ""the anorexic bride""; she is supposed to be on Dr. Phil's show tomorrow as well.  Take good care of yourself, sweetie, we'll all be praying for you."
I would suggest seeing a family physician.  I have had months on end of headaches.  I have tried migraine medication that didn't work.  Eventually a neurologist had commented that mine are from neck and shoulder tension.  Using too many pills over time can make headaches worse.  Try looking at medical websites to determine if you are suffering from migraines or tension headaches.  Once you figure that out, it is easier to learn how how to treat them.  Hope it isn't migraine because some of the medication is awfully expensive ($100 for 6 pills).  Because headaches can be a sign of brain tumors, it isn't something you want to take lightly.  Don't wait.

I was sentenced to 6 months in prison a year ago for stealing a car.  I had no idea how to fight.  I had 3 weeks from my sentencing to get my affairs in order.\n\nI used that time to get in shape.\n\nI knew that I would not master the art of Karate, kick boxing, self defense, boxing or street fighting.  I basically just needed to know enough to prevent myself from being raped.  And if I was raped, I needed to know enough to prevent myself from being raped a second time.\n\nI ordered Kick Boxing for Wimps.  I practiced everything that CD had to offer over the next 3 weeks.  Needless to say, no one bothered me.  Due to my celebrity status, it may have helped that I was sentenced to a juvenile prison instead of the Big Boys prison.\n\nNow I use my new Kick Boxing skills to fend off cops and other thieves while I'm stealing cars.
it depends what you do with it!!!!!!!
Ovaries are in great demand these days!\n\nGet an ultasound done to check if ovaries exist at the place.\n\nHave you tried premarin? Though controversial it may help! Else a safe way is to use Shatawari Ghrut, an ayurvedic paste, if available close by.\n\nYour hysterectomy suggests you had hormone imbalance (Estrogen dominance causing heavy frequent cycles or similar problem, so ovaries missing is a close possibility). If that is case, local application of Shatawari Ghrutam for 3 months is a good remedy.

I am a man of 58 and when my son was 4 5 or6 he would have loads of fun playing with his sisters dolls and other girlie toys, and He grew up to be a very masculine father of three. Ironically! His second son wants to do the same thing , and I am sure that as children grow, they benifit from diversity, and as they grow they usually come away from it, I think kids are lucky to have parents who allow them to experience different avenues.\nThey grow up with an attitude that allows them to seek out things in life, and to be a little bit wiser as they were allowed to grow with their own identity and individualism.\nAnd hopefully they will allow their kids to grow in the same way, instead of forcing our ideas on them.\n\nDon't worry!!\n\nRegards Bill.\n  (pa69oldfart)

"Hi,\n\nLet him do the talking - as much as he wants;  be there for HIM.\n\nI found this article to be very good and true.  When I was diagnosed I had people in each of the groups. \n\n http://www.cancerlynx.com/angels_bolters.html\n\nIt is very hard to get your mind around ""terminal cancer""; it is a huge set of words.  Everyone goes through life thinking that they will live to a 100 or so then a guy in a white coat comes in and tells you that your ""demise"" is right around the corner.  \n\nBy being there for him, you are helping him;  he will have ""lots"" of open issues that he want to clean up and he needs to talk to someone;  it may be you, it may not.  As I said,  let him run the conversation.  \n\nAnd remember;  docs can be wrong,  2 years can stretch to 4 and 4 to 8 etc.  \n\nHere is a resource from hospice net - for the friend of someone who is dieing;  hope it helps\n\nPeace be with you and your Friend,\n\nJewells\n27 months and still here"
With the works of modern medicine, it would be hard to conceive that there hasn't been new and different techniques for the disorder. For these types of questions I always recommend a search engine such as GOOGLE or ask.com. You may also want to try webmd.com.
"Yes, you can still pass on an STD that is ""dormant"". Test results may or may not come out negative, depending upon several factors. For example, you can pass on herpes or syphilis even when they're not in active stages, because the agents that cause these diseases ""hide out"" in the body for periods of time without causing obvious symptoms. Herpes lives in part of the spinal cord forever...once you've been infected, you remain that way for life. It is possible to pass it on to someone else even if you don't have an outbreak.  In the case of syphilis, these days it can be cured with certain antibiotics...but when the disease runs its natural course, there is often a latent period between the primary stage and the secondary one, as well as between the secondary and tertiary stages. It is still possible to spread this disease, too, even during the latent periods."
In my personal experience I did not have any problems with that.the IUD is far enough inside that you can't pull it out.But your boyfriend/husband may feel it you just have to change positions.when you do have it removed by the doctor it hurts like a really bad cramp its not unbearable just some what painful.I have had two and they did fine.You may also bleed a little more on your monthly but that's better than having an unwanted child.I hope this helps .
Fun.
My mother has this as well. I forget what it is called, but hers keeps getting bigger. Her opthomologist said he could remove it no problem in the office, but he doesn't have the time right now to do it. I would recommend having the surgery he said there is absolutely no problems in having the surgery. Hope I helped if so can you give me the 10 points because I have never gotten a best answer
hypertension can be caused by numerous things such as sodium, stress, lack of sleep, heart conditions, etc...etc... Too much work would probably cause hypertension or at least it can be a partial cause of it.  Boring work probably would put you to sleep before causing hypertension.  Note that most people know hypertension as High Blood pressure.
lift legs to build your quads and hamstrings to hold up your knees better.  you can do wrist curls to build forearms for your wrists.  Also the impact and stress from lifting and excercising can strengthen your bones and assuming you don't hurt yourself will probably help the parts you're worried about
If I understand you, you are asking, what are the chances that  a carcinoma of the axillary lymph nodes will metastasize...well, with all lymph cancers metastasis is a likelihood, but if it is yet early in the development of the disease treatment can still be affected. Remember, even if it does metastasize, modern medicine is marvelous and it's better to be down a few nodes than it is to be down a few dozen years.
If they aren't malignant, it shouldn't be a problem, but they do need to be monitored.  If they do turn malignant, they will need to be removed and you will probably need radiation treatment for them - not chemo.

No and they are only a temporary fix to what ever you are trying to achieve.
based on the age of the child i dont think some can.. i have seen older kids do it as a joke and use a alka-seltser as the foam...some did it wit dish soap.. if you think a child is faking it smell the foam .. it shouldent smell like soap.. or candy .. it should smell like spit..
I am 28 and have osteoarthritis in my hip, ankle and back. It is becoming more common in younger ppl. Mine is from injuries and being hard on my body(I was pregnant 8 times in 10 years..delivered 7 kids) There are things you can do to ease the pain. Light stretches like pilates and beginner yoga are good. Also not carrying extra weight around(still working on that one) eases pain on your bones and joints. Take it easy when you feel the pain. Drinking lots of water is sposed to help too. GOODLUCK!!
Cardio is the best way to lose weight. Get moving and bring your heart rate up. Swimming, running, jogging, tennis, basketball, elliptical, cycling, step, kickboxing, etc. Anything like that will help you burn fat.\n\nYou can also do some weight training, lunges, squats, and crunches, etc. in addition to your cardio. This will put more muscle on your body, and the more muscle you have, the more fat your body burns from cardio.\n\nTry here and look under 'Exercise Pictures':\nhttp://www.ironworkout.com/index.htm
I believe you should ask the doctors doing the physicals for your company. I don't see what kind of help you can get from making your test results public like this. Please, don't put your health in the hands of an amateur forum. Respect your mind and body. You must consult your doctor. (I am a physician myself and this is the best advice I can possibly give you.)

Alcohol exerts a lot of effects in the brain.  The reason that it dehydrates you is that it affects hormones in the brain.  We all have a hormone called antiduirectic hormone in our bodies.  It is released in times of dehydration to help you to hold on to water.  One of alcohol's effects is to stop the release of antiduirectic hormone.  Therefore, alcohol stops you from releasing a hormone to help you hold on to water.  The bottom line, you pee more than you drink.

Sounds like a fungus to me, if there is no itching it is not dandruff. Try a shampoo with zinc pyrithione in it, it's an antifungal. it's also important NOT to wash your hair daily, you strip your hair and scalp of it's natural protective oils, which are kind of like the scalps immune system. it's also important to use a conditioner to keep the hair and scalp moisturized.

yes if you talk to any medical personal they will tell you if a doctor suspects meningitis you have to have it done and if you decline the health department will step in and get a court order to make you have it done but if a doctor does suspect it then you should have it done cause meningitis is a very deadly diase
don't be stupid of course your not! when a young girl is undergoing puberty her body is making itself ready to attract a mate and have child its perfectly natural to want to be the first to mate with a young girl to have her in your pride as it were. but if your affections are to someone a girl who is playing with her barbie and who's pants have a my little pony on them then you should be shot in the groin with salt pellets every day for the rest of your life.\n\noh and by the way to all those people who say you have a problem ask them when they lost there virginity and they will all LIE.
Yes, you do feel guilty when you've sinned or hurt others who don't deserve such injustice.\nOr when you've caused trouble for others because of something you did. \n\nThe best way is to ask God for forgiveness because sometimes it is better we don't approach the person we've hurt. Further communication no matter the good intent may ignite the situation more.\n\nAnother way, is to avoid thinking too much about it by focussing on other things after you've asked God for forgiveness. Sports has always been a good outlet to distract oneself from the difficult things we have to face.
You are only 13 then yea you will still grow you will not stop growing till your about 20/21! You still have some time and some growing to do!
The average size is about 4-6 inches.  So if you're a little in that area you're average.  If you fall below you are lower than average, and if you are above that then you are above average.
I like freckles...their cute. It's nice to have something unique a lot of people don't have. Enjoy them! You really can do nothing about it...you were born with what you got and you should learn to accept that. Some people are born with all different kinds of things that are a lot less attractive than freckles! Your not alone. My best friend has them, and it looks as if they've actually faded. Try some make-up if your a girl....explore the cosmetic section and see if you find anything that might suit you best. Good luck.
its ur period. he prolly cleaned out ur insides when u guys had sex and all the remainder of ur period is coming out. like when u use a plunger in the toilet
"The method you mentioned is useful if it is osteo-arthritis, not rheumatoid arthritis. It is more of a preventative than a treatment. The vinegar balances the bodies pH, and the molasses provides iron. And remember that all ingredients must be organic. Another good preventative/restorant is ""organic egg"". Place an organic egg or three in a wide-mouth jar and cover with organic freshly squeezed lemon juice. Let it sit for about a week, gently shaking daily. The vinegar leaches the calcium from the egg. Gently remove the egg itself (it will still have the membrane on it), and keep the calcium rich liquid. It will be calcium citrate, the most absorb-able form of calcium. Take three tablespoons a day."
I'm sorry you're in pain sweetie. You could take some paracetamol as well to try to help ease the pain, and you could try rinsing your mouth with a hot salt water rinse, that sometimes helps me when I get toothache. Avoid anything that makes it worse, so don't eat anything sweet, and make sure you keep the cavity clean - rinse it out after every time you eat. If it gets worse, you should probably call the dentist to see if he can fit you in any sooner. Hope you feel better soon, there's nothing worse than a toothache!
It depends upon the diseases status....Like in all common diseases you can keep body as long as you wish (ofcourse you must not overlook the legal implications of it)....but in some diseases like Plague, very contagious diseases, AIDS related complex etc you need to dispose the body soon. However even in the later cases, if you do proper embalming, then you can delay its burrial...........\nBut I am really surprise as what made you interogate into such an issue...Anyway don't fall for any crime ..ok..and take care.
that depends on what kind of diet...for carbohydare based diets no, but for fat i dont see why not...i know this guy who was allowed only rice to eat in rehab and he came back in pretty good shape
go back to bed, and watch TV or listen to some tunes for no more then 2 hours then get up look in the mirror, smile at your self and ten times say I am pretty, and smart and a great person, then call someone on the phone tell them you love them and they will tell you they love you, and then go out and have some fish and chips, and a soda, then go to a movie, or buy yourself a present.  I like you and I can relate to how you feel.  If I was where you live and I actually knew you I would give you a big hug, and take you out for lunch.  Good luck, and remember tomorrow will be better.

just try to cut it drastically. i mean, when you get up one day, think of stopping right there and then.\nit might be hard, but i think it's the same thing in other situations wherein you should make a decision real fast--like cutting something with a knife. fast and sharp.\nchew on sugarless gum instead.
how old are you? for this type of question you must be a young kid. but to somewhat answer this .she has two holes ones for her to urinate from the other is for sex.that hole is located low down.if she is bending over from the back view the hole will be just under her turd hole.i hope this helps you out.and by the way the other hole you can forget about it. it is to small.
you should try it and see.
Get Certain Dri. You will never sweat from your underarms. Eliminates all odor. Has no smell. Has no residue so it does not stain your clothes at all. It is a roll on you can get at any drug store in the anti-perspirant section. You put it on at night. Go to sleep. Wake up and take a shower. The residue of the anti-perspirant is gone, but you don't sweat or smell at all for a couple of days. And when I say you don't sweat or smell I mean it. I go to the gym and my shirt gets soaked except for under the arms. That is how well it works. I have not sweated under my arms for over ten years since starting to use this product, and nothing else was able to stop the sweat.
A dermatologist can give you tiny shots of a steroid in the area.  It's not steroids like the athletes use, or at least not in those doses.  It is very safe.  They also might prescribe something like Tetracycline.  See a different dermatologist if you are not getting results from the one you have.
"I'm very sorry for your difficulties.  Forget the ""tricks"".  It might be helpful to try getting real help from someone you know and trust.  I know there are those who feel strongly for and against using medications, therapy etc, but I am not going to advise you on that.  What I can suggest is that you try building a very rigid daily routine.  Write it down, then follow it.  Start with the first part of your day, if that's easier, then gradually add to it.  Remember too that it takes about three weeks for most people to effectively build a habit.  Best of luck."

Grow from the experience of the past, but don't allow it to destroy your open mindedness of the today.\n  If you don't just let go, in your mind, wish that person the best life has to offer, and thank that person for all the wonderful times and experiences and found wisdom, and say good bey...................that's the best you can do, otherwise, your mind will never let go and your today and tomorrow will always be haunted and hindered by your past.\n  You must move on......................good luck
it' might be a seizure...have it checked out...you might wanna get her an MRI but make sure she has no ear piercings or metal objects on her cuz that machine is a BIG MAGNET...you can opt for a CT (catscan)...but yeah if it is a seizure...it might be something in the brain...didnt mean to scare you...also though she might just be learning how to balance...is her head big? too big for her body to support? my brother and  I had that same problem...we just had too big of heads for our bodies to support
Hello,\n\nShe should go see a medical doctor first!! Her MD will run tests to find our WHY she has the goitre and will be able to advise her about surgery, medications, dietary and lifestyle changes.\n\nIf the MD is not helpful, she should DEFINITELY consult a **registered dietician** (NOT a 'nutritionist' or a non-accredited 'diet specialist').\n\nFor your information:\n\nOur thyroid uses Iodine to create important hormones (T3, T4). She needs to be very careful about her Iodine intake (ie iodized salt, seafood). Since her thyroid is enlarged, it may be like a giant sponge for Iodine and this can be **dangerous** if her Iodine intake is increased too quickly.\n\nNext, she would be very wise to limit her intake of soy and cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cabbage, kale, kohlrabi, Brussels sprouts, etc). Scientific studies have demonstrated that these foods interfere with Iodine uptake by the thyroid. For the same reason, avoiding products with 'rapeseed' is important too. It is very, very difficult to find any foods or oils that contain rapeseed now so this shouldn't be a major concern.\n\nALSO, she should ** NOT become pregnant**; it puts a major stress on her body AND her children will have major birth defects (known as cretinism).\n\nHope this helps!\n:)
Sounds exactly like thrush see a dosctor asap.\nThey will confirm it is thrush (yeast infection) and give you a pessary and cream (you insert the pessary) or just a pill and cream to soothe the area. \nDo not apply anything to this area as it can irritate it just keep clean.\nThings available from a pharmacy are canestan (which can cost a lot) and a cream called clotriamzole 1%.\nHowever a doctor should really confirm that it is thrush first.
Your doctor would do an exam and testing, including an ultrasound.
It can take many years for someone who is HIV positive to develope AIDS. It would be Extremely unlike  that your boyfriend became infected and died in less than 2 years even without any treatment. And contrary to the first reply, I am a physician.
NEVER GET CIRCUMCISED!\nIf you have phimosis ask about PREPUTIOPLASTY _ if your doctor doesn't know about it, find one that does............\ngo to : \nwww.foreskin.org to learn more.
For real? Even without the family history I'd say your chances are pretty good!
Spots? You must be British. \nThe best thing is different for everybody. what I recommend is to make a list of all the creams you can think of, or are most eager to try, to find the best for you. Try some of a product, making notes of the progress you see. Try that with everything. Try as many holistic and diet related options as you can. Find what works and stick with it. Good luck. \nThe best for me was proactiv until I took Accutane.
I like the way I taste, so sure. But make sure she likes it first.
I think its not a helpful way to deal with stress because it is harmful physically and because it doesn't really help you to manage the situations that cause stress. \n\nIt is impossible to avoid stress in life, so I think you are far better off learning coping skills that help you manage stress without harming yourself. Stress management, relaxation, seeking social support from others, and developing assertiveness skills are examples of coping methods that can be learned and have a long-term helpful effect for people.\n\nIf someone is cutting themselves to manage stress I suggest they talk to a trusted adult and find someone to help them learn more effective coping skills.
Nipples probably have melanin which means they could tan a little, but be really, really careful with that.  Nipples have extremely fragile skin so you definitely don't want to expose them to UV rays for too long.  You definitely don't want to run the risk of getting skin cancer there.

"PKU, or phenylketonuria, is a genetic disorder where the person lacks an enzyme to break down a certain amino acid called phenylalanine.  In children with PKU, phenylalanine builds up in their bodies and can cause problems.  It used to be that it wasn't diagnosed until symptoms showed up, at which point it was too late to prevent a lot of the damage from the amino acid build-up.  Children with PKU would typically be signficantly mentally retarded, and have other developmental problems as well.\n\nNow, however, all children are tested for PKU at birth, because a really cool scientist named Robert Guthrie decided not to patent the test, so it would be available to everyone at a reasonable cost.  When a baby is diagnosed with PKU at birth, they are put on a special diet that is low in phenylalanine so that they will not have any symptoms later on.  As long as they stick to their special diet, children with PKU can develop perfectly normally, and show no signs of mental retardation or other problems associated with untreated PKU.\n\nSo basically, what it means that the test came back postivie (i.e. ""bad"") is that there's a good chance that the baby has PKU and will only be allowed to eat certain foods (like how people with diabetes can't eat things with a lot of sugar), but since they caught it so early, he/she will be fine as long as his/her parents follow the doctor's instructions carefully."
I asked a similar question and here was the answer I found most helpful. I give the credit to nightevisions. Hope it helps you too.\n\nIt helps to have a relaxing routine before bed. Do something calming. Whatever that might be for you... a warm bath, a hot cup of tea, reading a book... \n\nIf you lie there awake when you go to bed, occupy your mind in a non distressing way. Recite a childhood fairytale such as the 3 Bears... and when your mind starts to wander to everyday worries, pull it firmly back to the story... you'll fall asleep before you get past the porridge!
osteoarthritis is a bone condition that weakens bones, usually around the joints making them crumble. It is very painful and as yet not curable but it can be helped with certain medications. There is research into hormonal treatments of arthritis that have been very promising. If you put osteoarthritis into yahoos search engine you will have plenty of hits on the subject. Stay away from people giving their views if you can as some of them can be depressing although some can give useful information on the subject. Try and stick to official sites.
It's called a blood clot.  Totally normal, if you have clots bigger than your hand go to the doc., you could have had a miscarriage or endometriousis.  Best wishes
Sorry guy...surgery to remove the bent part
If a person DOES NOT have AIDS, then obviously they can't pass it to anyone.\n\nIf a person DOES have AIDS, then they can definitely pass HIV to someone through a used needle. There might be a small trace of blood from the infected person, and if someone uses the needle after them, they might get that small trace in them. \n\nAlso you don't get AIDS from someone, you get HIV. AIDS is later developed from HIV.
I have found that if I apply pressure to the base of my penis just as I am ejaculating there is an incredible pleasurable sensation in my legs, so strong I can hardly stand it.
Just go in any emergency room and get your friensd looked after ASAP, if you are feeling like you do, does it matter, just go to the nearest one available. and Yes as noted above if you want deatiled information about the location or the doctors you should state is your question if you want any help. Besides if you are in the Us dial 911 and they wil come and get you.
Yes, everyone has them, just feel your throat.  Women's aren't as prominent and usually can't be seen like men's.

I have heard of something called a Photo Facial that helps with them. Find a local spa or facial place that does them and call for pricing. These can be done on more than just the face. Arms, chest, neck, hands. \n\nYou might even try talking to your dermatologist as well. They are usually very up to date on the latest technology to slow down aging. \n\nGood luck!
you will need about 5 days with no stress for your arms to fully recover - you could do a leg workout though\n\nand when you go back learn from the lesson - make progress slowly!\n\nafter a hard training make sure you stretch - then use hot-cold showers for 10 minutes and if you have access to it a whirlpool or spa bath \n\n\nyou can also ice areas that have been worked very hard for 10-15 min every hour \n\n\na bath with epsom salts helps as does an ibuprofen\n\nmake sure you hydrate during and after training and have a protein shake and some fruit as soon as possible after training
At 15 your still growing so I think its to soon. When you get older you may like having a bigger chest. Are you over weight? If so you can work out and eat better and it might reduce it some. But be happy the way you are you could be stuck having no boobs. Hey if your the only one in school with a big chest be proud of it, your one of a kind.
No problem buddy. Heres the deal. \n1) Avoid using computer too much from too short distance, but if you have to work try to put a UV protection screen on the front of your monitor/laptop.\n\n2) If using a CRT monitor (the old big ones) throw it away cuz ur eyes are much more valuable than anyting out there. Buy the one with LCD/TFT screen which now have low emission and a 20 inch will just cost $300 which is nothing compared to your eyes.\n\n3) The glasses/spectacles you are wearing change them, and get a new lens with the power you require but go for a new type of lenses rather costyl which are called polariod lens or UV protector aka Double layer coated lens.\n\n4) Eat as much green as possible, including carrots which have a precursor of Vit A, also you can take vitaming supplements with the help of your doctor.\n\n5) Try to take a walk on grass or go to greener areas and walk there for 30 min or so thrice in a week.\n\nI hope this helps you. And will pray for you.
Total weightloss means being VERY active!\n\nConfidence is key, weightloss is hard, but worth it for your health, its the most valuable thing you have... protect it and defend it!\n\nGet outside and be active, run, walk, rollerblade, bike, SWIM, get some small weights, a workout DVD, push ups and sit ups every morning and night\n\nGet into a routine, like when you get ready for bed, brush your teeth and do some squats, comb your hair and do sit ups, practice your school work and do psuh ups reciting the scientific elements... \n\nReward your self !\ndont punish... run a block drink some juice, ride your bike, eat an apple\n\nAs for your stomach...\nAbs are made in the kitchen!\nChoose the foods you put in your mouth carefully...\neat whole foods, veggies, fruits, grains, dairy, meat, and take vitamins\nprepackaged processed foods have too much sugar salt fat and carbs in them forget diets, fads, and pills\n\nEAT SMARTLY, EXCERCISE EVERYDAY, SLEEP WELL, AND BE SUPER HAPPY!
I try to have coffee or tea with sweeteners. That fills me up a bit and gets rid of the sweet craving. In fact i do this throughout the day if i need it. You think you need sugar, but the sweet flavour of the drink fools your mind.\n\nIf you are really desperate, then try 3 sweeteners. You can buy them in powder (great for cereals!!) or tablets (great for taking with you)
SADLEY TRUE!!!  WERE NOT INCLUDED THOU,  HAHA
My husband gets those every 6 months or so on his wrist.  His doctor told him that the cyst is a build-up of fluid in an area between joints that did not fuse together correctly.  The doctor told my husband to do one of two options to get rid of it.  He could either let the doctor hit the cyst to make it pop and release the fluid...or he could simply wait it out and eventually it would do it on it's own.  He chose option 2. It finally burst, and his wrist went back to normal.  The Cyst comes back sometimes because of a type of inflammation that occurs in the joint from working out.
It sounds like you have thrush. Eat plenty of Live Active Cultered Yogurt. In necessary get a prescription to treat it from your doctor. Also, gargle with warm salt water. I hope this helps you. Have a good day.
drink lots water, watch eating too much junk food,sodas and watch your salt intake, meaning dont add salt to foods.\n\nexercise.. actually put some music on and dance for an hour or so a day and walking is good too. the more active you are and more healthy you eat you will be just fine. drink your milk and eat your yogurt. Best of Luck!!
I fell and broke the radial head on my right elbow, and cringed my knee.  I wasn't able to use a crutch on the right side for quite a while.  I have since had 3 surgeries on my right knee, but the elbow has never been the same.  Walking on crutches has become as easy as driving a stick shift.  You get used to it.
You can skip them but If your pills change dose weekly (ex. OTC-lo) you may end up bleeding for a month, or if your lucky just have some spotting. Other pills dont change doses are best for it but still can have spotting. A doctor put my friend who had real bad period problems on the pill 24/7 no more periods ever, but did get unpredictable spotting. The doctor said that it was healthy.  There is going to be a pill on the market soon out that lets you have only once a year. But break-though bleeding is evil and just a bad as a period and with pills that let you skip your period that happens more often then on the reg. pills.

for motivation, think about what could be, you are young now and you don't want to get fat. keep that as a motivator, stive to be thin. you don't want to end up huge. \n\ndo get toned and in shape, keep it simple- sit-ups, push-ups and running around your neighborhood.
Actually It is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary DISEASE. Basically Copd consists of C.B.A.B.E-Cystic fibrosis , bronchitis , Asthma , Bronchiectasis , and Emphysema. You die from this usually from an exacerbation where your lungs just cannot keep up with the demands of your body for oxygen and the by-product of The body using Oxygen. When the body uses oxygen it makes CO2 and your body puts excess Co2 in the lungs for you to exhale it and get rid of it when it accumulates it makes the ph decrease which makes the body more acid-like. usually someone that dies of COPD will have multiple problems before they finally do die. A lot of times they end up with a tracheostomy tube and have problems with being on a ventilator (a machine that breathes for you just in case someone doesn't know what that is). The most comfortable way for someone with COPD to die is for them to go home with comfort measures for palliative care so that they can be relaxed and comfortable while they remain on this earth---hope that helps

Toluene is so toxic that OSHA has restricted exposure to employees who come in contact with it at work. It is a hydrocarbon which can trigger asthma. It affects the Central Nervous System and cause euphoria, dizziness, confusion,depression, headache, vertigo, hallucinations, seizures, vision problems ,stupor, and coma. It may have direct on the Cardiac System. It can cause bronchial spasms and suffocation. Long-term exposure can damage the liver, kidneys, and skin. Inhaling this solvent can even cause abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. \nI have personally known people who had used it as a 'high' (sniffing correction fluid). They were in a mental hospital facility and had permanent brain damage. They had difficulty speaking. Their symptoms were like those of alcoholics with 'wet brain'. There is no recovery for them.\nIt is a SCARY chemical.

Homeopathy IS the placebo effect.
infantilism is the desire to wear diapers and be treated as a helpless infant. One who engages in infantilistic play is known as an adult baby  There is no singular, archetypical infantilism, but a range. Some fantasize about being free of guilt, responsibility, or control while others might not. Some act indistinguishably from a baby at times, while others practice in a way that would be unnoticed by passerbys on the street. The desires and tastes of infantilists vary around common themes of diapers and babyhood.\nwhen someone says that they are refering to a adult that acts like a baby...
If I got aids, first of all, I would try to determine when I contracted it and contact all the people I may have infected. I would do this by retracing my steps so to speak. Go to the last person I put myself at risk with & backtrack until I get to someone who isn't infected & that would give me an idea who I contracted it from. I would still need to contact the people from before that though, just in case someone just got lucky & didn't get it from me. It's not gonna be easy & I would need to be ready for a few black eyes because if someone came to me and told me they may have given me aids I'd be tempted to give them the biggest beating of their entire life. I know it would be hypocritical of me for having put myself at risk but it's just human nature. Other than informing people and making sure I don't infect anyone else, there's not much else I can do. I would just need to make sure I keep myself healthy because the slightest infection would make me very ill.
The best way to enhance intercourse tenure is to use more time in foreplay. During intercourse, man gets aroused fast and reaches to orgasm fast, whereas a women needs more time to get fully aroused and to reach orgasm. So to delay in reaching orgasm (in males) man should avoid penetrating early.Ans should indulge foreplay. However if even during penetration one feels reaching to orgasm and wants to delay, one should change thought, or should pull out before ejaculation sets in etc

Your blisters is awarning that you have pushed too hard on\nsomething or things, or you are doing rough work without wearing gloves. These are called friction blisters. It\noccurs when you rub constantly on something. If your fingers\nand hands are sensitive, it will occur even faster. Like\nwinter has just passed, so if you wore rough.. garden like gloves the blister could have occured from that too. So if\nany rubbing on your skin causes the skin and tissue under\nyour skin to serparate. The roughness created causes it to\nfeel like a pin prick.
There's a symptom called chlorophilia where the fibers from your turd remain on your skin, and sink in. Then, a green hue develops up from your feet. Since you crapped in your pants, probably some turd-fiber was smeared on your butt that you didn't wipe off, and now you got chlorophilia. Have a nice life.
Yeah you can. Eat right, exercise, stretch, and think positive. I read that will help you get taller. And get plenty of sleep, and stress free yourself.

What makes people drowsy from NyQuil is the 25% alcohol added to the antihistamines.  It would take way more than 2 tablespoons to cause any toxicity in an otherwise healthy 10 year old.  If he were to take a whole bottle at once, that could definitely be a problem and I would then advise calling your local poison control.  He'll be fine, albeit very drowsy.

"motor skill development occurs without the use of ""self talk,"" in other words, when we first learn of the spatial relationship and interaction between body movement and our environment, we typically do not form this understanding with language. it has been hypothesized that the same language independent areas of the brain that are vitally important for gross and fine motor development could be the same neurological mechanisms or processes activated when solving mathematical tasks or basic comprehension of the laws of physics, because these areas are known to be significantly intact and functional in patients who are without linguistic capability."
"Alcohol addiction is called alcoholism and I am here to tell you that there is no medicine in this world that will cure it,YOU are the only thing that can cure YOU!\n  Just as you find reasons to use alcohol,you will eventually find reasons to not take the medicines you say you want to help you quit drinking.\n   When you get in enough emotional,physical and financial pain,when you have finished destroying your life and the lives of those who have loved you and have tried to help you,you will get up off your ass and do what you need to do and that is to go to ALCOHOLICS ANONOMOUS!!!!\n    You are doing the same thing in trying to find medicines to help you quit that you are doing in your consumption of alcohol. . .Looking for an easier and softer way to deal with life.\n    You are living in a constant hell that YOU are creating.\n    Alcohol consumption/abuse is only a bandaid for those things in your life you are looking to heal,cure or cover up.\n    You can leave the ""bandaid"" off by merely stopping the consumption of alcohol but the ""wound"" will continue to be there and though it might seem like it is getting better without the ""bandaid"",eventually it will fester up again and you will be off and running with your alcohol again but then it will be worse.\n    Take responsibility for your alcohol consumption,pick yourself up,dust yourself off and get to an AA meeting with the same conviction you have in finding your ""bandaid"".\n    Until you decide to decide to take this step,there is NOTHING nor ANYTHING that will treat your alcohol addiction.\n\n    In the end one way or another you WILL quit drinking whether you go to AA or not. \n It may be because you are in jail because your addiction catches up with you or it may because your mental health  and or physical health gets so bad you will have to be hospitalized or your addiction will get bad enough you will die!!!!\n  Don't be misled,people of all economic classes have this problem.

I would strongly encourage you to bypass the medical system and pay for an angiogram out of pocket if need be. I had a 100% blockage and even with a private health care system I had to wait a few days. \n\nKeep your nitro tablets on you at all times and stay close to a hospital. I do not mean to scare you but you are facing a very serious situation. For some reason everyone gets blase about heart problems unless they are the ones with the problem. If you go to the emergency room they are pretty much obligated to treat you. At least that is the case here in the States. I would not recommend getting on a plane and going anywhere. I found out about my problem at 29000 feet. It was right after 9/11 and I thought I was having an anxiety attack. It turns out I was blocked. \n\nTake care and I wish you the best. What part of England are you located? If you want to get more information on this e-mail me at joespillman@hotmail.com  I have been through 4 angiograms.
I'm sorry but that's just bad.....that's has totally changed my mind about Canada i thought it was more liberal and tollerant than the UK but I'm wrong, and how can he be a danger to others?

the possibility is too slim to even worry about...\n\nAll one has to do if they're worried about this, and it's good health practice anyway, is to cover with a band-aid any broken skin they may have on their hands...

i was told by a 'foot person' to use sand paper to sand off the shiney top layer of my nail.  Because that is what protects the actual nail bed.

"I am a registered nurse, so I'll help you here.  A nurse gives you the injection (and you should have had a ""wheal"" that looks like a mosquito bite).  You have 48-72 hours and then it must be ""read"".  All that means is that the nurse is checking for what's called induration, or redness AND swelling.  If there is any swelling that you can feel, then she/he should measure this diameter in mm.  Anything above 10mm indicates a positive TB test, and referral for a chest x-ray.  That basically means that you carry the tuberculosis infection in your blood due to exposure previously, or you have an active case of TB.  \n\nThe nurse is allowed to check this legally, because it is like a lab result.  A doctor is not usually involved with TB skin tests unless there's a positive reaction as described above.  I administer TB tests everyday in my job, and I SELDOM have anything that is above a 3mm, which is negative."

Eat lots of fruits and veggies,they have so little calories and have 70% water content so they are really filling.Stay away from processed foods(chips,oreos,crackers,fast food,stuff like that)\nEat 5-6 small meals a day instead of eating three big ones.Drink only water,no soda,no juice.I don't try to push anyone towards veganism,but I would rceommend for you to try eating only raw foods.There is 21 day detox diet,I was watching it on t.v.,a woman lost 25 pounds in three weeks.I would recommend at least giving it a try,eat only raw fruits and veggies and nuts.

Chances are that if you're cycling that fast you're not bipolar.\n\nOK, so bipolar's a mood disorder and a serious mental illness. It has a strong genetic component, but appears to be triggered environmentally. There are no diagnostic tests for it, just psychiatric evaluation. Most sufferers are not diagnosed until middle age, and it takes an average of around 8-10 years to get a correct diagnosis. Historically, figures suggested it affects about 0.8% of the population at some point, which makes it about half as common as schizophrenia. In recent years, bipolar disorder has become an 'in' diagnosis, and many more people are being diagnosed at younger and younger ages. As with ADHD, this fad may well pass with time, although for the moment many celebrities appear to be 'popularising' it.\n\nIt is characterised by episodes of severe clinical depression and mania or hypomania (for definitions of those, see here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_diagnostic_criteria_for_bipolar_disorder ). The extreme end of mania often turns into psychosis, complete with hallucinations and delusions. During manic phases, the person's judgement and perception of reality is severely compromised, leading to risky actions with potentially damaging consequences (financially, sexually and relationship-wise). Untreated, episodes generally worsen over time due to an effect known as kindling. Untreated Bipolar sufferers are at a very high risk of suicide: 20-25% attempt it, and 15% succeed.\n\nThe cycles in bipolar disorder are much longer than people generally believe. Anyone whose mood changes from minute to minute is very unlikely to be bipolar. Bipolar 1 is characterised by mood episodes lasting many months, while Bipolar 2 has episodes in the region of weeks to months. Rapid and ultra-rapid cycling bipolar disorder is rare, and cycles last days to weeks.\n\nThere are many drugs available to treat the symptoms of bipolar (there is no cure). These are either anti-convulsants or anti-psychotics (personally I take both), and the most well known of these is Lithium. Most patients will go through a number of different drugs before finding one that works for them.
Just do it. If you're talking with a therapist then there should be open communication. They can't help you deal with it if you won't address it. Good luck.
Different drugs (be they street, or prescription) can effect different individuals in different ways.  However, there generally is no specific difference based on gender alone.
Well I bet I beat all the people who answer. In 1988 when the 7 World Leaders came to Canada, for the Economic Summit, I was assigned to the Accreditation Division, 5,000 people had to be processed.

Are you getting enough rest?  Are you doing things that stress you out?  Are you ill?  All of these things will affect your appetite, too.  \n\nGet a balanced lifestyle with rest, lots of exercise and some relaxation to balance the stress.  You may need to see a doctor or a therapist if it lasts longer.\n\nAlso, browse through cook books, cooking magazines, etc. and make stuff that looks yummy.  And sometimes the appetite needs to be jump-started -- you won't feel hungry until you have a little appetizer.  Then you start to feel hungry again.  High-calorie appetizers could include: nuts, cheese and crackers, olives.  Low-calorie ones would be carrot sticks, cucumber sticks, pickles, a little sliced-up fruit.  \n\nHope that helps. (-: I'm hungry just thinking about it.
"i have worked with adolescents and adults with ocd. you cannot get through this alone. you need to be on meds that help control your obsessions and compulsions. and you need to be under the care of a psychiatrist. there are very good behavioral modification techniques you can learn to help to keep your ocd under control. if you don't seek professional help, your ocd behaviors can branch out to many other behaviors, that will greatly reduce your ability to live a ""normal"" life. there are also great support groups where you can establish friendships with other ppl who have the same issues as you, and can help you in many different ways that will be beneficial in your daily functioning. it sounds like you are having a tough time and want to get better, so that in itself is a step in the right direction. be an active participant in your therapy. i hope you have friends and family who are empathetic and supportive for you, and who will encourage and help you through your process. best of luck to you."

How much do you weigh? If you only need to loose 20 pounds, eat only three times a day every meal with a vegetable, and just drink water for 2weeks and you should loose 10 pounds of water in the first week, and an additional 10 pounds of fat in the next week.Believe me I do it when I feel a little over on any certain week.
The stomach is the hardest area to get rid of it seems!  \n\nFirst off, please know that spot reducing is not possible. If it were possible to make an area lean by always working it, typists would all have super thin fingers! (which, sadly is not the case:) )\n\nThe formula for lean abs is clean eating, and cardio. The crunches do help- they will build the lean muscle, but the purpose of resistance training is to build muscle, not burn fat. You have to turn to the fat burner of fitness- cardio.\n\nI would suggest working your abs every other day and use a variety of movements. An example routine would be:\n\n15 crunches\n15 reverse crunches\n15 oblique crunches (each side)\n15 dual crunches\nRepeat the circuit 2 times. \n\nFor eating- cut out the white flours, and white rices. Eat whole foods, lower in fat. Try to pair protein and carbs with veggies at your meals, and be sure to eat enough- every 3 or so hours. This will keep your metabolism high, so you burn fat. \n\nFrom there, do your caridio. You can swim, jog, walk, bike, use machines, box, go to classes- but try to get in 30 minutes 5-6 days a week. Push yourself to where you can't sing, but can still talk a little. This will be your personal fat burning zone. \n\nPut it all together, and you will have a lean midsection in no time!\n\nBest of luck!
I fully agree with what Deez said. However I would also like to add that if they do the hair sample test, your screwed, big time!

I was unable to find if the shot is given for any other decease. There is no mention either at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningococcal nor http://www.meningococcal.com.au/ it seems like this is the only reason to get such shots. It is stated that this shots are only good for three years, after which there is no hard proof that there is still protection against said decease.
Symptoms\n\nSymptoms of leukemia depend on how much the cancer has grown and may include:\n\n    * Fevers and night sweats.\n    * Frequent or unusual infections.\n    * Weakness and fatigue.\n    * Headaches.\n    * Bruising of the skin and bleeding from the gums or rectum.\n    * Joint pain.\n    * Swelling in the belly or pain on the left side of the belly or in the left shoulder from a swollen spleen.\n    * Swollen lymph nodes in the armpit, neck, or groin.\n    * Decreased appetite and weight loss because you feel full and don't want to eat.\n\n\n\ni will pray for you. if the doctor you are seeing will not talk to you you should get second opinion. and if she does have leukemia (knock on wood) ya'll should come to st.jude childrens research hospital in memphis,tn. they provide housing and pay for everything(the medical bills, travel costs)\n\n\nThe chronic forms of leukemia often cause no symptoms until much later in the disease.

"Greetings!!!  Fascinating question!!  As someone who has been successfully managing the symptoms of MS for over 45 years - R/R for the first 40 of those years, and now Secondary Progressive MS - my answer would depend on what ""causes"" your MS fatigue the most??? \n\nAs you know, MS fatigue is far and away DIFFERENT from ""normal human"" fatigue.  AND, each person's MS symptoms are different.  With this as background, I'd offer the following.\n\n1)  Determine your ""optimum"" activity stage within each 24 hours.  For example, for me I start to go to sleep about 2 - 3 am, and sleep until noon or 1 pm.  My most productive time is 11 pm to 2 am.\n\n2)  Determine your main ""cause"" of fatigue.  For me, it is interacting with others; any physical activity; and the clenching of my muscles.  For this, I swear by Baclofen, which is a muscle relaxant!!!  AND, I ""manage"" each day to maxamize my ability to get done what I need to do.\n\n3)  As for taking beta interferon, it's DOCUMENTED success in ""decreasing the rate of increased MS exacerbations"" is great!!  AND, the greatest successes come with folks like you, who are caught early.  Unfortunately, when I went on Avonex in 1997, it was really too late for me, and, even though I took the shots for 5 years, my symptoms had ""solidified"" so that I was no longer within R/R, and there are currently no meds for SPMS.\n\nHere are my qualifications for providing you with these answers, and information about the current ""best"" meds for each MS symptom.\n\n1) I've successfully managed the symptoms of MS for over 45 years.\n2) I was an HR Executive for over 30+ years, and combined my professional and personal expertise in creating a website dedicated to assisting folks with ""chronic disease symptoms"" better document, communicate, corroborate, and manage their symptoms and the resulting impairments to become expert patients; chronic disease self-managers; and, partner with their doctors to practice patient-centered health care.\n\nhttp://www.disabilitykey.com\n\nMy website contains tons of information in 2 blogs, downloadable free articles and self-help ebooklets, and the Disabilitykey Workbook which contains over 100 pages of how to processes and actual forms - blank and completed examples - to assist folks. This workbook is available for a very small price (under $10).\n\nHere's a blog that I did that discusses not only the top 22 MS symptoms, but what - at least a year ago - were the top medications used to help you better manage those symptoms. The reason that I like this list of symptoms and their associated ""management aids"" is that precisely because MS has so many symptoms, you may need to take some time to do some ""introspection"" to figure out which TYPE of symptom do you haave!! For example: do you have ""plain vanilla"" fatigue, or do you have depression coupled with either pain or fatigue? The management aids for the 3 different ""types"" of depression are different; so, the more precise and specific you can become shen documenting both your symptoms and how they impair you so that you can better inform your doctor, the better your doctor can assist you with symptom management!!\n\nSo, your Doctor tells you that you have a disease. You know that you have symptoms that impair you in your every day life, but you want your Doctor to give you something to make the pain/symptom go away!\n\nWhat is the best medication for your symptoms, for your illness? Remember, only your Doctor can help you. However, the better informed that you are about what is out there, the better you can discuss alternatives with your Doctor(s).\n\nThe following information comes from the National MS Society website. Now, most disease medication lists start with the brand name first, with the SYMPTOM that it is to address almost as an after thought. BUT, we, the patients, start wit"
Yes you can. There are thousands of babies born each day as a result of a man pulling out before he ejaculates.
For your legs:  biking, jogging, elliptical trainer, squats, dancing, kicking, stair climbing though not TOO much as you don't want bulging muscles.  They should just become firmer with all that exercise.\n\nFor your stomach:  Continue with the crunches but when you come up, turn to one side then down, then come up and turn to the other side. That will help develop your 'oblique' muscles in your abdominal section.\n\n Also, while you're on the floor, lift your head, put your hands behind your neck and lift your legs with your knees bent.  Now move your legs like you're pedalling a bike and alternate pointing your right elbow to your left knee when it's up, then your left elbow to your right knee.  \n\nKeep up the good work with the pushups but remember that your arms have other muscles so lift heavy objects and pull too.
EASY, CHEAP AND IT WORKS....Vics Vapo Rub....I have recommended this for quite a few people on here and ALL have e-mailed back with fantastic results.

Any number of reasons, she may be on a diet or she may feel uncomfortable eating large portions in public, as she worries that people will look at her wondering why she doesn't eat less. You know how judgemental people can be. She may be ashamed of her eating habits and only does it behind closed doors or in secret, not where people can see. Have some compassion, it must be hard enough for her, without ignorant strangers gawking at her. Take care.
"First off there is nothing ""extra"" about a foreskin, it is a vital, sensitive, protective organ. To say the foreskin is extra is like saying the eyelid is extra. The eyelid is not needed to see either, but with out it the eye would soon become be as ineffective for vision as the glans becomes for sensation.\n\nCircumcision came about to remove as much of a mans sexual pleasure as possible and still leave him capable of fathering children. If they removed any more he would not function and there would no more children to bring into the tribe or to become solders for the king. This is shown in early writings by several rabbis, they speak of the necessity of ""moderating the needs of men"" \n\nClaims have been made for all kinds of ""benefits"" of circumcision as being more hygienic, curing masturbation, preventing cancer, protecting from STDs and on and on. All based on garbage science! None of it stands up to reality.\n\nCancer of the penis strikes 1 out of 100,000 men and has been found to be more related to other factors such as the standard of living and smoking. Cancer of the cervix is not caused by friction from the foreskin but rather by the human papiloma virus (HPV), which is transmitted in the sperm from an infected male whither or not, he is circumcised.\n\nSTDs are not stopped by circumcision but by safe sex and condoms. The fact that most US males are circumcised has not stopped or even slowed the infections. Sweden doesn't circumcise and their incidence of STD infection is fifty times less than the US, (now Sweden has banned childhood circumcision)\n\nEven the claim that circumcision would ""cure"" masturbation is wrong, circumcised males tend to masturbate more and are also more likely to seek oral and anal sex. Largely because of the reduced pleasure they get from vaginal sex. A lubricated vagina doesn't provide very much friction for the circumcised penis. Circumcised males also are more likely to resist using a condom because it lowers sensitivity even more. The recent study claiming that circumcision lessens the risk of HIV has already been embraced by circumcised males as a green light for unprotected sex. \n\nSurgery is no more needed for male hygiene than it is for female hygiene. It is assumed that because a male urinates with his penis it must be dirty but really urine is very sterile, only tears are more bacteria free. The exception to this is in the event of a bladder infection, which is rare in even uncircumcised adult males. Of course urine smells because it contains ammonia and even small drops of it are noticeable. But simple soap and water washing are all that is needed to remove any traces of urine or smegma (which by the way females produce too!)\n\nBy the way children (both male and female) need training in hygiene an unwashed foreskin is not the only part of the body that can stink. Perfume can't eliminate the odor of bad tuna either.\n\nThere is the comment ""who knows what is growing under that foreskin?” Think about it, the foreskin and glans of an uncircumcised male are among the most sensitive parts of his body; you may as well ask what is growing under his eyelids. If you give an uncircumcised male a yeast infection he will know it within hours and he will seek treatment. On the other hand a circumcised male's dry-keratinized glans can be infected and not show or feel any symptoms. So an infected circumcised male will keep re-infecting his partners. And his characteristically more vigorous trusting will leave the walls of the vagina abraded and more prone to infection.\n\nLastly there are the religious reasons, some desert tribes maintain circumcision as a tribal rite for various reasons; however the rights of US born children, male or female, should not be ignored because of some old tribal customs. \n\nChristianity has no requirement for circumcision. Saint Paul in his letter to the Galatians states, ""neither circumcision nor "

i would consult the doctor
Yikes that sure sounds like it includes exercise and a lot of it!  I'm scared of exercise and sweating.
That is a good question, and it is SOOO True.  I think it is because you are just cutting the first layers of the skin, and if it is on you finger, hand, etc... when you move it breaks it open again and makes it hurt more and longer to heal..\n\nThat is just my guess, good question though and Yes they hurt
Prednisilone is a steroid.  Have you been prescribed this by a doctor?  It can be purchased online, but you will need a doctor's prescription.  If you don't have one, they will have you complete a form, which will then be reviewed by a doctor before issuing the prescription.  Be very careful with steroids a they can cause a lot of damage to you if not taken and stopped correctly.

"I don't know if a penis can ""shink"" as you put it but it may temporarily appear smaller when a man is in cold water or in cold weather. I don't know of anything permanent. As far as weight gain it may appear smaller because the rest of the body has gotten bigger."
Well, other than the fact that its delicious....it has more fibre in it than the other junk.  Fibre is a really important thing to have in your diet (keeps stuff moving through your digestive system and makes you feel full when eating) and most people don't get enough of it (because it gets taken out when food is processed from delicious whole wheat to crappy refined white stuff)
Different health articles claim weather has nothing to do with arthritis...My opinion says they are probably right. They have determined that mild exercising helps (every day) and moving around is good treatment.

He looks at life differently now. It must be very hard for you to be sidelined like this.

The BEST thing for burn is cold running water. After the object has touched your skin and been removed, the skin continues to burn down through the layers of skin, giving you your 1st,2nd,3rd degree burn ratings depending on the severity of situation. Another thing is to never remove something thats been melted on to your skin until its been cooled off with the running water. Im sure you wiped it off imediately which will be fine, but had it cooled before you removed it might of been less painful. So since this happed hours ago. Take to tylenol and an ice cube to bed and call me in the morning to tell me this is the best answer.{i even have fire in my avatar background and did give this same advice to my own daughter about 3 hours ago, her burn was with the curling iron}
Well, as long as you do not breathe heavily of the fumes and let the smoke waft about, there is no concern

i was in the martial arts when i was 8 to 13 .. and i dont think he will take injuries anymore because his abs are trained to take that punishment ... now dont get me wrong i bet he puked the first few times and had a sore stomache. But most likely he didnt just jump into heavyweight girls, he most likely started with a lightweight girl, and as his abs got used to the beating he raised the weight. Its all about conditioning and practice in the martial arts. in fact, chinese monks can bend a metal pipe with their throats and do two fingered push-ups because they condition their bodies to take that abuse.
Sweetie, it is so good that you are seeking help early on, because if you let this spiral out of control it will consume your life tragically. I was about your age when I started throwing up for the same reason, not necessarily because I thought I was fat, but just bad about myself in general. It went on for a year and lost a lot of weight. I started sneaking out, drinking, being promiscuous, and failed my first class every (I was a straight A student). The hardest part about it was the secrecy. But don't let it get to the point where the secrecy and lying become normal and routine andd don't even notice anymore that you are lying.\nI had to hit rock bottom before I got help, but thank goodness I hadn't been at it for long less than a year and it was so easy to change and move on from that. You sound like you have a good chance of beating this early on. \n\nTell someone anyone that you can talk to, a school counselor, your mom, or you could email me even and I would be happy to help and talk.\n\nlilcloclo@yahoo.com

Yes,  herbal baths are great for skin.  The benefits will depend on the quality and quantity used.  Try a drawstrings bag and add different herbs and spices.\n\n*Oatmeal softens the skin.
do you hear people talking in your head? What else do you hear? \nI would go to the Dr. you might have a yeast infection. \nmaybe it is your guilt for not standing in line for the playstation 3 for your husband.
first take a deep breath and relax.\n\nyou may need to talk to a professional about the stress you are feeling.\n\nin the meantime do something that relaxes you.  when i get stressed i take a hot bath and read a book.  find something that you enjoy doing and do that for a while.  also (i know this sounds cheesy)  think happy thoughts.  think about the last time you were truly happy.  what were you doing where were you.\n\nyou have to believe that this will work itself out.  good luck
we may have a different body structure, but if your body type is like mine   then no. = ). iam the same weight, height, and age. don't worry yourself.
Most likely it's psoriasis. Ask your pharmacist for over the counter medication for it. If it doesn't clear up after a week, see your doctor.

wheatgrass juice!!! just a small expresso sized cup is literally like drinking pure sunlight. it's the purest thing you can put in your body (but it tasts horrible) still you dont need much to feel totally energized... be carefull tho. too much can make you very sick, especially if you dont eat healthy to begin with, it will clash with your stomach acids and make you sick... but if you get used to it you will notice a lasting change... i haven't had the stuff in ages but i want to get back into it. =) \ngreat for hangovers ;)
It has to grow to keep from drying out and rotting. \n\nNails provide support and protect the end of the finger.\n\nIf the bone grew all the way to support the tip, it would be much too easy to actually puncture the skin with the bone if you gripped something very hard.\n\nWithout a fingernail the tip of the finger would be rubbery soft and so flexible it would be hard to pick things up or hang onto them.  \nI know because I lost a fingernail once and it was so rubbery it felt weird and there was no strength in the tip of it.....
You may just have irreguar periods. I'm seventeen and am celibate as well. I sometimes get my period twice a month as well and it's not like there's something wrong with me, I just have irregular periods. However, if you are really concerned I suggest you visit you doctor becuase irregular mentrual periods can somtimes be linkes to irregular or imbalanced hormone levels that can be associated with certain illnesses.

Only a honeybee dies after it stings.  No other kind of bee dies after it stings once. All other types of bees have smooth stingers.  Once they sting you, they pull their stingers right back out. A honeybee's stinger, however, has a hook on the end. When a honeybee stings something and flies away, the stinger stays hooked in the flesh of the animal it just stung. Soft parts of the honeybee's body pull off with the stinger, and the bee soon dies.
"Yes. Most is possible and this is possible, but some of the little theories seem a little off... I dont think its like an arm where you just work it out and it grows. That doesnt work. You can take pills that most of the time dont work according to what i've heard. Or you can tie weights to it or do ""jelquing"", all of which can do serious damage to your body. The jelquing suppossedly swells it up big time and most of these techniques can cause PERMANENT IMPOTENCE, which you dont want, trust me. You want it to work, and you want it to work well. Girls like a guy hardup. \n   Again, you CAN, but it would take alot of lifestyle changes. What Im about to say has not evaluated by a doctor and it is not medical advice in any way. This worked for me and all of these things combined, or different combinations of these things may work for some people.\n   Diet, change your diet. Do your research on a healthy diet, and eat extremely healthy.\n   Workout seven days a week. Doesnt need to be 7 days of lifting, thats not too great even if your rotating muscle groups. Alot of cardio keeps your blood circulating all the time and it helps to rip your muscles and outstanding circulation helped me get a better erection(LARGER). \n   STOP SMOKING WEED and cigarettes. Essentially, you want to stop putting polutants and toxic substance into your body at all. I recommend to stop drinking excessively as well. Drink a beer or glass of wine once a day a couple times a week just to relax before bed or something, if that.\n   Correct your emotions. There is a small pump inside of your brain that is constantly releasing chemicals that correspond directly with certain emotions, fear, anger, etc. These chemicals are almost like food. If you have emotions similar to the idea of discontent, especially in relation to your size, I believe that this can hinder you from having a larger erection. Example, if you are discontent with your penis size when your just about to have sex with a girl, you may be alot less confident in yourself and you will be shaky, hence, you might not be able to get it up all the way. \n   Hook up with some chic that isnt an attention freak and that makes you feel confident in yourself all the time. Otherwise its not even worth your trouble, trust me. Remeber your body eats your emotions and if you have great emotion, this can help you get a larger erection according to my experience. \n   Have sex more often in combination with the things above. Your standard size will be bigger, trust me."
why not just call the school and ask them how? I'm sure they have the information you need..
Amazing what added chemicals can do.\n\nCoach

The stiffness in the neck indicated you have a problem that has increased to allow an inflammation process to involve the nerves of the brachial plexus..(the nerves to the arm). You will find there is still restriction of motion of the head to one side. When a nerve has pressure on it for any extended period of time, it acts as an anesthetic.. explaining the numbness. The tingling telling you a nerve is under a state of irritation. Is similar to what the aftermath is after you hit your crazy bone.\n\nPerhaps you should consider highly, the consultation with a doctor of Chiropractic.. and have the cause of the problem taken care of.
Yes!  The cure is called Drysol, and your doctor can prescribe it.  It works!  I used it.  Now they even make it in containers that are sort of like deoderant, making it easier to use.
You can and will get over OCD . I have suffered from Obessive compulsive disorder from age 4 to 21 It was awful and ruined my childhood and teenage life. Then No one even knew what it was. It has become out in the open lately and there is all kind of help for it. I mean I had it super bad washing hands over and over having to do things over and over trying to control the unwanted thoughts  it was hell so I sympathize with you< But when I tell you it can be controlled believe me I lived it and camr thru the other side.. In my case I simply had enough of it  surrendered to it.  asked god to remove it  trusted that god would  and did not do the compulsion no matter how bad I wanted to I believed god would not allow the unwanted thought to happen if I trusted god and didnt do the compulsion  it was hard at first but I just didnt do it no matter whqt and thank God for removing it as if it already happened!!!!! Eventually it did and I am 40 now and Have had a good adult life OCD free !!!! There is medication now that controls it and therepy 2 So it will be easier for you but I am telling you dont let it win. You control you mind remember that !!!!!!!!

It's true that briefs can cause a lack of active sperm.\nNot that every man who wears briefs is going to be infertile. \nBut what one wears is really a matter of comfort. Some men find brief too restrictive and other men find boxers too loose, becoming twisted and allows their genitals to rub causing irritation and discomfort.  It's really a matter of how you are built (hung) and what you find to be comfortable for you.\nI used to wear boxers most of my early life and then changed to briefs as I got older I found briefs more comfortable for me.
Treatment Options\n \nRosacea \nHow is it treated?\n\n\nWhile rosacea currently has no cure, various treatments are available that can help control it. Treatment may also keep it from progressing. Since the symptoms of rosacea usually vary not only from individual to individual, but also from time to time for any one patient, the choice of treatment will depend on the subtype and severity of rosacea, as well as on the patient’s emotional and physical impairment. Some rosacea treatment options include topical antibiotics, other topical preparations, oral antibiotics, laser therapy, and plastic surgery. \n\nThe main goals of rosacea treatment are to control the flare-up, prevent or decrease progression, and improve the appearance of the skin. Unfortunately, several weeks or months of treatment may be needed before improvement is apparent. In fact, topical treatments may even worsen facial redness at first. Most often, laser therapy is used to eliminate tiny widened blood vessels under the skin, and surgery removes thickened skin (most commonly from the nose). Laser and surgical treatments usually result in bruising and/or swelling that may take several days to disappear. \n\nDrug Treatment \n\nGenerally, a rosacea flare-up is treated with a combination of prescription drugs. A topical product (an antibiotic and/or another type of drug) may be applied to the affected areas and oral antibiotics may be taken, as well. Both topical and oral medications are used to reduce inflammation and/or control micro-organisms that may be involved with the flare-up. Once the flare-up is under control, oral antibiotics usually are discontinued. Topical products are often used continuously, however, to help maintain remission and prevent recurrence. \n\nTopical Preparations \n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved three topical products — metronidazole, azaleic acid, and sodium sulfacetamide and sulfur — for treating rosacea. Topical preparations, which may come in a variety of forms that include creams, gels, ointments, and solutions, are applied directly to affected areas of the face. While topical antibiotics are widely used to treat rosacea, their effectiveness may be due more to anti-inflammatory or antioxidant properties than to antibiotic activity. A cream or gel form of metronidazole is the topical antibiotic most often used for rosacea. Other topical antibiotics that may be used to treat the condition include clindamycin and erythromycin. \n\nTopical tretinoin, a vitamin A derivative that is not an antibiotic, sometimes is used to reduce rosacea papules and pustules. Benzoyl peroxide, commonly used in both prescription and over-the-counter products to treat teen acne, may also treat rosacea eruptions. Not only antibacterial, benzoyl peroxide also promotes exfoliation (also called desquamation) — it causes dead skin cells to fall off. It may cause stinging and worsen redness for some patients, however. In fact, most topical medications cause dryness, which may make skin look and feel more irritated — especially when therapy is begun. Gently applying small amounts of the topical preparation only twice a day, avoiding sunlight, and applying a water-based moisturizer can help reduce irritation. \n\nOral Antibiotics \n\nShort treatments (a few days or weeks) of an oral antibiotic, such as azithromycin, clarithromycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, minocycline, or tetracycline, may be given to control a flare-up. Frequently, these drugs are also used to treat teen acne. Due to possible side effects, longer-term oral antibiotics usually are reserved for rosacea patients with more severe forms of the condition or for those with eye-related symptoms. Typically, oral antibiotics are more effective than topical antibiotics in clearing papules and pustules. \n\nOccasionally other types of oral drugs may be used to treat rosacea. For example, isotretinoin, which is used mainly for teen acne, may help clear rosacea papules an

"There's nothing that can be done to increase your height at 25.  You're well past puberty.  No advertised product will make you grow, unfortunately.\n\nThere are surgeries which involve chipping and elongating the bones in your legs.  These are typically excrutiating and the procedures last for years to achieve a result of an inch or two.  This is sometimes performed on people with dwarfism, but I can't imagine many doctors who would be willing to put a patient through that kind of pain if they are already at 5'7"" ... which, while not average (which is probably 5'9"" or 5'10""), is not abnormally short for a male.  \n\nBe happy with yourself.

do 5 minutes of abs a day... do 30 crunches, 30 toe touches (lay flat on your back w/ your legs straight up and lift your shoulderblades off the ground to touch your toes) hold 6 inches for 30 seconds, do 30 full sit-ups, then do 30 push-ups (no girl push-ups allowed!) then start back at 30 crunches and keep the rotation going w/o stopping until 5 minutes is up! it's pretty intense, but it RELLY works!

Hey there! I have never tried this product but I do know that veneers, crowns, bridges, dentures, and fillings will not whiten. That is why it is advisable to have veneers, crowns, etc done after whitening your other teeth.
these products don't sound too bad, they are nothing prescribed for diabetes. being non prescription the predictability for these products goes low, but if you have not tried them before they could be worth a try, just let your doctor know that you are going to try 'em out and then watch your sugars closely, good luck

"""Vitamin B17"", a name given to a substance called Laetrile by those who claim it prevents and cures cancer. Read more in detail-\n\nAmygdalin, C20H27NO11, is a glycoside isolated from bitter almonds by H. E. Robiquet and A. F. Boutron-Charlard in 1830, and subsequently investigated by Liebig and Wöhler, and others. Some sources claim Ernst T. Krebs was the discoverer of the substance, and Krebs is generally credited with popularizing it as a purported cancer cure and as ""Vitamin B17."" It is extracted from almond cake by boiling alcohol; on evaporation of the solution and the addition of ether, amygdalin is precipitated as white minute crystals. Sulfuric acid decomposes it into d-glucose, benzaldehyde, and prussic acid (hydrogen cyanide); while hydrochloric acid gives mandelic acid, d-glucose, and ammonia. The decomposition induced by enzymes may occur in two ways. Maltase partially decomposes it, giving d-glucose and mandelic nitrile glucoside, C6H5CH(CN)O·C6H11O5; this compound is isomeric with sambunigrin, a glucoside found by E.E. Bourquelot and Danjou in the berries of the common elder, Sambucus nigra. Emulsin, on the other hand, decomposes it into benzaldehyde, cyanide, and two molecules of glucose; this enzyme occurs in the bitter almond, and consequently the seeds invariably contain free cyanide and benzaldehyde. An ""amorphous amygdalin"" is said to occur in the cherry-laurel. Closely related to these glucosides is dhurrin, C14H17O7N, isolated by W. Dunstan and T. A. Henry from the common sorghum or ""great millet,"" Sorghum vulgare; this substance is decomposed by emulsin or hydrochloric acid into d-glucose, cyanide, and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde-."

Honey, you cannot be properly treated online, not if you are having such serious thoughts--- call the crisis hotline---it will be in your phone book and it should be the suicide/crisis hotline--- it is anonymous, they do not ask your name or age, they just sit and talk to you and that is a quick fix for tonight--- but, you really should talk to a family member that is close to you- sister, brother, aunt, and if you don't have anyone, you can go to your FREE counseling center in your city- the hotline will give you the name, phone number and address and you need to sit down with a professional and have them help you deal with whatever is depressing you--------you are toooo young to be feeling that way and honestly, NOTHING is worth killing yourself over--- please seek help!  good luck to you.

My brother-in-law had a huge piece of metal dropped on the back of his foot at work. After the bruises healed, he learned his heel spurs had been broken up by the injury.\n\nWhile a true story, I wouldn't recommend that strategy. Try drinking Emergen-C with MSM 2 or 3 times a day. It is a powdered drink you can buy in any good health food store or online. It doesn't taste bad at all...kind of like a slightly salty fizzy lemondae. A doctor friend of mine recommends it to his patients and has known it to resolve heel spurs (among other things).

"DID is usually caused by some sort of early trauma, usually severe, sustained trauma like abuse, living on the streets, being a refugee, etc. Memories and experiences that are too much for a young child are then ""given"" to a separate personality, who is strong enough to handle them. \n\nWhen a psychiatrist deals with a person with more than one personality, he usually has to start out dealing with each one separately... The goal is to get them ""talking"" to each other, and cooperating. Ultimately, they may re-integrate into a single personality again. Before this can happen, the original trauma usually has to be dealt with and accepted as part of the person's past.\n\nMedicines can help--depression, PTSD, and anxiety are very common comorbids to DID, and these often respond to various antidepressants, tranquilizers, and antipsychotics. However, most of the work is done by the patient in counseling; the medicines in this case are helpers but not the main treatment."

Pain is actualy felt in the brain. But it allows you to feel it wherer there is a injury so that you know to fix it or move it.\nMeds tagret the pain receptors in the brain, thus dulling or removing the aches or hurts in question.
Sounds about right.  Same thing has been happening to me this year.  Just be glad it's not a full migrain.  Migrains are mental and your brain is finding ways to counteract the migrain before it develops.  You may also be finding ways to react to it differently.\nHere are some things I do.\n1. Take 2 motrin as soon as I see it with my eyes (sometimes I can feel it come on before my eyes go wacky).\n2. Relax\n3. Walk around to get blood flowing if you've been sitting\n4. Use the restroom, eat something soft like a burito, massage sore muscles, or anything else I can tell that may be causing internal stress\n5. Rest your eyes\n6. Get a damp washcloth put on your eyes / forehead\n7. Lay down in bed\n8. If migraine still coming on, I take another 2 motrin at about 1/2 hr after step 1.  Then I go back to bed and its a waiting game from there.

The eight essential sugars are part of a larger nutrient picture known as Glyconutrients \n\nGlyco means “sweet” and, therefore, used when describing a sugar or carbohydrate molecule. “Sugar”, “Carbohydrate” and “Saccharide are all used interchangeably. \n\nGlycoforms are large sugar molecules that combine with proteins and/or fats to cover the surfaces of all cells. These are then known as “glycoproteins” or “glycolipids”. \n\nGlycoproteins are molecules made of sugars and proteins. They are found coating the surface of every cell in the human body that contains a nucleus. \n\nGlycolipids are molecules made of sugars and fats. “Lipid” and “Fat” are often used interchangeably. \n\nGlyconutrients are the foods and nutritional supplements that provide saccharides along with other glycoforms essential to the body, but which are scarce in most diets.

First of all, know the serieses allotted to different service providers such as BSNL, Air Tel etc. They have specific numbers. with this half of the number can be remembered easily. and for balance say the number rythemically or whether the number can be fitted in even or odd series. and finally remember the total of the number. For example 9826883422 can be remembered like 9+8+2+6+8+8+3+4+2+2=52 5+2=7. Like this.

Yep, I did something similar years ago.\n\nI saw a doctor who told me to avoid sitting for six months and that is what I did.  I didn't sit at the table for meals, I avoided any car rides of more than fifteen minutes or so, and in general I just didn't sit.  Sometimes it was embarrassing, like at conferences when I'd stand instead of sit in the chair, but it did pay off.\nGood luck to  you.

Crash dieting will make you fatter in the long run. This is because your body goes into starvation mode. The human body is designed to hang onto fat in case of famine. This is something that we have carried with us since before we were living in caves and evolved because food sources were less certain at that time. We live in a modern world now where there is plenty of food. But our evolution is still in the caves and our bodies do not recognise this (unfortunately). Hence the minute we cut calories drastically to try to lose weight quickly, our bodies behave as though each meal will be our last. The end result is our metabolisms slow right down. That is why we often end up fatter after a period of crash dieting. \n\nWhat you need to do is try to shift your mindset and make a lifestyle change that you will stick to. This calls for a new way of looking at food and eating for the rest of your life. The problem with diets is most people see them as short term fixes. Once they have achieved what they want to achieve (i.e. weight loss), lots of people just go back to their former eating habits - then they are surprised that the weight comes back again - in spades!\n\nNutritionists everywhere agree that a healthy, balanced diet is the key to good health. Focus your diet on variety - primarily brightly coloured vegetables and fruit (no more than 2 pieces of fruit a day - 3 in a pinch) with more focus on vegetables. Give up mayo and fatty dressings. Cut fat off meat - visible fat - and remove the skin from chicken. Cook with any method that does not involve adding fat. Do not eat anything in breadcrumbs or pastry. Reduce bread but if you can't, eat wholegrain bread. Reduce fats generally. Minimise fast food. Drink water instead of fruit juices and diet soda (I posted something here about diet soda earlier - it is not our friend!). Cut out ALL processed foods - white anything, sugar, candy and cakes. Instead, snack on nuts (or raw vegetables not dried fruit). \n\nMost of all, accept that you did not get fat overnight and you will not get slim overnight either. Tell yourself that this is a long term solution and you are willing to do the whole haul for the sake of your health.\n\nIf you decide not to follow these principles and instead try to crash diet again, chances are in 6 months - a year's time, you will be looking back still fat (if not fatter) and asking the same question about weight loss.

"Keep your nails short! you wouldn't run a race with a broken ankle like, oh well it'll get better. \n\nMOISTURIZE!!! use hand cream rather than lotion (it's thicker) and put on COTTON gloves afterward to keep the lotion on your hands until it absorbs. \n\n\nAVOID fake nails. they kill the strongest of nails.  \n\nI find that getting manicures once a week helps keep my nails in shape. Having them filed and shaped and breaks repaired can help your nails get stronger. when you do go, bring your own nail polish remover. buy the kind that has ""no acetone"" (which can also be labeled as nail polish remover for fake nails). \n\njust for the sake of precaution, ask your doctor.

What is the brand name for adderall? Add Details please. \n\nEdit: I looked up adderall by typing it into my yahoo search bar. It has a site that you can look up drug interactions and side effects.\n\nI didn't find anything in regard to nicotine or the patch. \n\nHowever it is always best to consult a pharmacist,ER, or your physician rather than rely on the info from the internet.\n\nThis medication id highly habit forming and has some very serious side effects associated with it. From reading the info provided here,I would strongly recommend not using the patch or nicotine. This is my opinion based on the information I read about this med though. Knowing what it is used for and the consequences of the med itself,I would suggest that you not use the patch or nicotine;even if it is only until you're able to reach your physician.\n\n~Z~

Holy CARBS!!!\n\nUm, as long as your body feels fulfilled you are not hurting it!!
I suggest a high protein low carb diet.  You want you body to burn the excess weight, meaning you want your intake of food to produce fat burning This will help since your excercise potential is limited due to your back. Keep a food journal and pay attention to how and when you eat. I suggest cutting out starch altogether.   For 14 days .Do the same with fruit  Starch-ie bread, pasta, cereal-  turns to sugar in your bloodstream as does fruit. And remember that Dairy products are another source of carbs.

No, if you are on your period you have already ovulated and there isn't an egg to fertilize.  Its so many days after your cycle that you can become pregnant.  A woman has a discharge before and after her cycle.  The best time to get pregnant is when the discharge is thin, thats when you are ovulating.

"Cellulitis is an acute inflammation of the connective tissue of the skin, caused by infection with staphylococcus, streptococcus or other bacteria (see also cellulitis - streptococcal).\n\nCauses, incidence, and risk factors    Return to top \n\nThe skin normally has many types of bacteria living on it, but intact skin is an effective barrier that keeps these bacteria from entering and growing within the body. When there is a break in the skin, however, bacteria can enter the body and grow there, causing infection and inflammation. The skin tissues in the infected area become red, hot, irritated and painful.\n\nCellulitis is most common on the face and lower legs, although skin on other areas of the body may sometimes be involved.\n\nRisk factors for cellulitis include:\n\nInsect bites and stings, animal bite, or human bite \nInjury or trauma with a break in the skin (skin wounds) \nHistory of peripheral vascular disease \nDiabetes-related or ischemic ulcers \nRecent cardiovascular, pulmonary (lung), dental or other procedures \nUse of immunosuppressive or corticosteroid medications \nSymptoms    Return to top \n\nLocalized skin redness or inflammation that increases in size as the infection spreads \nTight, glossy, ""stretched"" appearance of the skin \nPain or tenderness of the area \nSkin lesion or rash (macule): \nSudden onset \nUsually with sharp borders \nRapid growth within the first 24 hours \nWarmth over the area of redness \nFever \nOther signs of infection: \nChills, shaking \nWarm skin, sweating \nFatigue \nMuscle aches, pains (myalgias) \nGeneral ill feeling (malaise) \nAdditional symptoms that may be associated with this disease: \nNausea and vomiting \nJoint stiffness caused by swelling of the tissue over the joint \nHair loss at the site of infection \nSigns and tests    Return to top \n\nDuring a physical examination, the doctor may find localized swelling. Occasionally, swollen glands (lymph nodes) can be detected near the cellulitis.\n\nTests that may be used:\n\nA CBC may show an elevated white blood cell count, and indicates a bacterial infection. \nA blood culture may be performed if generalized infection is suspected. \nTreatment    Return to top \n\nCellulitis treatment may require hospitalization if it is severe enough to warrant intravenous antibiotics and close observation. At other times, treatment with oral antibiotics and close outpatient follow-up is enough. Treatment is focused on control of the infection and prevention of complications.\n\nAntibiotics are given to control infection, and analgesics may be needed to control pain.\n\nElevate the infected area, usually higher than the heart, to minimize swelling. Apply warm, moist compresses to the site to fight infection by increasing blood supply to the tissues. Rest until symptoms improve.\n\nExpectations (prognosis)    Return to top \n\nCure is possible with 7 to 10 days of treatment. Cellulitis may be more severe in people with chronic diseases and people who are susceptible to infection (immunosuppressed).\n\nComplications    Return to top \n\nTissue death (gangrene) \nSepsis, generalized infection and shock \nMeningitis (if cellulitis is on the face) \nLymphangitis (inflammation of the lymph vessels) \nCalling your health care provider    Return to top \n\nCall your health care provider if symptoms indicate that cellulitis may be present.\n\nCall your health care provider if you are being treated for cellulitis and new symptoms develop, such as persistent fever, drowsiness, lethargy, blistering over the cellulitis, or extension of the red streaks.\n\nPrevention    Return to top \n\nAvoid skin damage by wearing appropriate protective equipment when participating in work or sports. Also, clean any breaks in the skin carefully and watch for redness, pain, drainage, or other signs of infection.\n\nFinally, maintain good general health and control chronic medical conditions.

I feel as if I have to correct some well-meaning information given to you by ilovemycfnis.  If a doctor is doing an endometrial biopsy, they are not looking for HPV.  They are looking for any cancer in the lining of the uterus.  Endometrial cancer can cause excessive bleeding, and he/she is just looking to rule that out.  If the biopsy is negative, the doctor will make a detemination based on your history, as to a course of treatment.  I hope this is helpful to you.
Dark brown or black could indicate internal bleeding, NOT good.  Red could mean fresh blood which can happen occasionally, usually for known reasons, like dry or hard poop tearing up body tissues.  Normal color is light to medium brown, or green too if you ate a lot of green stuff.  Hope this helps.
Bleeding in the upper part of the gut may cause passing of black,tarry and sticky stool.It may also have peculiar smell.Pain may or may not be present.\nSince you  have some pain now with passing of black stool without any chages in diet, there may be bleeding somewhere.\nYou shouldc heck with your family doctor.
There are several areas you could persue:\n\n1. CNA   (certified nurses assistant) - This would require only about 3 months of training and you take a certification exam.  There is a great need for these people not only in the hospital setting, but also at extended care facilities and nursing homes.  Basically the training prepares you for direct patient care, such as taking vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, pulse), assisting patients with ambulation, assisting with meals and perhaps feeding them, assisting with personal hygiene, etc.  The CNA works under a registered nurse and helps with whatever tasks are necessary.\n2. LPN - Nursing in many states is restricted to nursing homes and extended care facilities, however some hospitals I'm sure still employ LPN nurses.\n3. RN - registered nurses go to school for a minimum of 2 years, but many are baccalaureate programs.\n4. Medical transcription - I'm not sure how long the program lasts, but I would guess around 6 months.  This teaches you all the medical terminology and you would listen to physician dictation and type it into a computer for record keeping.\n5. Pharmacy assistant - again about 6 months to learn this skill\n6.  Surgical technician - These programs generally take a year to complete and after finishing the course you  work inside of the operating room assisting the surgeon by preparing the instruments that are needed, handing instruments to the surgeon, assisting with holding retractors, etc.\nThere are also positions inside the hospital that you could work while attending school, such as....dietary aide, housekeeping, central supply, etc.   and these positions may help you get a foot in the door.\n\nGood luck - We need health care providers in many different areas.

Swimming. Mixing swimming and running will improve your cardiovascular fitness and maximize the benefits of both sports. Running can place a lot of strain on your legs so swimming will allow you put less strain on your legs but condition them at the same times.  This will allow a better heal. Also, swimming will build up your breathing and heart functioning which can result in a faster run.
First off, believe that you CAN kick the habit.  Whatever the case may be, believing in yourself is KEY.  Confidence in yourself is also very important. \n\nIdentify the reason you do it OTHER than it relaxes you, because quite frankly, (like my smoking) that is an excuse and an excuse only, not a reason.\n\nGet rid of the reason, stress, depression, whatever it is.\n\nDevelop a support system.  Weather it be friends, family, therapy or an Internet group and sometimes even your family doctor.\n\nThen finally, follow through.  Find something that distracts you.  Something you can do EVERY time you are tempted.  It could be a hand held game (like the poker ones or something) crossword puzzles, anything that stimulates thought.  It would be great if you had someone you could call or email or like I said an Internet group you could write ANYTIME Internet was available.  I wish you great luck and success in kicking this if you are serious!\n\nXOXO Lissa
I would think that you are just about ready for a huge growth spurt.  Once you are completely finished with puberty, the growth plates close, and then growth is only minimal.

Milk and good nutrition work wonders.
If you can be moderately active, one other serious help would be to cut out processed sugar.  It's not fun, but it will help.  This means no candy, cake, donuts, cookies, ice cream, etc.  Don't overdo pasta and bread, but cutting out the sweets should help.  It will suck, but help.
Go to a doctor ASAP because trying to get it out urself can make it worse.

Hi,\nI've tried all different diets, and the weight loss is only temporary. I finally tried diet pills on the market are made from Hoodia. I saw this stuff on ABC News. It's all natural and safe, and it works! My wife took it for a month and dropped 20 pounds. I took it for a month and lost about 13 (but I didn't exercise).\n\nI bought the natural hoodia from this website: http://www.alllsite.info/free-diet-pills.php . I checked the web site address so I can post it here and I saw they're running a promotion now to get a free 2 week sample for only $4.97! I'm going to order this supply for my wife and give it to her for Christmas =)

If her throat feels like it is burning and it feels like food coming back up into throat then it is most likely reflux.  I would take her to doctor and they can either give her medicine or suggest other alternatives.  In the meantime, try having her eat smaller portions and sitting or standing (as long as she doesn't lay down) up for about 30 minutes.  Longer if she can.

"""A certain amount of free fluid in the pelvis, behind the uterus, is normal at certain points in your cycle; after ovulation, a small amount of fluid released with the egg collects behind the uterus and is eventually reabsorbed by the body.

well when i was 2 years old i had to have tubes in my ears because they were filling up with fuild and i was losing my hearing you will have the tubes in your ears for how ever long the doctor said and then they will take them out i had them in to drain the fluid and my hearing came back to me but i lost 2 sounds that are really no use one very high pitched sound and a very low sound i hear fine now
I understand totally how you are feeling. I started cutting myself at about 12 years old but then I stopped a while and picked it back  up at seventeen and then stopped again and just recently started again and Iam 28.  I have had such a terrible life that it helped me cope. I was hurting myself because of other people. Eample: If i was to have a fight with my husband and he became abusive I would go in the bathroom and cut myself. See its other peoples negitive actions that  caused me to feel a certain way, so in reality I was punishing myself and cutting myself  because  I did not what to feel certain feelings. Instead of getting angry or explosive or hurting the person who hurt me I would hurt myself. Cutting can be very dangerous even though you may feel its helping you. Its only making matters worse in side you. Look at it has a drug addict. When a addict gets upset and cant cope with life he will use.  the problem is still there but self medicating  makes it go away for a while but the problem is still with the person. So theres nothing that can take pain away forever unless you work on it. Its not going to be easy it will take time. people want to die when they feel trapped. You dont know what else to do to make you happy  in life and so far your whole time being on earth has been terrible you say i rather die if i have to live like this forever. Thats the worsed feeling for a person. Death is not the answer, trust me I tried it alot of times and i was in and out of hospitals. (no way to live)   You start to believe in a higher power because you cant believe all the trying you did to kill yourself  and your still here. You have to find out what the root of all your problems are, who is hurting you, school pressures, mom, dad, siblings, other family ect.  You have to talk about whats bothering you. Thats the only way someone can help you. You need to see a counsler but not for your parents for yourself. Apparently something went on in your family or friends and you are burying it, by cutting yourself. Please take it from me deal with what is going on with you now. The older you get the worse it will become. My mother did the same thing to me at 12. I would go because i ways forced and nothing got acomplished. I would just sit there listening. I never talked and i felt even if i did no one would understand and think i was a freak. Years later I went and found that same lady my mother sent me to. I then felt ready to talk. There were many  hard things that happened to me that I was not ready to discuss. She told me it will take work and we have to start out with baby steps. That was fine with me. You seem like a bright person and one that wants to know what to do to change. You are making the first step by reaching out. Thats great half the people that have what we have dont even know were to begin and they think they have no problem. I know you want to be different and change its just you feel alone and think no one will care and if any say they do they will try to lock you up in some mental ward. I have been in many mental hospitals its nothing like tv. They do help if you talk and tell them everything you feel dont worry about sounding crazy. Your feelings are your feelings. there are medications out there that do help. Iam on some myself. So you are not alone. Iam here if you need to talk.
because you took that morning after pill. It's probably just the baby you murdered coming out of you, that's all.
Hey Val,\nthe only thing that has helped me is to get involved in somerhing soothing even if you don't want to do anything, the quickest thing to do is turn on the radio, it is almost instant that you get considerable relief from anger. go out side and and spend a little energy-instant relief , but you really need to make yourself do something.  let me know how you are doing.&#92;  My e-address is cjydawn@yahoo.com\ngood luck.
I'm wondering why you put this in 'alternative medicine'.  Good alternatives to the meds are plenty of exercise and St John's Wort is the herbal equivalent to a well-known anti-depressant.  The meds are just blocking the symptoms and not getting to the source.  You will always have side effects and they are also addictive, so you would need to come off them gradually.\n\n\nhttp://www.freewebs.com/spiritualhealing
Well, there are lasers and there are LASERS.\nPerhaps you'll be just as well off using a laser pointer, because dental lasers are powerful beasties costing megabucks. Their intention is to activate the bleach by releasing H2O2 in a faster and higher fashion than home bleaching. You're not going to get a laser like that thru the mail, not to mention the safety considerations.\nIn any case, home bleaching has been found in studies to give better and longer-lasting effects than in-surgery bleaching.

"First of all, you can't exercise ""too long"". It depends on what your objectives are. If you stay longer than 40 mins on the treadmill, you're losing more fat and building up more endurance. If you stay on for 30-45 mins, that's a good time for people who just want to lose weight and keep in shape. After 30 mins, you start burning fat instead of just calories. So the longer you stay on, the more fat you're burning. People who train for marathons and races definitely stay longer than 45 mins! \nBut in your case, I think 30-45 mins is a great time to start off with. And don't worry, my face also gets extremely flushed after working out, this has nothing to do with your level of fitness.\nYou will see that the longer you stick with it, the better your overall fitness will become, and eventually you can start jogging. I can also recommend that you perhaps try the uphill mode on the treadmill - it'll burn more calories and tone your butt as well. So, I think you should keep up the brisk walk for now, and start jogging whenever you're ready for it (and you will be). However, if you really don't like jogging, just keep walking. It definitely puts less stress on your knees and as long as you're exercising, there's nothing wrong with walking! The key is to work up a sweat and get your heart rate up."

"If you are indeed suffering from pain severe enough to warrant narcotics you should speak with a physician.\nSelf medicating can be very dangerous not too mention illegal.\n\nIf however, you do not suffer from pain and just want the drugs to get 'high"" I strongly encourage you to seek professional help from a therapist, or a substance abuse physician, counselor.\nThere are major risks with taking narcotics and one of them is your life, not too mention prison if you were to be caught.     I also have issues with individuals who use drugs in this manner as it causes those who truly need these medications undue stress when they are unable to receive them."

As far as I know, it's okay. My mother was taking them together for a year or so. But you might want to ask your doctor or a pharmicist to be on the safe side.

I'll bet you have curly hair too.\nYour problem is likely in-grown hairs.  \nYou know how the commercials say the razors shave below the skin?  Well they do.  When the hair tries to grow back out it grows under the skin (which happens more often the curlier your hair is), and gets irritated and you get a zit.  Clean a large pin or a needle with alcohol and free up the ingrown hairs when they get painful.  The only preventative solution is to not shave so close.  Stick with the electric and don't press too hard.

"your skin is olily. so make sure that any product you use is oil free. it would also be great for your skin to get moisture and water. find a moisturizer with ""lanolin"". this helps the skin absorb water. and DONT use anything on your face that has alcohol. i use clean and clear, which has no alcohol in it, its just a cleanser. get anything that is ""anti-microbial"". that will clean all the germs that is exacerbating your acne. any type of exfoliating cream would be great to get too."

Neonatal intensive care nurses monitor and maintain the health of critically ill babies who are sent to neonatal intensive care units that are devoted to their care.\n\n\n\nSome babies are born prematurely (under 37 weeks gestation) and they need assistance because various systems and organs are not yet fully developed. Full term babies born with health problems, such as birth defects or infections, may be in the unit because they need special treatment, observation or surgery.\n\nOnce babies are admitted to the NICU, either directly from the delivery room, the newborn nursery, or from another hospital's NICU or nursery, working as part of a specialist team, neonatal intensive care nurses begin the constant monitoring of their young patients. \n\n\n\nWelcome To The NICU \n\nNIC nurses are trained in assessment. They monitor vital signs such as respiration, heart rate and temperature. This information assists the neonatalogist in planning treatment for the baby. \n\nDuring a baby's stay in a NICU, physical examinations and assessments of their condition are regularly carried out by the nurses. To help evaluate a baby's condition, blood, urine tests and x-rays may be arranged and conducted. Weighing and measuring the babies also enables the nurses to keep a check on their progress.\n\n\n\nBabies are monitored from their special beds or incubators, which are used to help keep their body temperature stable. Some may be wrapped in bubble plastic or glad wrap to help keep them warm.\n\nOn The Hour, Every Hour\n\n''NIC nurses do hourly observations, checking the baby's temperature, heart rate, pulse and blood pressure. If the baby is on a ventilator, then the nurse would also maintain the pressure and rate of the ventilator. All of this information, including every abnormality, is recorded,'' says a local neonatal nurse.\n\n\n\n\n\nNIC nurses are taught to be super diligent, they work according to a system and 'cutting corners' is something they simply cannot afford to do. \n\nNIC nurses work under the direction of neonatologists (pediatricians with additional training in newborn intensive care) and they also work closely alongside other NIC nurses, so teamwork is clearly critical in this profession. \n\nAll babies, especially very sick babies, need to be in contact with their parents. NIC nurses encourage a high level of contact between parents and their baby, while the baby is in intensive care. Parents also need to be kept fully informed about their baby's condition. \n\n\n\nNurses need to have very good people and communication skills, and to be supportive of parents with whom they spend a lot of time. It's very much the nurse's responsibility to teach parents how to care for their babies and to look for the signs that indicate something maybe wrong.\n\nVarious sources indicate that much of the pleasure of the job comes from it's very hands on nature, and the satisfaction that comes from getting to know babies and parents, who stay sometimes for a fairly long period of time. But, they also suggest that you need to be able to work in a team, cope with sometimes stressful situations and those irregular hours. \n\nThe development and dissemination of neonatal intensive care technology has been associated with improved survival rates for critically ill, newborn infants, some of whom are born many weeks ahead of their expected birth date.\n\n\n\nIndustry representatives and employment forecasters suggest that employment prospects are good for nurses in general. In Western Australia, there is a strong demand for the skills of NIC nurses but the workforce is still very small. \n\nAfter training, the intensive care nurse can expect to earn about $41,000 per year, which can go as high as $102,000 for a director of nursing.
Pray to God and he will help you.\n\nRead the verses from the Holy Bible\n\nPsa 27:7 Hear, O LORD, [when] I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me. \n\nJam 5:14 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: \n\nJam 5:15 And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. \n\nPsa 22:11 Be not far from me; for trouble [is] near; for [there is] none to help.\n\nPsa 22:19 But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me. \n\nPsa 27:9 Hide not thy face [far] from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation. \n\nPsa 60:11 Give us help from trouble: for vain [is] the help of man. \n\nPsa 115:11 Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he [is] their help and their shield. \n\nHope you are cured by Gods grace and love for you.\n\nMay God bless you. In Jesus name. Amen.
your friends will look after their own way of handling it. It is good to be able to be honest with them. However if you're cutting yourself maybe it's time to talk to a professional who can help you. it may be too much for your friends to deal with alone. They can still support you while someone else qualified really helps you. It's worth it. Good luck.

I've tried it and it did not work for me.  I was always hungry while following the diet religiously.  Everyone is different too, it may work very well for some and not for others.  So, give it a try and if it works for you then great, if not, don't get frustrated.  Try something else.  As with any weight loss program, you do need to follow it.  So, good luck.
Both sweet and dry have similar benefits, and good news, there is more health benefit to  beer than to bubbly soft drinks.
Your first appointment is a consultation.  They will explain the procedure and payment options and maybe x-rays after a down payment is made and a contract is signed.\n\nBands and brackets are up to the orthodontist.  My orthodontist used brackets on molars.  My daughter had bands on some molars, but she went to a different orthodontist.   I think brackets are more comfortable.\n\nYour baby tooth will have to be extracted by your dentist.  Your orthodontist will explain this to you after x-rays are taken.  My daughter had baby teeth that wouldn't come out naturally and had to have dental surgery to remove them.  Not all baby teeth need surgery.\n\nYes, the adult teeth will have brackets, but sometimes, baby teeth will not fall out naturally.  The baby tooth has to come out so that the adult tooth will come in.\n\nYour orthodontist will explain everything to you.  Sometimes other dental appliances are necessary.  My daughter had a device that expanded her arch.  She also had an appliance that corrected her cross bite.\n\nDon't be worried about anything.  Modern dentistry and orthodontics are wonderful.  There is an adjustment period after the braces, but you will adjust in no time.  Good luck and remember it won't be long and you will have a beautiful smile and beautiful teeth.

How much are you taking?  If you are only on 10 mg, you may need to up the dose to 20.  If you are thinking of adding Wellbutrin, it may make more sense to switch to Cymbalta, which is like putting Lexapro and Wellbutrin together.   I have seen great success with Cymbalta for anxiety and depression.
It sounds weird, but I personally think that when you see someone yawn, its kind of like a mental thing to think tiredness.

You have just explained exactly what i go through at least once per week. It is the scariest thing for me. No matter how hard i try i just cant move even though i know im not asleep.\n\nI looked into this condition awhile ago. Its a safety mechanism your brain will sometimes paralise your body so you don't hurt yourself while asleep. The only problem is sometimes its faulty. Somehow this don't make me feel any better. lol\n\nBest thing to do is just ignore it and go back to sleep. Thats what i do.\n\nThe only thing that really scares me about all this is, what if there is a home invasion or a fire starts and you can't move to get out.
I would definitely not recommend it since Adderall is a stimulant and can cause a panic attack in a panic-prone person.  There are better meds to combine with Zoloft if you have panic problems along with attention problems.  I personally feel that Adderall is too powerful a stimulant to be used in a panic-prone person but I am not a pharmacist (only a psychology graduate student who took psychopharmacology and loved it).  Please ask your doctor or better a pharmacist before taking that combination.  I doubt it would be fatal but it could cause a panic attack and would not likely be helpful in any way.
do some sit ups,  and some not heavy weights\n\n:> peace\n.
""
Registered Nurse here; Okay hun, first of all 450 sit ups is far to many for your age or anyone's.  This does prove your in excellent physical shape.  Now you need to give your body time to grow and catch up.  11 years of age, your body is just beginning to mature.  Things may not come together all at once as you would like for them to, but believe me they will.  Now doing 450 setups, sounds like you could be developing another problem known as obsessive compulsive disorder, in other words, you over compensate, and work your body for to hard.  Slow down, exercises in moderation.  Please don't obsess over your body.  \nThanks for the opportunity to address such an important question.
from http://www.babyhopes.com/articles/causes-low-sperm-count.html\n\nCauses for LOW sperm count:\n\nTesticular Exposure to Overheating. \nOverheating (such as from high fever, saunas, and hot tubs) may temporarily lower sperm count. Work exposure to overheating may even impair fertility. \n\nSubstance Abuse\nCocaine or heavy marijuana use appears to temporarily reduce the number and quality of sperm by as much as 50%. Sperm actually have receptors for certain compounds in marijuana that resemble natural substances and which may impair the sperm's ability to swim and may also inhibit their ability to penetrate the egg. \n\nSmoking. \nSmoking impairs sperm count, sperm motility, reduces sperm lifespan, and may cause genetic changes that affect the offspring. Additionally, a 1999 study found that men who smoke have lower sex drives and less frequent sex. \n\nMalnutrition and Nutrient Deficiencies. \nDeficiencies in certain nutrients, such as vitamin C, selenium, zinc, and folate, may be particular risk factors for low sperm count in such cases. \n\nObesity. \nSome studies, but not all, have found an association between obesity in men and low sperm count.\n\nBicycling. \nBicycling has been linked to impotence in men and also may affect the sperm count. Pressure from the bike seat may damage blood vessels and nerves that are responsible for erections. Mountain biking, which involves riding on off-road terrain, exposes the perineum (the region between the scrotum and the anus) to more extreme shocks and vibrations and increases the risk for injuries to the scrotum. \n\nGenetic Factors \nGenetic factors are proving to be important contributors to male infertility. Such genetic conditions may be inherited or caused by environmental assaults. Inherited disorders can genetically impair fertility.\n\nEnvironmental Assaults \nOver exposure to environmental assaults (toxins, chemicals, infections) can reduce sperm count either by direct effects on testicular function or on the hormone systems, although the extent of the effect and specific environmental assaults involved are often controversial. Some chemicals that affect sperm production men are : Oxygen-Free Radicals, Estrogen emulation pesticidal chemicals (DDT, aldrin, dieldrin, PCPs, dioxins, and furans ), plastic softening chemicals like Phthalates, hydrocarbons (ethylbenzene, benzene, toluene, and xylene)\n\nExposure to Heavy Metals. \nChronic exposure to heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, or arsenic may affect sperm production and most often cause a reduced production in otherwise healthy males. Trace amounts of these metals in semen seem to inhibit the function of enzymes contained in the acrosome, the membrane that covers the head of the sperm. \n\nRadiation Treatment. \nRadiation treatments and x-rays affect any rapidly dividing cell, so cells that produce sperm are quite sensitive to radiation damage. Cells exposed to significant levels of radiation may take up to two years to resume normal sperm production, and, in severe circumstances, may never recover. \n\nLow Semen Levels \nA reduced amount of ejaculated semen (less than 0.5 milliliters per sample) may be caused by a structural abnormality in the tubes transporting the sperm. \n\nVaricocele\nA varicocele is a varicose vein in the cord that connects to the testicle. (A varicose vein is one that is abnormally enlarged and twisted.) Varicoceles are found in 15% to 20% of all men and in 25% to 40% of infertile men. It is not clear how they affect fertility, or even if they do at all.
Epidermolysis bullosa is just one in a group of blistering skin conditions. The skin is so fragile in people with epidermolysis bullosa that even minor rubbing may cause blistering. At times, the person may not be aware of rubbing or injuring the skin even though blisters develop. In severe epidermolysis bullosa, blisters are not confined to the outer skin. They may develop inside the body, in such places as the linings of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, intestines, upper airway, bladder, and the genitals. Most forms of epidermolysis bullosa are evident at birth. This disorder can be both disabling and disfiguring, and some forms may lead to early death. The disease results when skin layers separate after minor trauma. Defects of several proteins within the skin are at fault. \n\nTo pick up a baby with severe epidermolysis bullosa, place the child on a soft material and support the under the buttocks (bottom) and behind the neck. A baby with epidermolysis bullosa should never be picked up under the arms. To protect the skin from injury, avoid overheating by keeping rooms at an even temperature, apply lubricants to the skin to reduce friction and keep the skin moist, use simple, soft clothing that requires minimal handling when dressing a child, use sheepskin on car seats and other hard surfaces, and put mittens on at bedtime to help prevent scratching. When blisters appear, the objectives of care are to reduce pain or discomfort, prevent excessive loss of body fluid, promote healing, and prevent infection. If infection appears, it should be promptly treated.

I had the same thing along with other coming and going symptoms.  I had been seeing a dr like every month or every other month.  Finally it got to be so bad I switched dr.s for a second opinion. He said I have Interstitail cycstitis (very hard to recognize cause symptoms are so similar to a lot of other things), no one knows what causes it but I didn't have any problems until I had my second.  She is now 6 months old and they are still treating me.  I don't feel anything like I did.  \nIts hard to be a good momma when your in pain all the time right? Good Luck hope it gets better.
"I dont really know what that pain could be. It definitely could be related to the PCOS. I would recommend seeing a reproductive endocrinologist. It would probably be OK to wait until Jan...but when you make your appt., talk to a nurse and see what they say. Here's a little general info on PCOS that I feel is important. \n\n\n The underlying cause of PCOS is insulin resistance (IR). The best treatment for PCOS is going on an insulin sensitizing drug such as metformin (1500-2550mg per day) combined with a low carb diet and exercise. There are a few important things to know:\n\n1. Many women ""pass"" the test for IR, but still respond positively from the metformin. No one knows exactlly why..my thought is that the test is not a sure fire way of detecting the IR.\n\n2. You must be on a high enough dose of metformin. I've heard women complain that their bodies dont start working even though they've been on metformin for awhile. Some doctors are hesitant to up the dose past 1500mg...but for some of us it takes more. I don't respond until my dose is around 2000mg a day. \n\n3. It can take a few months on the correct dose, before your body is regulated. \n\n4. It is important to treat your PCOS even if you are not trying to get pregnant. There are higher risks for many things (high blood pressure, blood clots, diabetes, and many other things) when you have PCOS, but if it is treated properly, then those risks go back to a normal rate. \n\nI recommend seeing a reproductive endocrinologist. They are the most knowledgeable about PCOS. I also highly recommend visiting http://messageboards.ivillage.com/iv-bhp... It is a great message board, where you can ask all your PCOS questions. The women there are great. Good luck."

"I have been taking it for 3 weeks and the only side effect i've had from it is being tired.  It has just kicked my butt, but other than that i have had no troubles with it.  For me, it took about 3 weeks to kick in and it's a slow kick to boot, but it is great.  It wasn't this big flashy thing where ""hey i feel better like right now"" it was more gradual and i never even noticed it other than i just feel good - no big moment.  No more panic attacks and anxities.  I was taking effexor and it KILLED my drive - i have had no problems with the cymbalta doing that - the drive is where it was 4 weeks ago.\n\nGood luck! :)"
"I feel like i just answered this question an hour ago. Hehe. Okay. I know this sounds very weird, but it has helped me examine a lot in my life. It may or may not work for you, but there's always room to try, isn't there. First off, question everything!!! Why are you crying? Okay, you've answered that it's about something that's going to happen or ""something else"". You need to be more specific. Find the answers. Ask yourself questions until you tire of it or find the answers to them. You are more than likely having a bout of insomnia, as I am one. True, you can just let your body tire itself out. Things that you can do to help this are:\n\n1) exercise\n2) meditate (listen to soft music, breathing exercises, etc)\n3) taking a bath\n4) reading \n\nWhile you are trying to go to sleep it's best to clear your mind, hence why i suggest meditation. This is a big problem for most of us as we have so much going on in our lives and why we feel we didn't sleep as well the next day. Clear your mind of all your problems, worries and anxieties. Let yourself go and drift. You will fall asleep."

"You go to the office, a tube is inserted into your lubricated rectum, warm water is sent into your colon through the tube.  Then the water is released.  This is repeated for 45 minutes to an hour.  The water loosens up encrusted fecal matter in your colon so that your body can get rid of it.\n\nIt is very important that you research whomever will treat you.  In the States the procedure is licensed as a ""cosmetic"" procedure.  Ask the therapist lots of questions.\n\nFind out how long they've been in practice, what's the average number of treatments given to their clients.  Do they provide you with dietary education throughout the process or are you left on your own to figure out what to eat?  Check out the office.  Is it clean?  Do they reuse speculum's or do they use fresh ones each time?\n\nIf their clients come in continuously for more than 2 months (max 3) at a time, or if their clients only come in once in a great while for one treatment, look for another therapist.  The goal of the treatment should be to clean you out and to strengthen your bowels to do the work more efficiently on their own.  If the therapist wants you to keep coming in for months and months and months at a time, your body will become lazy and instead of strengthening your bowels, they will become weakened.\n\nI wish you well!"

The problem with buying overseas drugs is you are never sure of the quality of the medicine.  It is estimated that 70% of all medicine sold in China is not what it should be.

And they cost 40% less than in the USA.  And they seem to be the real deal.
Bursae are small sacs between your the bones, tendons, and muscles in your joints.  They contain fliuids that help your joints move more easily.

Walking pneumonia is an outdated term referring to pneumonia (infection of the small air-filled sacs of the lung) which does not cause significant disability. People who are affected by walking pneumonia do not require hospitalization and are often able to continue participating in school or work functions. Although these mild cases of pneumonia can be caused by any number of microorganisms, infection with viruses such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus or atypical bacteria such a Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, or Legionella pneumophila are the most common causes.\n\nTreatment, when necessary, is typically with oral antibiotics such as amoxicillin, a macrolide like azithromycin or clarithromycin, or a fluoroquinolone, e.g., levofloxacin. Prognosis is excellent with symptoms typically resolving after a week or less.
It's possible that you might have injured it. It doesn't take much to injure a joint, especially a knee or ankle, because those joints hold up your body weight and take alot of pressure. It could also be growing pains. If you have had or are about to have, a growth spurt, your joints will hurt, especially your knees. If it continues to hurt, you need to talk to your parents and see a doctor.

Liposuction surgery is very safe nowadays. My cousin got her breast reduction, tummy tuck and facelift surgery in India by the company called Forerunners Healthcare .The Price for the surgery she paid in India was very less. She paid 30% of the cost she was quoted in America.\n\nForerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. They arrange cosmetic and plastic surgery for foreigners in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low price, as the breast reduction, tummy tuck, facelift and other cosmetic surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.\n\nhttp://www.forerunnershealthcare.com\nHope this helps.

Reduce stress if possible, but if your hands shake always maybe you have a problem of neurological kind....all this sounds too much maybe, but it all depends how much they shake. Do you have anybody in your family with some neurological disorder (maybe essential tremors)? And how old are u?
I know the pain, I did it myself.  Talk to someone, ANYONE to help you out.  It seems like life sucks, but you need to talk, and try and direct yourself, find something you enjoy and engross yourself in it.  Me, I love to play music and dance.  When I'm in my music mode, nothing can get me out of it unless I want them to.  Talk to someone, sweetie, life is GREAT, we all have our ups and downs, just need to have help when we're at the low points.  Talk to someone.  I'm praying for you.
Wait til it dries and use regular soap and water.  Just scrub a little harder.  Not too hard though.
Yea duffus.  Don't do that.
This is more than like growing pains. But if you are really concerned there are some blood test that your doctor can order to check for inflammatory conditions that may be causing the pain. You can ask your doctor about performing an ANA, SedRate, Coag panel, and RA. These simple blood test can help you feel more secure about whether these are growing pains.
Your friend is right.  All alcohol causes impotence.
Would'nt think so as viral pertains to virus.During the victorian era they referred to colds and like symptoms as germs.Even Pasteur or Lister who were stalwarts against germs never mentioned,virus during this period
It is a disease which removes the myelin sheaths from the neurons in the brain.  It causes alzheimers-like symptoms, as the myelin sheaths are the neurotransmitters, allowing chemical signals to pass from neuron to neuron.
Histamine is a biogenic amine chemical involved in local immune responses as well as regulating physiological function in the gut and acting as a neurotransmitter. New evidence also indicates that histamine plays a role in chemotaxis of white blood cells.

I grew one inch between 17 and 22 yrs of age, the stopped growing at Six Ft one. \n\nBUT.... after looking at my posture, and doing some work on that, and once I had spent a few months walking, sitting and sleeping properly positioned my height was measured as Six Ft 2 and a half.\n\nKeep exersizing, eat well (nutrition, protien !!) and look at your posture.\n\nAvoid SMOKING !!! and dont get too drunk too often.

Gastro-esophagial reflux?  The books that I have read about blood sugar imbalances and yeast syndromes would indicate treatment by diet should be a moderate protein, low glycemic carbohydrate, good (monounsaturated) fat diet, taken in small but regular amounts (3 medium sized meals and 3 snacks a day), along with water (2 liters a day minimum).

I have read this study. There are many questions that you must take into consideration while interpreting this study. One is the way in which women learn and think as this will effect the way that women respond to these sorts of intelligence testing. Also, you may want to consider the ways in which young girls are treated in the classroom as opposed to boys as well as the expectations. It might come as a suprise but even still young women are not expected to excell in things such as maths or science. Expectations can be personalised and thus creating self fullfilling prophesies.  What about the fundamental problems with the IQ test in general? Can intelligence really be measured with such a simple test? What about the motive of these scientists when conducting this study and the biases when interpreting these results? How was the study conducted? Was it a man or a woman conducting the IQ tests? What sort of effects can this create? And on and on.\n\nThen again, I'm just a woman.
Watch what you eat. A lot of acne is caused by your diet. Once you figure out how your skin reacts to certain foods, it helps a lot.\n\nAlso, when I had this problem, my doctor put me on a low-dose birth control pill. It really helped to clear it up.

Hi, let me tell you something about that IUD. I had it for six years and I hated it. Please don't let me discourage you from getting birth controll, but, that IUD was painful. No it didn't make me gain or lose weight, but it gave me the worse menstrual cramps there ever was. I took all kind of pain medications there was and nothing helped the pain. I cried sometimes because it hurted so bad. I was so grateful the day I got rid of that dam IUD and I've been happy since. I'm sorry to tell you all the bad effects it gave me. Different strokes for different folks, try it and see.    GOOD LUCK
It's probably a bruise. A bruise is basically a clot of dead blood underneath your skin. It'll go away on it's own, but it never hurts to check with a doctor just in case....\n\nBy the way, if it is a blood clot, it's a superficial one, not the kind that can give you a heart attack or stroke. Those are caused by blood clots that are inside the veins (called deep vein thrombosis). What you did was open up a blood vessel (popped it) so the clot formed outside of the circulatory system. It'll be absorbed back into your body, but it won't float around and screw things up.

A study published in the March 2005 edition of the American Journal of Public Health found that homicide was a leading cause of death among pregnant women in the United States between 1991 and 1999. Data taken from the Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the pregnancy-associated homicide ratio was 1.7 per 100,000 live births.

No is doesn't  instead it may help you increase... hehe\n\nremember what small really is....\n\n\nThis is in my own writing, it wasn't copy and pasted, enjoy it, it took me a while to write it and hope is beneficial to everyone. Thanks.\n\nSince I have answer to many of these question regarding penis sizes, i recollected most of my answers, read it and you make be satisfy with a correct answer.\nIs a little less than average, but i could predict that at least 20% of males are of that size or under ;) , well actually height does not matter, some people over six feet tall dont have a 5 inch dick! I came up with this after researching it! \npenis sizes!\nless than 4 inches is way below ! >4.5-5.0 moderate > 5.0- 6.3 (average 65% of any male u encounter are around this size!) > 6.7 (10-20% of popul) more than average > 7.2-9 less than 10% (gifted) > 9+ thats a big ******* story! ahhaah 0.1% of the male population *(Different web site and researches show these stat as the average penis 5.1, 5.7, 5.9, 5.877 from these numbers you can conclude what’s average, since all those are say to be average, I guess they are diff because are taken in different regions, let say if u take the same test in china you would find out that 4.7 is average! and 6 is to big. well other internet survey say to be 6.2 so is funny because it does not match with true measurement, so self measurements adds more than 2 cm. Be proud of what you have, the average vagina is about 3-4 inches so there is no problem filling up that space! and if the woman loves you, there is no problem.. but everyone wants a bigger penis even I and i have 7.3 :) .... **** dont they say smaller pennis stand up longer? enjoy \nyou don’t worry; I bet money that 80% + those that make fun of other with small organs have less than 6.6 inches! cuz only 10% of the population have over 7 inches!\ndo stretching it may give u a few cm\n<proud! \nwill know ur final size when u reach 17... you will gain from .2-1.5 inches from that age up to 17! \n\n\nBUT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN KNOWING THE IDEAL AND DREAM SIZE, Here goes **\n\nThe ideal penis would be above average size (if you were given a woman what would you pick the same girl with smaller or bigger breast? yes is possible you pick above average and not to big either, is the same thing for penis..) what would that size be? hmm I would definitely say 7-8 inches x 6 inches of circumference..thats a bit bigger than porn actor though, most porn actors have between 6-7 inches but since their are bellow 6 feet their penis look bigger on them... and so there are porn actor with more than 8 inches...(note that those male actors on the internet with mega penis are mostly the same people...there aren’t many with over 10 inches...) like I said is preference some woman may prefer something smaller then 5 inches... or something bigger than 7 ... but at the end you will love a woman with small tities you usually never dump her for that.... it happens to be the same with women and our penis... Hope this helps..\n\nforget the motion of the ocean.... sorry girls but a 4 inch guy can do what a 7 inch penis do ( if they know what they are doing of course)vaginas are 2-2.5 inches wide therefore a penis with girth of 6 inches will reach and stretch you so all ur nerves are receiving pressure, so is ur G spot everything is done by PRESSURE, NOT THE MOTION OF THE OCEAN learn that....a 5 inch penis can almost do the same thing but give the same person different sizes and u will see the different of course anything over 9 inches can hurt and less pleasure but anything from 7-8.5 inches is the BEST of sizes of course if it has 6-6.5 inches of girth\n\n\nI had like 6.5 when I was 16 and now I am 18 it is 7.3,.. Don’t feel bad, try doing exercises like stretching! maybe u gain something in 1 month! keep going if u see any gain maybe instead of gaining 1 inch.. u gain 2-3! \npenis sizes!\nless than 4 inches is way below ! >5.2 modera

(m)\n\n stye (also spelled sty) or hordeolum is an inflammation of the sebaceous glands at the base of the eyelashes. They are harmless but can be very painful. They are generally caused by a Staphylococcus bacteria infection. They are particularly common in infants.\n\nThe stye may form on either the inside or the outside of the eyelid.\n\nAn external stye (external hordeolum) is a purulent inflammation of infected eyelash follicles and surrounding sebaceous (Zeis) and apocrine (Moll) glands of the lid margin. It shows as a tender, red swelling on the edge of the eyelid and will tend to drain itself quickly. \nAn internal stye (internal hordeolum) will also be tender and may show external red swelling. Internal styes often take longer to heal because the abscess cannot drain as easily. These types of styes can also cause blurred vision and irritation. \nSince a stye is technically a pimple, it can be popped. However, doing so is not recommended without technical experience.\n\nA stye can be secondary, caused by blepharitis.\n\nTreatment and management\nMost styes will drain on their own though this may be accelerated with a hot or warm compress. Styes typically resolve within 1 week with treatment. \n\nMedical professionals will sometimes puncture a particularly persistent or irritating stye with a needle, to accelerate its draining. Their spread or expansion can also be fought with the use of antibiotic ointment akin to Neosporin (e.g. Erythromycin Ophthalmic Ointment), a special version being available for styes, which can be applied in a ribbon along the lid, on either inside or out.\n\nVarious folk remedies call for holding a metal or wooden spoon against the stye  or the rubbing of a gold ring on the stye

What Is REM Sleep?\n\nUsually, REM sleep occurs 90 minutes after sleep onset. The first period of REM typically lasts 10 minutes, with each recurring REM stage lengthening, and the final one may last up to an hour. Polysomnograms show brainwave patterns in REM to be similar to that recorded during wakefulness. In people without sleep disorders, heart rate and respiration speed up and become erratic during REM sleep. During this stage the eyes move rapidly in different directions.\n\nIntense dreaming occurs during REM sleep as a result of heightened brain activity, but paralysis occurs simultaneously in the major voluntary muscle groups. REM is a mixture of encephalic (brain) states of excitement and muscular immobility. For this reason, it is sometimes called paradoxical sleep.\n\nThe percentage of REM sleep is highest during infancy and early childhood. During adolescence and young adulthood, the percentage of REM sleep declines. Infants can spend up to 50% of their sleep in the REM stage of sleep, whereas adults spend only about 20% in REM.
That does not sound like a cyst but a pimple. I get small cysts on my face but inside them are like small little white balls. Sounds gross but they are very small and they eventually open up and go away. Try some salycilic acid. (spelling might be wrong) It works pretty quick. Good luck. And im sure the inlaws arent going to judge you because you have a  pimple on your forehead.
I cleared it on the treatment (interferon & ribavirin) 6 years ago. It can take a few months to show up, but you have to be specifically tested for it. I have 2 children, neither one has hep c. There is a <8% chance of passing it to your children and a <5% chance of becoming infected through sex. There is way too much information to tell you everything about it. My advice would be to treat it as soon as possible; why wait until you have more liver damage. The chances of clearing it are better the younger you are.  Get vaccinated against other forms of hepatitis (A &B).  Educate yourself by joining a good support group.  Don't drink alcohol (that should be the #1 advice!). Best wishes to you.
An allergy is your body's way of protecting you from something that it thinks will do you harm. So clearly your body thinks that your ex is something you should stay away from even if your head and your heart haven't caught up to the rest of you yet.\n\nThat's the snippy response, it's more likely that you're allergic to perfume your ex is wearing or the detergent they are using. But personally, I like the thought that your body is actually rejecting your ex... that's great and smart.
My husband has degenerative disc in his neck area.  He  had two surgeries (neurosurgery) and still deals with the pain on a daily basis. He is now on long term disability.\n\nAs a result of the degenerative disc, he has pinched nerves in the neck area. The pinched nerves cause his arms to  tingle a lot.  He has lost his hand grip.  He drops things a lot. \n\nHe has learned a lot about these things on www.spineuniverse.com.  My best advice to you is to see a doctor.  Good luck.

"I don't know about women - but I sure love copious amounts of it.\n\nthe more the better - it's a sign of good health in the man that he's fertile and ready to make babies.  but for me - it's just that I love to see a lot coming out of him.

My best friend was one of the unlucky ones. She took her own life because of it.\nJust sitting back and hoping the drugs will make you all better is not a reality. You have to be committed to actively working on helping yourself get better- physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually. \nIf you are feeling so bad that your world feels like it's crumbling or you want to commit suicide, do not hesitate to seek outside help from a therapist or other mental health worker. \nOften, friends and family just say "" Oh, snap out of it"", or ""Just get out and DO it"" as a means of encouragement. These misguided phrases just reinforce the guilt and shame that something is wrong with YOU, that YOU are doing something wrong. Not true. It's the illness. With the stigma mental illness has, someone who has never been truly depressed can never know how it feels when you stay in bed all day, wanting to go out and do things, but you just don't have the energy or the motivation. Goals of going out for a jog or getting all your chores done are fine, but they can seem like mountains to someone who'se depressed. Take baby steps. Even if it's the goal of getting yourself out of bed and getting dressed. And once you do it, give yourself a HUGE pat on the back. Because I've been there. And I know how hard it is."

HAHAHAH omg what a question.
Looks like Brooke Burke. She must have had her implants removed since then.
A cold sore is a fluid-filled blister which usually appears at the edge of the lips. Cold sores are caused by a herpes simplex virus infection.\n\nWhile anyone can be infected by herpes virus, not everyone will show symptoms.\nThe primary infection can cause symptoms like other viral infections including tiredness, headache, fever, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck.\nBecause oral herpes is so common, it is diagnosed primarily by symptoms. It can be diagnosed and treated by the family doctor, dermatologists (doctors who specialize in skin diseases) and infectious disease specialists. Laboratory tests may be performed to look for the virus.\nTreatment\n\nThere is no cure for herpes virus infections. There are antiviral drugs available that have some effect on lessening the symptoms and decreasing the length of herpes outbreaks.\nAcyclovir (Zovirax) is the drug of choice for herpes infection and can be given intravenously or taken by mouth. It can be applied directly to sores as an ointment, but is not very useful in this form. A liquid form for children is also available. Acyclovir is effective in treating both the primary infection and recurrent outbreaks. When taken by mouth to prevent an outbreak, acyclovir reduces the frequency of herpes outbreaks.\n\nDuring an outbreak of cold sores, salty foods, citrus foods (oranges etc.), and other foods that irritate the sores should be avoided. Wash the sores once or twice a day with warm, soapy water and pat gently to dry. Over-the-counter lip products that contain the chemical phenol (such as Blistex Medicated Lip Ointment) and numbing ointments (Anbesol) help to relieve cold sores. A bandage may be placed over the sores to protect them and prevent spreading the virus to other sites on the lips or face. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) may be taken if necessary to reduce pain and fever.\n\nAlternative treatment\n\nVitamin and mineral supplements and diet may have an effect on the recurrence and duration of cold sores. In general, cold sore sufferers should eat a healthy diet of unprocessed foods such as vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. Alcohol, caffeine, and sugar should be avoided.\n\nFoods rich in arginine that should be avoided are chocolate, peanuts, almonds, and other nuts and seeds.\nVitamin C and bioflavonoids (a substance in fruits that helps the body to absorb and use vitamin C) have been shown to reduce the duration of a cold sore outbreak and reduce the number of sores. The vitamin B complex includes important vitamins that support the nervous system where viruses can hide out.
Many women experience headaches along with their periods. If tylenol isn't helping, switch to a medicine specifically designed for menstrual discomfort, such as Midol or Pamprin. If these don't work for you, either, talk to your gyno and he/she should be able to prescribe you better meds for this time of the month. Hope I helped!

Gym and Yoga differs a lot. In gym, I guess you are aiming for resistance training namely weight traning.\n\nWeight training usually damages ur tissues certain extent, and the recuperation takes place during rest and supplemented by nutrition. So, the msucle got repaired in a such a manner that next time the same amount fo weight can not damage it. That is it bulges a bit.\n\nWhere as Yoga, is purely rests on static strethes with control on breathing. By doing yogic postures you can not have any apparent body figures ( what u call muscular cuts and all). But, you will be healthy and fit. Yogic system is a time tested therapy. You can find cure for all the disease in the science of Yoga.\n\nSo, both types of exercise excels in its on way. If you want a physically well built body u shud do the resistance traning. you can inculcate yoga in it for the stretching work out.

Yes.  Steroids act like adrenaline or cortisol - which have the effect of releasing sugar from storage in the liver.  Sugar, in the bloodstream, is blood glucose.
"As someone said, you still have as many as 9-10 years left to reach your full height! My wife says she actually grew an inch between age 20 and 22. \n\nMuch of it is genetic (how tall are your parents?). Our kid is 6'4"" at age 16, but I'm 6'3"" and my wife 5'7"". Both of us had one tall parent (dads) and short moms, so obviously, one side may ""win out"".\n\nFirst, make sure you are eating enough calories. (see the Healthy Body Calculator at the site below) Eat plenty of protein, for your muscles and calcium-rich foods, for your bone growth, and carbohydrates for energy. If you don't like dairy, leafy green veggies have calcium, or you can take a supplement. Make sure it's Calcium CITRATE, since it's absorbed better, and combined with magnesium.  You can also get foods enriched w/calcium, like cereals and juices.\n\nExercise is important (strong muscles stimulate bone growth and strength), as is the proper amount of sleep. Teens need at least NINE hours a night, and they often don't get it, so make sure you don't stay up too late. \n\nAvoid the pressure to be too thin, as this will stunt your growth. Also, avoid cigarettes, alcohol and any drugs (obviously).\n\nSome prescription drugs can interfere with growth, such as anti-anxiety drugs, anti-depressants and others. Check with your doctor (if you're on any of these) to see which ones you can switch. \n\nYour problem may just be that your are maturing more slowly than your peers, which is usually normal. If lack of growth continues, however, check w/your doctor to test for things like thyroid problems (and other endocrine (gland) disorders) and diabetes.\n\nIf you follow healthy eating, sleep and exercise, you should catch up to your peers soon. Also, you may never become as tall as most others, but don't let that interfere with your self esteem. Many attractive women are actually shorter (J-Lo, for instance) Don't worry!"
Several times.  It feels more comfortable.
There is only one way - a dental handpiece with the right bur.  Go to another dentist.  Don't tell them the whole story, just say that there is still cement from your braces and you do not feel comfortable going back to the old dentist.  He should be willing to only charge you a small amount to remove the cement.\n\nSmall amounts of it may be able to be removed by a dental scaler, but it must be sharp.\n\nThere are no home remedies or answers for this one.  I'm sorry.  It is important to have it removed when you can because plaque can collect around the edges of the cement allowing cavities to form.
"Well partially as I understand.\nI was a dish washer on a freighter as a teen ager. The engineer and officers instructed me to place egg shells in the coffee pot. \nI asked why !.

The idea was the egg shells absorbed the acid as well as bad odors and tastes.\nI think it would make a mess if you add just the whites to the hot coffee. ???"
Having a doctor remove it is the only safe way.  Doing it another way can cause scarring and can cause the mole to develop precancerous changes.  It doesn't cost much to have a dermotologist perform the procedure and it's better to be safe than sorry later because of scarrying.  I would say it's money well spent especially if it's on her forehead.

Hi,\nI've tried all different diets, and the weight loss is only temporary. I finally tried diet pills on the market are made from Hoodia. I saw this stuff on ABC News. It's all natural and safe, and it works! My wife took it for a month and dropped 20 pounds. I took it for a month and lost about 13 (but I didn't exercise).\n\nI bought the natural hoodia from this website: http://www.alllsite.info/free-diet-pills.php . I checked the web site address so I can post it here and I saw they're running a promotion now to get a free 2 week sample for only $4.97! I'm going to order this supply for my wife and give it to her for Christmas =)
First thing you do is make an appointment to your M.D. At your age the symptoms you've mentioned has to be taken very seriously. You don't want to end up with untreated diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, immune system disorder etc.,Yahoo people are great ,but you need professional advice.
It could be a couple of things.  Most likely it is a muscle or hernia.  If it hurts bad when you breath it could be an intercostal muscle, these are the muscles that help you breath.  I would see a doctor if the pain doesn't go away.  Stay away from any pain medication because that will just mask the pain.  Make sure the pain goes away because your body recovered.

I know the feeling but it sounds to me that you are taking way to much of the xanax and is probably prescibed by a family doctor and not one that you should be seeing not saying you are crazy i have these attcaks all the time and going off your meds will only make them worst but you may need a stabilizer and a diffrent approach to treatment. and when you say you are not feeling good i wonder what exactly that means do you have some depression going on? again nothing to be ashamed of just asking . I wish you luck and dont give up on yourself just try to understand what is going on to make you feel this way in the first way
Remeber that whatever you put into your body, you also put into your baby.  Percocet is a combination drug - acetaminophen and oxycodone.  They are both in the pregnancy risk category B.  I'll give the complete list for future use:  \n\nCategory A:  No evidence of risk  to the fetus\nCategory B:  Low risk in first trimester, no evidence of risk in later trimesters.\nCategory C:  Evidence of possible risk, give if benefits outweigh the risks.\nCategory D:  Positive evidence of risk but the benefits should outweigh the risk.\nCategory X:  Contraindicated with pregnancy.  The risks outweigh the benefits.\n\nAlways make sure your doctor, and in your case, your OB/Gyn, are aware of all medications, vitamins and herbal supplements that you are using.  You have most likely done no harm to the embryo but speak to your OB right away about the advisability of continuing this medication.
William, please contact the Social services department in your city or town.  Also, call the Social Security Administration and see if you can get your Mom on SS disability.\n\nIf all else fails then call your Mom's senator and congressperson.\n\nContact local charities and churches and ask for help.  I know the Mormon Church is very good about helping individuals in need. \n\nAlso, most cities have food pantries and give food to people in need.  Look for a food pantry in your town.\n\nThe Squeaky Wheel gets the oil.  Call also the Red Cross, Salvation Arm, and your local Cancer Society

My Husband is on these same meds.  It is a challenge.   He does his very best when eating almost NO starches.  If you cut out the white and wheat starches (potatoes, all breads and flour products, rice, of course pasta as it is made with flour).\n\nInterestingly enough when you stop these you will eat very little butter.\n\nWe do walk one to two miles each evening.\n\nWe have been bad since the week before Thanksgiving and are looking and feeling a little blimpy.  But we will be good again for three weeks, till Christmas and new years.\n\nRead your side effects, you will probably find it is the meds causing a lot of the problem.\n\nAre you using lemon in water every day?  It contributes to leveling your blood sugars.  We also drink diluted Cranberry concentrate from the health food store. One pint is $17.00 and makes two gallons with water.  We drink 6 oz before and between every meal to flush poisons out of our systems.  It is quite effective.\n\nThis is from THE FAT FLUSH PLAN  It is a quite effective weight plan.\n\nGoing very light on meats will help your triglicerides emormously and lower the three month test.  Cutting out all pork made a huge difference.\n\nGood luck.

"I felt sad reading your question. But you have not given any details but I would just go through it with you, if you dont mind ? Your family isnt 'here' ? You mean you dont have a family, or is it that your family isnt with you at this point of time, probably living in another place ? You have disabilities, like bad hearing, right ? You have not mentioned what other ''disabilities'' you are referring to, but I am sure you are really feeling low due to that. Your eyesight is low, and you do not speak normally.....and to top it all you think of suicide ? \n\nIts the last part of your question that you have to read once more yourself. ''why should god let you live here, ....'' Thought why ? I wouldnt want to preach you, cos' when you really feel low and down, you really wouldnt be interested to listen to someone preach you on god, and how to live. But there is one thing for sure, that obviously there are some things left for you to do, while you are here. You may have less of certain things in life, but you have it anyway. There are people who have nothing, in terms of health that you are referring to, and they still struggle day in and day out. You are young, and you still have a long way to go before you say ''I am tired''. You possibly could make things better while you have time. Have you ever thought of a counsellor, participating in activities that you are good at, involve yourself with people of your age, who may be having difficulties, just like you ? Making freinds, is a good option too. Your emotional situation right now is not to socialise, but just give it a try, and then say you cant. \n\nHave you considered all your options, and the time god has given you to make things better ? Obviously you are healthy, you were healthy enough to type this question here on yahoo answers, werent you ? And coming back to your question, ''God let you live here, and you have no idea...'''.. I am sure you want to stick around and find out why, would be a good idea, dont you think ? And let me know too, on what you found ?\n\nI dont know if you have heard this before, I liked this one which keeps coming in one of those annoying forwards -\n\n""""It's not whether you get knocked down, it's whether you get back up. - Vince Lombardi''''\n\nI feel thats soo true. So, cheer up, and get yourself going. The first instance would be to sum up and mentally make a note of ''All the things I have and I can do"""", and then the next step would be to overcome each disability by doing something alternative, winning through it, and not let that disability to rule your life or control your emotions. Right now, you are doing just that. It wouldnt be a quick change, but it will change. This will pass too, and you will begin to see things better. I just hope you do. However, it would be a shame if you cannot say ''Yes, I tried, and I survived it''. \n\ngood luck."

First of all don't panic, I recently had a procedure called a novasure, it  is where they go inside and burn veins, it is new and the dr. said they have had good results with it. my periods were very bad, not irregular, but could last 2 weeks sometimes.  Lots of people have irreguar periods. Call your dr. Mon.

The best range of temperatures for growing salvia plants is about 60-80 degrees Fahrenheit, they can tolerate much colder (Almost freezing temperatures) but plant growth slows at the extremes of its preferred range. Growing salvia is also made a good deal easier when you take steps to preserve the plants’ natural affinity to moisture in the air. This can be done by frequently misting your growing divinorum plants with clean water from a garden-mister. This is also an ideal way to clean the leaves of your salvia divinorum plants from any dirt or bugs. Salvia divinorium also grows very well in a humidity tent, that is a greenhouse like setup that traps moisture and heat but lets in light to the plants. Simply wrapping plastic wrap from the lights overhanging your growing salvia divinorium plants will be sufficient. \n\nCare of salvia divinorum plants\nRemember that salvia plants will begin to grow quite slowly at first, and every time you move a divinorum plant from one pot to another there will be a slow down in the salvia plants’ growth until it has time to recover and adjust to the new growing environment. The larger the plant typically the faster the rate of growth and recovery from transplantations and other stresses, fertilizer generally will help speed this process up also. Make sure, when growing salvia divinorum plants for leaf mass, to use a big enough, otherwise the growing plants roots will be constricted and you will get a smaller yield of salvia divinorium.\n\nSalvia divinorum plants have very weak stems, that are prone to breaking in half when they get too tall to support the weight of all the leaves. When the stem breaks if it is in contact with the soil, as it often is since the plant usually bends over as it breaks, the stem will root in the soil and the salvia plant will survive and you can continue growing salvia.\n\nThere are two different strains commonly available in salvia divinorum plant cuttings from vendors, the first specimen brought back to the new world was called hoffman and wasson and it’s the smallest and host hardy of the salvia strains currently being grown. The other most popular variety of growing salvia is blosser/palatable this is the most recent specimen retrieved from mexico (in 1990) and its reportedly easier to eat because it has a much less bitter taste
Yup, there are other types of pills that only regulate your cycle.  When I was 18 I went to the gyn because my cycle was 7 weeks long.  He gave me the option of birth control or something else.  I took the birth control because of all the side effects - less cramps, less flow, and no pregnancies.  The other one didn't have any side effects (well, not the ones I wanted, anyway).  I don't remember what it was called, since it was 14 years ago.\n\nWhen you see your doctor, tell him you want him to find out why your cycle isn't normal.  Insist that he do a blood workup on you.  It could be nothing, but it could be something.  Insist on finding out!
Come on... don't set yourself up to fail. If you want to do that, just quit trying at all for anything.

I'm around your age, honey, and I can tell you that it's a challenge keeping your skin moist at this age.  I take a good multivitamin daily (Dr. Taub's) and it has 400units of E in it.  I also take Rx estrogen.  One thing you can do is after showering/bathing, pat dry and IMMEDIATELY apply a moisturizer.  This will lock in the moisture from your bath/shower.  I usually apply a sealant like petroleum jelly to my elbows and feet (put on socks afterward) and around my cuticles of my fingernails.  I use shey butter cream on the legs and arms,hands.  And a light moisturizer on the face with antioxidants and PAPA in it.  I'm greased up like a turkey!  BUT I don't have dry skin.  A humidifier will also help when running the heater.  God love ya...getting old is not for sissies, is it?
Sounds like someone slipped you the date rape drug. I would go to the hospital if I were you and get checked out. Tell the police too.

You have two holes down below- one very large, which I hope you have explored by age 23! This is the vaginal opening. In front of this, there is a smaller hole, the urethral opening. It is easier to see on a man! \n\ntry this (it will sound weird but oh well): place a large bowl on the floor in the bathroom, and angle a mirror so you can watch. pee in the bowl. Feel with your fingers where it is coming from, and trace it back to the top. (urine is sterile and water-soluble so there really is nothing gross about this!- just wash your hands afterwards). You will find exactly where it is, and the mirror lets you watch it in action. You can then match it to a picture online that shows both openings, and get a pretty good idea what is going on down there...\n\nAnd learn your anatomy- it will help you be a better lover...
Some bacteria are harmless. Your skin, mouth, bowels and other places are filled with them. Many are even necessary to your survival because they help digest food or keep infectious organisms at bay. Cows could not digest grass without bacteria in their stomachs. The troublemakers are the ones that are able to make harmful chemicals that act like acids or poisons. Botulism, for instance, is caused by a bacterial poison. Pus, for the most part, is the body's response to illness. It's a collection of white cells that the body recruits for an area of infection. At other times, bacteria are so irritating to your system that your own body's defenses go overboard and attack not only the bacteria but also the tissues that host them.\n\nHow do I know I have a bacterial infection?\n\nBacterial infection usually makes you noticeably sick, whether it's an infected ingrown toenail or bloody diarrhea. Sometimes, however, they produce very little awareness but still can go on to cause immense trouble. Sexually transmitted disease, for instance, can be very subtle and can leave you infertile before you know what hit you. Even if an infection is obvious, it often takes a modern laboratory to identify the exact germ and, more important, tell the doctor what to use to treat it. Most bacteria can be grown in the laboratory and tested for their reaction to different antibiotics. This is why the doctor wants to collect a specimen from your infection, wherever it is.\n\nMany infections produce inflammation, a process generated mostly by your immune system, which appears as redness from an increased blood supply, swelling from fluid accumulating in the tissues, pain from nerve irritation, and heat, both localized warmth and generalized fever.
Eat lots of protein.  It will help build up your muscles.  Also, you could start weight training to help build muscles that way...\n\nJust don't pig out and gain fat.

"The best way to get pregnant is to treat your PCOS. Those tests help to eliminate any other problems you might have (blocked tube, scar tissue in your uterus, etc). These tests are not comfortable, but they are not really that painful. It might be worth it to do them, but you could try treating the PCOS the correct way and waiting to see if it works. If not, then you should probably have these tests done just to make sure there are no other problems. Here's some general PCOS info and the correct treatment for it:\n\nThe underlying cause of PCOS is insulin resistance (IR). The best treatment for PCOS is going on an insulin sensitizing drug such as metformin (1500-2550mg per day) combined with a low carb diet and exercise. There are a few important things to know:\n\n1. Many women ""pass"" the test for IR, but still respond positively from the metformin. No one knows exactlly why..my thought is that the test is not a sure fire way of detecting the IR.\n\n2. You must be on a high enough dose of metformin. I've heard women complain that their bodies dont start working even though they've been on metformin for awhile. Some doctors are hesitant to up the dose past 1500mg...but for some of us it takes more. I don't respond until my dose is around 2000mg a day. \n\n3. It can take a few months on the correct dose, before your body is regulated. \n\n4. It is important to treat your PCOS even if you are not trying to get pregnant. There are higher risks for many things (high blood pressure, blood clots, diabetes, and many other things) when you have PCOS, but if it is treated properly, then those risks are lowered. \n\nI recommend seeing a reproductive endocrinologist. They know the most about PCOS and any fertility treatments you may need to undergo. I also recommend visiting http://messageboards.ivillage.com/iv-bhpcos. It's a great message board where you can ask all your PCOS questions. Good luck."
Same thing happened to me a few years back, turns out my right hand was sleeping around on me while I was asleep.   I didn't understand it, I thought we had such a good relationship, sometimes, i'd even bring my girlfriends around, and we would have a threesome.  \nAnyway, to make a long story short, my right hand gave me herpes, and I had to break up with him.  Lefty treats me much better (from what I know, i'm gullable sometimes), and Righty will never know what he could have had!!
one, how can you do more than one in one go? unless you've got a Siamese twin!
It genuinely comes down to what you feel comfortable with...I personally like a real woman and I think most men do as well...I don't think that you can pin it down to a number and just be done at that...I mean if you were 135 but all of the weight is in your left arm that wouldn't be good...\n\nSo to summarize, do what you feel comfortable with bc at the end of the day your assessment of who you are is what is important, not what someone else tells you that you should be....

Sometimes the woman is unable to relax enough to reach orgasm. It is a loss of control that they do not feel comfortable with. Try to relax. Nothing bad will happen if you give yourself over to the feelings. Good luck.

"Hi Kat\n\nYou must cleanse your system. It doesnt matter what disease of symtom you have. The blood must be cleansed or you will always have issues. Crohns disease was never actually cured because the toxins in the colon are still there. When we dont have regular bowel movements (30 min after we eat), the toxins sit in the colon and get into the blood and that is what causes illness and disease. You must do a colon and liver cleanse to jump start your health back to normal. Here are some more tips on Crohns. \n\nCauses\nCrohn's disease can be caused by a variety of factors, including poor diet and nutrition, food allergies, imbalanced levels of hydrochloric acid, impaired immunity, infections, lack of exercise, ""leaky gut"" syndrome, pharmaceutical drugs, and stress.\n\nNote:\nPharmaceutical Drugs: The following drugs can all cause and exacerbate various gastrointestinal disorders, including Crohn's disease: Accutane, Alka-Seltzer Antacid and Alka-Seltzer Pain Reliever, Anturane, Genuine Bayer Aspirin, Bayer Plus Aspirin, Bayer Regular Strength Enteric Aspirin, Bufferin Analgesic Tablets and Caplets, Ceptaz, Clinoril, Cuprimine, Ecotrin Enteric Coated Aspirin, Feldene, Ilosone, Lamprene, Leukine for IV Infusion, Lopid, Marplan, Meclomen, Novantrone, Paraplatin, Piroxicam, Prokine I.V. Infusion, Retrovir, Rynatuss, Supprelin Injection, Suprax, Ticlid, Tolectin, Toradol IM Injection, Trecator-SC, Trilisate, and Voltaren.\n\nQuick Action Plan for Crohn's Disease \n\n\n1. Diet is of primary importance. Avoid all sugars, refined flour products, and carbohydrates, milk and dairy products, processed foods that contain preservatives and artificial sweeteners, alcohol, hydrogenated and trans-fatty oils, as well as foods that are common allergens.\n\n2. Emphasize organic, fresh vegetables and non-citrus fruits, organic grains, as well as organic, free-range meats and poultry and wild-caught fish.\n\n3. Drink plenty of pure, filtered water throughout the day. Gallon a day if you can.\n\n4. Enema containing butyric acid two to five times a week. (Add one tablespoon of butyric acid to one quart of warm water.) Do a Colon Cleanse to clean out the toxins in the body. A liver cleanse will help new blood penetrate the sick areas and help the healing process.\n\n5. Supplements with vitamin A, beta carotene, vitamin C, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and zinc, taken with a multivitamin/multimineral formula. Essential fatty acids, especial omega-3 oils, are also recommended.\n\n6. Stress reduction through the use of various mind/body medicine techniques, such as biofeedback, hypnotherapy, meditation and relaxation exercises.\n\n7. If you smoke, stop and if you are currently taking aspirin or other NSAIDs, consider replacing them with safer, more effective natural remedies.\n\n8. Soothing baths two to five nights and alternating hot and cold water packs placed over the stomach and upper abdomen.\n\n9. Juice remedies include aloe juice; wheatgrass juice; cabbage, papaya, and carrot juice; and carrot, beet, and cucumber juice.\n\n10. Juice of half a lemon with warm water, especially in the morning.\n\nEducate yourself on the above ideas and your life will change. Email me with any questions you have.\n\nBest of health to you\n\nCheers"

It sounds like you probably have the flu which is a virual infection.  Antibiiotics do not treat viruses-only bacterial infections.  Why did your doctor give you the Ceftin if your chest was clear and your throat swab was negative?  That is crazy.  You are just going to have to give it a few more days.  Drink lots of liquids, take tylenol or ibuprofen and rest.
Salivary gland tumors comprise less than 3% of head & neck tumors.  Between 75% and 85% are in the parotid gland and approximately 70% of those are benign mixed tumors (pleomorphic adenomas).  Tumors may be benign or malignant and occur in the parotid, the submandibular salivary gland, or in the minor salivary glands found in the lining of the oral cavity.
oh my my. you poor dear. I think you shouldnt take any medicines. Just go out and eat at some place with your friends or alone at times. Go and eat at favourite places. Ask the cook for your fav. dishes. You will slowly regain your appetite that is for sure because God wanted you to live, see?
If you live near Mexico you can get dental work done much cheaper than in the US.  If you have a good, caring doctor let him/her know how you are feeling about yourself and ask if there is a dentist that they know of that could help you at a greatly reduced rate.  Surely there are some decent, caring dentists somewhere out there.  If the dentists have web sites you could send each a message and let them know of your situation and see if there is anyone of them willing to help you.

It is normal for someone who sleeps with their mouth open to drool.  We all do it.  You should try sleeping in a different position.  It doesn't hurt anything and does not indicate some sort of sleep disorder.  It is not a habit that can be overcome, it is your body's natural function to keep the mouth moist.  If you can find a way to keep your mouth closed while sleepng, you won't drool.
i believe so. I think i have a photographic memory and find that it is very helpful for me to remember things and i realize sometimes why they call it photographic memory becuase i really do take mental pictures of things and that is how i remember the important things. Well, all of my dreams are very detailed they are almost like movies. and i feel that has part to do with my ability to take mental pictures. And because they are so detailed i remember every aspect and detail about my dreams. I dream in color and see peoples faces very clear. I even feel sometimes that they are so clear that i am actually dreaming of someone i havent met yet or a place that i am yet to visit. Wierd but very true.

The mirena coil and ovarian cyst could be related.  One of the side effects of the mirena coil is endometriosis.  Also, however, ovarian cysts can come and go, and possibly (even though 40 is a bit young) you could be in para-menopausal and sometimes ovarian cysts can develop yet dissolve on their own.  Also, at 40 your metabolism will begin to slow down, so it's best to watch your calorie intake and keep up daily exercise to avoid weight gain.  At 40 your body begins not to want to metabolize all the sweets and fats that it handled when you were younger.  As for the Prozac; how long have you been on it?  Even though Prozac, when you first start taking it, causes a decrease in appetite, after you have been on it for possibly a couple of years, a side effect can be just the opposite.  All in all, 40 is a great age.  Enjoy this next decade.  It could be the best time of your life.
Invisalign requires submission of impressions and photographs for computer analysis prior to diagnosis for a case, so we can't advise you about your own treatment with virtually zero information.  It sounds like you are planning on trying to make the modifications to your own models and doing a series of appliances.  If so, good luck.  You are correct in theory, though.  The movement would start at the most posterior tooth and proceed tooth-by-tooth until you have created the room required to move the malaligned teeth.
Why do people feel that this type of forum will help cure all of their ills?
Relax, don't stress yourself about it. Stress will add to the affects.  Keep drinking fluids...because right now you are overloaded on salt and your body is tyring to maintain homeostasis by using osmosis to get the concentration of salt in the Extracellular fluid to equal that of all of your cells.  so you must keep bringing in water to do this.  Using coffee or other diruretics will only prolong this process...stressing your body even more.  You are doing exactly what hsould be done by drinking lots of liquids and relaxing.

"Depression is a mental illness that is caused by a chemical imbalance, so thinking ""happy thoughts"" will not ""cure"" depression. It is normal to be depressed even though you have ""everything"", the best thing to do is, seek medical attention. People fail to realize that a mental illness is a DISEASE. For example a person who has cancer, diabetes or any other type of BODILY disease, can't just wish away their disease and neither can a person who is depressed... you just can't wish away the depression. Depression is NOTHING to be ashamed of... would any of you be ashamed if you had cancer/diabetes etc.? Don't listen to all these people who have probably never ever been depressed, seek medical attention good luck..."
Get plenty of fresh air and exercise during the day, if you're not physically tired it's much harder to sleep.\nHave a routine, go to bed and get up at the same time each night and morning.\nCut out caffeinated drinks after 6 p.m. Save stimulating activities for earlier on in the day. To feel sleepy you need to wind down so as the evening draws on have a warm bath, afterwards change into night clothes and maybe have a small snack and drink if you need one.\nMake sure your bedroom is comfortably warm and dark. Don't watch T.V. in bed and make sure there is no clutter on the bed.\nReally important - don't drink (alcohol) or smoke in excess before you go to bed. If you do when it wears off you'll wake up and find it really hard to go back to sleep.\nDon't worry too much. If you're fretting about something that can be sorted get up and do it. If you can't, then forget about it til tomorrow.\nIf you use chamomile tea instead of tea/coffee you will feel the difference (more relaxed)
The symptoms you are describing leads me to believe that you have allergies, not a lingering cold.  During the Fall and Spring, people with allergies are miserable, and have the same symptoms you have described.

I'm 38, and yes I am also sex crazy,I don't care about the snuggling as much as I just want to get f*cked. I love my husband and every aspect of our sex life.

Honey my mom also has emphysema. She started having pain in her arm & shoulder so she went to the E.R. She ended up having to have angioplasty because the pain was being caused by a major blockage in 3 of her coronary arteries. I would not wait. It's better to be safe than sorry. Women experience symptoms of heart related problems differently than men. If she has a serious coronary problem, Thursday may be too late.
"You should jog at a comfortable pace (you should be able to say a sentence semi-comfortably) for more than twenty minutes. Slow down if you need to. Stop if you have any chest pain. \n\nThe first 5 minutes or so are more of a warm-up: go a little slower at first, then increase your speed. Also, cool-down after your 20 minutes are up (start with a power walk and wind down to a good ""mall pace""). Don't forget to stretch before and after a workout- it will make your workout more productive. \n\nAs for the workout itself, for the first 20 minutes, you're getting cardio benefits (aerobic exercise). After 20 minutes, you're in anaerobic exercise...you're no longer burning fat, but building muscle. Muscle will increase your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), which will increase the caloric need of your body...so it helps you to lose even more weight!\n\nAs for treadmills v. outside: it's a matter of person preference: \nTreadmills:\n   Advantages: help you keep up your pace, can vary terrain/incline to your preference, can see the calories you're burning \n   Disadvantage: sometimes it can be more difficult to breathe indoors\nOutside: \n   Advantages: ever-changing scenery, cleaner air \n   Disadvantage:less control over terrain/incline\n\n\nEnergy requirements depend on the speed, duration, and incline of your workout, as well as your current health status."

Cerebral edema may occur if a person has been hypoglycemic for a long time or other causes. The intravenous injection is that of an osmotic diuretic mannitol  (that causes loss of water from the body by osmotic pressure method-- that is first removal of water from the brain into the blood vessels and then exerting it's osmotic effects in the renal tubule..). which take cares of the edema.....which otherwise can prove fatal.\n                                                                Waqar(FUMC-Pakistan)
"'Metabolism' just means 'things going on in your body'. Rapid metabolism always produces heat as a by-product, just like 'work' does in physics.\n\nUnfortunately doctors tend to confuse people by grossly simplifying WHAT goes on in your body. \n\nFat storage is a 'metabolic' process; if your metabolism is fast, you will store more fat. Fortunately, the things that increase your 'metabolism' most, will use up some of the storable fat, so there is less to store !\n\nThe most 'metabolic' portion of your body is your musculature, although your Liver does a wider range of metabolic tasks. (the liver can convert sugar into fat, BUT ONLY A LIMITED AMOUNT, so you DO NOT ""store the excess energy as fat"".\n\nOne problem with the Diet/Exercise simplification, is that the 'calories' (energy) you eat are not available to use (or store) in your body UNLESS YOU ABSORB THEM THROUGH YOUR GUT. (Shit contains calories that haven't been absorbed; dried shit can be burnt, and is used as fuel in some cultures, although usually it's from livestock rather than humans).\n\nDigestion, absorption, and transport of food are all 'metabolic' processes. After you have eaten, your temperature goes up ('thermogenesis') because you are processing the absorbed portion of the food, and moving the unabsorbed food along your gut. \n\nA popular diet (the T-factor diet, book by Martin Katahn) was based on the various 'thermogenic' (ie. metabolic) effects of different foods.\n\nA common metabolic effect is Anxiety-related Weight Loss, where stress will cause rapid changes. These happen when the muscles (all of them) are more tense because of constant adrenaline production, which also affects appetite AND the gut reactions needed to absorb nutrients. So more fuel (mostly fat because the tension is constant and gentle, rather than forceful) is being used, less is being eaten, and a smaller proportion of the nutrients are available. This can all happen without you noticing any difference in your behaviour, unless the stress becomes severe.\n\nThe body is operating 24 hours a day, and your CONSCIOUS movement is only a small fraction of your total activity. Hormonal patterns, such as a low or high Thyroid output, have an effect on ALL of your body systems, including motivation. That means you can try hard to overcome the pattern (you still produce adrenaline when thyroid is low, but it takes more effort to do it), but your body will make it even more difficult to remain motivated (it thinks you're dangerously overworking yourself).\n\nThe only simple truth is that everybody operates in a slightly different way. 'Metabolism' is something that we all have, and we can raise or lower (like blood pressure). That IS more difficult for some than for others, but it is not 'THE ANSWER' or 'THE PROBLEM' for anybody."
It sounds like it will be starting very soon, and you shouldn't go by whether you are getting cramps or not.  Some women don't get them around/during their periods ever, while some do.  Your best bet would be talking to your mom about getting you some panty liners, so when you start, you don't leak and get an embarassing stain.  I'm sure she'll be glad to help you out.
I think it is high in saturated fat, and is not healthy. Try virgin olive oil, that is supposed to have the nutrience and fat that is healthy for the body.\n\nThis website feels coconut oil is best used for cooking:\nAnytime you cook a food you run the risk of creating heat-induced damage. Well, suppose there was a type of oil that is stable enough to resist heat-induced damage and so beneficial that it helps you lose weight, promotes heart health and helps to maintain normal cholesterol levels. Would you choose to use this oil?\n\nIf you said yes then you will want to get some coconut oil today. Naturally, when choosing an oil to cook with you want an oil that will not be damaged by high cooking temperatures. Of all the available oils, in my opinion, coconut oil is the oil of choice for cooking because it is nearly a completely saturated fat, which means it is much less susceptible to damage when it is heated. \n\nhttp://www.mercola.com/2003/oct/15/cooking_oil.htm

"You probably have lactose intolerance. That is, your small intestine doesn't produce enough lactase, the enzyme you need to digest lactose, the natural sugar found in dairy products. Never fear, it's not dangerous.\n\nThe obvious thing to do is decrease the amount of milk and dairy products you eat until your symptoms go away.\n\nIf milk is your main source of calcium and you cut back on milk, then you should supplement your diet with substitutes like;  sardines with bones, or spinach or broccoli. Calcium supplements are another option, as are lactase enzymes, pills, or lactase-treated milk.\n\nNever drink milk alone. Some people find their symptoms disappear if they take their dairy products with meals. As you mentioned "" eat something with cheese"".\n\nEat yoghurt. The organisms that make yoghurt what it is, also produce lactase to digest the lactose contained in yoghurt. Secondly, the bacteria themselves also probably break down the lactose in the milk. \n\nYoghurt is made from pasteurized milk. But sometimes manufacturers repasteurize the yoghurt before they freeze it. This would kill the beneficial organisms that produce lactose.\nSo try to find yoghurt that has not been repasteurized. It means choose regular yoghurt over frozen one.\n\nEat yoghurt before ice cream. If you eat yogurt 5 to 15 minutes before you eat ice cream [or other milk products], probably any symptoms of lactose-intolerance would be less.\n\nTry cheese, too. Cheese has less lactose in it than milk. Hard cheeses are the best,because they're fermented the most. Swiss cheese or extra sharp cheddar cheese contain only a trace amount of lactose and are thus less likely to produce digestive upset."

Some people are pre-determined by genetics to remain thin. Others just have an extremely good metabolism.
I had my miscarriage on oct. 17. I had my first period on nov. 16, so that was good, but I havent gotton to the second one yet, so idk, but If I was really concerend I would call my doctor. It's always better to be safe than sorry.
OK, so it's a mood disorder and a serious mental illness. It has a strong genetic component, but appears to be triggered environmentally. There are no diagnostic tests for it, just psychiatric evaluation. Most sufferers are not diagnosed until middle age, and it takes an average of around 8-10 years to get a correct diagnosis. Historically, figures suggested it affects about 0.8% of the population at some point, which makes it about half as common as schizophrenia. In recent years, bipolar disorder has become an 'in' diagnosis, and many more people are being diagnosed at younger and younger ages. As with ADHD, this fad may well pass with time, although for the moment many celebrities appear to be 'popularising' it.\n\nIt is characterised by episodes of severe clinical depression and mania or hypomania (for definitions of those, see here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/current_diagnostic_criteria_for_bipolar_disorder ), although the mechanism that causes the cycling is unknown. Current research seems focused around sodium channels. The extreme end of mania often turns into psychosis, complete with hallucinations and delusions. During manic phases, the person's judgement and perception of reality is severely compromised, leading to risky actions with potentially damaging consequences (financially, sexually and relationship-wise). Untreated, episodes generally worsen over time due to an effect known as kindling. Untreated Bipolar sufferers are at a very high risk of suicide: 20-25% attempt it, and 15% succeed.\n\nThe cycles in bipolar disorder are much longer than people generally believe. Anyone whose mood changes from minute to minute is very unlikely to be bipolar. Bipolar 1 is characterised by mood episodes lasting many months, while Bipolar 2 has episodes in the region of weeks to months. Rapid and ultra-rapid cycling bipolar disorder is rare, and cycles last days to weeks.\n\nThere are many drugs available to treat the symptoms of bipolar (there is no cure). These are either anti-convulsants or anti-psychotics (personally I take both), and the most well known of these is Lithium. Most patients will go through a number of different drugs before finding one that works for them.
It works regardless. It may take a little longer to really feel it if you take it after you eat , and a little less if you take it on an empty stomach.

Hi Kate, in theory it should take you around 6 months to lose 6 stone. However, in reality if you stick to CD like glue, you might well lose it a bit quicker than that. The flavours and products are fab and once you get through the first 3 days you should feel absolutely great - full of energy and looking and feeling really healthy. You'll also sleep really well because your body is concentrating on sleeping - rather than digesting food! The first 3 days can be bad because you're withdrawing from sugar, food additives, etc.\n\nAs you'll already know, it's meal replacement with 100% of your vitamins and minerals, plus 3 litres or so of water a day. There are soups, shakes, readymixed shakes and bars - which are all pretty yummy. You'll need a wand blender - if you don't have one, Tesco sell a value version for £4.99 or something like that.\n\nYou need to be in the right frame of mind to do it, set your mind to it and be really positive and have the support of the people around you and you are half way there! It needs to be the right time of your life to do it too. It's not something to be taken lightly, you need to keep focussed and realise it's only 6 months out of your whole life, etc., etc.\n\nI wonder if you've heard about Lighterlife too because people always go on about how wonderful it is (it's not!!) so I should explain that Cambridge Diet differs significantly from Lighterlife in two ways - firstly, it's literally half the price - approx £33 a week as opposed to £66 (yes, really!) and secondly on Cambridge Diet you will have add-a-meal week every 5th week. So you don't get out of the habit of eating altogether. The stabilisation and maintenance programmes are really good too and will make sure you don't put it back on.\n\nThat's about it I suppose, good luck with it, I hope it goes really well for you xxx
Have you been having sex?  If not, then your probably just affected by the pill.
Quitting smoking is a great opportunity to learn about ourselves.\nCongratulate yourself  on having the desire to stop - then you are over the worst, but still need to maintain your resolve. It's just so easy to start thinking that just one won't hurt, but it does. Just one achieves nothing except feeling the need for another. Whatever you do, don't have just one. Beware - alcohol will weaken your resolve.\nHere's a few home-brewed tips that might be useful.\nIt's not just nicotine addiction - there are 50+ chemicals in cigarettes. Also the main problem is habit.\nWe have been used to having body sensations which we translate as 'my body needs something', which we have attempted to satisfy by having a cigarette.\nWhen we try to stop smoking, we still get these 'my body needs something' sensations, and we still feel that we want a cigarette. We have to train our body to be more selective. When we feel we need something, we have to work out what it is that we actually need.\nA glass of water is an excellent substitute if nothing else comes to mind, as it helps with the clearance of the toxic substances in our body. Another good substitute is a bag of salted peanuts, used in combination with the water.\nAnother thing to do is to find an activity which occupies the mind or body. Go swimming - nobody wants to smoke while they are swimming. Slowly, as our body adjusts and translates the 'want something' feelings into something other than cigarettes, then the feelings begin to go away. We know its not a cigarette that the body really needs, because as soon as we've had one we still have the feeling, and want another!\nWe will have a few bouts of feeling or even being short tempered. We must try to bite our lip, and control; ourselves. Recognise the short temper as being the removal of toxins which are trying to find a way out. They went in through the mouth, and they try to get out that way to. We must learn to keep our mouth closed, and force the toxins out the other way.\n\nAfter we have stopped for a while we will begin to feel that just one wont to any harm.\nAll that leads to is a desire for just another one. We must guard very strongly against the desire to have just one.

Most doctors, if not all, say exercise is good; however, by changing your eating habits, your weight (stomach) will go down and you could probably get away with doing alot less crunches (yuck!)  I ate more protein (chicken, fish), green veggies, lots of water, limited carbohydrates (go online or get a book) and continued running (not as much as you), and have kept my weight off and have done so since I had my twins 28 years ago.  Congrats on your commitment to running...it's cool to get that second wind and makes you feel like you could run forever and ever.  However, over the years (unfortunately it has been several), I have found that once you stop exercising, fat sure starts coming on quicker than if you hadn't exercised at all.  I picked Yoga and Pilates (bad back) and it has been quite successful.  You are 17 right now, get your body back by changing your eating habits and continuing to exercise (just don't get carried away if you know what I mean) and your weight and stomach will both start showing improvement more quickly than you could imagine.  The good news is that your skin is still able to bounce back and hopefully you will avoid those awful stretchmarks.  Like I said previously, I had twins at 22, went over 200 lbs when I delivered, and can honestly say I do not have any stretchmarks, do not eat diet or no fat foods (again, yuck!) and my body looks pretty good for being in my 50's.  Another word of caution....understand the meaning of MODERATION.  It's all part of the life cycle.  Good Luck.

There are many causes for penis curvature.  These include weak and poor development of the penis, wearing restrictive underwear, a penis injury or some form of damage to the penis, age, over-masturbation resulting in trauma to the penis causing scar tissue to form and thus causing the penis to gradually curve, twist, or bend.  Other results include the penis being out of shape or deformed, such as one part being thicker or thinner than another part.  A slight curve such as to only 15 degrees, however, is normal.

Not knowing your age but quessing that you are over 30, I would recommend that you get checked out for high blood pressure and diabetes.  These are some of the most common causes of lack of sexual desire and ED problems. It those test are fine and your results are in the normal range for your age group - lets check your testosterone level.  If that is lower than it should be, it can be increased.  If you are faced with ertile dysfunction that can really hurt a man's sex drive so seeing your family Dr and getting Viagara or Cialis may also help you.  \n\nIf you are younger than 30 and have not had a productive and enjoyable sex life then I would suggest meeting with a councilor and seeing what emotional issues may cause the lack of drive.

"Hi Mama\n\nHere are some answers and remedies for your allegy issues.\n\nCause: \n\nWhen certain foods are eaten, toxins are stirred up in the body which has an excessive retention of waste matter. \n\nDr. Harold Thomas Hyman, M.D., in his book Handbook of Differential Diagnosis (Philadelphia, London, Montreal: J.B. Lippincott Co.) explains that despite limitations in current understanding of the problem, the state of allergy is described best as ""a perversion or perversions of the mechanisms of host-defense."" Several pages then continue to explain whether the allergies are histamine versus tuberculin type and the many tests, clinically, to determine the cause. The cause can be pollens, plants, micro-organisms and their products, animal tissues, digestants, cosmetics, drugs, serums, articles of clothing, dyes, industrial products, physical modalities (heat, cold, solar energy, etc.), and psychic tensions. The first step in cleaning up the cause of allergies is to work on rebuilding the bowel area to a ""healthy action."" \n  \n\nHerbal Aids: \n\n1. General Instructions: Clean the blood stream with a good herbal tea such as the red clover combination tea, which consists of red clover blossoms, chaparral, licorice root, poke root, peach bark, Oregon grape root, stillingia, prickly ash bark, burdock root, and buckthorn bark. A very fine herbal remedy for allergies, hay fever and sinus conditions is an herbal combination as follows: Brigham tea, marshmallow root, juniper berries, golden seal root, chaparral, burdock root, parsley root, cayenne, lobelia. Adult dose: one cup morning and evening. Another aid for sinus-stopped-up head and nose is our horseradish combination. \n  \n\nPreparation: Blend fresh, chopped-up horseradish roots into apple cider vinegar into a pulp (thick) and chew thoroughly before swallowing (one-eighth teaspoonful) three times in a day. Each three days increase this amount from one-eighth teaspoon up to one teaspoon. \n\n2.Other Treatment: \n\nUse the three-day cleanse each thirty days, or at least each three months and follow the mucusless diet. Also, do a colon cleanse.\n   \nBe sure to drink at least one gallon of distilled water per day for an adult of average size. We use one ounce of distilled water to each pound of weight per day--20 ounces for a 20-pound child. One who weighs 130 pounds would use 130 ounces per day, or about one gallon. \n\n3. Dr. Christopher's Formula for Allergies, Sinus, Hay Fever: (Sha Tea) This is an aid for clearing up these malfunctions, a ""natural and herbal help"" working as a decongestant and natural antihistamine to dry up the sinuses and expel from the head and broncho-pulmonary tubes and passages the offending stoppage and mucus. This formula consists of the following herbs: Brigham tea, marshmallow root, juniper berries, golden seal root, chaparral, burdock root, parsley root and lobelia. \n\nTo speed up this cleansing procedure, use the following combination in addition to the above: blend fresh, chopped-up horseradish roots mixed with apple cider vinegar into a thick pulp and chew thoroughly before swallowing. Take 1/3 teaspoon three times in a day. Each three days increase this amount from 1/3 teaspoon up to one teaspoon, increasing the amount 1/3 teaspoon each three days. \n\n4. Dr. Christopher's Blood Circulation Combination: (BPE) This formula is given to assist blood purifying teas to work more efficiently and to also aid the clearing up of allergies, etc. This group of herbs feeds cayenne (a stimulant) and ginger (stimulant) into the circulatory system where the cayenne works from the bloodstream to the heart and arteries, out into the veins. The other herbs in the formula assist these two herbs and work together to equalize the blood pressure (whether high or low) and to bring it to a good systolic over the diastolic reading. Blood flow is life itself. The blood circulatory combination consists of ginger, cayenne, golden seal"

Many people eat way too fast. Chewing your food thoroughly cause syour mind to trigger and let you know that you  are full. It takes your body about 20 minutes to process when it is full. So, by chewing your food completely and eating slower you are going to consume less becuase your body will know when you have eaten too much. Whereas if you eat quickly you are going to overeat.

Physically, the stomach can expand and take up all the space around the surrounding organs to actually fit the food inside--but that doesn't explain the weight. I remember hearing (sorry about the lack of source) that once you get to an outrageously large amount of food your body just wont take up the energy anymore... it would have to be an extreme amount, like in a hotdog eating contest.\nAlso, unless they train all year round, constantly, I assume their body naturally regulates by eating a smaller amount throughout the rest of the year.

"Firstly, I'm guessing it was ""stuck"" in the esophagus.  If it were in the windpipe, the person wouldn't be able to break, speak, etc.  Second, most of the time when it feels as if a pill is stuck in the esophagus, it is really just a leftover feeling from going down without a lot of fluid to buffer it. And lastly :),  a liquid taken afterward would help get rid of the feeling and no matter what (unless it really is in the windpipe), it will be effective."
"""....Reboxetine (Edronax) is a relatively well-tolerated, relatively selective ""noradrenergic"" agent. Crudely, whereas serotonin plays a vital role in anxiety and mood, noradrenaline is essential to maintaining drive and the capacity for reward. There's a fair bit of evidence that chronically depressive people have dysfunctional and atypical noradrenergic systems - particularly their alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptors. Reboxetine itself typically doesn't have the disruptive effects on cognitive function or psychomotor performance common to older, tricyclic clinical mood-brighteners - though alas antimuscarinic effects are still not completely absent. Indeed for one sub-population of depressives, the new NorAdrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors (NARIs) are possibly under-used. Unfortunately, catecholaminergic strategies to combat depression were eclipsed in the late 1980s and 1990s by the marketing hype surrounding selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). \n\n         Reciprocal interactions between the different monoamine systems make it hard to target one neurotransmitter system without triggering a cascade of effects on the others. But NARIs - and ""dopaminergics"" like amineptine (Survector) - may be especially useful in drive-deficient ""anergic"" states where the capacity for sustained motivation is lacking; in the treatment of ""retarded"" depression; and for melancholic depressives with a poor ability to cope with stress. Anxious depressives, on the other hand, may do better on Servier's neuroprotective and anxiolytic antidepressant tianeptine (Stablon), though comparative clinical trials are lacking. \n\n         Reboxetine may be safely combined with an SSRI, though there is evidence that NARIs themselves indirectly enhance central serotonin function by a mechanism that doesn't depend on reuptake inhibition. More surprisingly perhaps, preliminary studies suggest reboxetine can actually reverse tranylcypromine-induced hypertensive crises. The ""cheese effect"" is usually triggered by ingesting tyramine-rich foods. Thus NARIs plus MAOIs may prove a potent form of combination-therapy if other options fail. Newly-licensed (2006) EMSAM, the transdermal selegiline patch, is probably the safest choice of MAOI. \n\n        Reboxetine may also be used off-label to treat low back pain and fibromyalgia.\n\n\n\n        By mid-2006, reboxetine was licensed worldwide in over 60 countries. In May 2001, however, the FDA declined Pharmacia's license application for the North American market. The grounds for the decision have not been officially disclosed... """

HCV means Hepatitis C Virus.\nElevations in the different classes of immunoglobulins (antibody) are sometimes useful in determining the cause of liver damage in patients whom the diagnosis is unclear:\ntotal IgA is elevated in alcoholic cirrhosis; \ntotal IgM is elevated in viral hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis; \ntotal IgG is elevated in viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis. \nHCV IgG ELISA is an enzyme-linked immuniosorbent assay (ELISA) for the qualitative determination of antibody Hepatitis C Virus human serum or plasma.\nPlease see the Google search for more details on Hepatitis C Virus Immunoglobulin G.

Con: chewing gum in class is disturbing due to those who cannot chew it quietly. I personally can`t stand to hear smacking and cracking of someone chewing gum. It will create distraction in others causing the inability to study and take a test.\nPro: chewing gum quietly can lessen stress and actually burn calories, and if you chew sugarless gum, will clean the teeth.\nThe analysis: Gum chewing should not be allowed in school as there are far more reasons against than for.
Is it a microfracture or a complete fracture? If you can't walk because of the pain, try putting hot compress on the area and yes, take some mefenamic acid as well. The bones will heal in time. I am sure it's not a complete fracture since your doctor didn't require you to immobilze it eg. casting. Good luck

In reality, it's not the hot water that actually KILLS the germs; it's the friction.  When you wash, using mild soap all you really need is WARM water and lots of hand rubbing, or friction.  This is what kills the bacteria.  Hot, or warm water just feels better on the skin than COLD water...

Frisbee, dog walking, dancing, bowling, serious housework all counts.\n\nFor motivation check out the Success Stories at the Kimkins diet website.
"Debbie S has a terrific answer.\n\nI just wanted to add that it is best to never promise not to tell a secret.  It puts you in the dilemma you now face.  If someone says, ""promise you will never tell, if I tell you something"" you could say...""I will only tell if it puts you or someone else in danger to stay quiet.""  Quite clearly, it puts others at danger to leave a rapist on the loose.  Your friend also needs medical attention and emotional support.  Your friend may even be at further risk if the rapist tries to pick her up again as he knows her route walking home from school.  The moving excuse is just that, an excuse.  No one needs to move because they report a rape.  I would think that she might WANT to move to be safe from seeing the rapist again.  Then again, it could be possible that she suspects she is pregnant and made this story up to cover herself.  Of course you would know more, as she told you.\n\nIt's great she has a friend she can confide in.  Continue to support her.  Find ways that she can report in a confidential manner and encourage her to do so.  You could confide in your parents or the school counselor without telling them who you are talking about and see what they recommend.  You could approach it as a hypothetical question.\n\nGod bless you both."
Right now your body mass is 29 which is really unhealthy. The weight you should be for your height is 112.  You should try to eat healthier and eat small portions. Also do alot of cardio and pilates,yoga. Cardio excercises burns lots of calories and pilates and yoga will make you more flexabile and also give you the lean look that you are looking for. But you have to keep yourself committed. To start out try to excercise 3x a week for 20 mins. Then when you get yourself into a rountine you can start for 6x a week for 45 mins to an hour but dont start to hard on yourself cause that wont be good for you. Also make sure you get alot of water cause water cleans out your body.If your still real hungry after a meal try guzzling some water and chewing some gum. The water will fill your stomach and chewing the gum will distract you from trying to eat more food until your stomach settles with whats in it. So goodluck hope you achieve your goal.

"if you really WANT THIS BAD then your gonna have to WORK HARD FOR IT.  not just think ""oh if i skip this meal then i can have a chocolate cake for dessert"".  or if your gonna end up giving up why even try to lose weight?  first of all you need to watch what ur eating. no more snacking on all that unhealthy stuff. eat an apple if your hungry. next you need to start excercising.  taking a jog every day will help. enrolling in a hot yoga class could help too.  hot yoga is when you do yoga in a very hot room and you lose weight much faster."

Ok, relax.  I'm going to lay it out for you.  If you had a test at 9 weeks, then I'm fairly confident you are negative.\n\nThe average time it takes for someone to develop detectable antibodies on an HIV Elisa test is 25 days.  94% of people have detectable antibodies after 56 days of infection.  97% of people have detectable antibodies after 90 days of infection.  The remaining 3% can take up to six months mainly because they have an immune system disorder (leukemia, etc.).\n\nI volunteer at an HIV testing clinic.  I will tell you that everyone I have seen was detectable anywhere from 2 weeks to 8 weeks post exposure.  Make sure you are tested via a blood sample rather than oral specimen.  The blood test is slightly more accurate.  \n\nYou cannot diagnose HIV based on symptoms alone...you will drive yourself crazy.  A test at 9 weeks is a HUGE indicator that you are almost certainly negative.\n\nSounds like you probably have tonsillitis.  Get some antibiotics and you should be fine.\n\nThis is a valuable lesson for you.  Be careful and always use protection.
You don't have the flu, since the flu rarely gives you a bad cough.\n\nIt sounds like you have an upper respiratory infection.  If the cough syrup you got OTC didn't work, you absolutely MUST go to the doctor.  Chances are what you have can only be cured by antibiotics.  You could even have pneumonia, which could put you in the hospital.\n\nDon't worry, if you tell the doctor the cough syrup didn't work, he'll surely give you something stronger.

Actually, it is not illegal to not wear gloves, only unsanitary and dangerous. You need to let your doctor know or anyone for that matter who is performing a medical procedure on you that you want them to wear gloves or not to touch you. Many people who have been in the medical field a long time think that gloves are not necessary or that they get in the way, but they are at risk of transmitting an infection to you, to other patients and to themselves and their family! Shame on that doctor!
Please don't resort to pills. There are no 'healthy' pills for weightloss. The only way to do it is through exercise and dieting. I know it's hard, it's a struggle for most of us, including me, but it's always easier than dealing with the regrets of the possible damage diet pills can do, which includes anything from stomach ulcers to serious heart problems even if you're young!\n\nPS: Stay away from those Hoodia pills, it's a scam, the manufacturers are posting those answers!!!

PCO is when the eggs in your monthly cycle fails to release and developes into a bubble(simply put). The more eggs that fail to release forms into more and more bubbles that form a cluster and that is where the term poly(means many) began to form on the ovary.  Each month a woman has an egg released and when it does not fully mature and travel the normal process it stops and stays on the ovary, again forming a cluster.  So having PCO means many cyst on your ovary and it woul stand out on an ultrasound, looking exactly like a cluster of grapes but only a doctor can read the ultrasound.  As far as i know the only treatment for it is removal of the whole ovary.  If you had it the doctor would have told you the time you had the US.  So it may be nothing to worry about.  I know I had to have my right one remove DEC last year.  You only need one ovary to have a child as long as that one ifs functioning properly and releasing an egg or two :).  Good Luck baby girl

Excessive body weight has been shown to predispose to various diseases such as \n - cardiovascular disease, \n - diabetes mellitus type 2, \n - sleep apnea \n - osteoarthritis.\n - kidney stones\n - congestive heart failure, \n - enlarged heart and its associated arrhythmias and dizziness\n - varicose veins\n - pulmonary embolism\n - infertility\n - hernia,\n - colorectal cancer\n - gall stones\n - incontinence\n - cancer in general esp, breast, uterine and prostate  \n - still births\n - gout\n - stroke\n - carpal tunnel syndrome\n - dementia\n - asthma\n - too many psychological defects to mention e.g. depression and body dysmorphic disorder\n\n\n..... and this is only the short list!\n\nObestity is linked to each in a different way. In general heart conditions occur due to the increased work load and pressure obesity causes. Joint problems occur due to an excess of weight.  In artherosclorosis, the fat actually sets off the cascade for the thrombis formation and further ischemia and blockages that follow.\n\nYou really need to be specific in this area as it is so large! Research into each disease will give you a better idea.\n\nThe lesson here is obesity is a bad thing! It is correlated with such horrible diseases, why would you put yourself through it?

Here are the cost vs. benefits of taking Effexor\n\nWe'll start with the benefits.\nEffexor is a multiple reuptake inhibitor, which modulates two neuro transmitters in your brain, norepinephrine and serotonine.  Once at a theraputic range, Effexor and take you out of the most deepest and darkest depression imagineable. \n\nHere are the cons (and they are not exaggerated)\nEffexor is the most addicting of all of the antidepressants on the market today.  Not addicting in a way similar to fun drugs.  Because of the complex way Effexor works, your brain wil become dependant to the point where Effexor may become a permanent part of your life.   The withdrawal syndrome from effexor is the absolute worst amongst the serotogenic drugs.  Due to the short elimination half life (amount of time it stays in yoru system) you can experience withdrawal by missing just one dose!  Effexor is the hardest antidepressant to stop taking.  Let's say you reach the therautic dosage of 300mg, you will have to taper off in 30mg incriments, per week.  That means it will take at least 10 weeks to wean off, that is, if your brain lets you.\n\nEffexor is only recommended for deep deep depression and try taking anything else, unless it is your last resort.\n\nHope this helps
Ativan is to help calm her down.  I'm sure she is anxious about everything and it will keep her calm.

Weight distributes itself differently depending on the person. But judging from your measurements, you don't seem at all. Don't worry about being too fat for cheerleading, if you're good at it, they'll choose you. I'm sure your weight won't have to do with their decision.

I quit for three weeks before and could have stayed quit except I gave into a thought to get a pack when I was really stressed out.\nI regret that move. It only took one cigarette to get me hooked again. I can tell you that to be smoke free for three weeks, what I did was pray and ask God to help me. I said, I can't do this on my own, and I am asking for help. So, I threw the half filled pack in the trash and didn't smoke for three weeks. So, if you have decided to quit that you're sick of the habit I know you can do it, just be prepared for the thoughts like I had and don't give in to them. I wish you all the best...

This person probably thinks it's ok not to say anythign and let it go because they are in a lot of pain, and would rather have it go away than have to face it. Also, many sexually assaulted people feel ashamed because they think it was thier fault, while of course it was not. They don't like people probing into thier personal lives and into them as well.  This will not just go away though, if they don't tell someone and hopefully eventually face the perpatrator they will likely have it dwelling painfully within them until they die. If it is someone you both know, he/she may end up seeing that person again, which can cause alot more pain and such. Also, if they tell someone they can get the help they need, so that they can eventually move on so to speak. I would suggest you call your doctor and ask him/her who you should talk to, there are specialists in this topic and they can help you figure out what needs to be done. They can help your friend in a sensitive and calm way. So, call your doctor or a rape hotline or something to get a number to call. I don't know what else to say, other than of course be very sensitive around your friend and to help him/her as much as you can, and to either convince him/her to get help or get him/her help yourself (don't come across to strongly though if you are trying to convince him/her to get help, that might push them away). Whatever you choose, i wish you the best of luck!\n\n-sarah

Nowdays we don't isolate the patient and it is not necessary to take chemoprophylaxis also if your one member has got TB.\n\nThe best way is to treat the patient with short term chemoprypholaxis. If we give even single dose of Rifampicin the communicability of TB will reduce drastically upto 60%. \n\nSo have a standard treatment is enough.\n\nAnother thing we can't avoid acquisition of TB, most of us are infectd with TB, and shows diseases in certain conditions like low  immunity, AIDS and other condition when body fight system is poor.\n\nKeep you member in your home, give him/her atandard antiTB drugs, say him to use towel during coughing or sneezing, proper disposal of sputum and give him fresh air, good nutrition.\n\nHowever if the member is your intimate like partner and you can't avoid and he/she is in active stage then only you can take INH chemoprophylaxis, however is is is taken, it should be taken for long duration.

Any website dealing with neurology will give a good definition of the medical term. If it is services available to the family start with the hospial,rehab center and even teachers in public schools.

I think they're rude and insensitive to your feelings.  Talk with a counselor first, someone who's skilled in mental health.  The best ones to decide whether you need medication is your doctor and yourself.\n\nSpeak up for yourself, it's not what you say but how you say it.  Let them know it hurts your feelings when they mention Prozac, and your name comes up.  There's nothing wrong with getting treatment if you need it.  But there's a stereotype against people with mental illnesses, as though they're nothing.  Like they'e totally crazed and don't have feelings, and unaware what's happening.  \n\nI know how you feel, because I have a mentally ill parent.  It's tough.  But take a stand for yourself, and people will change their tune around you.  Let them know you're not tolerant of being looked down upon. \n\nMake sure if you decide to get medicine that it's best for you.  Don't get medication just because other people say you need it.  If people feed you negativity long enough you can buy into it, if you're not careful.  It's because words have the power to build and to tear down.

Don't worry about it.  You might kill off sperm in your system during the spa time, but those balls are hardier than you think.  Sperm produced outside of the hot tub should be fine. \nI used a very hot hot tub every day for years at the Y--usually 110-112; also have 3 kids from that same time period.  If you do have very low sperm count, or the sperm fertility is very low, you might want to forgo hot tubs completely if you are trying to reproduce. \nIf you are not trying to reproduce, then enjoy the hot tub.

"1-2 pounds a week is usually the amount that is healthy.  Just make sure that you are eating enough calories when your exercising, usually people tell you ""You have to burn more calories then you're eating""  but when your exercising its extremely important to make sure you're eating the right calories, not empty ones.  Also if you have access to a free gym you should see if they have a nutritionist, most do now and you can have a consultation that works with your exercise program.  Don't get discouraged if you dont see a significant change in the first 6 weeks or so, it takes your body time to adjust and start burning that fat and building muscle.  good luck!"
To lose weight, you need to run more. I would suggest running a total of 45-80 minutes a day. You also need some weight training to increase your metabolism. Since you don't wanna be muscular, i would suggest doing high reps of low weight to gain small lean muscles. I would do 20-50 reps of each exercise, and only do a couple exercises with 2 sets of each exercise.Here are some exercises I would recommend doing for someone that doesn't want to get bulky but wants to have some strength, be lean, and be fit. \n\nSquats (maximum amount you can do without weight for 2 sets)\n\n Pushups (maximum amount you can do without weight for 2 sets)\n\nBicep Curls (2 sets of 20-25 reps with 8-15lb dumbbells depending on how strong you are)\n\nShoulder Press (2 sets of 20-25 reps with 15-20lb dumbbells depending on how strong you are\n\nDoing this weight training to speed up the metabolism and running to burn the fat will help you lose weight everywhere you need to lose weight. There is no way to lose weight in just one certain area.\n\n\nI bet you are losing weight working out 40 minutes a day, but just not at a noticeable rate, so just run more and weight train to make it noticeable. \n\nGood luck\n\n\n                     Jer

I went to see one after being refused DLA for the third time to help me appeal and she went mad that I was refused after she read the medical report (which I requested a copy of).

I won not only the appeal, but the backdated one too.\n\nGet to a Welfare Rights Officer now (they know what they are doing and seem to be feared by the DSS- they changed their mind about my recent appliction when I mentioned that I wanted all the info because I was going to see a Welfare Rights Officer). Its all very confusing. The DSS were at my appeal and were rude and scary and made me cry. \n\nBut just so you know, I don't think you can get Carers Allowance if you get DLA. And I hope your husband gets DLA as well as some other benefit. Not to mention a companion travel card and such, because he should. \n\nAs someone said, it is hard for the genuinely disabled due to those that just take it as an easy option or a reason not to work.

The non-dentists above are just not aware of the new issues.  Don't lose TOO much sleep over this, because osteonecrosis secondary to ORAL bisphosphonates is very rare.  That doesn't mean that you are not one of the unlucky ones, though, so if you have any questions about your healing, the sooner you see your dentist the better he/she will be able to help you.\n~

Easy answer.  Exercise.  By exercising regularily, your metabolism kicks it up a notch automatically.  Doing cardio three days a week will help.  Mixing in a little weight lifting around the cardio helps even more.\n\nSo, not only does exercising burn calories, it also makes your body better at losing weight and makes you healthier
They are very uncomfortable and sometimes hurt alot, depending on where you are in your cycle. Don't go right before your period. It's a good thing, esp if the radiologist reads the films correctly.
This would not effect how effective your birth control pills are at all. \nPersonally, you are slightly paranoid about this. Relax. As long as you take your pills daily you are fine. Unless you throw up/vomit 30 minutes or less after taking your pill the pill is ingested properely. If you still remain concerned you should use a back up method such as condoms with your pills.

Typical signs and symptoms of an infection include redness, swelling, pain, a pus like discharge,   If you are experiencing these symptoms you should probably get checked before Monday.  I don't want to scare you but on March 17 this year a young girl in my province died from a staph infection related to a body piercing so get yourself to a doctor, either emergency room or at an office.
There could be a variety of reasons-trapped nerve being one of them. Are your pillows supporting your neck and head properly? I have the same pains,but mine is down to injury resulting in degenerated neck discs. See your doctor,who will probably want you to have x-rays to help pinpoint the source of the problem.
"This can get you started; from there, you can google ""Cardiac Memory ECG"".  \n\nCardiac memory describes the phenomenon whereby the T-wave abnormalities that result from a change in the direction of cardiac activation, as during ventricular pacing, persist for a while after the end of pacing."

Everyone is different..for me nothing happens...but for when i am pregnant..for the first period i miss i get cramps..but for when i am not pregnant i feel nothing..i just realize that i started my period when it happens
Sorry, but practice makes perfect.....
It's alright to keep it because it means something to you, but you should seriously think about leaving it at home. You should definately seperate yourself from it. What are you afraid of? Live your life without fear, you don't need a teddy to keep you safe.
I know you feel depressed and overwhelmed with the loss of your husband. But it will get better with time. I am on the same boat you are on i was diagnosed with post traumatic stress syndrom and was getting panic attacks for a long time. The only way to battle this is to get out and enjoy life. I was like this for 7 years but because i let depression get to me and i didnt get out i let myself spend years of my life alone. dont let this happen to you because you will regret it in the end. I wish i could help you more but all i can offer is advice. goodluck\n\nThink about what your husband would want.\n\nOh another thing i used to get nausea alot also what i would do is chew sugarless gum and it would take my mind off people around me or my stomach i hope i helped.
Tell her you feel bad when she says that if you do loose weight do it the right way but I don't thank your to big for your age

1. An ordinary yeast infection cannot cause infertility.  That doesn't mean you shouldn't treat it, as it is communicable and unpleasant.  Your doctor can prescribe diflucan, or you can take an over-the-counter medication like Monistat which should clear it up in a few days.\n\n2. Yes you can still get pregnant if you have a yeast infection.  You are also more vulnerable to STDs, as your vagina is irritated and susceptible to tearing.\n\n3. Are you not using a condom?  It could be semen, or it could be  that you are ovulating (thick gluey discharge is classic ovulation mucus).  If you're concerned, you need to see a doctor for this one, since internet diagnosis is notoriously unreliable.
A TENS unit has done wonders for me. It can be worn for up to 10-12 hours a day. You can't use it for sleep though. I would highly recommend one.

50 regular push ups will not be easy. Chest, Shoulder, and tricep strength will need to be built before you can start. Do modified push ups until you can get to 50. \n\nOnce you can do that you should start in the push up position and lower your self down to the ground, if you cant come back up do modified push ups from your knees  until your arms are fully extended-lift your knees up and lower yourself back down. Repeat that.\n\nDo not do push ups more than once a day at this point, you need to rest the muscles and repair a little.\n\ngood luck!
I'd try a lot of different things and just see what works
"If you have been taking your birth control pills properly (every day at around the same time) you ARE protected from pregnancy during your ""off"" or ""sugar"" pills. This is also when your period should come. All this information should be included in the information packet you received with the pill pack. As long as you've been on the pills for more than a week (and it looks like you have) you are protected from pregnancy throughout the whole cycle. You are NOT protected from STIs/STDs though so if you and your partner haven't been tested you might consider using a condom.\n\nIf you are saying ""3rd day off the pills"" meaning you've decided to not take hormonal birth control any more and stopped before finishing the entire pack, I'm not sure how long you're protected from pregnancy. It doesn't look like you mean that though so you are fine, and should be protected."
I do agree that you need a new doctor. First, you need to determine the kind of pain you are having during intercourse. Your doctor should do a thorough pelvic exam on you so that he can determine where the pain is located. If you are having pain in the entire vaginal region (as your question may suggest), you may have vulvar muscle degeneration, chronic vulvar pain, or a vaginal infection. Since the pain is exterior as well, it may not be endometriosis and it may not have anything to do with your uterus or ovaries. You should get a complete pap smear, a pelvic ultrasound or CT scan or MRI of your pelvis. You definitely need to go to a doctor who will take you seriously and will treat you, regardless of your insurance situation.

That is classic dehyration...you must drink water....make sure you have a drink a little while before you go to the gym and then afterwards and keep your salt intake regular as you sweat a lot out, so it will need replaced, just as it does in a hot climate....keep fit and well!
it's not a bad thing to do, it helps relieve the cramps and it can also help you keep from getting pregnant when you don't want to.
"There is no site specific way of losing fat... the old myth about working your abs to burn belly fat isn't true. To get rid of love handles, you need to lose overall fat. That happens with exercise and watching your diet. More on that below. \n\nThe most effective way to lose fat is aerobic exercise in the ""moderate"" fat-burning range, ideally first thing in the morning before you eat. When you wake your body is ready to burn fat and your levels of growth hormone are highest at that time. Later in the day it can take up to 30 minutes just to put your body into a fat-burning mode. \n\nAnother overlooked way to burn fat is by lifting weights. Skeletal muscle has very high caloric needs... almost twice that of adipose (fat) tissue. Put on a little muscle and you will burn calories all day even at rest. Be aware that skeletal muscle weighs more, so with this approach you may see your weight increasing while your body fat is melting away. Not realizing this often stresses folks who think they should be losing weight as a measure of fitness. Forget the scale, look in the mirror and you will be happy.\n\nSix-packs are 20% abdominal exercise and 80% diet. There is one caveat... abdominal muscles will form in the position that you work them, so be certain to pull them tightly toward your spine while doing crunches, etc. Also, during most lifting, the ""core is active"" which means that you should be stabilizing with contracted abs then too. Fail to do this and the abs will form, but bulging outward and the result is not attractive.\n\nYou are welcome to look at my 360 Blog of September 10 for more detailed suggestions.\n\nAloha"
Weight Watchers is much better because in the long run, you learn an entire new way of cooking to maintain your weight.  With Jenny Craig, you have to buy their expensive meals and learn nothing about nutrition.
take two aspirins and call me in the morning!!!!
that's kind of a silly question. i guess you'll have to try it and find out.
My advice is to quickly go to a doctor for this. This is something you don't want to just wait around to see if it goes away. With all the medical things that can go wrong in that spot, I would seek medical attention right away.

Which body fluids can transmit the HIV virus, and which ones don't?\n\nBlood, pre-cum, semen, vaginal secretions, and breast milk all contain high concentrations of HIV, and all have been linked to transmission of the virus. \n\nSaliva, tears, sweat and urine can have the virus in them, but in such small concentrations that nobody has ever been infected through them. However, if any body fluid is visibly contaminated with blood, the risk of transmission exists. \n\n\n\n\nHow is HIV transmitted?\nHIV must get into your bloodstream in order to infect you. If it doesn't get into the bloodstream, you will not get the infection. Blood, pre-cum, semen, vaginal secretions or breast milk must have direct access to your bloodstream in order to infect you. Activities where this can happen include vaginal intercourse (both partners), anal intercourse (both partners), giving oral sex, sharing needles (IV drugs, tattooing, etc.) and, rarely, through receiving a blood transfusion. HIV can also be transmitted from mother to child. HIV is not transmitted through any form of casual contact. \nIn summary, in order for infection to occur, three things must happen: \n\nYou must be exposed to pre-cum, semen, vaginal secretions, blood or breast milk, AND \nThe virus must get directly into your bloodstream through some fresh cut, open sore, abrasion etc., AND \nTransmission must occur, directly from one person to the other, very quickly (the virus does not survive more than a few minutes outside the body).\nNo matter what the circumstances are, if you think about these three criteria for transmission, you'll be able to determine whether you're at risk for HIV or not. But do remember that other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can be transmitted more easily than HIV, so what might be low risk for HIV may be high risk for other STDs.
I am no doctor, so I do not know.  If you are really concerned that it could be your heart, then go see a doctor. Age doesn't matter.\nMy opinion is that it sounds like anxiety.  I say that because you said you were arguing and shouting loud.\nGod Bless.
So many and answers- I have systemic lupus along w/other health problems and take a b complex daily.  It's a liquid taken sublingually because B12 isn't absorbed well thru the stomach.\nSublingual B Total™\nLiquid B Vitamin Supplement is the one I use and recommended by my doctor.\n\nVitamin B12 - helps maintain healthy nerve cells and red blood cells.  Works in close partnership with folic acid in synthesis of the building blocks for DNA and RNA. Essential for the integrity of the maintenance of the nervous system and for the production of energy producing molecules. Non toxic at 1,000 mcg daily for many years.\n\nFolic Acid (folate) - a non-toxic nutrient that protects our chromosomes from DNA damage. Also helps with depression.  No noticeable side effects.\n\nVitamin B2 (riboflavin) - required for cell growth and release of energy, formation of red blood cell, and synthesis of antibodies.\n\n\nVitamin B3 (niacin) - stabilizes cell membranes, insures proper circulation and maintains healthy skin. Aids in the function of the nervous system and helps to reduce cholesterol.\n\nVitamin B5 (panthothenic acid) - a non toxic nutrient needed to breakdown fat to covert into energy. An anti-stress vitamin.                        \n\nVitamin B6 - needed for the synthesis of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine.

eating bananas do not make you fat. eating excess of anything which increases your total amount of calories consumed can make you gain weight. eating bananas can make you feel really full or like you have gained weight since they are a bulky food. but as the banana passes threw the digestive system the feeling will pass.
i have  i am sad to say . i have been on a number of meds over the years for the most part prior to now i don't think anyone them were doing much to help with the depression . \n i am sure some of them made things much worse. once a doctor started giving me anti psychotic meds and that messed me up bad i was unable to sit and was in the end after 3 days of going out my mind and putting my car in the ditch admitted to the hosp with the help or my gf and mom.  the meds i had been given had made so so mixed up i failed the test i was given that is very basic IE what day is it and so on . \n that was one doctor  i am pleased to say that the doc was already under the microscope himself as they had in the hosp the director of a mental health hosp there to over see there pyschatric. dept and i was told by this head doctor it was all because of the doctor that put me on the terrible wrong meds \n anyway after that i went through a number of what are called ssri  meds selective serotonin re uptake inhibitors this is the newer class of meds used to treat depression . one is not the same as the next .i am sure you have heard of prozac well that is one ssri but it did not work for me nor did quite a few others\n over the years what was of help to me was anti anxiety medication benzodiazapam type they helped for me but they are \n addicting for many so you have to be sure just to take them really as the doc says or take less then your told. never more at least not much more without telling him.\n right now i am on a drug called welbutrin you might now it as ziban the drug used to help people quit smoking. that med on its own was somewhat helpfull but not much then at my suggestion i started a new med along with it called effexor . that with some use of the mild sedative i have has managed to help me more then any other med . now keep in mind this is just me and each person is different you might be really lucky and get on the right med for you first thing \n as far as the meds go remember this and its important you have the right the legal right not to take the med if you think its not in your best interest . i say that as the time i mentioned with the stupid doc was one of the worst times in my life pacing and so on a real trip one that was as a result not of depression but because of the meds and i knew they were the wrong ones for me but i was not aware enough to stop them soon enough \n another thing is that when you get on a med and it is helping you  come out of the depression this is when people hear about the meds on the news as the person has killed himself . sounds awfull and it is . the reason for this is odd to some but its really simple if you know depression from having it . a person can become so low that they just dont have the energy or will power to get up and do anything that is as difficult as killing yourself\n but when the med starts to work some of the people very few gain the energy back and there still along way from being not depressed so they now are depressed but with some increase in energy and concentration so this is when they are able to follow through with the idea of suicide. \n the med did not cause the sucides it was working just like it should have what if any thing caused the failure in the system was a lack or commmunication with the doctor and the patient and or the person just not knowing that its ok to just go to emergency room and tell them how you feel flat out. \n sure if your a threat to yourself saying you want to kill yourself you do get locked up . but that is only for a few days meaning 3 often and then a review takes place and you might get sent home or asked to stay in both cases if you volonteer to be admitted to the hosp or stay in the hosp longer it goes to show that your not unaware or unwilling to deal with the problem\n i was never locked up for more then 10 days nor did i see anyone in the ward that was there for depression that was locked up longer then 10 days . \n that is no
You have raised the quetions on Albinism previously. Hence it is presumed that this question also relates to Albinism.\nPlease see the webpages for more details on Albinism.\nSymptoms:-\nFor those with albinism, one of the following will be present:\nAbsence of pigment from the hair, skin, or iris of eyes \nPatchy absence of pigment (skin color, patchy) \nLighter than normal skin and hair \nMany forms of albinism have some of the following possible symptoms:\nRapid eye movements (nystagmus) \nStrabismus (eyes not tracking properly) \nPhotophobia (avoidance of light because of discomfort) \nDecreased visual acuity or even functional blindness \nTreatment   \nTreatment aims to ease symptoms and depends on the extent of the disorder.\nThe skin and eyes must be protected from the sun. Sunglasses (UV protected) may relieve photophobia. Sunburn risk can be reduced by avoiding the sun, by using sunscreens and covering completely with clothing when exposed to sun. Sunscreens should have a high SPF (sun protection factor).
No Good and Reasonable Answer.\n\nSex whether the act or just the sexual fantasy elevates the blood pressure, heart rate due to the catecholamine discharge, causing vasodilation in some parts like the brain, and the lower head, and constriction in some other parts like the stomach and the heart and lungs.  In fact there is such a thing as ruptured aneurysm , stroke , subarachnoid hemorrhage and heart attack during sex.\n\nMay be do it infrequently but add more the emotional support like whispering sweet nothings before , during and after and long after the event.  As one gets older, emotional comofrt becomes more significant than the sexual act itself.

Depends whats causing it !!!
It can be a fungal infection the only way to know for sure is to have a dermatologist do a swab. \n\nIf your girlfriends went away can you figure anything she didi to cause it was she taking a monostat or the like. \n\nThe pimple thing worries us.  WHo else ar you and your girl frined having sex wiht besides eachother? \nIf no one then we woudl not think it is a STD but it oculd be one from the description. \n\nYOu might have jock itch. \n\nThe way to get rid of a fungal infectino or a skin infection if you can not get to a doctor is to use the wet dry capilary action of nature to dry up what ever is growing in your skin.\n\nWhen you wet somethign and let it dry more water comes off of it than you put on it to get it wet.  This is why lips chap in the winter.  PErsons continutally lick their lips and they dry and they lick them again and this makes them more and more dry becseu each time the water evaporates off of the skin it pulls more molecules of water off of the skin with it than you put on the skin. ''SO  one way to kill fungal infecitons on the body is to wet them and let them dry. \n\nSit with your penis out it won;t hurt if it is slightly erect while you do this but do not turn it into a masturbatio session.  \n\nWet it good for example with a wet rag. or a wet paper towel. \n\nThen let it air dry.  YO ucan fan it or wave somethign at it to speed up the drying.  Then do this eiht or ten times in a row in one sitting.  Wet then air dry it, wet and then air dry it. do this eight times at a session and do it four or five times a day.  \ndo it for about eight to ten days. \n\nyou should notice improvement before that but if it seems to work and the redness seems ato go away as a result then keep doing this for at least 7 days after the redness is gone. \nYOu can do it.  \n\nIF you do htis for a few days say four or five and there is no change you should get to a doctor or medical expert. \n\nHOwever if it is a fugal or mirobial infection that should help it. \n\nI donot know what the conectino is to the pimple.  It could be the introduction of a Sexually transmitted disease.  YOu should ask your girl friend and yourself who have you been sleeping with if one of you has been with another person then you should both go get checked for sexuall transmitted diseases. \nI pray that it is not so. \nYOu might want to read my very conservative set of ideas on this in my various answers to otehr question s. \n\nThe more conservative persons have the best sex lives it seems according to certain poles taken for many years. \n\nanswwwerman@yahoo.com

This could possibly be a parotid tumor. Don't be afraid- they are usually benign, although it is a good idea to get them checked out.  I had one for a couple of years.

No problems, and barely a scar.

Hi - \n\nWell, first, a few facts:  Cholesterol in your diet can ONLY come from animal products.  So that means meats, seafoods (especially shrimp and shellfish), eggs, dairy, etc.  If you limit these foods, and increase your intake of fruits, veggies and whole grains, it's likely you will see a positive result  :)\n\nNow, onto your question.  It's been seen that niacin can have some lowering effect on cholesterol, and some believe garlic supplements can help (both have mixed results in clinical studies).  Either way, nothing over the counter will have nearly the effect that a statin would have.\n\nYour MD or RD will be able to tell you best what will work for you and your lifestyle.
im 13 too! what worked miracles for me was going vegan! just dont eat anything that has animal products in it (milk, eggs, meat) and you will loose lots of weight. just still make sure you get all your nutrients!!! keep exersizing too. :)

I have sex with men, it gets embarrassing sometimes, but if I think to much about it it makes me go soft.  It's natural, and it's great to last longer and give your partner more pleasure.  Probably better for you, once a man is done he's done and doesn't want to wait for me.

"Sounds like depression to me. I have been diagnosed with bipolar a couple of years back... and for months at a time i feel sluggish, sleep tons and i am unmotivated... and some months i can get anything done and i don't like to sleep during those months.  I have a very mild form of bipolar.  but I know that during my down months it is hard to pull myself out of bed at all.  I don't necessarily feel ""depressed"" but my body sure does.  I can sleep for 12-15 hours a day during those times. I say the best thing to do is to contact your physician and find out if it is a physical or physiological.  Another thing that I have found helpful is to improve you diet and exercise.  It really does give you so much extra energy."
It may be more than just swollen feet and/or diabetes.  Does she constantly work on her feet?  Is she grossly overweight?  How is her blood glucose control?  Many things come together to determine diabetic foot problems and the sorting out of them is better left to her diabetic Dr and a good podiatrist . Second guessing is dangerous, it could also be her heart or kidneys  or something known as Charcot Foot disease.  Know exactly what the underlying problem is before you self treat.  Living with diabetes is hard enough without foolishly putting yourself in harms way. Good Luck! PS The pros know where to find the shoes too!

Usually, but not EVERY morning. It is a morning erection that is naturally caused as the brains enters the REM-deep sleep phase.

Hi Jerri Lynn.   I think you are asking about Resveratrol.  Resveratrol is a polyphenol found in many foods, especially the skin of dark grapes.  It is a powerful antioxidant.  Research suggests that it can be helpful in prevention of many chronic diseases including cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  The health benefits attributed to red wine may be, in part, a result of the resveratrol content of the wine.\n\nHope this helps you.  Best wishes.

I have often read of people who have abilities as you said you do, learn how to turn that entire situation into good. You can learn to expand on the bad feelings you get and possibly get to a point where it doesn't just make you cry, you are able to see exactly what bad thing is going to happen and possibly stop it from happening. I see the psychic's all the time where they are called in by the police department to try and find missing people, solve crimes, many times solve murders. The psychic has to experience the pain that the murder victim went through but I don't know about you but I would do it every day of the week if I could help a family find their loved one, help solve a murder, help put a murderer or rapest behind bars so they can't hurt anyone else. Don't look at this as an all bad thing. I wish I had the ability because my main goal would be to help law enforcement as much as I could no matter how muh it hurt to do it. Look what the rewards would be...you could help keep a community safe and end the hell that a family of a victim had been in. I do have to also say BE CAREFUL THOUGH.... You can develop this so it's a good thing. There are scams all over though. Psychic's and people and web sites that claim to be able to ""help"" you develop your abilities are one of the highest scams out there. Read..READ...READ...I can't tell you what to do, I can only tell you what I would do. I would get books on the subject from my local library 1st. I would do all sorts of reading online but DO NOT PLEASE give anyone even a red cent online. Even on the sites I am sending you below...the second someone asks for any type of money be it membership fees, buy my book, donations for others who are also trying to sharpen their skills, or fees for them to teach you. After I read non-stop on the internet and from my library, I personally would look for free introductory or free session of any type in my local area (internet is a good place to find out about them). Then I would be looking to my local community college and take classes, as many classes as I could on the subject. That way, you are getting the knowledge at the rate YOU are comfortable with, if anything makes you uncomfortable at any time, you can just stop right in your tracks. Lastly, NOBODY IS RIPPING YOU OFF. It sounds to me as if you possibly could have abilities, you can direct them to where you want them, and not have such a negative effect coming from this but watch your back. For someone people, money is all that matters. They will claim they are wanted to help and teach but in reality, they have their hand in your pocket. I wish you the world of luck. I can be contacted via email by, I think just clicking on my log in name on yahoo ask /answer if you would like to. This is a subject that I have studied/read about for a few years now. If you have any questions that I can answer, feel free."
If you don't have any symptoms still then you probably dodged that bullet.  You may as well get tested again anyway.
Tell yourself you are going to go, but only for 10 minutes.  Once you are there, the same inertia that kept you from going will now be working to keep you from leaving early.  Also, unless you are training for a marathon or something, there is no need to go everyday.  Space it out and give your muscles a chance to rest and recover.
There is nothing wrong with sleeping during the day and staying up at nights. The main thing is to get enough sleep, whatever time of the day you prefer sleeping. It might do you good to get some sunlight every now and then though, or increase your intake of vitamin D from food, because sunlight is an important source of vitamin D for us. Apart from that you have nothing to worry about.
You are so pretty...

I'm an Audiologist\n\nThose numbers are about the maximum noise reduction rating for an in-the-ear plug.  Because sound is vibration, we can hear through the vibrations in our skeletons.  In order to block more sound, an ear muff is necessary, as it cushions the temporal bone and area around the ear.  Unfortunately, the earmuffs aren't comfortable to sleep in.\n\nCustom earmolds even only block about 30-33dB in the low-to-mid frequencies, where most voices are, but do block up to 40-45dB of the higher frequency sounds.  \nhttp://westone.com/attenuation.html\nhttp://westone.com/earmold_styles.html#protect\n\nThe ones that are for hunting are only for sudden noises, and some of them actually AMPLIFY some sounds, so the hunters can hear the animals rustling in the brush.  They would not serve your purpose, unless you're trying to sleep through a fireworks display or 21-gun salute.\n\nWhat sounds are you trying to block when you are sleeping?  I have tinnitus (ringing in the ears - so plugs would make that worse.  In addition, I have cats and family members who make noise when I'm trying to sleep, so I run a fan all night long to mask the noises.  If you're trying to block a partner's snoring, you are better off getting them evaluated and treated for the snoring by an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist.

I love turning down the speed on the treadmill and increasing the incline.  This has firmed my thighs and hips.  People at work asked me what I was doing because my a** looked good.\n\nI still enjoy jogging on the treadmill 1 hour 3-5 days a week if I can't get outside but I reduce speed and increase the incline 3 times a week.  \n\nNow others at my job enjoy it as well.\n\nEnjoy yourself !
"I am not happy that he removed ""almost"" the entire lesion, since this was supposed to be an excisional biopsy, but I was not there and do not know the conditions that exist in your mouth.  Perhaps it was very close to the mental foramen and he did not want to leave you permamnently numb if it is not necessary.\n\nThis dysplasia is very likely in response to a poor fitting denture.  It's not unlike the callous you have on your elbow.  Just let the surgical site heal for a few weeks (as recommended) and then either get a new denture or have your existing denture relined (if it is otherwise suitable) so that it fits properly.\n\nAt this stage, just don't wear your denture until it heals and be careful not to bump into the area with any food if you are chewing soft foods."

"Polycysitic ovaries, or PCOS is a complex condition that to this day has no clear cut situations. But first as off let me address your possibilities of not being able to fall pregnant. This is not always the case. Your presonal situation will be different to every other woman with PSOC, so this is something only you and your doctor can discuss, however, more and more women who suffer from PCOS are falling pregnant. If you are in a relationship and are looking ot fall pregnant, then there are many things medically that can be done to assist, however some women dont need assistance at all.\n\nSecondly, a Laparoscopy is a procedure that uses a ""laparoscope"" via a key hole inscision to send a camera to your ovaries to have a look.  Your Doctor may or may not remove cysts that he sees, as depending of the size and the nature of the cyst, they can often disappear over time. If he does chose to remove the cyst, it generally can be done through the same key hole inscision. \n\nAlso, ovarian drilling, done during laparoscopy, is a procedure in which a laser fibre or electrosurgical needle punctures the ovary 4 to 10 times. This treatment results in a dramatic lowering of male hormones within days and is often performed in women who have polycystic ovary syndrome. Studies have shown that up to 80 percent of patients will benefit from such treatment.\n\nOne thing I wish to say to you is never follow 'things you have heard' as gospel for your own health. Only a health professional who knows your medical history should make calls on your personal situation. \n\nBut I do suggest that you read health journals, or even go to www.soulcysters.com It is a support group for women with PCOS and can be a valuable resource for information.\n\nGood Luck, and your situation isnt as uncommon as you may believe and all you have to do is ask a few other woman, and chances are, one of them will have PCOS too."
two ways I know if....\n\nFirst of all...the cheapest hot tea variety tea bags you can buy. The 200 for a dollar type. Soak them in a cup like you were going to make tea. Then, get as much of the water out as you can. Put them over your eyes (obviously close them) and let them sit for about 5 minutes. It works because tea bags contain tannin which is a natural reliever. The cheaper the tea bag, the more tannin they contain. \n\nCucumber slices work (they have to be cold though) but it wont help the itching as well as tea bags.
Hi ferocious\n\nHere are some ideas to heal the condition.\n\nCause\nThe most common cause of hepatitis is a virus that can occur in five potential forms: A, B, C, D, or E. Other causes include excessive alcohol consumption, drug abuse (including pharmaceutical drugs, such as acetaminophen), overexposure to chemicals, and, sometimes, as a reaction to properly prescribed medications. \n\nIn recent years, hepatitis C has been on the increase. It is most frequently caused as a result of blood transfusions. Typically, people with hepatitis C are identified either because they have abnormal liver tests or because of a hepatitis C antibody test. A positive test does not necessarily mean serious liver disease, however. People with hepatitis C may have no liver disease, a mild form of chronic hepatitis, or a more serious form of hepatitis that may progress over a number of years to cirrhosis. The usual indications are a positive antibody test for the hepatitis C virus, abnormal liver tests for more than six to twelve months, and a liver biopsy that shows chronic active hepatitis. Approximately 20% of patients chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus will go on to develop cirrhosis. \n\nNote: Infectious hepatitis can be easily spread two weeks before and one week after jaundice appears. The feces of people with hepatitis contain the virus. Therefore, very strict toilet hygiene and hand and cloth washing should be observed during this time.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNatural Cures\n\nAromatherapy: Rosemary can help stimulate liver function. \n\nDiet: Follow a diet low in protein and high in fresh vegetables to minimize stress on the liver. Also eat small meals throughout the day, and avoid foods such as refined sugars, alcohol, and caffeine, which cause stress on the liver, and be sure to drink plenty of filtered water. Drinking fresh lemon juice water every morning and evening followed by vegetable juice is also recommended to help liver function. Easily digested grains, such as millet, buckwheat, and quinoa, are also good food choices. \n\nEnemas: Three warm enemas administered daily can help boost liver function.\n\nHerbs: The liver-cell regenerative properties of herbs such as milk thistle and licorice can be helpful. Take 1/2 teaspoon of this mixture three times a day. Tumeric combined with milk thistle has also been shown to help alleviate the symptoms of hepatitis B. \n\nHydrotherapy: Hydrotherapy is the application of water, ice, steam and hot and cold temperatures to maintain and restore health. Treatments include full body immersion, steam baths, saunas, sitz baths, colonic irrigation and the application of hot and/or cold compresses. Hydrotherapy is effective for treating a wide range of conditions and can easily be used in the home as part of a self-care program. Many Naturopathic Physicians, Physical Therapists and Day Spas use Hydrotherapy as part of treatment. I suggest several at-home hydrotherapy treatments.\n\nJuice Therapy: The following juice combinations can be helpful: beet, carrot, and wheat grass juice; or garlic, burdock, flax, and black currants.\n\nNutritional Supplementation: Supplement with vitamin C, beta carotene, liver glandulars, milk thistle extract, vitamin B complex, adrenal glandulars, lipotropic factors, pantothenic acid, free-form amino acids, betaine hydrochloric acid (HCL), multi-enzymes, and evening primrose oil.\n\nAlternative Professional Care\nIf your symptoms persist despite the above measures, seek the help of a qualified health professional. The following professional care therapies have all been shown to be useful for treating hepatitis: Ayurveda, Acupuncture, Detoxification Therapy, Magnetic Field Therapy, Naturopathic Medicine, and Oxygen Therapy.\n\nbest of health to you

You should clarify your insurance coverage and a doctor's billing policy before being seen.  If you have billing problems with an office discuss it with the office manager, and if it cannot be resolved change doctor's.  If you contest a bill the vast majority of doctors will make a compromise - and if they will not - it is just as well that you are no longer a patient.

I work at a drug store and the most popular otc for bladder infections is AZO.  You will find it in the same section as the Midol and feminine hygiene products.  I have used it and it has helped.  But, if the infection is severe, you will need to see the doctor after the weekend.  But, the AZO will get you through the weekend with less discomfort.
Probably just a bug - take something for general pain, drink plenty of fluids and rest!  You'll probably feel much better tomorrow.  God bless!
well my excuse is i have a midterm or final or just a test i have to study for that i have a class after the class i want to cut. you know just to study a little more beforehand because if i go to class i may forget some material that i need for the test in next class.
It most certainly can.  I drank nearly a 2-liter bottle of water a day and lost about 30 lbs in 2 months.  Of course it helps to diet (and exercise) but water nearly does the trick.  But careful, it will also flush your system and increase your appetite.
that blue gel stuff is full of chemicals, that's maybe why you feel more pain when you're wearing that one.  It's not toxic shock, just a reaction from nasty toxic stuff (also found in disposable diapers).

"The good fats are Monounsaturated Fats  and Polyunsaturated Fats. Monounsaturated fats lower total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (the bad cholesterol) and increase the HDL cholesterol (the good cholesterol). Nut, canola and olive oils are high in monounsaturated fats. Polyunsaturated fats also lower total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Seafood like salmon and fish oil, as well as corn, soy, safflower and sunflower oils are high in polyunsaturated fats. Omega 3 fatty acids belong to this group.\n\nThe bad fats are Saturated Fats and Trans Fats.\n\nSaturated fats raise total blood cholesterol as well as LDL cholesterol (the bad cholesterol). Saturated fats are mainly found in animal products such as meat, dairy, eggs and seafood. Some plant foods are also high in saturated fats such as coconut oil, palm oil and palm kernel oil.\n\nTrans fats are invented as scientists began to ""hydrogenate"" liquid oils so that they can withstand better in food production process and provide a better shelf life. As a result of hydrogenation, trans fatty acids are formed. Trans fatty acids are found in many commercially packaged foods, commercially fried food such as French Fries from some fast food chains, other packaged snacks such as microwaved popcorn as well as in vegetable shortening and hard stick margarine."
Dry skin\nDry skin is common; as skin loses moisture the surface cracks. \n\nThe inherited forms of dry skin are known as ‘ichthyosis’ (fish-scale skin). There are various kinds of ichthyosis. Dermatologists often call dry skin arising in later life ‘xerosis’, ‘asteatosis’ or ‘acquired ichthyosis’. \n\nThe dry areas may result in dermatitis, i.e. the skin becomes red and itchy. This may result in a crazy-paving appearance on the lower legs (‘eczema craquelé’), or round patches scattered over the trunk and limbs (a dry form of nummular dermatitis). Sometimes the dry skin is just itchy, without much of a rash (sometimes known as ‘winter itch’, ‘7th age itch’, or ‘senile pruritus’). \n\n \nIchthyosis   \nClose-up of ichthyosis   \nDermatitis from dry skin  \n\nCauses of dry skin\nFactors which contribute to dry and cracked skin include: \n\nInherited factors \nMetabolic factors such as an underactive thyroid gland, or excessive weight loss. \nIncreasing age, resulting in decreased natural lubrication. \nCool weather, especially when windy or the humidity is low. \nAir conditioning, central heating or sitting close to a fire or fan heater. \nExcessive bathing, showering or swimming, especially in strongly chlorinated hot or cold water. \nContact with soap, detergents and solvents. \nFrictional irritation and chapping. \nTreatment of dry skin\nAn important aspect of treatment is to identify and tackle any contributing factors (see the list of causes above). \n\nReduce how often you bath or shower, and use lukewarm water. Showers may be better than baths. \nReplace standard soap with a substitute such as a synthetic detergent cleanser, water-miscible emollient, bath oil, anti-pruritic tar oil, etc. \nApply an emollient liberally and often, particularly after bathing, and when itchy. The drier the skin, the thicker this should be, especially on the hands. \nTreat eczematous patches with a topical steroid for a 5 to 15 day course. These are prescribed by your doctor and should be only applied to the red and itchy areas. \nLong term control\nDry skin is usually a long term and recurring problem, especially in winter. When you notice your skin getting dry, resume your lubricating routine and use a non-soap cleanser. If the itchy dry-skin rash returns, use both the lubricating routine and the prescription steroid cream or ointment. \n\nso now u can work out what u got...so is the treatment...\n\nis it usfull...if not pls contact me..\n\nget well\ngood luck

Typically they are gas pockets that form around those areas, and get stuck. However though, if the pain does not go away after just a few minutes...and it lingers, or becomes worse...I encourage you to see a physician immediately; especially if it is near the heart area. Also, if you begin to feel like your left arm is numb, tingling or any other pain...also see the doctor.
Without sex you are not pregnant, but please consult your school nurse re discharge --it could be a period.  Be well.
As guys age, color changes from pale pearly opalescent white to yellowish.   Not to worry.   this is universal.
I'd say yes, everything sounds normal. You sound a little young. When you're younger, you're period will be irregular, and could be on an off schedule until you're around 20 or so, then it should be the same every month. I'm still kinda young and sometimes I'll go for 2 months w/out my period and beleive me it scares the crap outa me. My doctor said not to worry about it, and that sometimes your period will only last 2-3 days whereas other times it'll be like 8-9 days! Or atleast untill your period regulates. It's a slim chance you're pregnant, very very, so I wouldn't worry about that. As far as your breasts hurting, well mine get reallly tender right before my period, so that may be happening to you, which would be good meaning you're not pregnant! Just to be on the safe side, if I were you I'd take a pregnancy test a week after you were supposed to get your period (or a week after you do). Good luck and try not to be such a nervous wreck, enjoy yourself!
You didnt do your cholesterol levels any favours!  That 500 odd calories is mainly fat calories, it is also high in salt (not good for the blood pressure!).  Try something a mite healthier after the gym!!! :D

The pill is a safer form of birth control than the shot for women who would one day like to conceive.

Just relax, the technology they have these days really makes it almost painless. I had to have oral surgery because my wisdom's were pushing my teeth inward. I was in the army and they had no oral surgeon. So they just pumped me up with whatever they used, (Novocain?) and with a laser broke the wisdom's and pulled the pieces out. Sounds primitive but I didn't feel a thing. It took two trips, one week apart. It will be ok, just pray the Good Lord guides the hands of the dentist and everything will be smooth sailing.

Not in this household, and it would be better by far to purchase some commercial lube. Glycerin will produce a burning sensation, and honey, by providing glucose to feed the candida yeast organism that is naturally present on humans, may cause a person to develop a yeast infection.  Honey is also sticky, not slippery, so it would be counterproductive in other ways.

"When you starve yourself your body goes into ""starvation"" mode, and it does hang on to the fat. But starving yourself is quite relative.\nAnorexics don't just starve...they exercise, purge, throw up, etc. Overweight people usually have a very hard time losing weight. Anorexics are USUALLY not overweight to begin with...they just ""see"" themselves that way."
I would sure think so.  As a general rule, metabolism slows down as you age...
it depends on the reason for having the preterm birth. was it something herditary? was it something you done (by accident) such as lifting something, sitting for long periods etc.? was it due to an incompetent cervix? anyway if it is a medical reason why your baby was born early you and you want to get to pregnant again you need to start seeing you OB now. there are things that can be done to prevent  this on future pregnancies.

Hi, I am now 26 but a few years back. I had my gallbladder removed because ultrasound tests and endoscopies showed stones. My symptoms included heartburn and pain on the right side of me just under my ribcage. Then pain even went all the way through my back(with the pain lasting several hours). I had nausea, and vomited a lot also. Avoid alot of fatty and spicy foods. Once you have you ultrasound ask about and upper endoscopy. This test is very uncomfortable. Although they give you medication that relaxs you and you may even fall asleep. That didnt work for me, I was awake during the first part of the procedure which is the insertion of the tube. That test is well worth it. Along with gallstones, I had polyps in my stomach as well. I now have to have the endoscopy yearly but the biopsy came back abnormal. It was later removed with another endoscopy. Don't be afraid and be persistant. I have been symptom free for a few years now and the procedure worked out great for me. There are some drawbacks to having your gallbladder removed. such as frequent and loose bowel movements that can take up to a year to improve. Google, Gallbladder, gallstones, and endoscopy. You will definitely find what you need to know.

Hi Sentaka\n\nHere are some ideas on how to heal your condition.\n\nCause: \nAsthma is caused by malnutrition. Only by diligent and consistent effort to change embedded habits will one get permanent relief. The cough is a result of nature's effort to expectorate mucus from the lungs, after which breathing becomes easier. Ofttimes the cause of asthma is basically a nervous condition because the nerves are irritated \n\nHerbal Aids: \n1. Convulsions: When a person is in a convulsion there are certain herbs that will give very fast relief. One of these is tincture of lobelia, and a valerian decoction with a little cayenne added to relieve spasms. If such an attack comes after a meal one should use an emetic, such as a large dose of lobelia or use the Yoga finger method. (see # 2 below) \n\n2. Yoga Finger Method: Drink several cups of warm water, then place the middle finger deep down the throat and press the tongue until regurgitation starts. Mustard is also good to clean the stomach and lungs. Prior to the emetic a peppermint or spearmint tea should be used to soothe the area and alleviate the discomfort of continual vomiting. Hot fomentation of castor oil, comfrey, lobelia, mullein, etc., may be placed over the stomach, liver, spleen and lung areas. Frequent hydrotherapy baths or lengthy sweat baths are beneficial, followed by a cold shower or sponging. \n\n3. Vapor Bath: Another helpful method is to take a vapor bath twice a week, inhaling steam from a decoction of cudweed ragwort, wormwood, or a decoction of the following herbs, taken warm, (equal parts) will prove very beneficial: elecampane root, horehounds, hyssop, skunk cabbage root, vervain, wild cherry bark (and to this preparation add tincture of lobelia or antispasmodic tincture. Clear the bowels with an injection of catnip or barberry bark. This affliction also calls for plenty of outdoor exercise, deep breathing, and good ventilation while sleeping. The whole body system should be built up with tonic herbs such as chickweed, comfrey, marshmallow, mullein, etc. Diet should be mostly fruits and vegetables, avoiding all processed devitalized foods. \n\n4. Dr. Christopher's Herbal Respiratory Formula: (Resp-Free) It is wonderful for asthma. This combination of herbs in tablet, tea and capsule form is an aid to relieve irritation in the respiratory tract--lungs and bronchial. This is an aid in Emphysema as well as other bronchial and lung congestion such as bronchitis, asthma, tuberculosis, etc. Suggested amount for an adult is a cup two or three times a day, or 2 or 3 capsules or tablets two or three times a day with a cup of comfrey tea. For additional help in the program, it is good to add three to six drops of tincture of lobelia to each cup of tea. This formula consists of comfrey root, mullein, chickweed, marshmallow root and lobelia. \n\n5. Dr. Christopher's Hay Fever Formula: (Sha Tea) It is good for asthma also. This combination is a natural herbal aid working as a decongestant and antihistamine to dry up sinuses and expel from the head and broncho pulmonary tubes and passages the offending stoppage and mucus. Combine this with the respiratory combination to speed up the process. The wise person will turn to fresh wholesome food and beverages to keep the body in a perfect state. This will guarantee permanent relief, by going to the cause. \n\n6. Elder: The inner bark is used, although it should be aged before used. The fresh bark is violently irritating and poisonous to children. It is specifically used for spasmodic asthma with copious phlegm and stringy mucus. For asthma, take a tablespoonful whenever an attack threatens. Powdered Cloves can alleviate excessive vomiting when using the bark. To avoid bowel cramps, add a tablespoonful of powdered Ginger to the infusion. (ShoA:58). \n\n7 Lobelia: Most people agree that Lobelia is a specific treatment for asthma, as well as other bronchial or spasmodic troubles. Because the herb removes obstructions, g

Well, bracelets wouldn't work too well anyway as they are made to wear on your arm or ankle. Braces on the other hand are probably the best option. Contact an orthodontist and go in for a consultation. You should be able to find one thats has the first consultation free. He will examine your teeth then tell you what he would need to do, how much it will cost, etc.

"I work with MDs and have had the same problem in the past.  The orthopedic surgeon I work with as well as one of the general surgeons told me that plantar warts need air, and occasional light as well as moisture to ""grow"".  They told me to cover them with a piece of duct tape and keep them covered so they get no light or air and if it comes off in the shower to replace it as soon as you get out.  I tried it and it worked for me, just takes a while."
LOL thanks for that great post my friend.  I needed that good belly laugh early this morning.
This could be symptoms of irritation, which could certainly be brought on or aggravated by sex. You should lubricate, minimize friction to the extent possible, and stop carefully examining or rubbing the affected areas. If you are worried, please show your penis to a doctor.

(m)\n\nCushing's syndrome or hypercortisolism or hyperadrenocorticism is an endocrine disorder caused by excessive levels of the endogenous corticosteroid hormone cortisol. It may also be induced iatrogenically by treatment with exogenous corticosteroids for other medical conditions. It was discovered by American physician, surgeon and endocrinologist Harvey Cushing (1869-1939) and reported by him in 1932.\n\nCushing's syndrome is also a relatively common condition in domestic dogs in which causes are the same as the syndrome in humans.
Colonics are a safe and efficient way to clean the colon.  Look in the phone book or check  natural health centers in your area.  They cost $50-$60 but are well worth it.  Colon cleansing with herbs is less efficient and best done with a short fast on water or juice.  More info can be found at rawfoods.com or livingfoods.com  Good luck on this important step to improving your health.
How old are you? Well, you're asking. If a woman wants to preform oral sex on a man it makes it a little more pleasant than without it, safer also but, condoms, break and tear as well as come off. So, they are not 100% safe. No form of birth control or safe sex is 100%. They all faio from 6-15% and that's a big chance. I knowI wouldn\nt take it. I'd need a clean bill of health for 6 mos. then another one for 6 mos. then, just maybe, if I knew he was around me and no one else during that time.I'm just too scared to be used and themn die or be sick for one night of fun. doesn't seem worth it to me. He'll either love me enough to stick it our for that time or he'll go down the road.

It's very likely although mostly, you'd just feel ill and stop eating (if you were smart, hopefully). In extreme cases, if you kept eating or were being forced to keep eating, it's also possible that your stomach could rupture or that your asophagus could swell up from the strain its being put on. Either way, its not a pretty picture. I don't know if you've ever seen the movie SE7EN but.. yea. It's gross.

They can only if you're under 18 and your parents want you to go. If you are under 18 it's worth a try to tell your doctor that you don't want them to tell your parents. Sometimes they will comply. But in all sincerity, as a recovering anorexic, I would say that being thin in not worth the heath consequenses. My friend who is a recovering bulimirexic almost died of pnemonia becuse her body could no fight off the infection.
You said that you're bored and unmotivated with your life, so possibly it's a mild case of depression...?  If you think that may be the case, you should consult your physician.\n\nIf you don't think you're dealing with depression, making the following changes might help you feel more awake:\n\n1) Don't take a nap in the late afternoon or evening (probably not past about 3 PM); If you absolutely need to nap, limit it to a simple power nap of about 20 minutes.\n\n2) If you drink a lot of caffeine, cut back (or maybe even stop drinking it all together).\n\n3) Work out harder and for a longer period of time (and finish at least 2-3 hours before your bed time).  It will probably help you fall asleep and stay asleep better.\n\n4) Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.\n\n5) If you're waking up throughout the night or not feeling rested after 7-8 hours of straight sleep, you might want to think about replacing your mattress.  (This one was the one that helped me start sleeping better and feeling less tired).\n\n6) Expose yourself to more natural light.  Physiologically speaking, your internal (circadian) clock should respond to the difference in light throughout the day, making you more sleepy the darker it becomes and more awake the lighter it becomes.\n\n7) Create a sleep-time ritual for yourself.  The last half hour or hour before you want to go to sleep, make your space more quiet, warm, and inviting.  Cut out as many distractions as possible in that time frame -- turn off the TV or stereo and turn off unnecessary lights.  Slip into comfy PJ's.  This way, your body will begin to recognize when it is time to go into a sleep mode.\n\n8) Don't use a snooze button on your alarm.  You won't get any restful sleep if you wake yourself up every 10 minutes with a loud buzz.\n\n9) Don't eat within 2 hours of your bed time.  If you get the munchies in that timeframe, make yourself something like a hot glass of tea with a lemon wedge instead.\n\n10) In addition to eating a healthy diet, take a daily multi-vitamin to ensure that you're body is getting the nutrients it needs.\n\nIf these don't help, talk to a doctor -- s/he would be able to run tests to detect if you have an underlying problem causing the sleepiness.\n\nGood luck!
Is that the thing that the doctor on Oprah's show last week?\nThe blubbery thing in front of the stomach?\nI hope your okay, let us know.
I went through that a couple years ago, and I feel your pain! No one understands how much that really does hurt!! Mine was like I had sat on a sword, sharp side up!!\n\nI had ovarian cysts, and other cysts on misc. female organs, and I also had endo (endometriosis--which in basic terms is scar tissue on your femaile organ/s) caused by it growing in the wrong place. First the docs put me through a year of different birth control pills and the patch, then I had a laperoscomy done (which proved their was the endo), and a few months after that I ended up having a partial hysterectomy. The doc took my cervix and uterus, leaving my tubes and ovaries, because they didn't have much endo on them at the time).  I still get cysts on my ovaries though, and it's definately painful--just not as bad as before my surgery. Below are two links, the first is about ovarian cysts, and the second is about endo. Both of good links that can get you more information (instead of putting it all down here and you have to skim through to find what you want, I thought the websites can lead you in the direction you want to go, not where I think you want to go...lol\nGood luck! Hope you feel better soon! \n\n(hot water bottles on my abdomen or a fresh towel out of the dryer always helped my pain)

Gargle with salt water as warm as you can stand it.  If it doesn't clear up after a few days, go see a Dr. because it could be strep throat (which can spread to the heart if you let it go long enough).

Yo-yo dieting is very, very bad for you.  Like it was said above, it will slow down your metabolism.  When you starve yourself, your body begins to break down what energy stores it has to say alive.  Most people think that it is just eating up the stored fat they have and that is why they are losing weight.  THAT IS NOT TRUE!  \n\nThese trendy diets are all cleverly schemed ways to reduce your calorie intake and what usually happens is that you get so sick of their food that you quit eating all together.  This is NOT good.  \n\nWhen you starve yourself, your body breaks down the amino acids in your muscle and converts them into the compounds its needs to use glucose as energy.  So, you begin to loose weight and you think the diet is working.  But the diet is actually killing you.  Have you ever found that when you lose that weight your are urinating a lot?  That is because your body is getting rid of the Nitrogen that is found in the muscle's amino acids it is breaking down.  So your weight is going down, but you aren't losing any fat or getting much smaller.  Also, muscle tissue is what drives your metabolism, so if you lose your muscle tissue you are also losing your metabolism.  Remember, muscle weighs more than fat.\n\nThe only way to lose weight and not kill yourself is to cut your calories and increase your exercise.  Do something you like to do.  Run, walk, ride a bike, etc.  Eat healthy.  \n\nHow to figure out how many calories you need to eat a day:\n\n1- Take your weight and divide it by (2.2).  This will give you your weight in kg.  Then if you are a girl times it by 22 (guys multiply by 24).  This is how many calories your body needs to stay alive (breathing, your heart rate, etc).  Now I am guessing that you are a pretty sedentary person.  So multiply that number by 1.3.  This will give you how many calories you need to stay alive and move around every day.  Now take that number and multiply it by 7.  This will tell you how many calories you need in a week.  Now you can figure out how many calories you need to cut back to lose weight.  \n\n2- You should not lose more than 2 lbs per week.  If you are losing more than 2 lbs per week, you are probably losing muscle tissue and therefore actually slowing down your metabolism, not helping it.  \n\nYou need to eat 3500 calories less than you need to lose 1 lb of fat.  So take your total calories needed every week and subtract 3500 from it (7000 if you want to lose 2 lbs). Now divide that number by 7.  This will give you how many calories you should eat per day.  Now, you should NEVER EAT LESS THAN 1200 CALORIES PER DAY! This is just not healthy. \n\nTips to stay on your diet:\n\nEat a variety of foods, just watch your calories.  This way you do not get sick of the diet.  Plan your meals with a variety of LOW-CALORIE food.\n\nMake a shopping list, don't shop on an empty diet.\n\nAvoid alcohol.  Alcohol is high in calories and low in nutrition.\n\nOnly weigh yourself once a week, in the morning.  This way you are not freaking out the next morning when you haven't lost 5 lbs.\n\nKeep a daily record of what, where and how much you eat.\n\nAvoid midnight snacking like the plague.  You will still be alive in the morning.\n\nEat slowly.  It takes your body 20 minutes to realize it is full. One way to do this is to put down your fork in between bites.\n\nOnly eat in one room of the house.  That way your body is not conditioned to eat in the living room, bedroom, etc.  You will only get hungry when you go into the kitchen. \n\nPut your dinner on smaller plates so it will look like more food, and when you finish put your plate away so you are not tempted for seconds.  \n\nEat regularly, in the same place (nowhere else), and smaller meals.  This is so your body uses all the energy you put into and doesn't store any as fat.\n\nGood Luck!

some cancers, such as prostate cancer, have a marker in bloodwork.  many cancers are not found from simple bloodwork, but from an elevation in certain blood count levels.  That tells the doctor's what organs are working or not working.  This doesn't mean cancer, just that a system is off.  To be sure of cancer, there must be a PET,CT,MRI or biopsy of the suspected organ.
heres a very good article on this disorder, hope you get better soon, good luck
"Numerous females on ""the Pill"" have these symptoms and it is just a matter of determining what hormone works for your body chemistry. It is a rather common side effect of many birth control products and the physician may instruct you to stay on them for a little longer  so that the hormone levels may equalize or even may prescribe a different contraceptive. This is definitely a mal-effect  of the pill your using and you should seek for an alternate method to prevent unwanted pregnancies other than your current method.  \n\ngood luck"
Do not starve yourself for a guy!!  If this guy likes you he will take you as is.  If he demands for you to be super skinny and you're not, then you will be fighting this your whole entire life if you marry him.  Is this what you really want???
I would recommend that you find a different allergist.  Hives are an allergic reaction, just because your allergist can't find it, doesn't make it not so.
Call dentists and ask to fax then a short interview question sheet.  Ask them questions about the product, their experiences, preferences, etc.\n\nThe reason Captek is so great is becase it uses gold under porcelain instead of a metal alloy.  \n\nTeeth appear to be a certain color because of many things.  Some light reflects off of the outer layer of the tooth (enamal in natural or porcelian in a restorative crown).  Some light goes into the tooth and bounces back off the dentin or metal under the outer layer.  Some light goes all the way through the tooth (in a natural or all porcelian crown only!).  \n\nIn a metal substructure, the light that hits the metal and bounces back gives a dark gray tint to the tooth.  In capteck, the gold gives it a yellowish tint which is more normal for teeth.\n\nAny crown can match the srounding teeth if enough time and talent is used in selecting the colors.  Just like mixing paint, a little tint can change the entire color of the final product.  The dental team must select the correct outer porcelian color that will result in the correct tint after the light from the substructure has reflected through it.  If the outer color matches exactly, then the final product will not because of the substructure.  Also, the color and type of light makes a huge difference.  Floresent lights makes the colors look different.  Special bulbs called daylight lights should be used during color selection - or natural sunlight!\n\nThere are many reasurch companies who are similiar to comsumer reports.  Call your local dental supplier:  Sullivan Schein, Burkhart dental supply, patterson, JB dental, or a dental labratory.    Ask them for articles and studies on those products.

Chuck them.
Yes, and more.  By crash dieting (using the definition of extreme caloric restrition) you have convinced your body that it needs to store any energy it consumes rather than use it to power the body.  In other words, you have told it to get fat.  \nThat is why eating 6 small meals a day is the best for losing weight.  As an example, if you are a normal healthy adult female you need about 1200 cals a day on average to power your body.  So eat 6 small meals of 200 cals each (good cals, NOT candy bars!) with protien, dairy, fruits and nuts being your focus and you will lose weight (providing you burn 1200 cals!) because your body will see that you have enough food to survive and it does not need to store the energy rather than conserve it.
Death is pretty long term.
The surgery will have caused inflammation in the soft tissues (internal bruising).  If the wound is very sore and inflammed you may have an infection - Is it oozing? If you are concerned it may be worth visiting your GP.  Good Luck
Sounds like you have hyperpigmentation, a condition that causes your skin to darken drastically after any type of trauma (pimple or a cut). I have it too. Find a product with hydroquinone; it will fade spots over time with continued use. I use Palmer's Eventone Fade Cream. They also have a cleanser in that same line of products. \nLook at the link below for their full line.
The only relationship between periods and virginity is that women usually don't lose their virginity until after they have gone through puberty.  Going through puberty involves a number of things including young ladies starting their periods and raging hormones.  You may have mood swings from time to time because of your changing hormones.  Some of the hormones may make you more attracted to the opposite sex.  Just remember once you lose your virginity you can't get it back.   If a guy has a problem with you saying no, let it be his problem and his loss.  You are worth waiting for Ash!  Trust me!  It is normal for you to have pains in your abdomen and breasts either before or while you are menstrating.  It is also normal for you to be bloated and for your breasts to swell at that time.  There are also a varitey of other symptoms that you may also have.  Symptoms vary for each individual woman.  If you have these sympoms now you will  most likely have them the rest of your life unless you takle some form of birth control.  Many women take birth control to regulate their periods and reduce symptoms and not because they are sexually active.  Taking the pill will regulate you period and reduce the pain involved with it.  Some women who take the shot don't have periods at all.  Each woman reacts differently to these hormones.  When I was on the shot I only had one period every three months and I only spotted.  You can talk to your parents and your doctor about these options.  If you would rather not choose one of these options there are very many over-the-counter options available.  Midol is the most popular.  My choice is Ibuprofen because it also reduces swelling not just the pain.  Sometimes when people have a problem with pain it is caused from swelling.  Caffine can also help with your symptoms (if you take Midol they have caffine in them).  Heating pads applied to your abdomen can also give you immediate relief.
yes, and in fact  a low carb diet  along  with\n20 to 30 min of  Cardio  a day  is  Most beneficial for ones heart.\nAlso, if you choose to drink,  a glass of red wine is good for the heart as well. Statistics prove this. If one is an alcoholic, stay away from all alcohol.\nAlso one cup of coffee or tea  a day is excellent for the heart also, as is a piece of chocolate. (It is the caffeine).\n\nR.N.  -  with  Masters  Degree.

I have been a pump user since 1995 and have used all the above.  I favor the silhouette infusion set personally because it lies more flush against the skin and doesn't catch and possibly snag on clothing like the quick release.  Also, I don't particularly care for the use of poly-skin dressing as it tends to irritate the skin.  The silhouette can be quickly released, leaving only the infusion set flush against the skin surface and they come with stopper clips for bathing, but aren't really necessary.  I would cleanse it with an alcohol swab anyway for sterilization though.\nBest of luck and I hope your choice works best for you...it's really a matter of personal preference really.\nBTW, you may find more information on these items at www.minimed.com   Also, the new 722 is awesome as it has a bolus wizard and is compatible with the Guardian Real Time continuous glucose monitor. It communicates glucose readings directly with your pump and alarms when your glucose levels are too high or too low.  There is good information on this at the mini med website.  Again, much luck to you...live long and live healthy.

If you have razor burn, then your skin is too sensitive to shave. And as for waxing, just imagine what your skin will look like after all the hairs are yanked out by the roots! EEEwwwwww!

My doctor now thinks this may be a reason WHY I can't gain weight.  If you have something wrong with your gastrointestinal tract, it may be a cause.\n\nMy doctors haven't really ever told me a way to gain weight - the only thing they've said is to go on a ""high calorie diet"" - basically just eat, eat, eat (healthy stuff of course, not junk food completely).\n\nI've gained weight doing that...not a whole lot and it takes a LONG time - so have patience; it might not happen in even a year.\n\nGood luck!"

It could be right next door to you but you'd have to get there. All health clubs are basically crowded when you want to go. If you have a 9 to 5 job and want to get in a quick half hour fat burn or heat rate exercise in then your missing out on all of what a club has to offer. I've been with Bally's total fitness since 1981 and I go just about the time when people are having lunch. Its a different feel when you dont have to wait for a stepper or a stationary bike. I can get more done with less wait time. More often then not a club will promote something just to get new members, I've no clue on what a MAP test is or what it might be used for....but if its an extra cost then the price of your membership just went up... Leave the testing to your doctor and focus on staying in good health with a weekly workout schedule...\nGood Luck...

she ment eating food which have a low amount of calories and they burn more calories to digest the food. no i haven't been on the diet but i've heard that if you have one snack a day on a portion of a neg cal food you can lose quite alot of weight especially if you team it up wit healthy eating and excersise
the only way would be to quit working out those muscles and let it run back into fat
Maybe you could try this herbs called 'Manjakani', it helps the excessive discharge as well as remove the unpleasant odor from your intimate area.

If you are serious about losing weight, the calories\nin the food you eat should be less than the\nenergy you use.

I found a chap stick that I reallly like. It's Aveno brand. I don't know what its called, but its in a white and blue tube. Price is decent too, I think it was $3. I don't like using Vaseline. I feel like I need to reapply it all the time. This stuff isn't like that.

Colitis is a digestive disease characterized by inflammation of the colon.                           Signs and symptoms of colitis includes pain, tenderness in the abdomen, fever, swelling of the colon tissue, bleeding of the surface of the colon, rectal bleeding and ulceration of the colon. To make proper diagnosis the tests include x-ray, stool culture, colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy. Perhaps blood test.\nThere are several types of colitis including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's colitis, diversion colitis, infectious colitis, atypical colitis etc. Many patients suffer severe pain, diarrhea and fever. A number of the patients require surgery.\nTreatment usually involves antibiotics, general anti-inflammatory medications, steroids, other drugs or surgery. Reducing carbohydrates, lactose products, soft drinks and caffeine is also beneficial.
Airborne works for me. It is a tablet dissolved in water. It helps me but does not help other people I have recommended. I guess you body will tell you. Go get it!
Hemiplegia is motor weakness on one side of the body, and Hemiparetic tremors are the uncontrollable shaking affecting the limbs on one side of the body. The third part of your question is incomplete, but I'm going to take a guess that the word may be Hemianopia?  This is defective vision or blindness that impairs the normal field of vision of one eye.  All three terms are associated with Cerebral Palsy.

Interesting experiment.  The visual effects are not in the eyes, they are in the mind.  That would be impossible to predict.  Then you have the side effect issue of LSD to worry about.
i smoked for 40 yrs. then my husband developed a neurological disease. i realized if i wanted to be around to help him out i would have to stop. boy it wasn't easy but this time i had to quit. if i got sick the both of us would be in a fix.\ni drank water to keep flushing my system and help maintain my weight-  chewed on carrot sticks and celery stalks to satisfy the need to hold something in my hand and also to prevent weight gain\nit is still hard when i have that cup of coffee but i have to say it has been 2 years  and i haven't gone back (it took me six months to completely quit without cheating)\ni still drink at least 8 glasses of water a day and to my surprise i also lost 40 pounds without dieting- and have kept it off\nif you get stressed do something  you enjoy to keep your mind and hands busy- take a brisk walk\ndon't think about smoking- that is what is stressing you\nwhen i wanted to quit my doctor wanted me to try the patch but i didn't want to substitute one crutch for another\nhe also wanted to put me on wellbutrin but that really turned me off\ni said if i am going to do this i am going to do it right\nif i can you can \nI BELIEVE IN YOU\nBELIEVE YOU CAN\ngood luck
There are a lot of possible reasons why you are feeling this pain. It could be arthritis (osteoarthritis), a patella problem (patella is your knee cap), or a problem on the knee bones (distal femur and proximal tibia). I can see that you are a runner. This means that you put a lot of stress on your knees. If there is no trauma or you do not recall hitting your knee, then I can assume that it is osteoarthritis. Contrary to what others believe that osteoarthritis is for old people, it could also happen to young people. What I can suggest is for you to put a hot compress on the affected area. Stretch before running and most importantly, strengthen your leg muscles. This is important because the muscles help absorb the stress on the knee bones. You can do lunges or partial squats. Note that I put PARTIAL because if you do in fact have an arthritis, you should avoid bending your knees more than 45 degrees. If, on the other hand you recall hitting your knees, it may be your ligaments or the patella that is affected. That will need xray or MRI. Good luck with your knee problem!
If it's confirmed that this is a pulled muscle, go out quickly and buy a tube of arnica gel, preferably A.Vogel or Roberts. These are the ones available at health shops and better chemists. I don't find the Weleda so effective. \n\nAs you rub it in to the pulled muscle the skin feels very cold and within five minutes there is quite a dramatic reduction of pain. Keep massaging it in a few times a day and the pain will go quicker than if arnica not used. Arnica gel is used by physios on sports injuries to muscles.
My DR. said never put Vaseline in your nose. I get very dry sinuses. Which could lead to very bad nose bleeds. So he told me to use KY Jelly. I buy a generic version of it and it works better than Vaseline any day. Neosporin I don't know about.
Often a wam compress applied to the ear that hurts helps. I have read that putting a hair dryer on low and gently letting some warm air blow in the ear helps. Warmth seems to revieve ear ache pain.

I don't have a particular feeling about prostitutes, either positive or negative.\n\nI do have fairly strong feelings about men who have such a sense of entitlement that, when denied sex by women, feel the need to criticize and try to degrade them.\n\nEverybody likes to have sex, regardless of gender.  It is one of our most primordial instincts.  Women have many more negative consequences to their sexuality than men do, and they react to this by limiting their sexual contacts more than men.  \n\nYou are not entitled to have sex with any woman you desire.  It's not artificial scarcity... it's that you personally are unappealing.  Sorry:(
Just stay on a normal diet. SEE YOUR DOCTOR is extremely important. Ask for a special diet, try sweet fruit and vegys. do\nsomething different, like exercise, a cool plain ice tea, diet jello......keep in mind its really up to you. Take responsibility. Don't be a wimp.  Maybe a hot tea, honey and a little boooze. Take care.

TV is not the cause of headaches but flickering images on the screen might cause problems with migrane and epileptic sufferers. A headache for a week is not a long time and certainly not to overly worry about. People at times do get headaches it is a normal part of life.\nMany things can cause a headache such as chemical sensitivity such as cleaners and decorating; Eye strain, viruses, tiredness, dehydration, stress, noise.
check with the doctor just incase, it could be just a tomato thing but it could also be something much more serious and just to ease your mind so you do not believe you are bleeding from different parts of your body everytime you ache (trust me, it is happened to me and I get all paranoid!).  A word to the wise :You can never be too cautious when it comes to the weird things in your stool ;-)
Many women go rigid when they orgasm. Others go limp, and others don't really do either. It's all relative, and dependent on the intensity of the orgasm. There doesn't seem to be anything worrisome about your paritcular orgasm experiences.\n\nIn fact, it sounds like your orgasms are worth envying. Kudos, and happy star-gazing!
You never mentioned what your symptoms were. The only reason I can think of your getting the shot would be for vomitting ( it will dehydrate you), and it was a shot of finegrin. It numbs an upset stomach to calm the nasea. Also, if you were dizzy and dehydrated, a doctor will administer the same for precaution to keep you from vomiting. How much you drink does not mean that's how much your body would retain. As far as his tone and the words he chose, there he was wrong. The rest he was probably correct. If you were dehydrated too much he would have put you on an IV. My opinion is that the shot was a precaution to save you the burden of an IV.

"Many patients travel from United States of America and UK to get low cost of Adjustable Laparoscopic Gastric Banding Weight Loss in India. One of the most frequently asked questions when considering Adjustable Laparoscopic Gastric Banding Weight Loss surgery is ""how much?"" and “what is the price of surgery in India?”\n\nOftentimes, patients choose their surgeon on the basis of price. \nThe cost of Adjustable Laparoscopic Gastric Banding Weight Loss is very affordable in India and costs are much lower when compared to the United States, UK and other countries. \n\nHowever, since the success of your surgery is largely dependent on your choice of surgeon, cost should not be your main consideration for your decision to undergo Adjustable Laparoscopic Gastric Banding Weight Loss in India.\n\nI checked out the website of Forerunners Healthcare –which is the premier most medical tourism company in India offering low cost surgery in India to International Patients. They have served more than 400 International patients from across the globe (specially US and UK) to get low cost affordable surgery in India at the best Hospitals and Medical Institutions. And the general price of the Adjustable Laparoscopic Gastric Banding Weight Loss surgery is as follows-\n\nThe Cost of Adjustable Laparoscopic Gastric Banding Weight Loss in India is $ 5,500.\n\nhttp://www.forerunnershealthcare.com\n\nIn India, any licensed medical doctor can perform Adjustable Laparoscopic Gastric Banding Weight Loss surgery. To avoid unsatisfactory results, it is best to choose a surgeon who has completed an accredited residency-training program in Adjustable Laparoscopic Gastric Banding Weight Loss surgery. He should have extensive experience in the procedure you will undergo. That’s when Forerunners Healthcare come into picture-helping you get the best surgeon for your surgery at the most affordable prices in the best Hospitals of India.\n\nYour surgeon's skill can make all the difference between a good and an average result. Thus, although it is understandable that price is one of the considerations in your choice of surgeon, it is important to remember that the main consideration should be your surgeon's professional qualifications and experience.\n\nBesides that you should look into other issues related to traveling abroad, which is your visa, passport, climate, cultural issues and language barrier. Although language is not a problem in India –as most of the people are well verse in English. But you should make sure that you have a reliable hand holding person to guide you through the various steps of getting medical treatment and surgery in India.\n\n\nHope this helps."

I look too youug for my age You're lucky to look older I go to the liquor store and they look at me like i'm 19 when i'm 27! So theres a plus and a minus to showing age!
I used to be like that.  I thought I was the ugliest thing on this earth and had been put here as some kind of experiment.  I hated walking outside and would go into crowded rooms with my head down and blushing.  I used to think that people were staring at me because I was so ugly.  When someone stared and smiled, I thought they were laughing at me.  I eventually came to realise that I was actually very pretty and people were staring because of that.  I know where my thoughts came from ... remarks made to me as a child by my father.  Can you think back to any time in your childhood when remarks were made to you that might make you think like that?  Remarks made to impressionable children can unfortunately sometimes have very long-lasting effects.  You need to get to the bottom of it and you will be so relieved when you're finally convinced that you're not an ugly duckling after all .. I know I sure as hell was!  :)  Start by looking in the mirror at least once a day and telling yourself 'I love you, you are a wonderful, beautfiul person'.  \n\nhttp://www.freewebs.com/spiritualhealing

Time for a new doctor???
You have to go see a doctor. No-one can help you on this list. We're all just guessing what might be wrong, and in any case we can't prescribe a cream or course of treatment - you have to see a doctor. It's unlikely you will be able to use anything you can just buy in a drug store.\n\nDoctors have seen all kinds of things in their seven years of training, and then every day since then. Believe me, they won't care what you've been doing, they are not going to criticise you, and you need to get this taken care of professionally.
That truely sounds like a question that you should be answering your doctor. I don't think you can, but its always better to take precautions just in case. I know a guy that was 98% sterile and he still got his girlfriend pregnant.
You should probably talk to a doctor for real advice but i'll tell you what i think know. A friend of mine has a similar problem, and she was also told that she may find it hard to concieve, her periods can be very erratic and heavy and painful. Its certainly possible you had a miscarriage but i want reassure you not to worry. I believe about a third of women have a miscarriage at some point, most very early in pregnancy and most women will not even be aware they had had one or were pregnant in the first place. So without being the doctor that examined you, i can't be sure if it was a miscarriage or a heavy period, i'd suspect the later as that is more common than you might think but if you have any doubts i'd recommend you speak to your doctor. x
10 days you been like this go to your doctor\nonly a doctor can give you a trusted diagnosis\ngo on make an appointment :)

"Hi Red Rock\n\nHere are some ideas on how to heal the issue.\n\nCauses\nWarts are caused by any of 35 viruses and are often a consequence of poor diet and nutrition, poor hygiene, and, in the cases of genital warts, unprotected sex. Warts also become more common as a consequence of aging with corresponding diminished immune function.\n\nCaution: Some warts can turn into cancerous tumors. If they do not seem benign, consult with a physician immediately.\n\n\n------------------------------...\n\nNatural Cures\n\nNote: Natural healing of warts may require one to two months of care, with the wart disappearing suddenly in one to three days.\n\nAromatherapy: Lemon essential oil applied topically can speed healing. Thuja oil is also effective for dealing with warts.\n\nDiet: Eat an organic, whole foods diet, emphasizing foods that are high in vitamin A, such as dark green and yellow vegetables, cold-water fish, eggs, and sulfur, such as onions, garlic, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and broccoli. Avoid all refined and processed foods, sugar, unhealthy fats, and excess animal proteins, as well as milk and dairy products.\n\nHerbs: a.Onions for Warts: Warts have been said to disappear when treated perseveringly with raw onion dipped in salt. \n\nb.Wild Lettuce for Warts: The expressed juice is ""much regarded as an application to boils, abscesses and carbuncles, and if put upon warts will cause them to drop off. \n\nc.Garlic for Warts and Moles: Here is a very successful routine for removal of these unwanted growths called moles, or warts. Take a button of garlic, slice or cut in two, and placed the cup area over a wart of mole. Tape it on, and as it dries out put a fresh piece. Many users have reported good results. \n\nd.Cashew Oil: The cashew oil, which must be used with great caution, is used as an application to warts, corns, ringworms, cancerous ulcers. \n\nd.Potassium Deficiency for Warts and Moles: When cysts or tumors grow in places where they can be seen outside the body, often we react by having them cut out. This defeats healing by working on the effect instead of the cause. You can cut cysts out, tumors off, and burn warts off (which are also a potassium deficiency), or get rid of as many moles as you wish, but unless you go to the cause, they will grow back again, and you may end up with as many or more cysts, tumors, moles as before. Different signs of potassium deficiency will keep popping out on the body because the condition that needs correcting is on the inside. You have to go into the cause, Dr. Christopher always insisted, which is the way we have been eating.Potassium sources: There are several ways to receive your potassium. Dr. Bernard Jensen sells a potassium broth made from dehydrated vegetables. Dr. Bronner makes a similar, excellent product. You can also make your own potassium broth by simmering equal parts of red potatoes, celery, carrots, onions, and herbs to taste. Raw vegetable and fruit juices also flood the system with potassium. \n\nBest of health to you"

"<>This is a tricky question.  In my opinion, you should not base this decision on either the fact that your child ""is likely"" to grow out of the asthma or your concerns about any possible growth effects.  It is more important that the child be treated for the asthma, since that is a dangerous respiratory condition.  If nothing is woroking BUT the steroids, then you must use them.  If you have concerns about how effectively her asthma is being treated, then get a second medical opinion- don't deny her treatment.  Find a specialist in pulmonary function, which she should have, anyway."

In a patient with a dry socket, blood does not fill up the extraction socket or the blood clot is lost. The gums can not grow over the extraction socket because there's nothing to grow over and the hole remains open. This opening causes a constant dull throbbing pain and the patient can often have a foul smelling breath and bad taste in the mouth. Ear pain is another possible dry socket symptom.\n\n          It's called a dry socket because the hole, or socket, that the tooth used to fit into becomes dry. It begins hurting about three days after oral surgery. Unfortunately, the pain lasts about a week after it begins. The dental name is acute alveolar osteitis. Acute means all of a sudden. Alveolar is the name of the bone that supports teeth. -itis means inflamed and osteo- means bone. Osteitis means bone inflammation. Acute alveolar osteitis means sudden inflammation of the bone that supports a tooth.\n\n          Dentists don't know exactly what causes a dry socket. It occurs more with lower teeth than upper teeth and more with females than males. The problem occurs more often after difficult extractions. It may be that forceful pushing against the wall of the socket when the tooth is being removed causes the walls of the tooth socket to become crushed. This prevents bleeding into the socket because the blood vessels have been crushed closed. The lack of blood then causes severe pain.\n\n          Anything that dislodges the clot can cause a dry socket. Forceful spitting or sucking though a straw can pull a clot completely out of its socket. Patients should wait a day before rinsing with warm salt water to avoid dissolving the new blood clot. When salt water rinsing, spit gently to avoid pressure. Carbonated beverages should be avoided because they may bubble the clot out. Alcoholic drinks can dry out the blood clot and prevent healing. Avoid smoking for a few days after dental extractions because smoking can disturb clot formation. Patients who have recently had oral surgery should avoid anything that may irritate the socket or anything that may cause the clot from being dislodged. Follow our oral surgery post operative instructions carefully to avoid dry socket treatment.
well i tore my retina when i was in primary school and i had to have lazer surgery - i was almost blind if i hadn't gone to my optomertrist when i did, another 24 hrs and the sight in that eye would have gone.\n\nBut i wasn't able to go to school for weeks and i had to stay lying down for those weeks .. i had to really take it easy so i wouldn't suggest going back to school tomorrow ..
I say the same thing. I really think that it's the hair under there arms or what type of deodorant they where. I think mens deodorant don't have enough of fragrance to hold they odor or they PH balance. Boys seem to sweat alot when they sleep too. So maybe this is a reason why.
I think workplace counselling is an excellent idea as it can reduce sickness levels and makes for a happier work environment. If people have problems in their life which remain unresolved they are unable to give the job a 100%. Counsellors need to be trained to at least certificate level and ideally to diploma level or working towards it. All counsellors have to have access to first rate supervision. Sessions should be planned and generally time limited where possible. Most local authorities have a staff counselling service as to many large companies.

Well, I don't have oily skin but i have acne all over. There are some products out there that are just for oily skin and not that expensive. I bought this Neutrogena stuff [and it was just like Proactiv except cheap!] and it's already working in just about a week. If you are still having oily skin, carry around some of those clearasil pads and wipe your face during breaks and stuff.
Let them work, as long as they are productive they will feelbetter about themselves!!!
I am a dental assistant and someone who had dry socket. It is very painful but your dentist should of given you pain medication. Dry socket is when you have problems clotting in the effected area. The dentist should be putting medication on gauze and putting it in the hole were the tooth was removed. You should do this every couple of days and the dentist should change the dressing and put new ones in your mouth. This will help you heal. When ever you get bottom teeth pulled it hurts more because of the bone. The medication he puts in should give you relief from pain. Do not take aspirin because it thins your blood and you will blood more. Take motrin, or my favorite is advil liquid gels. It works great. Make sure you eat soft foods and not to hot because it will irritate the area. You will feel alot better once you get the medication in the effected area.
Hey man....dont get too nervous. Yes it will prob make noise, but is sex and to tell the truth if sex is pretty sloppy i u understand waht i mean. you put it on when ur good and hard but when ur clothes come off. forplay will start and articles of clothing will come off, when ur britches come off have ur girl put it on. it feels oh sooooo good when someone else puts it on to.

An allergic reaction will not take days period.  It will begin when the body starts to metabolize the food.  Much in the same way food poisoning shows up.  It can range from an hour to several, but not days later.  The food would already be processed & gone from the body in days.  Same thing as contact dermititis.  It's not gonna be delayed days.

I struggled with acne for years and I finally found the solution that works for me. We have been fooled, tricked, deceived, and just plain lied to. It's time that someone put a stop to it, and everyone learn the truth!\n\nThose of us who suffer from acne have usually been given 2 choices and neither of them work:\n\n1. Over the counter remedies such as cleansers, creams, ointments, etc. These things have been proven over and over again not to work. Why? It does not address the root cause of the problem.\n\n2. Go see a doctor and or dermatologist. They will generally prescribe prescription drugs which include topicals and or antibiotics. This, too, has been proven over and over again not to work. Why? It does not address the root cause of the problem.\n\nI found a step-by-step program that cured my acne and it has never come back. It is amazing and doesn’t use any drugs or doctors. The truth is that acne can be cured…if we know the secret the doctors and drug companies don’t want us to know.\n\nThere is a great website: http://cure-my-acne.info/3daycure/  that has all the details. I really suggest you check it out and see if it works as well for you as it did for me.
Rosacea is a common but often misunderstood condition that is estimated to affect over 45 million people worldwide. It affects fair-skinned people of mostly north-western European descent, and has been nicknamed the 'curse of the Celts' by some in Ireland. It begins as erythema (flushing and redness) on the central face and across the cheeks, nose, or forehead but can also less commonly affect the neck and chest. As rosacea progresses, other symptoms can develop such as semi-permanent erythema, telangiectasia (dilation of superficial blood vessels on the face), red domed papules (small bumps) and pustules, red gritty eyes, burning and stinging sensations, and in some advanced cases, a red lobulated nose (rhinophyma). The disorder can be confused and co-exist with acne vulgaris and/or seborrheic dermatitis. Rosacea affects both sexes, but is almost three times more common in women, and has a peak age of onset between 30 and 60. The presence of rash on the scalp or ears suggests a different or co-exisitng diagnosis, as rosacea is primarily a facial diagnosis.\n\nTreating rosacea varies from patient to patient depending on severity and subtypes. Dermatologists are recommended to take a subtype-directed approach to treating rosacea patients.\n\nTrigger avoidance can help reduce the onset of rosacea but alone will not normally cause remission for all but mild cases. The National Rosacea Society recommends that a diary be kept to help identify and reduce triggers.\n\nIt is important to have a gentle skin cleansing regimen using non-irritating cleansers. Protection from the sun is important and daily use of a sunscreen of at least SPF 15 containing a physical blocker such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide is advised.\n\nOral tetracycline antibiotics (tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline) and topical antibiotics such as metronidazole are usually the first line of defence prescribed by doctors to relieve papules, pustules, inflammation and some redness. Oral antibiotics may also help to relieve symptoms of ocular rosacea. If papules and pustules persist, then sometimes isotretinoin can be prescribed. Isotretinoin has many side effects and is normally used to treat severe acne but in low dosages is proven to be effective against papulopustular and phymatous rosacea.\n\nThe treatment of flushing and blushing has been attempted by means of the centrally-acting α-2 agonist clonidine, but there is no evidence whatsoever that this is of any benefit. The same is true of the beta-blockers nadolol and propanolol. If flushing occurs with red wine consumption, then complete avoidance helps. There is no evidence at all that antihistamines are of any benefit in rosacea.\n\nPeople who develop infections of the eyelids must practice frequent eyelid hygiene. Daily scrubbing the eyelids gently with diluted baby shampoo or an over-the-counter eyelid cleaner and applying warm (but not hot) compresses several times a day is recommended.\n\nDermatological vascular laser (single wavelength) or Intense Pulsed Light (broad spectrum) machines offer one of the best treatments for rosacea, in particular the erythema (redness) of the skin. They use light to penetrate the epidermis to target the capillaries in the dermis layer of the skin. The light is absorbed by oxy-hemoglobin which heat up causing the capillary walls to heat up to 70ºC, damaging them, causing them to be absorbed by the body's natural defense mechanism.\n\nCO2 lasers can be used to remove excess tissue caused by phymatous rosacea. CO2 lasers emit a wavelength that is absorbed directly by the skin. The laser beam can be focused into a thin beam and used as a scalpel or defocused and used to vaporise tissue.

"Hi Johnny\n\nHere are some ideas to heal yourself.\n\nCause \n1.Cleansing the Skin: The skin is a very important part of the body; it is an ""extra kidney,"" an extra set of lungs for breathing, and has many other functions. We should keep it in a good condition, important as it is, but we usually treat it shamefully. Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and the skin should be bathed daily. This does not mean to use soap with each bathing, unless it is a natural type biodegradable liquid soap. Nearly all bar soaps do more damage to the skin than they aid it, by leaving residue of the soap to clog the pores. The pores are the doors and windows of the temple and must be kept open to let in oxygen (the breath of life) and to excrete toxins and waste. \n\n2.Diet and Use of Natural Fibers: A person who uses lots of mucus foods has a gluey, sticky type perspiration. When this individual sweats and the body is not cleaned regularly, the dried sweat clogs the pores. This is a beginning cause of dermatitis, or skin malfunction. In addition, as a nation we have fallen in love with easy to wash and iron synthetic clothes. These rob the body of the breath of life because manmade synthetic fibers do not ""breathe."" Only natural fibers such as cotton, wool, linen, silk, etc., can allow the skin to breathe properly. \n\n3.Diet: These are two of our big problems; the third one is a diet devoid of wholesome foods. We use man's prepared materials, called food, that have been contaminated and processed, and in so many cases, should be classified as ""junk food."" All aids to fighting dermatitis work better and faster if we consider the first three things mentioned--bathe regularly, return to natural fibers to wear, and eat wholesome foods \n\nHerbal Aids \n\n1.Dr. Christopher's Bone, Flesh and Cartilage: (BF&C) For the most severe cases of skin diseases in the advanced stage, use a combination we have called Bone, Flesh and Cartilage combination, internally and externally. Repeat procedure. Make the tea, soak flannel, cotton, or any white material other than synthetic--never use synthetic--wrap fomentation (soaked cloth) around the malfunctioning area and cover with plastic or wax paper, leave on all night six days a week and for as many weeks as needed until relief appears. Then continue a week or two for severe cases. Drink one fourth cup of finished concentrated tea with three fourths cup of distilled water three times or more each day. \n\n2.Dr. Christopher's Chickweed Ointment: This is made of chickweed herb and bees wax and oils. Excellent for eczema and/or other skin infections, sores, burning, itchy skin or genitals, swollen testes, acne, hives, also for ulceration of mouth and throat. This is a wonderful healing ointment. \n\n3.Plantain: For skin diseases that result in scrofula or eczema, use the tea internally as a blood cleanser and use the strong tea externally as a wash. If the skin is not oily, you can use the ointment topically to affected areas. \n\n4.Juices for Eczema: Carrot & cucumber. \n\n5.Cabbage Leaves: Cabbage leaves applied to an infected wound, ulcer, or oozing eczema should be layered like roof shingles, allowing secretions to drain between the layers. \n\n6.Tarragon: Soothing for eczema and scurvy. \n\n7.Dr. Christopher's Healing Ointment: (CMM) Made of comfrey, marshmallow, marigold, bee's wax, and oils, this is an antiseptic to be used on lesions, eczema (dry), poison ivy, soothes inflamed surfaces, abrasions, burns, hemorrhoids, for bruises and swellings. Good to have on hand at all times. \n\nTestimonials \n1.BF&C cures skin problem worse than eczema: One day a lady came into my office in a frantic state of near hysteria. She told me that her fourteen-year-old daughter was at home and some neighbor ladies were with her, to keep her from doing harm to herself. That morning the mother had stopped her daughter from committing suicide. The girl, for several years, had a sever"
"I agree with huggy and also the people who are telling you that 28 pounds is WAY too much weight for you to lose.  I know you are on the shorter side, but 80 pounds is still too thin for you.  You should talk to your parent(s) about going to see a doctor, and have your doctor tell you what a good weight for you is.  Then you can think about getting your buddy.\n\nAn in-person buddy is much better for this kind of thing - someone who can get together and exercise with you, hold you accountable for eating good things, you can learn how to cook healthy together, etc.  Maybe your school nurse or counselor can put you in touch with a good buddy ""candidate.""\n\nMarina, listen:  Junior high is a scary place, and some people there are at the height of meanness.  You could go in to junior high weighing 19  pounds, and someone will still call you FAT.  Getting down to a certain weight is NOT going to protect your heart and soul from the mean people in your life.  The people who are mean will find something to insult you for, true or false.\n\nThe trick you have to learn has nothing to do with weight loss.  You have to learn how to block those mean comments out of your brain, to not let them in and not let them bother you.  Find a friend in your life - in person - to stick close to and support you when you get to junior high, and start practicing now how to ignore the people who call you fat, ugly, stupid, whatever.  Those people are worthless, and their comments have no value unless you give them value by allowing them to change YOUR behavior.  If you let those haters hurt your feelings, and let them make you think you need to weigh 80 pounds, then they win.  Don't let that happen."
well i just got over cholesterol problems myself.  my bads were really high and my goods where really low. all i did was cut grease out of my diet (use olive oil very good) i started eating oatmeal in mornings (oatmeal eats bad cholesterol's) I started eating more salads and a lot less beef. focused most of my meals on chicken and some pork. so no more hamburger helper. when i went back in for blood work six months later the goods and bads had pretty much leveled off plus i lost 10 pounds.  My doctor was pretty impressed because she prescribed me some pills TRICOR or something but it gave me diarrhea  so i stopped those with in a week of getting them. also you can go to an organic store and get Fish oil pills and garlic pills THESE WORK GREAT if you like taking pills. i hope this helps you
If only illegal drugs came in packets with instructions on the outside. We'd all know exactly what the drug would do, how much is too much and what other drugs are to be avoided at the same time.\n\nUnfortunately they don't. And while it's relatively easy to find out about the various effects of illegal drugs it's less easy to find out about safe amounts or dangerous combinations.\n\nMixing drugs isn't a good idea. It makes the effects unpredictable and the risks harder to define.
I am sorry I dont have any recipes! But I know the cook books ar eout there as I am sure you know.. try looking on ebay! I want recipes too but I need to break down and buy a book.. there is a website that has recipes and their point value.. its www.dwlz.com.. good luck and take care

Yes, you should be concerned.\n In those with liver disease or those who take blood thinning medications (such as heart patients) biochemical events cannot lead to the formation of the final clot.

First of all I think you should leave that part to a professional. BUT, to tell someone you think they may need to see a shrink/therapist can be very tricky. Start by telling the person how much you care about them. Tell them that you've noticed they are having some difficulties in their moods and you'd like to help them but that you think they should go see someone who is better qualified to help them. Don't push the conversation but try to let it come naturally. They may get offensive but stress how concerned you are for them. Alot of times the one talk won't have an effect so if it doesn't don't get discouraged. Don't nag but bring up on more occasions when you think your friend will be more reseptive. Maybe you'll luck out the first time and your friend will be relieved that you care enough to notice and seek help. Good luck.
It tastes good for about 5 minutes then has a weird ucky taste. I lick my lips 5 minutes later and it's like bitter or something.  After rinsing, my teeth are left blue, too.  The only reason I can use it is because the other brands are too minty for me that they burn.

Masturbation Frequency:\nhttp://www.jackinworld.com/misc/faqtree1.html#mastfreq\n\nHow often does the average male masturbate?\nIt depends on a lot of factors, the most important being age. For an 18-year-old male, a rough average is once a day or so. This is slightly higher for younger teenagers — maybe 10 or 12 times a week, and slightly lower for older people. You might be surprised by how often adult men masturbate — even happily married men.\n\nI think I'm addicted to masturbation. Is that possible?\nIt is, although many, many people think they're addicted when they're really just doing what comes naturally. For more on this topic, read the article Is Masturbation Addictive?(http://www.jackinworld.com/library/articles/addict.html).\n\nHow can I masturbate less often, or quit altogether?\nIt's tough; it takes a lot of will power. It can be done, especially if you're driven by very strong religious feelings. However, JackinWorld's position is that it's not worth it. We think you should enjoy the harmless pleasures your body can provide.\n\n\n\n\nConnection between ejaculation frequency and prostate health \nhttp://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/4961.html\n\nQUESTION:\nI have been coming across articles on the connection between masturbation, ejaculation, and overall health. I was very surprised about this article from the Cancer Council Victoria in Australia . It was a study that confirmed that ejaculation frequency is important for a healthy prostate. The protective effect was most significant in men in their twenties who ejaculated on average 7 or more times per week. It compared this against same-age men who ejaculated less than 3 times per week. I made a New Year's resolution to pay attention to my body and to ejaculate at least once a day. I feel much better for it and my penis strength and sexual urge has increased immensely. I feel balanced. After a year, I can't imagine going back to my old repressed frequency and probably couldn?t keep from cumming for a whole day if I tried now. Why aren?t people made aware of this need? After getting used to daily +, I often have the urge to do it even more, but hold back. Are there any physical problems with over ejaculating? \n\nANSWER:\nWhat a fabulous New Year’s resolution to pay attention to your body!  Your efforts are worth applauding, as being in tune with yourself and your new masturbation schedule seems to have paid off, as you note that you feel “balanced” and “much better for it.”  Happily, no physical problems are associated with over-ejaculating, so don’t worry about giving in to the natural urge to enjoy and pleasure yourself more often.  You clearly have a strong awareness of the positive effects of masturbation on your body, so go ahead and experiment with masturbation frequency – in this way, you can determine what frequency feels best for you and your regular routine.\n\nYou also ask why people aren’t made aware of the “need” to masturbate often.  Good question – especially in light of the study’s findings that frequent ejaculation helps reduce the risk of prostate cancer.  Unfortunately, self-stimulation – as with most sexual acts – is often viewed as shameful, dirty, immoral, and all sorts of other negative adjectives.  Wouldn’t it be great if masturbation could be seen as the healthy, enjoyable, and beneficial activity it really is, openly talked about and (gasp!) endorsed?  Perhaps one day it will be – with more people like you who are open-minded and bold enough to talk about it in a positive light.  \n\nEnjoy – and pass that article along to friends, family, neighbors, co-workers, and anybody and everybody else!
"By ""dieting"" with severe calorie restriction, you send the body a message that says... HEY! I'm STARVING here!  \nIt will NOT go to fat reserves to use them up- you will not burn fat. The body will go to muscle tissue to use for fuel.  \nYes, you will lose weight, but it will be muscle mass, not fat. That message flips a metabolic switch that tells the body to store whatever comes in as FAT - fat storage mode - to protect the body.  That means that no matter what you consume, no matter if it's good for you or bad... gets stored as fat.   \nMuscle weighs twice as much as fat. Think of the volume that a pound of lead takes up, vrs a pound of feathers. \nMuscle dictates your metabolism.  If you add a pound of muscle\nto your body it uses up 30 - 50 calories per day at rest.  Example - two people can weigh the exact same amount and the one with the higher muscle mass will look fit and the one with the higher body fat will look fat.\nEducate yourself on a healthy diet and exercise. Avoid trend diets - liquid, meal replacement, high protein, no carb...  etc.  Go on line and find a healthy eating plan that you can stick to for LIFE not for a few months. \nWeight training will increase your muscle mass. Concentrate on increasing your muscle mass rather than losing weight."

7-14 days they say. As far as when it is contagious it is a virus and is spread by sneezing, coughing and not washing hands. It's contagious as soon as you come in contact with the germ.

However, if your immune system is depleted it will normally take a good hold of ya.  I hope this answers your question.
Nordic women are around your height...which is great if you live in Norway.\n\nBut I'm assuming you're North American where the average height of a grown woman is 5'7. So yeah...you're a little tall, but if you're thin as well...then you're set to become a model.
pores are not a disease of anything like acne...they are simple a feature of the surface of our skin, through which we sweat.  you can't get rid of them, but you can minimize their appearance if the size of your pores bothers you. it is important to keep your skin clean.  wash your face at least twice daily, especially before bed.  use warm water to open your pores and a good facial cleanser (I like Neutrogena) to clean deep down inside your pores.  you should lather for 30 seconds and rinse thoroughly.  cold water will reduce the size of your pores but will not clean it.\n\nfor an added minimizing and deep cleaning effect, use a facial mask designed for deep cleaning and/or pore minimizing once a month.
You have no teeth in the front on top\nThe top part of your mouth (the palate) isn't closed, it's wide open
take a loofah and scrub the area to be shaved more coarsely than you would if it were soapy and you were just washing your body.  the scrubbing will prevent as many ingrown hairs, and will also allow the area to be smoother longer, because you're scrubbing away dead skin, and shaving at the new skin level.  it might not sound like that big of a difference, but we're talking like 2 bonus days here, depending on how fast your hair grows.

I've been in and out of therapy since I was 6 (I'm now 30) and DBT is the most helpful thing I have ever tried. I am a major advocate for it, I wish it was more widely offered.\nFor me, I always knew something was wrong but didn't know what or why or what to do about it. DBT lays it all out in a way that makes sense. It teaches the skills for being able to make real changes in your life. If you are ready to really face your issues and take a very honest look at yourself, then I highly recommend it. It truly can change your life and significantly reduce suffering. \nThe only negative thing I have heard about it have been due to the individual not liking the way the group was run, which had more to do with the people running it than the content. \n\nI would say, if you can get into DBT, do it. Try it. You have nothing to lose and so much to gain. It is very worth the effort. I wish I had been introduced to it at 18, I think my life would have gone a lot differently if I had.\n\nFor more info try these websites (the first will let you read what other people who have tried it have to say about it, the second will show you what it actually is) :\n\nwww.remedyfind.com\nwww.dbtselfhelp.com\n\nIf you want any more information on bpd or dbt, feel free to email me.
The only way that sitting in hot water can make you lose weight is if otherwise you would be stuffing food into your face. If you are soaking instead of eating then you could be losing weight. Otherwise it has nothing to do with weight loss.
Nope... Wheat, barley, rye, oats, spelt, semolina, triticale, and kamut are on the no-no list for Celiacs. If you're looking at expanding your grain intake, try corn or masa, quinoa, rice, and buckwheat. If you're simply looking for a gluten free grain to use in baking try a mixture of white rice flour, potato starch flour, tapioca starch, and xantham gum. If you're looking for a bread to substitute for gluten-containing breads, try ordering online at www.kinnikinnick.com, the tapioca rice bread is decent when toasted. I personally prefer using Mission corn tortillas instead of bread. Only Mission brand taste good and are flexible enough to make a sandwich out of them (after microwaving, of course). For bread, you may also be interested in trying Gluten Free Pantry's Sandwich Bread. You need a breadmaker to make it, but it's worth the hassle.
you do not need to weigh less,  If YOU don't like the way you look try some exercise program to give yourself some muscle definition

If the doctor will not freeze them off ask them about a plaster treatment. I don't remember the exact name but it is like a plaster with medication in it. Also wash your feet thoroughly and make sure you dry them before putting your shoes on. I would also spray the bathtub with lysol or a bleach solution and wash the washcloth with bleach after every shower. You should also use powder to keep your feet dry; they spread when it is moist. You can also spray the inside of your shoes with Lysol and wash your socks with bleach. \n\nHave you talked with your doctor about checking your immune system? You really shouldn't have that many if you are in good health otherwise. Good luck!\n\nEDIT: Glad to hear you are a healthy person! Just try to keep the feet dry to prevent further spread. My mom said she soaked hers everynight in a peroxide, sea salt and warm water bath and hers went away.

"Hun, are you 35? If you are ...I have a friend in California, I grew up with, who told me, she went through menopause when she was in her 30s.......My sister & I are, both in our 40s, and we both are going through whats known as, ""Perimenopause"", for those woman who dont quite go a whole 12 months, without a period. See, my sister & I do get our periods, still, we just dont get them every month, like most young ladies do.. We get them about every 5 months, and she went 8 months without getting hers.....Its really nice, because, its suppose to ease the side effects from the actual ""Menopause"" once we do go through the actual real-deal.. Dont be alarmed. Unless you think your maybe pregnant.. Then that could very well be the reasons for not having your period, yet. I would  just go and buy one of those pregnance home-kits, to see and make sure thats not what it is.. Then you can delete that one, and know it could very well be Perimenopause or even actual Menopause... Dont stress honey, we all go through this, one way or another! Smile, and just be Happy, and let Nature do its thing!"

"Hi if you type into your browser ""hearing voices mental health"" You will get a whole range of sites to choose from which maybe of some help to you.  \n\nI work as a Senior within a care home for the elderly and they all have mental health issues.  \n\nThe term ""hearing voices""....... they dont actually hear someone talking to them like you would hear me talking to you if i was stood infront of you.  They hear these voices in their inner ear.  The voice can be from someone they know (who maybe still alive) and from someone they have lost.  It can also be a voice of a complete stranger.  This is abit like when our consious self tells us within that something is wrong or that we need to do something, but for these people they hear it NOT as their own but as someone else telling them what to do or just talking in general.\n\nSome of my service users will spend hours holding a conversation with someone who isnt there.  They will even pause as if stopping to let the inner voice reply. Then continue as if answering them.\n\nI have recently completed a course on mental heath and I learned that even for something as simple as spotted flecks in a carpet can look competly different to someone suffering from mental health issues.  A few of our service users would bend over and reach for the floor trying to pick things up that werent there.  Even talking to the floor as if a small animal was there.  This I learned was because the flecks in the carpet didnt appear as flecks to them.  They saw it as something else and this all depended on the indiviual.  Weve recently had a new carpet laid now.\n\nIf your in thissort of work and not had previous experience your company should really be sending you on courses to help give you this knowledge.  People with mental health issues may see and there things but they are still very bright.  They will see themselves as being normal, and its YOU with the problem.\n\nSpeak to your emplyer about courses hun.  It must be very scarey for you at times.  Ive worked with mental health now for 4 years and im still learning new things everyday.\n\nAs abit of advice......dont turn it into a joke with someone if they start talking funny or telling you someones there its not likly to turn out very well.  You can try ASKING them who they see or hear.  You can sometimes understand them more if they feel you want to understand and can be trusted.  If you feel a moment is getting abit heated try and dirvert there attention somewhere else.  If your in their home on your own ALWAYS make sure you keep the exit door behind you.  NEVER let the client be between you and the door.  If a moment becomes above what you can handle or you feel you need some air then you can exit quietly and easily.\n\nAnything your worried about email me arabsaigold@hotmail.com.

"Healthy weight loss tips\n\n\n    * Take one pound at a time\n      Don’t get overwhelmed by how much weight you need to lose. Try to remember that ""losing 15 pounds in two weeks"" is nothing to celebrate. It is important to realize that the more quickly weight is lost, the more likely the loss is coming from water and muscle, not fat.\n\n      Since muscle tissue is critical in keeping our metabolism elevated, losing it actually leads to a decrease in the amount of calories we can each day without gaining weight.\n\n      Fat loss is best achieved when weight is lost slowly. Strive for a weight loss of no more than 3-4 pounds per week. One pound of weight is equivalent to 3500 calories.\n\n\n    * Set Reachable Goals\n      For instance, if you know you need to get more exercise, begin with a manageable goal of, say, walking 10 minutes a day that you know you can achieve. Then build your self-esteem by achieving the small goals you set yourself.\n\n      The same logic applies for losing weight.\n\n    * Stay off the scales\n      Don’t get discouraged when your progress seems to be slow according to your bathroom scales. They do not provide a true measure of what is going on with the body.\n\n      If exercise levels are adequate (5-7 days a week), you may be putting on muscle but losing fat, thus losing inches even if you are not losing pounds. It's always a good idea to do several body measurements to have a second objective way to monitor progress.\n\n    * Stay focused on being healthy, not thin\n      # Many people become more successful at long term weight loss when their motive changes from wanting to be thinner to wanting to be healthier. Change your mindset to think about selecting foods that will help your body's health rather than worrying about foods that will affect your body's weight. The Food Pyramid offers a basic outline of the types and amounts of food you should eat each day to give your body the nutrients it needs for optimal health.\n\n    * Fat Free?\n      We've known for some time that limiting high fat foods in the diet can be helpful with weight loss. That's because fats pack in 9 calories per gram compared to only 4 calories per gram from proteins or carbohydrates. To many, the message to limit fats implied an endorsement to eat unlimited amounts of fat-free products. Just to clarify, fat-free foods have calories too. In some cases fat-free foods have as many calories as their fat laden counterparts. If you eat more calories than your body uses, you will gain weight. Eating less fat will help you to lose weight. Eating less fat and replacing it with excessive amounts of fat-free products will not.\n\n    * Drink plenty of water\n      Drink eight glasses a day. Water is a natural appetite-suppressant. Nettle tea is a great weight-loss tea as it supports metabolism and has diuretic properties.\n\n    * Reward yourself\n      # Each time you reach a goal, such as losing 5 pounds, reward yourself with a gift or a massage.\n\n    * Seek help if you need it\n      # A big key in long term weight control comes from receiving encouragement and support from others. Find a friend to lose weight with or you can check to see if groups such as Weight Watchers, or eDiets offer programs and resources in your area by clicking the links. You may also wish to check with your local hospital to see if their registered dietician conducts group weight loss programs.\n\n    * Watch your portions\n      With the advent of ""supersize"" meals and increasingly huge portions at restaurants, our concept of normal serving sizes is a distant memory. Be mindful of the amounts of food you consume at a sitting. When necessary, divide your food in half and ask for a take home bag. It is all too easy to be a ""plate cleaner"" even when served enormous portions. Learn to pay attention to your hunger level and stop eating when you feel comfortably full, not stuffed.\n\n    * Eat your f"

it varies from time to time, i can come between 3 to 6 minutes or longer, if you want to last longer trying the hold and release method sometime can works too.before you come hold the base of your penis until it relaxes and go at it again keep trying that method repeatly.now also you let your girl or wife have her orgasm first then try this method or do it in between her orgasm that will make it last abit longer.\nif you want a quick and fast one then yeh 3 to 6 minutes is the average.sizes doesn't have to do with anything with orgasm.it all depends on your libido and mood.
ok! well i used to have the same problem, MAJORLY! I read heaps about this. One thing i never knew is that eye liner actually contributes to this, because it carries chemicals that go into the pores to give this effect- so try not to wear it often and ALWAYS wash your face really well.\n\nNow theres this stuff... i totally cant remember what its called! Well like its something like moisture boost or something? and its meant for putting under your eyes! it works really well! \n\nbecause the skin under your eyes is half the thickness of the rest of the skin on your face, so it is prone to dryness and bags.\n\nDo a search and read up about it. All skin types are diffferent, and different methods will have different effects.
If it doesn't go away, you need to see an eye doctor.  Your optomitrist might be able to help you, but they might refer you somewhere else.  It could be chronic conjunctivitis, which can be caused by contact lenses.

You might still grow a little - but not much i'm afraid: Probably an at the most! Boys tend to have a large growth spurt during their middle teen years (14-16). This is when most of your growth would have taken place. This is in contrast to girls who usually start their growth spurt early in their teens (12) but theirs is more slower and gradual. Both males and females stop growing around about the age of 18-21!
I myself have seizures. Epilepsy is best described as a muscle spasm in one side of the brain. Everything locks up, muscles constrict and most of the time but not all the time there is the well know shaking. If your friend seizes all you need to do is put him/her on their side and watch the tongue. Seizures worst side effect is vomiting and that is why you place them on their side so they will not choke on their own vomit. The tongue thing...the tongue cannot be swallowed but in lots of seizure cases the tongue is severely bitten. Hope this helps...and please just stay calm...that's the best thing you could ever do. The person having the seizure doesn't want to wake up to someone freaking out whereas this can cause more stress.

"No, I haven't seen it, nor do I intend to.\n\nBut this is the ""Diet & Fitness"" question area.  Sitting in a theatre doesn't make you fit.  And the diet of junk food that they serve at the movies is all wrong.  The popcorn has too much sodium and is drenched in fat, the candies are just empty calories.\n\nI would recommend you start distance running.  That way if you should ever encounter a serial killer you can run and get away from them."
"From my hubby's database:\n\n\nOf all the various aspects of the male human body, few are as variable from individual to individual as semen. The color, texture, and quantity — not to mention the force of ejaculation — vary greatly. Based on outward appearance we are all amazingly similar: virtually everyone has eyes, ears, a nose, and a mouth in the same place. But semen just doesn't work that way. \nJust like penis size, ejaculation volume and force are highly variable from individual to individual. Most guys want to ejaculate more semen with more force.\nIf you've done exercises like Kegels For Men, yes, it may have increased your distance — but probably not your volume. There's a *huge* variation from person to person with regard to ejaculation force as well as volume, and neither has anything to do with anything important (such as having children).\n\n\nConsistency of semen isn't very consistent; you've probably noticed that the thickness of your ejaculate can vary from day to day. This is because the quality of the fluid is very susceptible to a number of factors. Diet, exercise and frequency of sex can all dictate how thick or watery your emissions are, as can the tightness of the clothes that you wear (tight clothing will increase body temperature and can thus impact sperm motility. \n\nFor men of normal fertility, sperm creation is a constant, ongoing process. Millions of sperm cells are created each day in the testes; they mature in one to 3 months, after which they're ready to be ejaculated. So, since there are always sperm cells being made, there is a lot of overlap between your ""loads."" Once one has been released, another should not be far behind.\nActual semen quantity differs among individuals and can also change for the same individual during different times of his life. Genetics plays an important part in how much a male will ejaculate. Most males ejaculate about one teaspoon of semen. Some medications may affect the amount of semen produced. And you will notice that the longer you take between orgasms the larger the quantity of semen you will ejaculate. (You've probably noticed that if you masturbate more than once a day that the second, third or fourth time you achieve orgasm you release smaller and smaller quanitities of semen. Wait overnight and see how much more your body made while you were asleep.) Additionally, the more aroused you get and the longer you take to ejaculate, the more semen your body will produce. Foreplay — touching yourself in special ways in special places — will sometimes stimulate the body to produce more semen, since the body's reproductive glands (such as the prostate) work harder when you're aroused.\nSemen appearance and texture can change naturally over the course of months, days, or even from one ejaculation to another, due to a variety of factors inculding diet.\nSemen from a mature male is usually a milky or pearly-white color. It is not uncommon to see a yellowish tint to the semen if you've abstained from ejaculation for a while. Semen colored with red streaks may signify blood. If you occasionally see a bit of blood it's not necessarily a cause for alarm, but if you see a lot of it, or if it persists, the condition should be brought to the attention of your physician. The same goes any other drastic color changes, which may indicate infection. \nA lot of factors go into the appearance and consistency of semen, including diet, ejaculation frequency, etc., so changing any of these can alter the way your semen looks. Also, it's easy to think that semen is simply sperm cells in water, but it's a much more complex substance than that. So it may have been the absence or presence of something other than actual sperm cells — such as sugars or proteins — that caused your semen to look different before.\nA nocturnal ejaculation may have more prostatic fluid in it (which is whiter and thicker), while a da"
Huny, everyone says do this and do that but nothing works better than this:\n\nTake two Tylenol (any Pain reliever)and drink about 2 glasses of water after that.\nThe Tylenol help with the bad headache and the water helps with the throwing up and dehydration. If you don't drink enough water and replace what you are throwing up then you will keep vomiting, and it doesn't feel nice when your throwing up absolutely nothing.\n\nAfter all that take about a 2 hr nap. When you wake up you should feel like new. Just keep drinking water.\n\nHope you feel better.
Hi, Registered Nurse here; I have also noticed some of the negative response to health care here on Yahoo.  I don't think our health care system is near what it should be.  But not for a minutes do I believe physicians and pharmaceutical companions are conspiring against the people.  Medical school is far to hard, not to be dedicated to the patient.  I've further seen people write that vaccines are not necessary, well we can all believe as we want.  But I agree vaccines, antibiotics, advancement in almost all fields of health care have greatly benefited the human race.  Yes people still die, and yes, Doctors, Nurses, and the entire health care team do make mistakes for we are only human, and that cannot be factored out, as hard as everyone tries, and the most dedicated do make mistakes.  And even one mistake in regards to someones life and health is to many.  But unfortunately The Health Care System is made up of humans, and to be human is to error.  Thanks for the opportunity to address such a complex question.
this is a common problem faced by men.  yes, the pain will subside.  to speed recovey along, drink plenty of water.  it will push the soap residue out of your penis faster.
there could be many reasons for this, inner ear infections can cause it,if it continues to happen I would go to the doctor.

OK, so it's a mood disorder and a serious mental illness. It has a strong genetic component, but appears to be triggered environmentally. There are no diagnostic tests for it, just psychiatric evaluation. Most sufferers are not diagnosed until middle age, and it takes an average of around 8-10 years to get a correct diagnosis. Historically, figures suggested it affects about 0.8% of the population at some point, which makes it about half as common as schizophrenia. In recent years, bipolar disorder has become an 'in' diagnosis, and many more people are being diagnosed at younger and younger ages. As with ADHD, this fad may well pass with time, although for the moment many celebrities appear to be 'popularising' it.\n\nIt is characterised by episodes of severe clinical depression and mania or hypomania (for definitions of those, see here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_diagnostic_criteria_for_bipolar_disorder ). The extreme end of mania often turns into psychosis, complete with hallucinations and delusions. During manic phases, the person's judgement and perception of reality is severely compromised, leading to risky actions with potentially damaging consequences (financially, sexually and relationship-wise). Untreated, episodes generally worsen over time due to an effect known as kindling. Untreated Bipolar sufferers are at a very high risk of suicide: 20-25% attempt it, and 15% succeed.\n\nThe cycles in bipolar disorder are much longer than people generally believe. Anyone whose mood changes from minute to minute is very unlikely to be bipolar. Bipolar 1 is characterised by mood episodes lasting many months, while Bipolar 2 has episodes in the region of weeks to months. Rapid and ultra-rapid cycling bipolar disorder is rare, and cycles last days to weeks.\n\nThere are many drugs available to treat the symptoms of bipolar (there is no cure). These are either anti-convulsants or anti-psychotics (personally I take both), and the most well known of these is Lithium. Most patients will go through a number of different drugs before finding one that works for them.

I am not familiar with the gel that you speak of, however, gout is characterized by accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints caused by excess uric acid in the blood.  Uric acid is a byproduct of the breakdown of protein that is normally excreted by the kidneys into the urine.  To reduce uric acid concentrations it is necessary to support the kidneys, adrenal and immune system functions.  It is also necessary to detoxify by cleansing and drinking plenty of fluids.\n\nExcess alcohol, allergy-producing foods (get checked for food sensitivities by a naturopath), or strict diets can cause outbreaks of gout.  Foods rich in purines, such as wine, anchovies and animal liver can also cause gout.\n\nEssential oils can greatly help in the battle by supporting normal body functions.  You can try geranium, ledum, carrot seed, celery, juniper, rosemary CT cineol, Roman chamomile, lemon, Melaleuca alternifolia (also known as tea tree), nutmeg and Idaho tansy or there are some blends available that may relieve some of the symptoms called PanAway and JuvaFlex.  You can apply these to the affected area and some of them can be ingested as supplements.\n\nPlease assure that if you try essential oils they are therapeutic-grade.  Not all essential oils on the market are equal, some are even toxic.  If you would like further information, please contact me.

"First of all, I would get a NEW family doctor. What you have, is probably Pleurisy. Here are the symptoms: it hurts to breath deeply or cough. You may also have severe,but one-sided,chest pain.The symptoms are accompanied by others that are associated with the underlying disorder. The pain will disappear if pleural effusion occurs as a result of pleurisy, because fluid will prevent the roughened or inflamed  layers of the pleura from rubbing against each other. If this happens, you may become BREATHLESS! You need to see a doctor, have your lungs ""sounded' and a ""chest x-ray"" the x-ray will determine what caused this. If you are not allergic to Aspirin, this is the recommendation. Aspirin will ease your pain. Go NOW and get your lungs tested. Better to be safe then sorry."

No.  Children's physiology is different from adults and arterial plaqueing does not start to form until the teenage years.  It would be like screening the elderly for sexually transmitted diseases...lots of screening with very little result.\n\nThe problem is not that we are not finding heart disease if we are looking, its that there are plenty of people in their 50's and 60's who think that smoking, high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, diabetes, and a strong family history are nothing to worry about...and oh yeah, this chest tightness isn't that bad, therefore it must not be anything.  On the other hand you have perfectly healthy 20 year olds every day on this forum wondering if that sharp pain in their chest might be a heart attack.\n\nIn sum education would go much, much farther than routine screening for an inappropriate population.

What is dandruff? \nA person's entire body surface continuously sheds dead skin cells. Dandruff , the shedding of dead skin cells from the scalp at an excessive rate, is the result of the normal growing process of the skin cells of the scalp. Dandruff is a bothersome problem sometimes thought to be associated with inefficient hair care. Nothing could be further from the truth - anyone who has dandruff knows that! \nIf you're troubled by dandruff, that snowy, dust-like stuff that falls from scalp to shoulders, you're not alone. Nearly everyone has dandruff to some degree. You can also try out this Anti- Dandruff Shampoo to help control dandruff. \n\nEffects of dandruff \n. Dandruff weakens the roots, and consequently hair starts falling off. \n. Dandruff sticks on to the skin of the scalp in a cake form and blocks free flow of air to the roots. \n. As a result, hair becomes weak at the roots and loosen their hold. \n\nDandruff - Causes \nStudies indicate that 50% of adults are affected by dandruff at some time or the other in their lives. More often than not, it is the result of a disturbance in the body's metabolic process. Your scalp, like the rest of your skin, is constantly renewing and shedding itself. Old cells die out and give way to new ones. And when the natural balance in the metabolic process is upset, the new cells form faster than the old cells can be shed off. These then accumulate on the scalp in the form of flakes. The metabolic process can be disturbed by \n. Drugs \n. The onset of puberty \n. Emotional stress and strain \n. Sudden changes in the climate or your diet. \n. It is also believed that dandruff is caused by a fungal infection of the scalp. \n\nFactors that may augment a dandruff condition\nInfrequent shampooing of hair, inadequate rinsing and excessive use of a hot hair dryer (which also causes contact dermatitis), aggravates dandruff. You could prevent dandruff by shampooing regularly with a mild shampoo. Massage your scalp gently to loosen flakes and rinse the hair and scalp thoroughly. \nExcessive use of hairsprays and gels and improper use of hair coloring products can cause dandruff. Tight fitting hats and scarves should be avoided. \nA combination of cold weather, low humidity and dry indoor heat could explain persistent dandruff. \nPoor diet, food allergies, hormonal imbalances, and infections can all lead to dandruff. \n\nDo you really have dandruff? \nBefore you start treating your hair for dandruff, make sure you really have dandruff. Sometimes a flaky scalp may be caused by too much sun, or excessive use of hair dryers. It can also be caused by the use of soaps on the hair, or harsh shampoos which do not wash out easily. Care must be taken not to confuse simple dandruff with other conditions that also cause flaking of the scalp, such as seborrheic dermatitisor psoriasis. \n\nYour Comb/ Brush and dandruff \nNever use the brush or comb of the person suffering from dandruff as it is dangerous and contagious. Likewise, make sure that you wash your comb/brush after every shampoo if you have dandruff yourself! Many medicines, medicated soaps and shampoos are available to counter dandruff, but the most effective is cleanliness of hair. Brush your hair thrice a day and shampoo at least once a week. While washing your hair, take care the water does not trickle down your face. There are chances that you may get pimples. \n\nSOme home remedies for dandruff \n*Egg pack for dandruff worries \nBeat two eggs and add two tablespoons of water to it. Wet the hair and apply the egg mixture over the hair. Now massage your scalp and let the mixture on for ten minutes to fifteen minutes. Then rinse the hair with lukewarm water. This will keep both dandruff and hairfall problem away from you. \n\n*Tips to get rid of dandruff\nAdd 3 drops of tea tree oil, a natural antiseptic, to a small amount of shampoo and then wash your hair. \nAvoid or decrease your intake of fried foods, dairy products, suga

"Excessive flatulence is a sign of a food allergy/intollerance. The most common food allergies are caused by Dairy, Wheat flour and most other refined flours. (corn flour is usually safe, so is potato) Excessive fiber can cause such disturbances, however most people don't eat ENOUGH fiber, so that's unlikely to be the issue unless you happen to eat A LOT of it all the time. Beans are famous for their gaseous effects..but to be honest, I don't think beans are a real ""gasser"" for most people unless you happen to have a food allergy with beans. Cut the wheat, flour, and dairy from your diet for 3 days- I can almost guarrantee your flatulence will be diminished. I fart only about once a day! LOL Seriously, my diet is extremlely healthy and happens to be high in fiber (but not TOO high) instead of bread I eat brown rice, sweet potatoes, ect. Tortilla chips & anything made out of corn flour doesn't seem to bother me one bit. I also noticed a reduction in acne when I started doing this. Try it and see! Better than having to constantly down Beano all day!"

Whole grain breads.  Lean meats, like chicken (no skin, not deep fried).\n\nRead labels!  Know what's in your food!\n\nGood Luck!

I had a cracked tooth once, and I went through a filling first (will no relief), then a root canal (with no relief again), and finally I told my dentist to just pull the tooth (because I couldn't take the pain anymore).  If you haven't felt any better results by Monday go back again, or seek another dentist.  I was told that once you have a cracked tooth, there's basically nothing they can do for it.  Have it pulled--if it's in an unnoticeable area (mine was the very back tooth), before you go through all of the pain and expense I did.

Nervous breakdown: What is it?\nWhat is a nervous breakdown? What causes people to have them?\n- Linda / Minnesota\nMayo Clinic psychiatrist Daniel Hall-Flavin, M.D., and colleagues answer select questions from readers.\nAnswer\n\nNervous breakdown is a term that the public uses to characterize a range of mental illnesses. It's not a medical term, and it doesn't indicate a specific mental illness. Generally, it describes a person who is severely and persistently emotionally distraught and unable to function at his or her normal level.\n\nOften, when people refer to having a nervous breakdown, they're describing severe depression. Signs and symptoms of severe depression include:\n\n    * Agitation or restlessness\n    * Difficulty or inability to stop crying\n    * Sleeping difficulties\n    * Indecision\n\nThe causes of mental illness usually aren't clear. But these factors may play a role:\n\n    * Stress\n    * Drug and alcohol use\n    * Co-existing medical conditions, such as thyroid disorders and certain vitamin deficiencies\n    * Genetics\nhttp://www.mayoclinic.com/health/nervous-breakdown/AN00476

If she has fluid it wouldn't be behind the lungs but in them. Ordinarily the lungs fill with fluid because the heart is flabby and is not pumping correctly so fluid backs up into the lungs and a stated is called CHF, congestive heart failure. Pleurisy on the other hand is an infection in the pleural space, between the layers and is treated with antibiotics. It causes chest type pain. A course of antibiotics will cure this but it does NOT take months to happen.
i cut. it gives me a feeling of release....but i dont find it fun. im ashamed of it...i wish i didnt do it. it makes us feel slightly better.\n\nbut i wuldnt NEVER say thats its fun. it is not a hobby of mine. so i really dont know. if ur doing it for fun try find something else fun which doesnt involve inflict pain apon your self and leaving you with scars. looking back in later life you dont want a body for of scars from something you found FUN!\n\nalso it is an attention seeking thing. \n\nSTOP NOW...at least try (im trying and i do it for a reason not because i find it fun!)
"You shouldn't feel dizzy, because you shouldn't be ""dieting"".  You should be eating sensibly, every 2-4 hours (starting with breakfast), so you get a nice, steady supply of energy throughout the day.  Here are some foods to go for:\n\n-Lean, Complete Protein (eat with every meal and snack!):\neggs, low-fat dairy (milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, etc.), whey/casein powder, fish (tuna, salmon, etc.), chicken, turkey, extra-lean beef, amino acids (BCAAs), colostrum, and others like these.\n\n-Green, Leafy Veggies (eat at every possible opportunity, any time of day, even before bed):\nspinach, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, onions, pumpkin, green beans, tomatoes, peppers (all colors), squash, cabbage, kale, collard greens, asparagus, peas, greens supplements, you name it!\n\n-Fruits (eat with any meal):\napples, bananas, peaches, pears, oranges, mango, cantaloupe, watermelon, grapefruit, grapes, pineapple, plums, kiwi, strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, tangerines, raisins, cranberries.....again, have at it!\n\n-Carbs (eat early in the day and post-workout!):\nwhole oats, whole-grain cereals, wheat or veggie pasta, potatoes and yams, brown or wild rice, whole-wheat bread (read the label!), beans/legumes, maltodextrin (one of my favorites), etc.\n\n-Healthy Fats (all other meals, before bed, during sedate periods):\nfish/flax oils (also in fish, spinach and other foods), almonds, walnuts, pecans, extra-virgin olive oil, coconut oil, avocados, to name a few.\n\n-Beverages:\nwater, water, water, water, and water.\n\nMake sure you are getting a good meal within 2 hours of your workout.  A bowl of whole oats is a great idea (1/2 to 2/3 cups in milk), eat it about 1 1/2 to 2 hours prior to your workout (to allow time for digestion).  That should solve the energy problem.  Also, make sure you eat something AFTER your workout!  Otherwise, your hard work is going to waste!  You have to replenish your glycogen supplies that you exhausted during your workout (via 30-40 grams of good complex carbs) and get a good 20-30 grams of lean protein (whey is excellent)."
During a manic episode, you may be abnormally happy, energetic, or irritable for a week or more. You may spend a lot of money, get involved in dangerous activities, and sleep very little. After a manic episode, you may return to normal, but your mood may swing in the opposite direction to feelings of sadness, depression, and hopelessness. When you are depressed, you may have trouble concentrating, remembering, and making decisions; have changes in your eating and sleeping habits; and lose interest in things you once enjoyed.

Tummy tuck surgery is very safe nowadays. My cousin got her breast reduction, tummy tuck and facelift surgery in India by the company called Forerunners Healthcare .The Price for the surgery she paid in India was very less. She paid 30% of the cost she was quoted in America.\n\nForerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. They arrange cosmetic and plastic surgery for foreigners in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low price, as the breast reduction, tummy tuck, facelift and other cosmetic surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.\n\nhttp://www.forerunnershealthcare.com\nHope this helps.

"Just read this in my biology book yesterday.\n\nBreaking down alcohol. The liver, the only organ able to break down alcohol in the body, removes the alcohol from the bloodstream by slowly converting in into another poison, acetaldehyde; this poison is responsible for the headaches and nausea (""hangover"") that follow alcohol consumption. The acetaldehyde is eventually changed to acetate and  ""burned"" in cellular respiration. Because alcohol remains in the body until it is broken down by the liver, it may take the body hours to rid itself of only a few drinks. Also keep in mind that it mainly depends on your wait. If a person weights 100 pounds and they consume 1 drink = .038% is there blood level, 2 drinks = .075% driving becomes drangerous and you are legally drunk in some states at .08%. Or a person, 160 pounds can drink 2 drinks and have there blood level at .047%, alittle over what a 100 pound person's blood level is at after just 1 drink. So as I said it largely depends on your weight.\nHope this helps!"

I have been in psyc. hospitals before for longer than 2 weeks. A lot of it depends on how the person is doing. They start them on meds and if they are o.k. they may come home in a few days. If they have reactions to it and have to start them on another, they may be there longer. IT also has to do with how well they participate in their treatment. If they don't go to groups, talk, etc then the staff may think they are not healthy enough to go back out into the world. Just because he's been there over a week, doesn't mean he's seriously ill..People are admitted for different reasons. Depression, addictiion, etc. It may just be that they don't think he has progressed enough to go home..they may still be watching him on his meds.

Yes, there are exercises you can do.  You have a muscles on the chest wall behind your breasts that you can flex if you take something that has a spring action in the middle, maybe a ball would work and put your palms on it and hold it at chest level and press on it using the muscles in your chest to apply the pressure, not the muscles in your arms.  Flexing this muscles in your chest will firm up and help accentuate a nice breast line. Try different exercise to work those muscles.   The breast has a working milk producing organ protected by fat.  And if you ever have a child and breast feed; the breast feeding will actually tighten up your uterus. You will feel it tightening as you are breast feeding your baby.

If you are under 18, or your prescription is constantly changing, then it's not worth getting  until your eyes are stable. I wouldn't really recommend it for older people(over 70)for slower healing . Also, there are an awful lot of health problems that can prevent you from getting it done such as type 1 diabetes, clinical dry eye, pregnancy & rheumatoid arthritis to name a few.Your eye has to be thoroughly checked to ensure that it is able to take the treatment as well.The other one is expectation. You aint gonna be able to see through walls and stuff, but it's certainly a life changing surgery. The majority of people are suitable for it and don't be put off by stupid stories.You can have cateract surgery after you've had it done and unless your optometrist is incompetent, you shouldn't get a detatched retina, as the eye screen to check suitability should pick up any risk, including that.\nTry http://www.opticalexpress.co.uk\nOr http://www.visx.com\nThey have the Visx Laser, and Visx actually invented laser eye surgery and hold all the patents, so are the market leaders.

"From my hubby's database:\n\nfrom:\nhttp://ca.askmen.com/love/love_tip_200/232b_love_tip.html\nhttp://www.jackinworld.com/qa/qasem.html\n\nOf all the various aspects of the male human body, few are as variable from individual to individual as semen. The color, texture, and quantity — not to mention the force of ejaculation — vary greatly. Based on outward appearance we are all amazingly similar: virtually everyone has eyes, ears, a nose, and a mouth in the same place. But semen just doesn't work that way. \nJust like penis size, ejaculation volume and force are highly variable from individual to individual. Most guys want to ejaculate more semen with more force.\nIf you've done exercises like Kegels For Men, yes, it may have increased your distance — but probably not your volume. There's a *huge* variation from person to person with regard to ejaculation force as well as volume, and neither has anything to do with anything important (such as having children).\n\nA lot of guys would love it if they could make like one of the characters in Scary Movie and ejaculate so much that they plaster their girlfriends against the ceiling. And although that won't likely be happening anytime soon, it's believed that wheat germ increases seminal output.

Eat with oatmeal for better results)\n\nAmino acids, if taken regularly, are generally believed to increase ejaculate fluid. On the other hand, zinc seems to improve both the amount of sperm produced as well as the sperm's ability to move spontaneously and independently. Together with amino acids, this will increase normal sperm count and volume significantly. \nAmino acids are believed to increase ejaculate fluid (not the amount of actual sperm necessarily) if taken regularly. Some amino acids include:\n\nL-ARGININE HCL\nStudies show sperm and semen volume doubles, fertility improves (even among men with low sperm counts or poor sperm motility), and sperm health and activity increase with supplementation. Arginine is found in high concentrations in nuts and seeds like peanuts and almonds. It can also be found in chocolate and raisins. Some Natural Sources: Nuts, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, chocolate, popcorn, raisins, brown rice, carob, gelatin desserts, oatmeal, whole wheat bread, and protein rich foods. \n\nL-LYSINE\nResearchers find that this amino acids plus zinc increases sperm produced, stimulates testosterone production, and improves semen quality.\n\nEPIMEDIUM SAGITTATUM\nSometimes called ""horny goat weed,"" this botanical boosts libido and testosterone levels for greater sperm production for a strong ejaculation.\n\nZINC OXIDE\nHas been shown to increase number of sperm and sperm motility by 80% to 200% by aiding testosterone synthesis.\n\nL-CARNITINE\nThis amino acid is found in high concentrations in healthy sperm. Proven to significantly increase the percentage of highly motile sperm.\n\nCATUABA BARK\nBrazilian herb that strengthens the libido, and nourishes the entire male reproductive system.\n\nPUMPKIN SEED\nSupports prostate health and hormonal production.

Coupled with amino acids (see above), this will increase sperm volume significantly.\n(Butter's note: Not as miraculous as they make it sound, but regular zinc intake (50mgs a day) does increase quantity somewhat.)\n\nWhatever a pill company's claims are, you can probably do just as well with zinc a"
"I considered a Lap band; however, I went for the Rouen-Y gastric bypass instead.  After alot of research, I found that many surgeons are no longer doing Lap Bands because they have a tendency of ""growing"" into your digestive system then the surgeon has to go back and do the bypass.  Also with a lap-band, you have a port under your skin that can be filled with saline to tighten the band.  This can get infected.  I had the gastric bypass one day and was out of the bed walking around the next day.  Nothing to it.  Just follow your directions when you get home.  It wasn't painful.  I couldn't bend over for a few days (make Moms bed on a couch for a few days) or lift anything for 2 weeks.  Other than that, it was a breeze.   That was 2 years ago and I've lost 110 lbs. and maintained my weight for the last year.  For me, Rouen-Y gastric bypass was a blessing and I wish I'd done it years ago.  God love you and your Mom.

As I man I have to say that I don't care for the shaving.  I really don't even care if you trim it.  I'd sure rather lick a coochie that is hairy than one with hair bumps.  In any case hair is sexy.  It implies that the woman is an adult....
Yes, but a big reason for that (perhaps the biggest) is because men are, statistically, far more likely to be in higher-risk jobs (military, oil rigs, construction, etc.) and do high-risk things (stunts, dares, etc.)\n\nRemember, this is a mean (average) figure: it doesn't mean that any one woman is more likely to outlive any one man, though there might also be a little honest-to-goodness biology involved too. You just have many more people bringing down the average for men than for women.
"Most ""heart patient's"" sleep with their feet elevated.  LOL.   I have a bad heart.  I sleep anyway I want.  I've had stints.  Doesn't matter if you sleep on the right or left.  What you want is to allow the heart to pump blood with least resistance.  Heart patient's have problems with their legs swelling.  Of course you want to make sure their breathing is not obstructed, this is best done on their back with legs eleveate and soft pillow just under shoulder and head for comfort.  Nice if the bed is adjustable and you can keep the legs above the heart."

before and after would be best.  also having something about an hour or two before bed is good as well...you dont want anything fatty just something packed with protein like tuna w/ water (right out of the can) because when your body is at rest that is when it also repairs itself.  try to make sure you give your body time off and plenty of rest otherwise the muscles do not have to time to repair and grow...hope that helps!

I too have been diagnosed with scoliosis (I'm told a 17 degree arc to the left when viewed from behind).  I'm told surgery is only used in extreme cases, usually a 25 degree bend or more.  Now, my difference is I don't have much in the way of back pain.  I would suggest talking to a chiropractor first to see what he can do.  If nothing can by him or another medical professional and the pain is just killing you, then maybe you might want to consider surgery.  So just go ask a chiropractor or two to see what he/she can do.  Again, I only recommend surgery if the curve in your back is really big or the pain is unbearable.  Just wanted to say, though, that since this is your back/spine we are talking about, you don't want to be cheap about it.  If you can find an inexpensive chiropractor that is of high quality, great.  But if not, you may want to be willing to spend a little more.  I wish you the best of luck.

Yeah, it can happen a lot. Lamictal was a bitch to titrate up on - every dosage increase caused a few days of insane mood cycling.\n\nAbilify is an odd one: it's an antipsychotic approved for the treatment of bipolar mania. It hits serotonin, dopamine and histamine receptors, which makes it activating rather than sedating like most atypical antipsychotics. All very odd, but it should settle down in a week or two, but if it doesn't then go see your doc again.
Bodies are pretty resilient.  That said, I'm sure it's NOT good for someone to work non-stop without a break.\n\nYoung people are hired for 'brain' work as you put it because they are fresh out of school and on the cutting edge of technology.  Older people (SOME not all) prefer not to learn new things and are then relegated to accepting what positions they can to make a living.\n\nJust my opinion.

it is different with every pill, but you are experiencing this becuase you have to digest the pill.  THis happened to me too and my dr. switched me to NuvaRing.  This way it is just absorbed into your body instead of sitting in your stomach and digesting.  I have been on it for @ 6 months and I love it.  No side effects...I can't even tell its there!!!
You need to eat slow release carbs.  Brown rice, sweet potatoes, etc.
I know the feeling.  I went to nursing school and my children were lucking to get a home cooked meal.  My youngest father bite the shit out of me one day.  We were together for five years.  I forgave him and that was that.  Then one day he came at me again and before I was able to do any more damage I punched him so hard in the eye he could barely see.  We split up after that.  Then four years later he marries and I was talking to his wife.  Without me saying anything she told me about how she has bite marks all over his body.  \n\nI would give him a second chance.  You are just as stressed out as he is.  He could have walked out the door and bought you guys some dinner.  He should understand that when entering med school there is barely enough time for yourself.  You eat, breath and sleep med, med terms, and everything else involved.\n\nIf he tries again I suggest giving it right back to him.  It will surprise him and get him thinking that you don't allow that.\n\nGood luck in school
"The first thing you have to do is relax...... then start thinking about, well.... whatever turns you on in that way (e.g. the hugest stiffy you've ever seen, for instance... and it being all yours to ""play"" with).\nNext is the build up...... which mostly involves stroking things such as your thighs / breasts / p*ssy area, etc...... or of course have a willing partner stroke them for you.... may take up to 10-25minutes or more for a good build-up, before moving on to ""the grand finale"" (you may want to try a spot of finger teasing before sticking them right the way in)...... by now you should be getting like a throbbing sensation just above the entrance to the ""garage doors""..... if so, press right up against the throbbing part (either inside or outside ""the garage doors"", or inside and out at the sametime if you really wanna get it going), and rub on it (helps to start it off slowly, then gradually build up speed from there)..... and you should get a sensation almost like you gotta pee (which will be the orgasm building up)........ when you've found the spot, and start getting that sensation..... just keep stimulating it in whatever way you can imagine to make it harder to hold it back..... and the longer you can hold it back when stimulating it, the more intense it'll be when you finally blow.\n\nTry not to worry too much about it.... some women find it harder to cum than others..... just try to enjoy working on the build-up, and it'll fire away when it's ready.\n\nThere are also certain exercises that should help:\nhttp://www.geocities.com/HotSprings/Spa/4502/vagex.html"

"Everyone gets their period when they are ready, generally between the ages of 8 and 17. Don't worry about it. You should be glad it hasn't come yet, hun, cuz it is awful...But I have absolutely no idea why your doctor would say you might have to take pills because you don't have your period yet! This is perfectly normal. Everyone's body is different. I got mine when I was 12 (now I'm 14), some of my friend's got it when they were like 10, and others haven't gotten it yet. It's not a big deal if you haven't had it yet. Don't worry. Talk to a female adult you can trust if you're truly paranoid about this, you need some reassurance. And, just be aware then when you do get your period it can be very irregular, you may even skip months at a time. If you don't know a whole lot about periods I would suggest talking to a female adult you can trust so you know what to expect. Don't worry, hun, you're fine and there's absolutely nothing wrong with you at all. I said it before, but it's important, just remember everyone's body is different. There is no ""right"" age to get your period or a ""correct"" cycle."

call the poison control center or e.r and ask
if the same doctor prescribed the medications, it is probably okay but always ask if you arent sure.  \n\nif it was two different doctors, and I am assuming it was since two are psychiatric medications and the other is general - you better ask first because the one who prescribed the tramadol may not be aware of the other medications you are on.  \n\nAlways update doctors on what medications you are taking.
I had a 'pouch' too, I decided I would do 100 sit ups a night, and every night add 5 more. After about 2 weeks i saw a reduction, 4 weeks and it was gone. I didn't change my diet at all, and it wasn't really THAT bad, but maybe if I had I would have seen a bigger change sooner.\n\nSo my advice to you is to follow that exercise plan, and cardio and low cal diets will only make it go faster. Although, you should know that it does vary per-person.
"Well, google ""smoking benefits"" and there are a couple pages. Apparently smoking is associated with lowered risks of Parkinsons and Alzheimers and certain types of cancer. Nicotine can be  therapeutic for schizophrenia. And of course, there are the immediate benefits of smoking, which are the reasons people do it: pleasure, mental stimulation / mood lift, weight loss / maintaining a lower weight."

Take a hot bath, wrap yourself up in very heavy blankets (it will sweat your body out and release the toxins that are causing you to feel so badly). Drink hot herbal tea with lemon every hour or so. Avoid spicy food or cold drinks -anything that will aggravate it as sometimes colds can go to the throat too. Rest your head but sleep in an upright position so that you can rest easier. Get plenty of vitamin c and water. Honey also has some healing effects and can be good on warm toast. Soup is also perfect. But I don't recommend taking anything otc as nowadays they are having so many recalls (like the recent one on acetominiphin pain reliever pills). Just let it run its course and be sure to stay warm and keep your head and feet warm and dry. You'll feel better gradually but sleep, fuids, and rest are best.
I started smoking 9 years ago when I was 14.  Both of my parents smoked and I hated them for it.  So why did I decide to smoke?  Because everyone else was... or so I thought.  I wanted to be rebellious and show my friends that I wasn't afraid to do bad things.  I'd imagine that's part of the reason young people like us start smoking.  Fortunately I was able to quit for some time, but picked it back up because I am addicted.  I wish I'd never started in the first place, it's truly an awful habit, and even more awful to break.  Just remind yourself how awesome you are for not smoking, and let others make their own mistakes.  They'll eventually realize it was a bad choice.  I know I did.
There is no evidence that the sprays containing antiperspirant ingredients are the only ones with cancer causing properties.  This applies to any product (including sticks) that contains an antiperspirant ingredient (e.g. aluminum salts).  I would recommend using a deodorant only product, this suffices for most.  If you have severe underarm sweating, ask your physician about Botox injections (they decrease sweating under the arms).
You may have a bladder infection or it could be due to some medications you are taking.  Some medications, especially antibiotics, tend to discolor your urine and give it a noticeble odor.
I Dunno..but it sure does smell!
It comes with Chenye-Stokes breathing which happens as a person is dying. They take little gasps of air then there is a long pause then another attempt to breath followed by another pause and so on until they stop. The secretions gather in the throat and when they try to breath it makes a rattling sound.  It doesn't happen to everyone. I was having a conversation with a patient one day when all of a sudden her eyes rolled back in her head and she went white. She was dead within a few seconds. She died of a pulmonary embolism.
Not real sure what you're looking for, but yes, they sometimes go together.

"Almost any unresolved mental trauma will reduce the brain's ability to function. Most people can remember only recent traumas, but these are often related to stuff that can be years old & lost to conscious memory, but the brain is still trying to deal with it.\n\nThink of it like your computer running a whole load of unnecessary software. It slows down performance. The difference with the brain is that anything similar to the unresolved issue goes straight into the ""I can't handle it"" area.\n\nUnresolved stuff still goes round in the memory & takes up capacity as the brain tries to come to terms with it. Once you're able to face meories of the trauma without it causing fear, then it is resolved & will release memory capacity & function again. \n\nCounselling clients have completely changed as a result of resolving past traumas, childhood stuff often gets stuck there. I've seen a guy who had a 40 year old incident resolved & suddenly he could do normal stuff he'd only dreamed of."

Background: Epileptic seizures have been recognized for millennia. One of the earliest descriptions of a secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizure was recorded over 3000 years ago in Mesopotamia. The seizure was attributed to the god of the moon. Epileptic seizures were described in ancient cultures, including those of China, Egypt, and India. An ancient Egyptian papyrus described a seizure in a man who had previous head trauma. Hippocrates wrote the first book about epilepsy almost 2500 years ago. He rejected ideas regarding the divine etiology of epilepsy and concluded that the cause was excessive phlegm that caused abnormal brain consistency. Hippocratic teachings were forgotten, and divine etiologies again dominated beliefs about epileptic seizures during medieval times. Even at the turn of the last century, excessive masturbation was considered a cause of epilepsy. This hypothesis is credited as leading to the use of the first effective anticonvulsants, ie, bromides. \n\nModern investigation of the etiology of epilepsy began with the work of Fritsch, Hitzig, Ferrier, and Caton in the 1870s. They recorded and evoked epileptic seizures in the cerebral cortex of animals. In 1929, Berger discovered that electrical brain signals could be recorded from the human head by using scalp electrodes; this discovery led to the use of electroencephalography (EEG) to study and classify epileptic seizures. Gibbs, Lennox, Penfield, and Jasper further advanced the understanding of epilepsy and developed the system of the 2 major classes of epileptic seizures currently used. An excellent historical review of seizures and epilepsy, written by E. Goldensohn, was recently published in the journal Epilepsia to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the creation of the American Epilepsy Society.

I've been in the clinic for 3 1/2 years and I've been detoxing for a while now.  Don't do it to fast it can be really dangerous.  Try going down the way I am, I drop down 2 mgs every other day for three weeks, then I take a break for two weeks.  That way its not such a shock to your body.  This has worked great for me and I've had 14 friends get off methadone and stay off this way.   You could also call a doctor or a drug help line(you don't have to tell them your name).  I don't know if they could help but it would be worth a try.  Good Luck!!!  If all else fails maybe you could try the program.  But I would try on my own first if I were you, just be careful.  If you start to feel bad you can always go back up for a few days.
"I have a friend whom I've known all my life, who got really hairy around your age. He also went bald by 20.  People made fun of him in high school as well.\n\nLike him, you just happen to have a lot of testosterone.  It makes you hairy all over except where you want it.\n\nHe works out and has a good body, but he goes shirtless in the summer and nobody comments on his abundance of hair.  He shaves the fringe of his hair, so he is completely bald now.  He recently remarried, and his new wife loves his body.  \n\nI can see how you could be confused by your abundance of body hair, considering that you never see lead actors with chest hair anymore. I don't know why they all shave their chests.  Of course, if you shaved everything off now, the conspicuous absence of your hair will raise even more questions.  If you want a reason to shave your body hair, join the swim team and you will probably be required to shave your chest, legs, arms, etc.  However, if you do this, you may probably have to shave your head as well. If you think you are going to go bald and want to hang on to your hair for as long as possible, this may be a problem for you.\n\nJust accept the fact that you are probably more well advanced in your manhood than the rest of the other guys.  Hey, look on the bright side: having all that testosterone means you have really strong ""swimmers"" as well, if you know what I mean!"
Every good exercise program has components of stretching, cardio, and strength training.  You can accomplish the same on an elliptical that you would on a treadmill, but quicker and with low impact (easier on leg joints).  Plus you'll also tone your upper body.  If you want to do crunches there's a safe and effective piece of fitness equipment called a hyperextension (roman chair).  It's great for improving obliques, abdominals, and back muscles.  You don't really say what you're trying to accomplish, so I made some assumptions.

Bananas are a big favorite, as are avocados.  I even mixed them together with a tiny bit of lemon juice & my twins loved it.  Applesauce, cream of wheat, potatoes, green beans, carrots (pureed with cinnamon & a teeny bit of orange juice is a favorite at our house).  The big thing is to introduce new foods slowly (every 2-3 days) just in case she has a reaction.  Also, buy organic as much as you can -- those pesticides go a long way in a tiny little body.  You may want to check out a book called Super Baby Food that a lot of moms love for nutritional info and baby food recipes.
Sweetie, you need to go back tot the ortho and have them snip that wire for you.  They have the proper tools for that and it won't take but a minute for them to fit you in and take care of it for you.  If you have any wax, you may want to put that on until you get to the ortho.  Give them a call as soon as possible because the longer you wait, the worse it will tear up your mouth.

"I think you meant to say ""How did the disease diabetes get its name?"" but no matter.

I am so sorry you are going through such a hard time right now. Also i can not promise you that you do not have HIV. What i can say is that it is very unlikely. Even if she has HIV and you slept with her only once you may have caught it but more likely you have not caught it. Try to think of it like this: a women who is trying to fall pregnant may fall pregnant first time but more often she has to make a few attempts before she falls pregnant. HIV is a bit like that also. I hope it all goes well for you and please remember to use a condom in the future. All the best and take care. xx

Aorta is the largest artery in the body, the aorta arises from the left ventricle of the heart, goes up. ( ascends ) a little ways, bends over (arches), then goes down (descends) through the chest and through the abdomen to where ends by dividing into two arteries called illac arteries that goes to the legs.\n\nAnatomically, the aorta is traditionally divided into the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and descending aorta. \n     The descending aorta is, in turn, subdivided into the thoracic aorta (thatdecends with the chest) and the abdominal aorta (that decends with the belly.) \n\nThe aorta gives off branches that goes to the head neck, the arms, the major organs in the chest and abdomen, and legs. It serves to supply them all oxygenated blood. The aorta is the central conduit from the heart to the body.
Eating or drinking sugar does not cause diabetes..Family history,being over weight, lack of exercise..is the main reasons people get it.\nWhen you have diabetes your body doesn't produce and or use insulin properly,,That is why a person with diabetes has to watch what food/drinks they consume..because their body doesn't use insulin the way ..say yours does.. \n If you don't have major risk factors for it 4 teaspoons of sugar a day will not cause you to have diabetes..If you want a good alternative to real sugar try splenda..it tastes just like real sugar...I use it in my kids kool-aid and they love it. Also my mom used to be a sugar hound and I gave her a bag of splenda last year and she hasn't bought real sugar again..she even bakes with it.. Give it a try..it is pretty pricey compared to regular sugar,but worth it!!

Hi Rufus\n\nHere is some techniques to heal your condition.\n\nCauses of Sinusitis\n\nOver the course of the last few decades, there has been an increase in the incidence of sinusitis in the U.S. and other industrialized nations that is directly related to a corresponding increase in air pollution and unhealthy indoor air, making unhealthy air and air pollution the two main factors of sinusitis. Other environmental causes of sinusitis include cold and flu viruses, bacterial and fungal infections, excessively cold or dry air, cigarette smoking, and regular exposure to secondhand smoke.\n\nSinusitis can also be caused or exacerbated by food allergies and sensitivities, dental and gum disease, stress, lowered immunity, structural problems within the nasal cavities (such as a deviated septum), nasal cysts and/or polyps, and unresolved emotions, especially anger. Candiasis (systemic yeast overgrowth) and the overuse of pharmaceutical drugs, especially antibiotics, are two other common causes of sinusitis.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNatural Cures\nAromatherapy: Inhaling the steamed vapors of the essential oils camphor, eucalyptus, lavender, lemon, pine, or tea tree can help improve breathing and aid in fighting infection. \n\nDiet:If you suffer from sinusitis, you need to be screened for food allergies and sensitivities, and then avoid eating those foods that you are allergic or sensitive to. In addition, avoid all sugar and sugar products, wheat and wheat byproducts, soy products, soft drinks, commercially processed foods, and all foods containing artificial ingredients, such as additives, colorings, flavorings, and preservatives (such as BHA, BHT, sodium nitrite, sulfites, saccharin, aspartame, and cyclamates). Also minimize your intake of milk and dairy products, and coffee and other caffeine products, as well as red meat, salt, refined carbohydrates (white breads, pastries, commercial pastas), corn, chocolate, and unhealthy fats (hydrogenated or trans fats).\n\nDrink plenty of pure, filtered water (at least eight ounces every two hours; or for best results, add fresh squeezed lemon juice and a dash of cayenne pepper) and fresh squeezed, organic vegetable juices throughout the day, as well as hot broths and soups. Diluted organic pear juice can also be helpful, in order to loosen up lung congestion. Also emphasize organic, whole foods, especially plenty of fresh, raw organic fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, organic, free-range meats and poultry, and wild-caught fish. Garlic, cayenne pepper, chili peppers, horseradish, and onions should be eaten regularly, due to their powerful health benefits for the lungs and respiratory system. Organic, extra virgin olive oil should also be used liberally.\n\nAccording to leading naturopathic physician and researcher Joseph E. Pizzorno, N.D., President Emeritus of Bastyr University, a vegan diet can significantly improve symptoms of most respiratory conditions, including pneumonia. Such a diet involves eliminating all animal products, as well as fish, eggs, milk, and all other dairy products. Grains should also be avoided, or eaten in minimal amounts. Dr. Pizzorno advises limiting your fluid intake to pure, filtered water (avoid chlorinated, fluoridated tap water), and emphasize plenty of fresh, organic fruits and vegetables, especially romaine lettuce, carrots, beets, onions, celery, cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, cucumber, radishes, Jerusalem artichokes, beans (except soy and green peas), blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, cloudberries, black currants, gooseberries, plums, and pears. Apples and citrus fruits (except lemon) are not recommended, however.\n\nHerbs: Useful herbs for treating and preventing sinusitis include Echinacea, elder flowers, ephedra, eyebright, garlic, goldenrod, goldenseal, horseradish, Oregon grape, pokeroots, purple cornflower, stinging nettle, wild indigo, and yarrow.\n\nHomeopathy:\n\nArsenic

Food for Diarrhoea patients - Milk is not good as the lactose contents is the sugar commonly found in cow’s milk based formulas will not control loose motion. For breast feeding babies however it can be continued, since it is their main food. Others can have food as under-\n\nHigh energy foods such as fats, yogurt and cereals are quite well absorbed during diarrhoea. Small, frequent feeds of energy-rich local foods familiar to the child should be given. A little vegetable oil can be added to foods such as millet or rice to increase the energy content.\nFoods high in potassium are important to restore the body's essential stores depleted during diarrhoea. Such foods include lentils, bananas, mangoes, pineapples, pawpaw and citrus fruits.\n\nCertain foods should be avoided during diarrhoea, for example those containing a lot of fibre such as coarse fruits and vegetables, whole grain cereals and spicy foods. \nIt is very important to continue feeding a person with diarrhoea. Give soft, easy-to-digest foods, like khichri, watery dal, idlis, curd, bananas etc.\n\nYou should also give plenty of other fluids, like lemonade], rice kanji, lassi, coconut water, weak tea etc. If the baby is being breast-fed, continue to give her mother's milk.\n\nGive an extra meal a day, after the diarrhoea stops, to help the body get strong again-.
I have been asthmatic since i was 1 year old (39 yrs), i think i can honestly say been and done, tested about every inhaler over the years, from high to low doses!

Sometimes they can even be dangerous. \n\nOne day a person with bipolar disorder may feel so depressed that they can't get out of bed. Work may seem impossible. \n\nOn another day that person may feel great, full of endless energy and creativity. But other people might think that their actions are reckless and out of control. \n\nBipolar disorder is a lifelong medical condition that can be confusing and unpredictable, but it's nothing to be embarrassed about. Learning more about bipolar disorder can be helpful in managing this medical illness. \n\nThere are four main types of bipolar disorder: \nBipolar I Disorder \nBipolar II Disorder \nCyclothymic Disorder \nBipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified \n\n\nBipolar I Disorder - Bipolar I disorder involves one or more manic or mixed episodes, and often one or more major depressive episodes. A depressive episode may last for several weeks or months. Between episodes of bipolar I disorder, there may be periods of normal functioning. Symptoms may also be related to seasonal changes.\n\nBipolar II Disorder - Bipolar II disorder involves one or more major depressive episodes along with at least one hypomanic episode. Hypomanic episodes have symptoms similar to manic episodes but are less severe. Between episodes of bipolar II disorder, there may be periods of normal functioning. Symptoms may also be related to seasonal changes.\n \nCyclothymic Disorder - Cyclothymic disorder is a long-term fluctuating mood disturbance with periods of hypomania and periods of depression. It is a milder form of bipolar disorder. That's because the periods of both depression and hypomania are shorter, less severe, and do not occur with regularity.\n \nBipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified - This type of bipolar disorder is when the person does not fit into the types of bipolar disorder mentioned above. The experiences of bipolar disorder vary from person to person. Just like the other types of bipolar disorder, bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is treatable.
"The best solution for you is to practise meditation.\n\nThe whole aim of meditation is,\n1. to calm your mind, and\n2. to focus the mind on one thing.\n\nFor this you need only a silent place. You could sit on a chair or you could sit on the ground with folded legs.\n\nThe mind of a normal person is like an uncontrolled monkey jumping from one thought to another. To process all these thoughts a lot of body energy is used. Thus if your mind cease to process thoughts you will be saving a lot of body energy which can be used to cure a lot of ailments in your body. That is why a person who continues to meditate regularly even gets a nice body complexion.\n\nAnapana or concentration on the breath is the best form of meditation.\n\nIf you sit down and close your eyes you will notice that your mind is jumping from one thought to another. Even though you want to concentrate on your breath you will find other thoughts also coming in between.\n\nIn learning to meditate you must first learn to calm your mind. You do this by following every thought that comes into you mind. You must be like a Manager of a Hotel who stands at the entrance and observes the customers coming in. Without getting attached to the thoughts try to observe them. You will find that a thought comes in and that it goes nowhere and another thought follows it - try following that too - with same results. This way you will find that your thoughts gradually subside. Do not try to force out your thoughts.\n\nOf course do not expect results in one or two days. Practise it for at least 40 minutes every day for at least 2 months you find that you have 'killed' your train of thoughts. I have practised for nearly 2 years and still vagrant thoughts come in. \n\nThereafter start concentrating on your breath. Notice the breath coming in and going out. You should not concentrate only on the tip of your nose. Notice the breath coming in and thereafter your lungs getting filled and then gradually exhaling the breath. \n\nAfter you finish that for the day start to think of a person or several persons whom you hate most. Having those people in mind start to think in a compassionate manner ""may he be healthy, may he be happy, may he go up in life, may he live long"". Keep on doing this for about 10 minutes a day for a few months you will find that you do not get angry even when you have to get angry.\n\nYou should be able to get some guidance from the following sites,\n\n1. http://www.dhamma.org/vipassan.htm/ \n2.  http://www.meditationexpert.com/    and click on the free articles on yoga meditation - it includes articles on all types of meditations including Christian and Muslim meditation."
shoot that stuff as much as you can, the more the better.
Registered Nurse here; First let me share with you, this is not my area of expertise.  However, was the physician you saw a ophthalmologist (eye surgeon)?  If not make an appointment and see a Doctor that specializes in only diseases, and abnormalities of the eye.  Go for a second opinion if the initial physician was a ophthalmologist.  I do believe you can be helped with your eye problem. \nThanks for the opportunity to address such a important question.
It's physically okay if you lose more than 2 pounds a day. You should do a healthy diet and plenty of excercise.
That's very unprofessional of him to do that. Why didn't you stop him and insist that he put fresh gloves on?\nYou could get HIV, if the infected blood (if it was infected) got inserted into your blood.\nThe only way to be sure is to be tested for it, then again in another 6 months.\nJust a reminder, ALWAYS wear a condom.\n\nGood luck.
Lemsip - great stuff!
Probably the best time of day to wear your retainer is when you are sleeping. That way it doesn't bother you. You should probably wear your retainer at least a few times a week, while you sleep, until you don't notice anymore shifting. Teeth have a memory for a VERY long time and they will want to shift back to where they started. Good Luck!!!!
No more then any other kind. The same safety procedures should be followed. It's been reported that many young adults (high school students) are following this practice to prevent pregnancy. \n   This is in no way a way to the social structures of our society. It's not something I would want my daughters to start doing. Sex education in the classes and outside are a must today.
stop taking it up the ....?
Absolutely.  A lot of them gradually fade away as they age, although many never change at all.  It's a natural thing
Your behaviour seems perfectly normal to me.  Everybody (except self-absorbed people with narcissistic personalities) questions whether they have upset others - this is part of how humans develop self awareness.  At times we will be more or less aware of other's reactions either because we are prompted by our confidence to say more provocative things (perhaps when disinhibited by substances or hormones) or because we are in a mood where confidence is naturally low.  Hormones, fatigue, substances (such as cannabis and LSD) can create a hypersensitivity to the reactions of others at the same time as causing us to say stupid stuff.  The best way to deal with the problem is to continue developing your self awareness by continuing to engage in social interaction, preferably when sober.  Your friends clearly don't think you're pathologically stupid or insane or they would have told you so by now.  The worst thing that you can do is start to avoid situations where you experience this social anxiety because that will make it worse and you'll end up scared of your own shadow.  By feeling the fear and doing it anyway you will develop your social skills and your anxiety levels will decrease.  \n\nI work in mental health and have found that unfortunately many people with mental health problems become so dominated by the social anxiety caused by their fear of saying/doing something stupid that they don't leave the house or engage in relationships - and that really is stupid.  Social interaction, like any skill, gets better with practice.  Social isolation, like any weakness, gets worse if you let it become your dominant force.
first off-you're thirteen. don't worry about your weight. Worry about getting good grades instead, and don't sweat the small stuff. If you're looking to lose some, just eat healthier and try out for sports, ok? :) :) :)

So who doesn't? But you are intelligent enough to ask the question, just control your body instead of letting it control you. Notice how much more difficult this is for you when you feed your brain with songs about sex, visual images of sex, and locker room stories.It really is true that you can work off sexual tension with regular physical activity. Also keep busy with studies & hobbies, ie. don't let yourself get bored. \nYou do determine, to a great degree, how much of a constant battle this will be by the choices you make to either feed lust or not. I am certainly not putting you down for being a normal, red-blooded American male. Just telling you to respect your body by not getting involved sexually until you marry, and make it easier on yourself along the way by keeping a glance at a hot girl at just a glance, vs. a lingering stare that gets your motor running. Small choices are where you win or lose most of the struggles in life. A few hundred small choices add up to a ton of push in whatever direction you are headed to.Be normal AND wise with your mind & body, you will be disease-free and and free of many regrets.
I'm not a personal trainer, but have you tried changing your routine. exercise more one day and less one day the same with diet. you need to shake up your plan doing the same thing all the time can put you on a plateau.\n\nPS I just don't know why some have to be so rude,but then it's their lack of maturity and vanity.. Good Luck!!!!
Do the sniff test. Smell the hair for smoke. Breath for alc.
before you jog, do you warm up? after you jog do you stretch? It could be that your body is not use to it, if you havent done it in a while, but it could be signs of arthritis. Again, best thing...if is starts to hurt or swell, see a doctor.\ngood luck!!
You seem to have gone through some very distraught things in the past 5 years. Please don't give up yet. Whatever horrible things you've gone through, from now on, start filling your life and memories with positive things. The way our memory works is, you remember best, things that are hooked to what you already know. Therefore, if you want to forget things, best way is to not think about those things, or have things that will trigger your memory of those things. However, it is probably very difficult to avoid everything that would remind you of what you have gone through. It is therefore, better for the long run, if you learn to accept the past (yes, including the horrible things that have happened to you), and be the strong person, and live on. Don't let the past conquer you. You conquer it. The future is in your hands. You can't change the past, but you can certainly change the future.
Simple example: HIV infection will have a negative impact on your health.\n\nNegative health behaviors associated with HIV transmission include:\n1. Unprotected sexual contact\n2. Injection drug use\n\nYes, many people choose to have sex with multiple partners and not use condoms. This obviously puts them at risk for getting HIV. You can prevent HIV transmission by encouraging condom use and educating people about the dangers of HIV as well as methods for preventing it.\n\nThere are people who shoot drugs and get HIV. You can curb this as well by either getting more people into rehab, or by offering clean needle exchanges.\n\nSo that's how the process works: you locate a health problem, determine its impace, find routes of exposure and you try to cut risk factors.
You should follow your doctor's and pharmacist's directions. SR and XL are both forms of extended release tablets but they have different durations and taking them at the wrong times could put too much drug in your system for a while and then leave you high and dry. Often docs will prescribe SR two-three times a day versus XL once daily (or maybe in your case your doc wants you to take it twice daily). XL has a longer extended release.\n\nAlways check with a pharmacist if you have questions before taking a medicine, but it's probably safest to follow the instructions on the label.
"Brown bread is made from flour with out any of the outer casing of the wheat/barley/oats grains scrubbed off.  that is what makes it tan colored.  SOME brown bread is made with molasses and regualr white flour to fool us.  NOT FOOLED.  read the labels to see if it says ""Whole grain wheat flour""\nThe calories are not bad for you.  All food has calories.  You need calories to burn to stay alive.  What is healthy about brown bread, the good kind, is that those little husky bits in the flour are nourishing and good for your intestinal tract.  Help you stay 'regular' if you get my meaning.  The whiteness of white  bread is achieved by removing all those husky bits of the wheat grain and then, perish the thought, they use clorox stuff to make it white and it will never rot!!  You eat the clorox too and therefore unbleached flour is better and healthier to eat."
Change your diet NOW!!  It should be about 4.5\n\nToo much bad fat!
it sound like you may be depressed which is more common than u think, u must go to your doctor and explainhow u feel they will maybe prescribe u anti depressants,when i was depressed i was the same i would snap at people for no reason.didnt want to go anywhere,visit anyone,speak to anyone really,quite tearful for no reason,hated my life though nothing had changed to make me feel thet way,id feel adgetated and little things in daily life seemed an effort to do.thought id just tell u how i felt so if you are experiencing any of these symptoms too then u probably are depressed if your not go to your doctor anyway dont suffer alone any longer.good luck x
- eat healthier\nno fatty foods like chips, fries, candy, etc.\n- exercise more\ntake walks, jog, bicycling, swimming, etc. BUT don't forget to drink lots of water to keep you hydrated.\n- sleep well\n- avoid stress\n- DON'T BECOME BULIMIC OR ANOREXIC
I have chronic bronchitis, for years, and I know how you feel. I used to take tons of antibiotic with no help. Until.... a doctor has put me on a shot 50/50 of linkasin & depamethrol. It has saved my life. I also have a inhaler that helps tremendous. I drink hot tea or coffee when the coughing is so bad that I thought I would die, and it eases the coughing. But the shot is the trick, ask your doctor about it.If he won't do it, find a doctor that will., because it will save your life. If you smoke, try to cut back or quit, ok? I have cut back so much and feel so much better. So good luck!
NO. cause it's dishonest and they'll just laugh at you the min you undo your pants. I would suggest working on your personality to attract woman because while looks help attitude is everything. Have you ever noticed a couple walking down the street and the guy is average looking and the girl is a knock out?  it's cause whats inside count more than the outside.\n\nIf your worried about performance issues just do 2 things.\n1: become a master of oral sex\n2: Buy a vibrator to use on woman\n\nany woman will appreciate a guy who's goal is to make her cum and she will want to reciprocate.
"I'll answer what I can, but I can't answer every part of your question. If the dentures are really well-fitted, you may not need anything to hold them tight. The office I worked in always gave little tubes of Fixodent to patients when they needed something to hold them over until they'd get an adjustment on their plates. Some dentures look very natural. It all depends on the time, effort, and quality put into the product. You should be able to eat what you want to, but I'm not sure about gum. Your dentist, oral surgeon, or the dental assistants should be able to tell you what is safe and what would damage your dentures. I don't think it's any more painful to have the dentures immediately (they act as sort of a ""bandage""), but you'll be able to get away with fewer adjustments if you're able to wait until your gums heal and the swelling to go down (but that is entirely up to you, just make sure to communicate with your dentist in advance if you need the dentures immediately, or they won't be ready in time). \nI understand you're afraid, but don't hesitate to call and ask questions at your dentist or oral surgeon's office. They deal with it all the time, and can answer your questions (or arrange for a doctor or assistant to call you back to answer your questions) to help you set your mind at ease. Good luck, and I wish you the best."
it regulates menstruation but stop ovulation unless you are sick and have the runs then the oral contraceptive is useless
Plenty of good advice here.
i would advise you go back to the person who did your piercing, but since they did your initial piercing with sterling silver, then they are no good!  they should have done your initial piercing with stainless surgical steel...please find a reputable piercer in your area that uses stainless surgical steel for your initial piercing.\nin the meantime if you want to save your piercing, go find a surgical steel nose ring asap to put in from a more reputable piercing place!  a good piercing place will help you with your problem.  if not, then you will have to wait until it heals and closes up and try again through a reputable piercer.  \n\nto heal/clear up the infection, try sea salt soaks (a pinch of sea salt in 3 oz of hot tap water, soak a cotton ball and put it over your piercing for 5 minutes). it worked for me!
Um, why don't you try just going to sleep.
No big deal. If it is not too painful, it will heal fine by itself
"WE GOT THE SAME GOAL !!\nbut mine is for February.\n~ go to the gym at least 3 times each week ( 2 horus )\nIf you don't go to the gym do some excersice at home.\n~Drink water.\n~Dance while taking a shower.\n~eat normaly, but avoid as many fast food as you can.

you are probably allergic to alcohol and if so you are probably allergic to alot of other things too. You can type in joan mathews larson on the web or thiq and read more. Usually when one is allergic to alcohol they are allergic to wheat as well and dairy products good luck and watch out for allergenic/alcoholism
I doubt it.\n\nYou can get high off of smelling a permenent marker for hours.  Although some people like the smell of it, if they smell the marker, they aren't getting high, you need to REALLY work at it.  Same applies for this situation I believe.
Yes, try raising your keyboard
30 minutes of brisk walking is suggested!
Check out http://www.orthognathic.com/ for some answers.
perhaps your heater is broken
Running is the easiest way to lose weight.  If you are not fit for that yet, you can start out by walking at a brisk pace outside.  Start out with 30 minutes and build up to more as your fitness level improves.  Remember that your weight will go down for losing water and fat and it will go up for gaining muscle.  I better way to gauge your progess is with how your clothes fit.  Weight-training is also really good at boosting your metabolism.  Do some push-ups and squats everyday.  Good luck!
That is 100% normal..\n\nhere is some info on that to help explan to you why it does that..\n\nhttp://www.howtoadvice.com/Preview/Sotbutb
See your doctor.  Numbness in your legs could be related to a back problem.  It's something having to do with spinal nerves that extend into the legs. Or it could be a circulatory problem.  If you sit or stand in one position for too long, blood pools in the lower legs & you risk developing blood clots.
work out and keep to a low fat diet.
You may be a late bloomer. I wasn't able to grow a decent beard until I almost 30. Take a good look at your ansestery. If your father or grandfather did not have a beard at a young age, then there is a chance that you won't. Feel lucky. Having to shave is a real pain.
Incontinent care should be given in privacy prior to mealtime.  If a resident needs urgent incontinent care during a meal, you may respectfully assist them to a private area.  Assist with the care and back to the meal.  Reheat the meal if necessary so that it is served at the proper temperature.\n\nGiving incontinent care while the person is dining (say in thier room) most likely would be against a regulation related to dignity.
The simple answer is, because that is where you are ticklish.  Some people are ticklish on their neck, on others it is the ears, other places other people. You are a navel person.
Well I suppose if someone is that fat, it would hang over the edges and defeat the whole purpose of tanning anyways!
for the sore throat.. use warm water & some cayenne pepper... this does work.. i read it online with the herbs making you better instead of meds and when I had this sore throat it was really bad I did that and I gargle some and each time a little went down my throat.. i know it might be hot but it works...\nAlso do the hottie toddie..\n\nits warm tea, some honey, & some cheap brandy... \ndrink some of that too and that will make your throat better too and even your cold\nhope you get well soon
it's worked for me! worked wonders! i suggest using medication with them in it. for more specific, proactive has been by far the best on me. the first few weeks it pretty much cleared my face but after that my skin got accustom to it but it's a whole lot better then before! tell your sister to do some googling on proavtive. \n\nluck
If the penis is not fully erect and hard, there will always be a downward curve, it is called gravity.  Now if you have a downward curve when it is fully erect and hard, that is a different issue.
NO!  It doesn't sound safe or beneficial either.
"There are many supplements and techniques that are good for this issue. There are also medications, but those have side effects. \n\nNatural Supplement - "" 5-HTP 200mg"", which is a serotonin precursor. \n\nA low serotonin level has been linked to PE, that is why doctors prescribed anti-depressants, \n5-HTP will boost the serotonin levels naturally. \n\nIn general, practise and relaxation is all that is necessary to deal with this problem. Most men can gain better control by learning the ""start-stop"" or ""squeeze"" techniques.\n\nStop and Start method: This involves sexual stimulation until the man recognizes that he is about to ejaculate; the stimulation is then removed for about 30 seconds and then may be resumed. The sequence is repeated until ejaculation is desired.\n\nSqueeze method: This involves sexual stimulation until the man recognizes that he is about to ejaculate; at that point, the man or his partner firmly squeezes the end of the penis (where the tip meets the shaft) for several seconds, withholding further sexual stimulation for about 30 seconds, and then resuming stimulation."
Sorry, this isn't really any help, but I have the same problem.. I've been doing regular exercise, including weight training and cardio for months, with a personal trainer that I see every two weeks, and I haven't lost an ounce! My trainer says I'm probably losing fat and gaining muscle weight, and the same goes for you I'm sure, but any addiitonal weightloss has to come from a healthy diet and drinking lots of water, according to my trainer! Good luck, I know how hard it is!!!
your not fat unless your under 4 ft tall.
Hydrocortisone is a steriod cream - so please only use this if necessary\n\nMost people have them - small, white, bumps - all you can do is regularly moisturise and maybe they'll go away with time?
The bone will heal on its own.  Those are probably one of the few displaced fractures that doesn't require surgery.  I don't know how old your mom is, but those in their60's and 70's tend to heal a little slower.  Women also have the unfortunate condition called osteoporosis when they get older, which will also slow down the healing time.  \n\nLike I mentioned, not all fractures or breaks require surgical repair.  Clavicle fractures (collar bone) will be left in their broken position and sent home to follow up with an orthopaedic doctor.  I would recommend an ortho follow up, just to make sure she is healing properly and no neurological deficits occur.
you need a humidifier either in his room or on the furnace. if you already have one on the furnace it is not set high enough
"first off, Prozac is an anti-depressent. its not used for anti-anxiety. for anxiety you need meds like valium, xanax, or lorazapam. usually you dont ""cure"" depression or anxiety. you dont just take your meds for 3 months and your healed. you live with it because its YOUR emotions. its never going to go away. but you can live better thru chemistry. taking meds daily will make your life more stable. whatever chemical imbalance you have there are meds that can help you, but you have to keep taking them good luck"

Yes I watch what I eat (diabetic)\nI eat 3 meals and 3 snacks.  I keep the fat and sugar content  low and have lots of fresh fruit and veg (organic when possible).  I eat small portions of meat and oily fish twice a week.  I dont eat eggs or cheese very often.
It isn't the feet themselves.  It is moisture (sweat, not drying properly after a shower) that allows smelly bacteria to multiply.  It may also be a sign of an infection (bacterial or fungal) but that is usually accompanied by flaking skin, itching or yellowing nails and or discharge from the nail beds.  Dry feet (powdering helps) won't smell.  And keep shoes dry also.  Let them air out and if they are funky, Febreeze 'em.

It sounds like you have a form of anxiety along with post-partum depression. You need to see a therapist who can help recommend treatments (both drugs and therapy) to help you deal with the anxiety. \nYour boyfriend isn't helping with his comment about it being all in your head. This is a legitimate disorder and you need help. He needs to be more supportive.\nIf you have a support system in place, such as family and friends, get help with the baby. \nI also have to wonder if your history has a clue to this: did your mom or dad get ill and was unable to care for you? Is there a history of mental illness in the family? Go see a therapist ASAP for both your sake and your child's.

It is very hard to be 14. Your whole body is changing, some parts slowly and other parts at a high rate of speed. The only solution to your difficulties is time, unfortunately. Eventually your penis (which is quite large) will settle down and not bother you so much, and then you will be able to enjoy erections. But for now, there's nothing to do but try to keep your mind busy elsewhere. If you are working hard at schoolwork or a volunteer position, you will have less empty time to worry about the odd things your body is doing. Good luck - you'll be fine as soon as this crazy time of your life settles down.
See a doctor to find out. That's the best thing to do right now and that's what I would do if it were me. Good luck!
Of course, fad diets aren't healthy or wise, but sometimes they are necessary in an emergency! : )\n\nMy friends and I will eat nothing but salads, tuna, lean chicken, and broccoli when we need to lose weight FAST.\n\nThe salads should be greens, veggies, and clear dressing (Italian, Greek, etc)...no cheese, white dressings, or croutons.\nWe eat tuna right outa the can, but you can mix a lil lo-fat mayo & mustard in.\nThe chicken should be grilled.\nTh broccoli should be steamed or boiled with very little butter. \nBasically we do a strict No Carb crash diet.\n\nGood luck!
My period is very heavy the first 3 to 4 days and last for 6 to 7=( I know how you feel. I was scared of tampons firsts myself. Then I turned 23 and figured what do I have to lose since TSS is so rare. Always use the absorbency that matches your flow and try to swith during the lighter days interchanging with pads. Calm your fears, hon. There is also this new method using a cup. There is one in particular named of all things the Diva Cup and another which is more easily found in drugstores named conveniently...Instead. It can get messy, as it stored the blood instead of absorb it (making it inconvenient if you are just starting out,, but as with tampons practice makes perfect). You should try that. If inserted properly you shouldn't feel a thing=)
"Infectious mononucleosis (also known in North America as mono, the kissing disease, or Pfeiffer's disease, and more commonly known as glandular fever in other English-speaking countries) is a disease seen most commonly in adolescents and young adults, characterized by fever, sore throat, muscle soreness and fatigue (symptoms of a common cold or allergies). It is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which infects B cells (B-lymphocytes), producing a reactive lymphocytosis and the atypical T cells (T-lymphocytes).\n\nThe virus is typically transmitted from asymptomatic individuals through blood or saliva (hence ""the kissing disease""), or by sharing a drink with friends/family, eating utensils, being coughed on, or being in close proximity of an infected person. The disease is far more contagious than is commonly thought. However, in rare cases a person may have a high tolerance to infection[citation needed].\n\nThe disease is so-named because the count of mononuclear leukocytes (white blood cells with a one-lobed nucleus) rises significantly. There are two main types of mononuclear leukocytes: monocytes and lymphocytes. They normally account for about 35% of all white blood cells. With infectious mononucleosis, it can become 50-70%. Also, the total white blood count may increase to 10000-20000 per cubic millimeter."
First of all if it is red and swollen it is showing signs of inflammation. So more than likely you have an infection in the toe that may be coming from the fungus that is in your toenail.  Also, you need to soak your feet in Epsom salt until you see your doctor.
I have taken Keflex for infection before I had a root canal on an infected tooth.  The key is to take the medication for at least a week before you go back to the dentist, so that the infection has time to be eliminated before any dental work is done.

Workers' compensation laws are created entirely by the legislature, so what benefits you are entitled to receive depend on the laws in your state.  Workers' Comp is supposed to be a compromise that allows employers to have some limit on liability in exchange for worker protections in case of work injuries.  For example, if there were no workers' comp laws, an employer could simply avoid liability for work injuries by going out of business and leave the worker holding the bag for medical bills and lost wages.   In exchange for this protection for workers most states do not allow workers to sue the employer, other than for workers' comp benefits, except in very limited circumstances. (like intentional injuries or violations of certain safety requirements)  The law usually does provides for some type of award of compensation for permanent impairment.  In Ohio, it's called a permanent partial disability award.  That gives you some award of compensation to account for permanent residuals of the allowed conditions in your claim.  There are also additional awards if you lose the use of a bodypart, such as an arm, leg or finger.  Unfortunately, there is no specific award for pain and suffering.   Good luck and best wishes for a full recovery.
LOL.  I highly doubt he would not be able to feel his own fart, if another had felt the rumble.  Was there a smell afterward?  If there was no tell tale fart smell, maybe it wasn't a fart.  Otherwise, I think he's just not fessing up.
Warts Treatment\nSelf-Care at Home\nHome care is effective in making the wart or warts go away. No matter what technique you use, warts will disappear 60-70% of the time. Techniques may be done with or without medication. \n\nThe ultimate goal of the medical therapies (not the surgical treatments) is to get your body to recognize the wart as something foreign and to destroy it, much like the body destroys a cold virus.\n\nAdhesive tape therapy \n\nPlace several layers of waterproof adhesive tape over the wart region (even duct tape). Do not remove the tape for 6 1/2 days. Then take off the tape and open the area to the air for 12 hours. Reapply tape for another 6 1/2 days. \nThe tape works best in the region around the fingernail. This area may scar if cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen is used. Scarring could lead to permanent nail disfiguration. \nTape works because the airtight, moist environment under the tape does not allow the virus to grow and reproduce. \nSalicylic acid therapy \n\nSalicylic acid is available by many different trade names at the drug store. It comes either as a liquid to paint on the wart or as a plaster to be cut out and placed on the wart tissue. \nThe area with the wart should be soaked in warm water for 5-10 minutes. The wart should then be pared down with a razor. A simple plastic razor works fine for this, then throw it away. Do not shave far enough to make the wart bleed. \nApply the salicylic acid preparation to the wart tissue. Do not apply it to other skin because of salicylic acid's potential to injure normal tissue. \nFollow directions on the package for how long to apply the acid. \nIf you have genital warts , see a doctor. The treatments described here are not appropriate for genital warts and should not be used.\n\nMedical Treatment\nIn addition to recommending the home care treatments, such as taping and salicylic acid, the doctor may typically choose to treat the wart more aggressively. \n\nLiquid nitrogen: Liquid nitrogen or cryotherapy is used to deep freeze the wart tissue. With liquid nitrogen applied to the wart, the water in the cells expands, thus exploding the infected tissue. The exploded cells can no longer hide the human papillomavirus from the body's immune system. The immune system then works to destroy the virus particles.\nLaser therapy: Lasers are simply very intense light sources. This light has an enormous amount of energy that heats the tissue enough that it vaporizes.\nSurgical removal: Surgery may be necessary when other treatment methods fail. This would involve numbing the region around the wart and cutting out the wart.\n\nI'm not sure about the spreading part, but i'm going to say yes. A wart develops when a human papillomavirus infects the outermost layer of skin and causes the skin cells to grow rapidly. The virus can then spread from an existing wart to other areas of the body, causing more warts. Various types of this virus thrive in warm, moist environments such as showers, locker room  \n\nI take care of my own.  I used the dr schol's one and then pulled the rest of it off and then pulled out the core.. the core looks like a long black core.
yes it has a distinct smell, but it isnt that strong.  Just wash whatever it is on and you'll be fine.  Maybe spray something like febreeze
See an opthamologist. \nI never heard of that one,  sorry.
Be careful you might turn into the Hulk.
of course your bowels need to be cleaned.  but first of all why do you feel the need?  if you are having a lot of digestive issues, then you should do a cleanse.  you can get one in your local natural health store.  most will be about 12-15 days long.  you will take herbal supplements and eat a diet that cuts out sugar, dairy , wheat and most acidic foods.  lots of brown rice, veggies and salmon.  you will spend the first few days on the toilet but by the end of the cleanse feel great.  then when you start to introduce the stuff you werent eating back into your diet, you will be able to feel your reactions to these foods and decide if you are having problems with them.  if it is a serios problem with your bowel, i would consider contacting a colon hydro therapist ( look in the yellow pages) and getting hydro therapy that way.  you will fast for a few days and then have your bowel pumped full of water to be cleansed.  sounds gross but is really great results.
"That depends on what you mean by effective. If the ""effect"" you want is to gain cardiovascular health (heart health) than yes you should be slightly out of breath. You don't want to be gasping though. Especially when you first start working out. After a week or two, depending on many times a week you are exercising, it will not be as pronounced. If you are just focusing on building muscular strength you don't necessarily need to become out of breath."
"Cancer is really 180+ diseases under the same name. Different types of cancer that affect different organs can and do have a different Mode Of Action (MOA) in many cases. As with many diseases a complete and total cure is not at hand. \n\n1000's of scientists have wrote research papers, 1000's of experiments done, and great progress has been made. You are  likely to be living 5 years from now if you are told ""you have cancer"". Thirty years ago most told the same thing died within 5 years. \n\nAs one scientist said sometime ago: ""you will not be walking down the street some day and read a headline that says --scientists find cure for cancer--"". Rather we will chip away at it slow but sure"". It is impossible to cure 180 diseases all at once.\n\nOther issues such as early detection will be just as important as cures for this disease. The problem with cancer is that most of the time when symptoms appear for the first time it has already spread. This is why it is important to educate the public to be on the look out for early signs especially if someone  has a family history of cancer.\n\nIf you recieved severe sunburn before age 18, have a dermatologist check your skin once a year. Women over 50 should have yearly mamograms. If you don't smoke, don't start. If you do smoke, try to quit.     \n\nMany of the treatments today, although not an outright cure, can make this disease manageable. I hope that in the near future better public education, early detection, and therapies that offer management of cancer will help in the fight. \n\nMaybe I can summerize by saying that a complete and total cure is not a ""one-shot"" deal. Attacking cancer from several different angles sems the best idea at least for now. As for the long term future --  we can always hope."
You need to keep your filter changed frequently, vacuum out your vents and do an air exchange at least monthly.  \n\nThe air exchange is something that our allergist introduced us to.  You simply open all of your windows for about 30 minutes, turn on the ceiling fans (if you have them) and turn the fan on the air conditioner on.  This is supposed to let out the old air and bring in fresh air.  \n\nWe have to use the a/c at home because we all have asthma and allergies.  We have a hard time breathing if we just use the windows.
Sure, if you can afford it.  Isn't it kind of sad that it's cheaper to eat junkfood than stuff that's good for you?  Organic food is absolutely, 100% better for you...but you'll spend A LOT.\n\nAnd by the way, screw you for giving me a thumbs down.  You know what you can do with that thumb?  I'll give you two guesses, and the first one don't count.\n\nAnd dude, where do you get your facts about there not being evidence to show organic food is better for you?  You're the same kind of person who buys generic diapers that leak and say it's 'cause your kid's allergic to Pampers or 'cause there's no difference when plainly there is.  Some things cost more for a reason.  But you go ahead and enjoy your deep fried processed mayonaisse.  Seeya in the morgue.
The rule of thumb is:\n\nWhen you are having sex, see a GYN.  If your Pap-test is clear, you can miss like 2 years...otherwise you are supposed to have one every year.\n\nIf you are already having sex, it won't be a big deal for you.  The exam is short and to the point.
control.....key word.  i've been struggling for many, many years with the same issue.  at 16 i thought i was overweight. i wasn't. i am now though.  i lost control. \nif a doctor hasn't found a medical condition, than you must have faith in yourself.   talk to the person in the mirror and tell her that you are there to take over.  be strong for her and you'll be surprised how good it will make you feel to help her conquer the struggle together.\neat right and get up and move something, or somewhere.  walk or run two steps, five steps, ten.  it will improve each day.  don't set yourself with a time limit.  it didn't get there that quick and it won't go away that quick either.  if you watch t.v., stop and do something else.  the people on t.v. aren't just sitting there, are they?   \ndo it for YOU.
I was going to write a considered answer, but it would just be wasted.  Unless the next person inserts the entire shower cubicle into her reproductive canal, I doubt that it's gonna happen.

Collagen protein is not better than other proteins. Collagen protein is manufactured in your body to repair tendons, cartilage, and other connective tissue. Eating regular whey protein will give your body what it needs to make collagen. you do not need to take collagen unless you are older say around 50-60 or you have tendonosis or tendinitis.\n\nCollagen protein is not better than other protein and i wouldn't suggest using it as a supplement.\n\nto get more info on it go to www.bodybuilding.com
"Withdrawal symptoms from Coke (or any other caffeinated drink) is a definite reality. Thankfully, withdrawal symptoms are usually gone after 5-7 days.\n\nThere are two ways to answer the rest of your question. Are non-caffeinated drinks as healthy as drinking water? Purely from a hydration perspective, ""yes"" drinks like Crystal Light are an acceptable alternative to drinking water. If you are trying to lose weight, Crystal Light could be a negative IF you are drinking a lot of it in a day. \n\nYou could try the sugar-free powder drinks to cut out the calories. I personally prefer stevia (especially the liquid form). It is totally natural and has no aftertaste. But if you can't find it, I'd recommend Splenda over products like NutraSweet and Sweet and Low. There are less reports of negative side effects."
no... proper diet..  oxy pads..  careful cleansing of your face using non drying creams...  drinking water and sweating work much better than this expensive product.\n\nmost products that you must apply to the face clog pores.\n\nuse oxy and do drink more water.. stay away from foods that have to much chemicals...  \n\nexercise with much perspiration is a great way to clean the pores.. of course using a dry towel and wiping in circular motions...   and showering afterwards does help and is much cheaper.\n\nand works better.\n\nafter steam cleaning a face use again a dry towel and wipe in circular motions.
Longer than 2-3 days.  It's really 5-7 days.  Can be even longer if you have been abusing them for a long time.
Make an appointment with a qualified psychiatrist as soon as possible because your voices are giving you the kind of advice that can lead to serious legal troubles.
"GO TO YOUR DOCTOR!!!!  \n\nYou are NOT at risk for swelling your throat shut!\n\nThere is NO reason to wait it out/suffer! A good doctor will put you on steroids (such as Prednisone) for 14 to 21 days! (less time will lead to a rebound of your symptoms thus making you feel worse!).  With the steroid your rash will markedly deminish and you will feel better and look better!\n\nRemember that urushiol poisoning (i.e. poison ivy/oak) is NOT contagious! In other words you cannot transmit it to someone else via your rash! The urushiol toxin is tranmissible by direct contact with the sap/leaf of the plant. This sap stays on your clothes, pet hair etc. (wash all effected clothing in hot, soapy water!). The urushiol binds within 10 minutes of contact so if you KNOW you just brushed up against the plant wash IMMEDIATELY otherwise you are ""screwed!""  You will not know you have been otherwise effected until 3 days post exposure when the rash appears.  This is special type of allergic reaction that, unlike hives, does not begin for 48 to 72 hours (it's called a Type 4 reaction and involves your T cells but you can look that up if you want).  It usually starts at the site of exposure but can spread any/everywhere on the body.  Benedryl/Vistiril helps with itching but steroids are needed for true relief! (just remember that if your doctor puts you on less than a 14 day course he/she doesn't know what they are doing regarding this allergic type reaction!). Steroid cream and antihistamine creams are also useful but do NOT use a high potency steroid on your face unless you like a lot of redness and possibly cataracts!\nIn the future there are several products on the market that help prevent the rash by creating a barrier on you skin.  \nAlso, be extremely careful when burning wood for a campfire. The worst cases of urushiol exposure I have seen came from the smoke of unwitted burning of poison Ivy/oak leaves/branches! The person inhaled some of the stuff and you can imagine how bad off they were...\n\nGood Luck! I hope this helps!\n\nGreg M.D."

Kegel exercises are the main way to increase vaginal tone.  Gently tighten the muscles of your pelvic floor as if you were trying to stop the flow of urine or a bowel movement.  Hold for 5-10 seconds, then release.  Repeat 5 times, three times a day at first, then slowly increase the number.  \n\nThese exercises will also help reduce swelling and reduce the risk of complications later on, like urinary dribbling and incontinence.
Sometimes when I eat before I go to bed I have bad dreams, try to notice it there was a pattern.  If not I think you are pretty much just worried about him because you can't tell if he is ok all the time.  There is nothing wrong but your worried, even if you think your not you are, you trust him so just relax, and put your worries to ease.
Multiple system atrophy, or MSA, has no cure. It is a degenerative disorder of the brain that is neither hereditary nor due to another condition. If he has a firm diagnosis then encourage him to get his affairs in order, and spend time with each other. I'm sorry.
"I have this same problem FREQUENTLY as I have a really bad neck/back...\n\nI took some of the ""bio-freeze"" gel that my chiropractor gave me (you can use any muscle-rub) and rubbed that in really well.  Once you feel that starting to work, put an ice pack on your neck.  (Never put an ice pack DIRECTLY on your skin, place a damp washcloth between you and the pack) Leave the ice pack for approx 20 min or so.\nThen I took an electric massage pillow that I have and placed that behind my neck and set on ""low"" for approx 10 min.\nThe Tylenol ""Arthritis"" is what you really want to take for a stiff neck. It really worked for me.\n\nThe only difference between this and what my chiropractor does for me is the massager there is a bit stronger and I don't get a ""re-alignment"" at home!  \nIf you do this regimen for a day or so, the pain should go away.  Remember that at the times that your neck feels pretty good and you notice you have more flexible rotation (usually right after doing these steps), do some slow-steady neck stretches and turn your head from side-to-side. This helps to loosen up the ""knots"".\n\nGood Luck!"
start exercising crazily. and since ur short, u don't have to worry about ur height. since i'm tall and i'm 15, i can't lift any weight. if i do i become short, or lose my growth. but since ur short, u can lift any weight u want with no worry.
your only 14 . you are still developing. eat healthy foods rich in protein. eggs are a good food for that. eat calcium such as cheese , drink milk. any dairy products . if you can exercise all your body. run , ride a bike. swim that is excellent for building the muscles and stamina .Your body metabolism may keep your Skinner /slim all your life. you will still grow for a few more  years till you are 21.If you are meant to be thin you are lucky.look at your family. If any one or several are slim then you may be also.
Breakfast should ideally be the largest meal of the day to provide fuel for the day.  Unfortunately in our current civilisation this rarely happens.\n\nYou should also eat 6 small meals a day, and many people, myself included, advise avoiding carbs after 4pm.\n\nI would suggest eating a bigger breakfast, make sure you have a good healthy lunch, and have a small evening meal of grilled meat and salad or fish and salad.\n\nWhen you skip meals, you body gears itself for famine and slows the metabolism, which is not what you want.\n\nAt your age, you can get away with it, but as you get older (and that happens to us all) you will find it harder.  Develop GREAT eating habits NOW and they will last you a lifetime.
"I am 5'4"" 145 pounds and a 55 year old grandmother. I have no idea what my measurements are. I haven't taken them in decades! I know as one gets older one's butt tends to disappear and flatten out. My point is, as we have kids and age, our bodies change. That does not mean you can't change some of it, but be realisitc with your ""ideal.""\n\nThere is one basic principle for weight loss-burn more calories than you eat. Exercise burns calories and shapes the muscles, so that is a good thing.\n\nHere are some basic tips for reducing calories.\n\nRead food labels. \nLook for foods that are low in fat, low in calories, high in fiber.\nAvoid most processed foods. \nPIck low fat or non-fat alternatives.\nStay away from ALL fast food. One normal fast food meal has all the fat and calories you need for an ENTIRE DAY. This goes for fried chicken and fish, pizza, hamburgers, etc.\nPlan your meals the day before so you have healthy choices.\nEat more fruit and vegetables, at least 5 servings a day, more is better.\nAvoid all things with white flour and white sugar in them.\nSoups that have lots of veggetables in broth are good. Creamed soups are not. \nNo chips, unless they are baked. Pay attention to the serving amounts on the package. \nGo easy on rice,.pasta and bread. 1/2 cup (measure it) is a serving for rice and pasta!!!\n\nGood luck! I have found that Weight Watchers works for me."
In short (excuse the pun), no. In fact, they are herbal and thus not evaluated by the FDA.\nBy the way, speaking as a 53 year old guy, I can tell you that with most women, size doesnt matter. In fact, one woman I talked to told me her husband was hung like a horse and she hadnt had an orgasm in months. It's not the size of the boat, but the motion of the ocean.
I get a mix of all three times with the way my schedule is.  I would have to say I enjoy running at night because it seems like the times passes much quicker and my sides never hurt from running.  But I know the morning is the best time to go for weight loss.  I do love the way it feels AFTER a morning workout( which I do on Sundays) and then I have the whole rest of the day to go with my heart feeling great!
i have it....I had the surgery done..it allowed me to get back to my life...I still have a few problems,but I just wear a brace for a few days and ice it
I would talk to the head of Human Resources and tell them that you want the insurance to stop being pulled out of your check until all the paper work is done and tell her you either want a refund on the money that has already been taken or to get additional weeks with nothing taken out to make up for the month and a half worth of payments with no insurance!  I would be furious! What are the other employees saying? Maybe you could get a group together.  People tend to do things quicker when they have 5 or 6 after them, rather than just one.
It is all about self-discipline.\n\nIf you want it badly enough, you will do whatever it takes to make it work. \n\nYour body will quickly adapt to a schedule if you rigorously adhere to it for at least 2 weeks. Do whatever it takes, for 14 days, to stick to a strict schedule.You should then find that doing the menial tasks will come more naturally, and you won't forget, ro lack the drive to do so.\n\nGood luck!
This may sound odd and it takes a little practice.\n  While laying in bed trying to sleep clench every muscle in your body as hard as you can before they cramp and count to 20.  Then relax them and count to 20. Do this over and over, usually  10 or so times.  You will develop a rhythm and know when you have done it enough.  Some chemical in your body will get into your muscles and relax them.  It's worth a shot.

That is pretty cool....I am also in middle school (but last year of it). Don't worry about. You are beautiful the way you are don't worry about what other ppl say about/to you. I use to see ppl make fun of other kids that were overweight but the problem is they get offended by what those mean kids said about them and they don't do anything about it. You need to stand up for yourself and don't let any rude comments get in your way. I don't let any one stay in my way by saying mean things to me. I just brush it off and that is what my friends love about me. My best friend is like are you offended. I was like no. He kept saying he thinks he is fat and he is so not fat. I don't think he has a 6 pack or anything. I can tell you one thing, don't let your weight affect you like it did to my best friend. I still care about him and I am always there for him no matter the situation and I love him to death. I won't let anyone be mean to my friends and to me. You need to keep your head high and don't care what other people think. Just do your own thing. I hope everything goes well but don't feel bad about what your body looks like. Don't be ashamed, God made you the way he wanted you. No girls our age are ever happy with their body. A girl in my class is the All-American girl that is thin, tan and blonde, and blue-eyed. She is also a cheerleader. She doesn't think she is that pretty. You need to learn to love and accept yourself for who you really are and don't be ashamed. You go girl!!! :)

When My step kids sprained their ankle.  Ok here's the story My stepdaughter sprained her ankle in Gym Class and my stepson 1 week later was riding his bike home from school & got hit by a Pick up truck and went flying.  The doctor did give them both crutches because they were in school and they had stairs to climb.  But, he told us that when they were at home to not use them because excersising the ankle would help it heal faster.  He told them after 1 week not to even use the crutches at school.  I'm sure the doctor told you that Ibuprofen will take dow the swelling & the pain.  I feel for you.  I really do, but I sprained my ankle 20 years ago when I was 10 and never told my mom.  It hurt like heck, but I never told her.  I didn't get a splint and I didn't get crutches and I didn't get painkillers.  It hurts at the worst walking up or down hillI had to walk uphill to get home and down hill to get to school.  thankfully I grew up in a small town so it wasn't far about the distance of 1 city block. maybe 2 city blocks.  when you are sitting rotate your ankle as much as you can stand Ice it if need be as well.  I feel sorry for you it is a major pain, but sometimes we think our parents have the money & they don't.  Believe it or not, but crutches can be expensive.  Take care & good luck.

Hepatitis A and B are both VACCINE-PREVENTABLE. In my opinion, everyone who is eligible should get vaccinated for these hep viruses.Tell your aunt to consider a vaccination.\n\nHep A is transmitted fecal-orally through contaminated food or water.\n\nHep B is bloodborne or sexually transmitted. But you can prevent it with a series of three shots.\n\nHep C is bloodborne, but can carry a tiny chance of sexual transmission. There is no vaccine for it, though. But it should still be safe for your uncle to have relations with his wife if he has Hep C.

Hi Cleopatra!\n\nFruit and veggies don't cause weight gain, eating more calories then  you burn does.  Thus, I suggest you keep to the 5 meals per day, but keep your total calorie intake to 1500.  Then stay active: dance, shop, walk, play, etc.  Simple rule, fruit has more calories than veggies, so error on that side.\n\nThe should get you started where you could start to see progress within the week if you stick to it.\n\nI believe this answers your question, but if not, you can shoot me an email at: gregg@leandownsite.com\n\nGood luck on your diet and fitness goals!\n\nTrainer Gregg\nYou can achieve anything you set your mind on
The anesthetist (the doctor who will put you to sleep and monitor your vitals during the operation) will review your medical history and ensure you are in good health, and there are no medical problems which would make it dangerous to undergo general anesthetic.  They will start an IV in your hand or arm.  They will start running in a solution of normal saline.  You will feel a cool sensation in your arm as this starts to flow.  The anesthetist will continue to speak to you and tell you when he starts to administer the medication that will put you to sleep.  You will likely not even remember the exact moment that you went to sleep.  The next thing you will know, you will be in the recovery room speaking to the recovery nurse.  The entire procedure for wisdom tooth extraction should take no more than 20-25 minutes, so you won't be out for very long.

you may have the disorder called binge eating. when you eat that many calories in such a short amount of time you probably feel like you have no control over it. this feeling leads you to eat more and feel guilty afterwards. this can lead to bulimia if not fixed fast! what makes you feel like you have to eat is the anticiaption of the food and it makes you not care about what you will feel like after eating too much.  most of the food you eat is probably junk food and this is because you may have felt deprived earlier. it is a vicious cycle. if you find yourself eating alone in private this is a sign that you may be embarassed about it and that you may be eating for emotional problems. i am actually goin thru something similar but i told myself im goin to end it tonight. think to yourself that you are not a prisoner of food. You are in charge of your actions and what you eat. The food will always be there you can choose to eat it or not. Also wen you feel like binging stop yourself before hand. and think am i really hungry or not? if not what do i really want? and wen you are reaching for the food stop for a second and ask if that food will make you feel satisfied and happy afterward...most likely it will make you feel depressed and guilty. understand that food cannot fill an emotional void. eating more of it will only make things worse. when you feel like stuffing your mouth sit down take a few snacks out lay them on the table. ask yourself all these questions. and if you still want to eat, eat very very SLOWLY. soon you might realize that the food will not satisfy you. Then after the first few bites you wont crave it. Eat  balanced heatlhy  meals so you wont feel deprived. The main reasons for binging is low self esteem. you put too much value on weight and appearance. Know that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and your beauty is only true when you accept it. Learn to appreciate your body and all the wonderful things it does. No matter what your weight is or how skinny you are if you dont believe in your own beauty you will never be content. you can end the cycle now its all in the mind. best of luck!

I was sound asleep one night and then jerked awake.  I couldn't figure out what woke me; all was quiet as it should be.  But then I hiccuped.  I realized that somehow during the night I developed the hiccups -- while I was asleep!  That is not a pleasant way to wake up.

HELLO THERE YOU HAVE GOTTEN MANY ANSWERS AND HERES MY TWO CENTS WORTH !  SEE FOR OVER 50 YEARS I HAD SLEEP APNEA AND HAD YOUR EXACT CONDITON BUT DENIED IT!\n\nLast year I had a simple operation and was under anesthesia and simply stopped breathing for a minute or so ,,,  you know some doctors call it  DEATH .  After they revived me and I escaped the hospital within the month I went to a SLEEP CLINIC for an evaluation!  My wife had been telling me for years that I had breathed funny but I ignored her ... just could not ignore  DEATH!  Anyway anyhow in one night they checked me as to how I did sleep.  What bothered my sleep.  The next session a few weeks later I was tested for the setting of the CPAP machine the ideal pressure for it for me to have the ideal sleep.\n\nWe sleep in six levels of sleep one thru five our body is asleep but our brain only sleeps on level six or REM for rapid eye movement.  See it was like this for me. I would get into REM my body was on automatic but my auto breath would fail somehow ....  oxygen would get low the brain would drop out of REM and make the lungs gasp for air ... then would gradually go back to REM During the night at the lab this happened 20 times!  And I got to meet another disturber of mr REM it was my leg twitch which I have RLS restless leg syndrome it disturbs the REM pattern of sleep also!\n\nI used to have a high pressure job in Shipbuilding and I would grit my teeth during my sleep  from work problems.. that disturbs REM I found out!\n\nIt is the quality of sleep not the quantity of sleep!  If you are not getting your REM your brain is not getting any sleep at all!  I do feel so much better than I have ever felt in my whole life! I always thought that sleep was sleep not so.\n\nYou might try one of those sleep labs for the night and they will tell you exactly very specifically how much you do need and what if anything is disturbing your sleep!\n\nI am 61 and I can outwork a 20 year old but the CPAP has taken at least 30 years off my age!  I love the Darn thing!\n\nIt has improved EVERYTHING!!\n\n\nHave a good day\n\n\nAPS
It is likely they will ask you questions about what ways your mother is incapacitated. They may ask you about dates of when she became ill and stays in hospital. If it is about her finances then they may ask you questions about any income or savings. If your mother has been sent a letter about the tribunal then it's worth reading through that as it should outline what they might need to know and if you will need to take any documents along with you.\n\nThe important thing is not to be scared. They are used to dealing with people who are nervous and don't know what will be asked of them and you should feel free to ask for help or clarification if you need it during the tribunal.\n\nYou'll be fine.
Tell her to read the warnings that come with her prescriptions, that is enough proof there.  You can also call your pharmacist and tell what medications your mom is taking and he/she will tell you the same thing.  \n\nBelow are a few links to help you out\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9807/09/alcohol.pain.killers/index.html\n\nhttp://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/Medicine/medicine.htm\n\nhttp://alcoholism.about.com/cs/heal/a/aa082097.htm\n\nhttp://www.rochester.edu/uhs/healthtopics/Alcohol/interactions.html\n\nYou mom already know what she is doing and she is aware what she is doing is wrong, she have a serious problem and she is not ready to get help.  You have to try to be strong, because your mom is hurting deep down inside, and she drinks to numb the pain.  I know the feeling.  I don't drink like that, but I know I have taken a pain pill to help me sleep when I could not or did not want to deal with issues in my life.\n\nPlease be strong and if you need someone to talk to I am here for you.
Any sudden chest pain needs to be evaluated URGENTLY.  One does not self diagnose major disease, even with the ertswhile assistance of Yahoo Ask.\n\n  Only you can judge your own pain level.  If the pain increases as you take a deep breath it could be upper respitory, or it could be Heart.  You are not qualified to judge nor do I hear or see any MD responses.\n\n  Do not wait, see a doc.  Lung or Heart, either could be potentially life threatening.\n\n   Smoking or no smoking.

"Back when my heart was a bit blacker we had ""smelling salts"" in the first aid cabinet at a place I used to work. It was a liquid chemical in a small glass tube wrapped in fiber.

Mean but funny."
Have you recently gone off birth control. Reason I ask is because the first time I stoped using my pills my period didn't come back for about 6 months.
I get that sometimes and it can just be anxiety.  I had to be placed on medication to help with the anxiety attacks.  These attacks can feel like your heart is caving in and the pain is unbearable.  You should see your Dr. to followup\n\nGood luck
"""In a slowly developing coma, patients may be only mildly confused and drowsy in the beginning, and/or their personality may change. If the underlying cause is an infection in the central nervous system, patients may feel a headache or other bodily discomfort, a fever, rash, muscular pains, or dizziness, before the actual coma develops. As time passes, they may begin to show signs of lethargy and obtundation, during which they are not quite unconscious but are not responding to external stimuli.\n\nSometimes a person who is falling into unconsciousness may not recognize what is happening and may not be able to complain. Or, it may happen so quickly that they don't have time to notice and complain.\n\nAfter a person has entered into a state of unconsciousness, they tend not to respond to external stimuli, depending on how deep the coma is, and/or they show abnormal body movements. An unconscious person may lie still and not respond to anything. They may move spontaneously; these movements include shaking, tremors, and jerking movements. The eyes may move abnormally. If the breathing muscles are affected, a person's breathing may be irregular, and they may need to be put on a respirator."""

Your explanation is very vague.  A defective mitral valve?  There are several different conditions that could be possible.\nFirst of all, a heart murmur is rarely a serious condition.  Most heart murmurs are present at birth, and never adversly effect the individual, throughout their lifetime.\nSecondly, the most common condition occuring in conjunction with a murmur is called mitral valve prolapse.  Also, usually not a big deal.\nIf you are unclear on your diagnosis, or feel you aren't receiving adequate information from your physician, find a new one!  Ask for copies of your echo and go to someone who can communicate with you to meet your needs.
I had a very minimal problem with my teeth when I got invisalign...The dentist told me I was a good candidate for it & we started the treatment & I paid $5000...\n\n6 months later I was told I was done, told to use my last tray as a retainer (which was gross after liek 3 months) \n\nWhen I had my Invisalign off, by the end of the day, my gaps returned.

Denial, I went through it when my mom was diagnosed. If I didn't go see her, she couldn't get worse... I guess time would stand still, but it didn't and she got worse. That's when reality sunk in for me, but there may still be hope for your Dad.\n\nI am currently in the Bahamas with my Mother who has Terminal Lung Cancer. There is a clinic here that has been in operation for over 30 years. (www.immunemedicine.com) We have been here for 4 of our 8 week stay, everyday is really neat. A lot of the patients stick around in the meeting room/ waiting room to visit, and share stories and catch up. There were 40 people all talking and laughing, talking about cancer and life, the returning patients talk about how bad their cancer was 4, 8, 10 even 18 years ago when they started coming to the clinic, the cancer that has since disappeared. Many of them did not come here until they had exhausted all other options and were considered terminal, some with only weeks or months to live. There is nothing dangerous or foreign to the treatment, just building up your immune system in a very effective manner so that it can identify and fight the cancer. If you want to know more contact me or go to www.immunemedicine.com I cannot tell you how impressed I am with what I have seen and how my Mother has already improved. I know one man who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, he skipped all US, conventional (poisonous, dangerous) options and went to the Bahamas and is doing great now. Another man who has been coming here for 18 years that had prostate cancer. People with just about every type of cancer. But, they are honest here, you send them your medical information and they will tell you whether they believe they can help you or not, and they will send you home if they don't think you are benefiting. \n\nMy mom has shown drastic improvements and is feeling so much better. and we are in the Bahamas so we are having a good Mother-Daughter vacation.\n\nI have also done a lot of research on the Cesium Chloride/DMSO treatment and think that it has merit and you can do it at home.\n\nThe clinic here believes that a supplement/liquid called VIBE works really well in addition to other treatments, I am going to look in to that some more.\n\nMost doctors will tell you not to try alternative medicine and some will refuse to even see you again if you do. To some degree they are not to blame, they have not been taught anything about it other than that it is evil and wrong and they would be rejected by their colleagues if they suggested alternatives.\n\nTell your brothers that time is not standing still just because they are not there, maybe give them this information, if they are involved, that may help.\n\nOne very helpful website is www.cancertutor.com\n\nGood luck!!

"I had ingrown toenails but it wasn't that bad.  The foot docotor told me that they can get ingrown because of the way you cut your toenails, but I don't know, I don't think I was cutting them ""wrong"".\n\nThis website said that:\n\nThe causes include:\n\n-poor maintenance, like cutting the nail too short, rounded off at the tip or peeled off at the edges (versus being cut straight across), is likely to cause ingrowth; \n-ill-fitting shoes, like those that are too narrow or too short, can cause bunching of the toes in the developmental stages of the foot (frequently in the under 21s), causing the nail to curl and dig into the skin; \n-trauma to the nail plate or toe, such as can occur by stubbing the toenail, dropping things on the toe and 'going through the end of your shoes' in sports, can cause the flesh to become injured and the nail to grow irregularly and press into the flesh; \n-predisposition, like abnormally-shaped nail beds, nail deformities caused by diseases, and a genetic proneness to nail problems can mean a tendency to ingrowth."

My personal opinion is that ur friend is right,and a mental health history could follow one. My recommendation if he or she can afford it  is to go to a private therapist where it can not  be checked through the deparment of health or insurance. I really do believe people r stero typed and discriminated againest  if they have a history of mental illiness,which is terrible beacuse I believe it does keep some people who need help out of a doctors office.

It's good that you're recovering quickly when your heart rate is so high. It goes to show how much endurance you actually have.\nAgain you dont want to be in the high percentage of your heart rate for too long anyway. And what is the purpose of you getting up there?\n\nIf you're interested in fat loss than you really need short intense bouts of about 15-20 sec and then rest to allow your body to recover so you can go at the same intensity again.\n\nBut definitely pace yourself and when you are doing high intensity workouts be sure to give yourself a short break to recover so you can continue to work at the high intensity. Also do not stay in this range for a long period of time.  It will overload your cardiac system and while the overload principle when it comes to weights is great, in this case it might not be.\n\nFor more free info sign up for your own newsletter at\nhttp://4evertoned.com/newsletter.html
The birth starts with the onset of labour, which is usually marked by the beginning of regular uterine contractions. These are felt as tightenings either in the back or across the top of the womb. Sometimes the baby's waters break before the beginning of the contractions or, more commonly, once labour is under way. \nA mucous show is often passed through the vagina at the beginning of labour, which may have streaks of blood in it. Some women pass the show days before going into labour, other women do not pass a show at all, so it is not a reliable sign of labour. \n\nDuring a natural birth, the muscles in the uterus (womb) contract and it's this contraction that's felt as labour pains. Labour is a painful experience, but breathing techniques learned in antenatal classes can make early labour less stressful. \n\nThe contractions cause the baby's head to be pressed down through the pelvis and against the inside of the cervix. This causes the cervix to stretch open (dilate) allowing the baby's head to pass through (descend) into the vagina and onwards into the outside world. \n\nThe birth begins when labour contractions start becoming frequent, intense and of sufficient duration to cause the cervix to open. At the beginning of labour, you will usually be examined externally (abdominal examination), to see how the baby is lying and to be certain that the baby is coming head first. \n\nWhen labour starts, the cervix gets shorter (a process called effacement) and opens (dilates). The cervix is fully dilated when it has opened 10cm. During labour, it's important you don't start pushing before you are fully dilated, because there will be a danger of tearing the cervix. \nOnce your cervix has fully dilated, the first stage of labour is completed and the second stage is about to begin. The first stage generally lasts up to 12 hours in a first labour and seven hours in subsequent deliveries, but each labour is different. \nThe second stage starts when your cervix is completely open (10cm). Usually, there is a sensation of fullness in your vagina or bowel and you wish to push. \n\nMost women will find that the labour pains in the second stage of labour are more bearable, because you can now actively help yourself by pushing. \n\nThe second stage of labour ends with the delivery of the baby. It usually lasts for 45 minutes to two hours in a first labour and 15 to 45 minutes in subsequent deliveries. \nDuring this stage the afterbirth (placenta) is delivered. The placenta is usually delivered within 5 to 15 minutes after the birth of the baby. \n\nThe last stage of birth is a co-operation between yourself and the midwife, although little effort is required to deliver the placenta.\n\nAfter your baby's born, it's routine that you will be given an injection to stimulate the uterus to contract, which helps delivery of the placenta. \n\nMaking the uterus contract in this way reduces the risk of heavy bleeding during delivery of the placenta (post-partum haemorrhage).

I know that in the culture that we live in it is a huge temptation to strive for perfection. You are 13 years old and it sounds like you want to take care of yourself and be healthy.  If you are eating lots of fruits, vegetables and whole grain breads and drinking lots of water and adding in some exercise a few times a week you are off to a great start.  Don't worry so much about what the scale says or what size pants your in...if you feel good and energetic and your having fun with your friends that is what matters.  You are not at all fat and I think it would be great to know that you are having fun in life with yourself and your friends. Just be you and enjoy everything life has to offer that's what matters most in life in the end.

I've had saline implants for two years. They are on top of the muscle and are 425 ccs. They went under the breast during the surgery. Quite honestly, they are the best decision I've made regarding my body. I love them, and they're something I would recommend to anyone.\nI had them done on a Thursday afternoon. When I came to they sent me home and I was in some pain but they gave me painkillers. The next day I pretty much slept and took the medication. On Saturday I started to walk around more and do things. I felt well enough to go to dinner with my husband that night. By Monday I was back in my old routine. I was very sore for a couple of days, but really nothing that was unmanageable. I have a very low threshold for pain, but can tell you this does not hurt as much as other procedures like a wisdom tooth. At the time I was a pilates teacher, and I began teaching about 2 weeks after my surgery. I began taking step classes and working about about 3 weeks after the surgery. I have been active ever since, and really had no complications. Believe me the benefits outweigh the pain, and you will be fine.

There are many variables depending on the type of cancer, the stage of the cancer, the location of the tumor (s) and the age and health of the patient.\n\nSince you are not too specific I can give you a general idea. Please keep in mind that tumors can invade surrounding tisse or organs making surgery very difficult. Much depends upon how many tumors are present, what size they are, if they are in one spot, and have traveled throughout the body.\n\nIn general, surgery is possible when the tumor or tumors are localized - in one spot - and do not invade surrounding tissue.\n\nIn general, complicated surgery may depend entirely upon the skill of the surgeon. One surgeon will not feel comfortable operating, while another may specialize in this particular type of cancer and will operate. It may be best to get a second opinion in the case of surgery.\n\nIn general, surgery is not possible when the tumor or tumors are located in places that the surgeon cannot reach or places that are too close to vital structures. Again, surgery may be totally dependent upon the skill of a surgeon. There are some surgeons who have extraordinary skills, but they are far and few between. You will need to search.\n\nMy son has a rare sarcoma, that not many surgical oncologists see during their practice. His cancer was considered inoperable because it was so extensive. The recommendation was to treat him first with high dose chemotherapy to reduce the tumor burden and shrink the primary tumors. He responded and by the 5th cycle of chemo underwent a 'debulking' or partial surgery. He later underwent a second surgery to remove all signs of cancer. He was fortunate. \n\nOthers who have this same disease often are told that the cancer is too widespred and inoperable. Their doctors will offer only chemotherapy. Yet, I know of many of these same patients who have gone out and found a surgeon that will operate on them . . and have been successful. It happens with chilling frequency.\n\nSo, if you have been told that your cancer is not operable . . please go get a second or third opinon. Do some research. Talk to other patients.\n\nDon't give up. Good luck to you.

You should shoot for a minimum of 20-30 minutes a day of moderate to active exercise daily. Don't try to exceed 60 minute until your fitness level can easily maintain that maximum and only then if you are actively working on increasing your strength development, endurance or weight loss. You need a minimum of moderate exercise of 10 to 15 minute to get you body in a calorie burning mode. Choose exercises that you can maintain at a steady pace for a 20 to 30 minute duration and allow warm up and cool down time if you hit it hard. always stretch and warm up  before beginning regardless. You don't have to do it all in one shot for a longer work out, but don't do it for any less than the minimum or you will gain little to no benefit for your efforts.

Weight loss surgery-like gastric bypass /lap band surgery / stomach stapling and gastrectomy have become very common and very safe now. My cousin got her Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery in India. She has lost more than 65 lbs in 5 months and is very happy with the results. The price for obesity surgery is very less in India. My cousin just paid 25% of the cost she was quoted in America. She got her surgery from a company called Forerunners Healthcare.\n\nForerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and magazines. I have read a lot of their patient stories also.

I think you just need to be married to more than one person at the same time.
See a doctor about that...you'll drive yourself and everyone else nuts.  They'll give you something for that and teach you good habits to practice that work.
She is able to get a deeper penetration, the reason it hurts is your penis is hitting her cervix which can be sensative.
Of course everyone is different, but I took my chemo (cisplatin) really well.  I was nauseated, but the compazine took care of that.  Get plenty of rest and drink plenty of fluids.  Eat what you can because you'll need your strength.  Also, try not to eat your favorite foods when you're sick.  That way you won't associate them with that nauseous feeling should you get that way.\n\nI also exercised the days following my treatments.  The fresh air and physical activity helped me mentally, physically and emotionally.  I didn't feel sorry for myself as much because I was out there doing something.\n\nTake care and God Bless

"Sounds very much like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and you should get a referral to a rhematologist as the others have suggested. I would also suggest working in conjunction with a Pain management Specialist. They are used to dealing with people with severe, chronic pain. They are more understanding of pain and that it strikes people of ALL ages. Many doctors are afraid of prescribing pain medications because the patient might become ""addicted"" so they are willing to let the patient suffer instead. Be proactive and seek out the doctors you need.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis?\n\nThe symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis come and go, depending on the degree of tissue inflammation. When body tissues are inflamed, the disease is active. When tissue inflammation subsides, the disease is inactive (in remission). Remissions can occur spontaneously or with treatment, and can last weeks, months, or years. During remissions, symptoms of the disease disappear, and patients generally feel well. When the disease becomes active again (relapse), symptoms return. The return of disease activity and symptoms is called a flare. The course of rheumatoid arthritis varies from patient to patient, and periods of flares and remissions are typical.\n\nWhen the disease is active, symptoms can include fatigue, lack of appetite, low grade fever, muscle and joint aches, and stiffness. Muscle and joint stiffness are usually most notable in the morning and after periods of inactivity. Arthritis is common during disease flares. Also during flares, joints frequently become red, swollen, painful, and tender. This occurs because the lining tissue of the joint (synovium) becomes inflamed, resulting in the production of excessive joint fluid (synovial fluid). The synovium also thickens with inflammation (synovitis).\n\nIn rheumatoid arthritis, multiple joints are usually inflamed in a symmetrical pattern (both sides of the body affected). The small joints of both the hands and wrists are often involved. Simple tasks of daily living, such as turning door knobs and opening jars can become difficult during flares. The small joints of the feet are also commonly involved. Occasionally, only one joint is inflamed. When only one joint is involved, the arthritis can mimic the joint inflammation caused by other forms of arthritis, such as gout or joint infection. Chronic inflammation can cause damage to body tissues, cartilage and bone. This leads to a loss of cartilage and erosion and weakness of the bones as well as the muscles, resulting in joint deformity, destruction, and loss of function. Rarely, rheumatoid arthritis can even affect the joint that is responsible for the tightening our vocal cords to change the tone of our voice, the cricoarytenoid joint. When this joint is inflamed, it can cause hoarseness of voice.\n\nSince rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic disease, its inflammation can affect organs and areas of the body other than the joints. Inflammation of the glands of the eyes and mouth can cause dryness of these areas and is referred to as Sjogren's syndrome. Rheumatoid inflammation of the lung lining (pleuritis) causes chest pain with deep breathing or coughing. The lung tissue itself can also become inflamed and sometimes nodules of inflammation (rheumatoid nodules) develop within the lungs. Inflammation of the tissue (pericardium) surrounding the heart, called pericarditis, can cause a chest pain that typically changes in intensity when lying down or leaning forward. The rheumatoid disease can reduce the number of red blood cells (anemia), and white blood cells. Decreased white cells can be associated with an enlarged spleen (referred to as Felty's syndrome) and can increase the risk of infections. Firm lumps under the skin (rheumatoid nodules) can occur around the elbows and fingers where there is frequent pressure. Even though these nodules usually do not cause symptoms, occasionally they can become infected. A rare, serio"

It's very natural for girls to have a trail of hair like that. It won't be as thick and noticeable as a guy's, but it's definitely there! This MUST be shaved! It's not attractive whatsoever and it only takes two seconds to shave it, so just do it.

"No, you are still a virgin, but!!!!  Be sure he does not ejaculate at the entrance to your vagina.  If there is any ""lubrication"" the sperm can travel up the vagina and into the uterus and cause pregnancy.  It is not common, but it can happen.  Talk to your doctor about it.  If you can handle it, I suggest you go down on him when he is ready to ejaculate, and learn to swallow.  He'll love it, and you don't have to worry about being a bitch about telling him to move it.\n\nBy the way, I just noticed that you are posting a lot of questions about sex, and they are all contrdicting each other.

it depends on the man and how fast he grew early on in life.  They say anywhere between 18-21 a young man grows to his potential.  It's tough to say though, because they say 21 is the age where women top their height.
Really weird but even i have this problem. I was asking same thing to many but i realised that while jogging i sometimes jerk my shoulder so it may be causing that.

You shund worry it isnt that serious thing. Observe your arm motionwhile jogging and do some yoga for strenthing your arm joints or physiotherapy will do.
"In human anatomy, the vermiform appendix (or appendix, pl. appendices) is a blind ended tube connected to the cecum (or internationally, ""caecum""). It develops embryologically from the cecum. The term vermiform comes from Latin and means ""wormlike in appearance"". The cecum is the first pouch-like structure of the colon. The appendix is near the junction of the small intestines and large intestines.\n\nCurrently, the function of the appendix, if any, remains controversial in the field of human physiology. It has been known to cause the ability to process bark, leaves and other things of that nature.\n\nThere have been cases of people who have been found, usually on laparoscopy or laparotomy, to have a congenital absence of their appendix. There have been no reports of impaired immune or gastrointestinal function in these people.\n\nOne explanation has been that the appendix is a vestigial structure with no current purpose.[citation needed] The appendix is thought to have descended from an organ in our distant herbivorous ancestors called the cecum (or caecum). The cecum is maintained in modern herbivores, where it houses the bacteria that digest cellulose, a chemically tough carbohydrate that these animals could not otherwise utilize. The human appendix contains no significant number of these bacteria, and cellulose is indigestible to us. It seems likely that the appendix lost this function before our ancestors became recognizably human."

"How long a drug stays in you system is beside the point. What matter most is what kind of lab test will be performed to determine.\n\nTHE DRUG ITSELF can stay in your bloodstream up to 72 hours. However, most labs look for the metabolite, which is something that the body produces when it ingests something, in the case of cocaine it is ""benzoylecgonine"" that will stay around long after the drug is gone, up to 30 days for a frequent user.\n\nIf the lab prefer to take hair as a sample, cocaine can stay in your hair up to about 90 days. Nevertheless, new information is becomming apparent suggesting cocaine stay's in your hair about 25 years - even after you have only taken it once.\n\nAnd if you boyfriend has smoked weed, he definately don't have a chance. A minimum of thirty (30) days, minimum!\n\nAs medical science and employers become more and more aware of the problem exsisting in drug testing, they are choosing more complex, sophisicated testing methods. With these techniques and equipment, the only sure way to pass a test is to not do drugs and stay clear away from them.\n\nHope this answers your question!"
I could simply be a coincidence.  But you should probably bring it up with your pediatrician at your next visit.\n\nI hope, for your son's sake, that it isn't anything serious.  I am lactose intolerant, and it's really annoying to have to check everything.  Lactose intolerence can actually start as a person gets older.  I didn't have a problem with dairy until I was almost seven.\n\nThe best advice I can give you for right now is to just make sure he's getting plenty of fluids (other than milk) and don't let him have any dairy for a while.  If his symptoms persist, it's most likely just coincidental.

Yes, could very well be the gallbladder but I bet it is just severe reflux or maybe irritable bowel syndrome. Some people cannot eat spicy foods and that is just the way it is. You may be one of those people. ask your doctor about an upper gi series x ray that will show the reflux and will show if you have a hiatal hernia that may be increasing the irritation with the reflux. The ultrasound may be a good idea but if you are not having these problems when you eat bland then I would wait. Whatever you decide the ultrasound and upper gi are not real expensive. it is when you move into the CT and MRI phase that is crippling to the pocketbook. Good luck to you. Let me know if I can help in any other way.

I am so sorry for her and for you. \n\nNobody here can make an expert evaluation of her problems and prognosis, though. You really need to speak with her doctors. It may be time to let her go peacefully - when my mother was dying, the people in hospice told us that even though she was not able to communicate, she could still hear, and that it was important for us to tell her that we loved her and that it was okay for her to let go. That she didn't have to keep fighting after her body had worn out. \n\nDo consider hospice if the doctor tells you straight out that your aunt is not going to recover. The people who do hospice are incredibly kind and supportive, and they will make whatever time is left for her as comfortable and serene as possible.  No more invasive tests or waking her up to take blood pressure or all the other disruptive things that have to get done in regular hospital care.\n\nAgain, I am very sorry that her condition is so bad. Don't be afraid to cry - just try not to act too emotional in her presence. And if she does die, it's going to hurt terribly - knowing that it's coming does not make it easy - allow yourself to grieve.

I work for an oral surgeon who does sedation dentistry.  It definitely works, but there is no pill that will put you to sleep.  We give people valium to relax them, then start an IV and put people all the way to sleep.  It is a painless way to have dental work done, but it is extremely expensive compared to regular dentistry, in that you have to pay for the anesthesia and the insurance it requires.

Liposuction surgery is very safe nowadays. My cousin got her breast reduction, tummy tuck and facelift surgery in India by the company called Forerunners Healthcare .The Price for the surgery she paid in India was very less. She paid 30% of the cost she was quoted in America.\n\nForerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. They arrange cosmetic and plastic surgery for foreigners in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low price, as the breast reduction, tummy tuck, facelift and other cosmetic surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.\n\nhttp://www.forerunnershealthcare.com\nHope this helps.

"It is not likely that all the other girls in your class have gotten their periods, although it might be true. It is more likely that you are the only one who is honest about it.\n\nPlease don't be scared. Every woman you see walking around has gotten it and is still standing. Each month your uterus, which is in your abdomen, prepares a nice soft lining to wait for a fertilized egg. If you don't have sex, your egg will not get fertilized. Then your body says, ""Oh no baby this month"" and discards that lining. That is your period. The unused blood that is part of this lining will pass out of your body through your vagina. You may not be aware of this part of your body much. It is between where you urinate and where your bowel movement passes out. \n\nAt first you may not have much coming out. Your body is growing into womanhood. It will probably be a light brownish red. This may last up to about a week or less. You cannot control what we call ""the flow"" as it comes out, like you can control your urine. It comes and there is nothing you can do about it. You will want to wear a pad inside your underwear to catch it. Change the pad often and throw it away. I would get some and keep one in your purse. They have a little adhesive strip that attaches to your undies. This way, when your period does come, you will be prepared. Periods have a way of coming at inconvenient times.\n\nSome women will have cramps. Some women will not. Some will have a light flow for just a few days. Some will have a heavier flow for about a week. \n\nThe important thing about your period is that it is a right of passage on your way to becoming a woman. Your period is a thing to celebrate not to fear. We women are very special. Our bodies do the most amazing things. Celebrate your passage from girl to woman. And when you are older, like me, celebrate your passage as you become a wise old woman."
This is going to sound weird, but it absolutely works: Put some ice cubes in there, and don't piddle around about it (make it quick).  It will shock your muscles into tightening up, which is what the problem is.  During sex the striations of your muscle walls in there are are spread apart and loosened up (especially after a climax), and that entire area becomes more vulnerable to friction issues,  which is what's causing the agitation you're experiencing.  Simply shock those striations and the skin over them into tightening up, and you should instantly feel a lot better.
You need to see a doctor.  We could  make all kinds of guesses here, but that is all it would be - guesses.  Those symptoms could be something really serious.

Although it would be great if you would exercise, because you would gain lean muscle, if you eat right than you will lose weight dramatically.  Eat meals which are high in protein, and low in fat.  Cut out all sweets and most fats.  Most junk food has a healthy alternative, like ice cream sandwiches and whatnot.  For ice cream novelties, try Skinny Cow brand desserts.  The do not have artificial sweetener, and they are very healthy if you are craving sweets.  Make sure you drink lots and lots of water! Water helps out alot, and if you have poor skin than it will help it become clean and clear again.  Eat lots of fruits adn vegetables, as well as protein!  And if you change your mind about exercising, the best exercise is running.  Running is the best exercise because you are carrying your own weight.  Good luck!

i did't have appendicitis but i studyed about it; suppously, you feel a pain in the Right Lower Quadrant of your abdomen ( imagine your abdomen divided in 4 parts), maybe preceded by a pain that starts in the epigastrum followed by pain around umbilicus. That pain is characteristically sharp; you may have anorexia( don't want to eat), nausea, vomits, fever,etc...   It is quite common in the childhood ( 15 years old or younger), but may occur in adulthood. It is important that you go to your doctor when you experience those symptoms because  appendicitis has 4 stages ( focal, suppurative, gangrenose, perforated ), increasing the severity of the disease with the number; an appendicitis stage 4 is one that leads to peritonitis and spread the infection.  Is in that stage in which you don't experience pain at all and is very difficult to treat. The treatment includes  surgery, antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics,...

well usually discharge is clear untill its close to your period then it can get  a little thick ,stringy, and some times flecks of white. but not like alot of cottage cheese looking white.but your discharge can change some and still be normal like if you started on the pill or if you are pregnant. if it is something new you have never noticed before cause noone knows your body like you do then id go to a dr. just to make sure its normal. but if its itchy,has an odor to it more than just your usually odor its probly an infection of some kind. maybe this will help.
well if u no u r not pregnant, then it could be related to stress, as this will affect our body in a big way, half the time we dont even think we are stressed but our body tells us that we are, if u r really worried on this, go talk to your doctor, it will b fine
Finally - an interesting question.  People apparently don't know that they can search the previous questions instead of asking the same thing that 6 other people asked earlier in the day.\n\nStart by going to a good college so you will have a better chance of admission to a dental school.  Dental schools are becoming harder and harder to get into, so a good college helps.\n\nIt helps to look into the requirements for admission to a dental school and work backwards.  This will help you choose your college major and it might even help you choose your college.  Typically, it is easier to match up the requirements for dental school admission with the requirements of a science major and biology seems to be the closest match.  You could be a history major if you wanted to be, but then all of your electives would probably be used up trying to take courses required for dental school admission.\n\nTypically, you graduate from college with a bachelor's degree and then start dental school, which is a whole separate entity from college.  Some colleges offer combined programs where the really bright and focused student might be able to combine some credits and actually enter dental school before receiving the undergraduate degree.  \n\nObviously, you would have to know this well in advance, as it might even determine where you apply to college.  You do not have to disclose this intention as you are applying to the college, but you need to look into the program almost immediately, because it will determine quite a bit about what courses you need to take as soon as possible in college.

I was circumcised at age 40, by choice and in response to a suggestion from my (then new) wife, who had had experience of sex with both cut and uncut men before she met me and very much prefers a circumcised partner for a whole range of reasons. The answer to your question is a resounding YES - my orgasm increased in intensity markedly after I got rid of my foreskin and frenulum and most men who have been circumcised as adults will agree with me on this. Also, circumcision enhances comfort, appearance and hygiene, together with making sexual sensation FAR better for both the man and his female partner. Unlike most of the anti-circ posters here, I know what I'm talking about from personal experience. Circumcision should be automatic for all males - there is no downside to it at all.
You are very unspecific in your presentation.. Where is the facial pain.. You realize you are talking about cranial nerves, I hope. This is suggestive of the origin being very high in the cervical spine. To confirm this, just press at the base of the skull and see if there is discomfort there. Again, suggesting an inflammatory process is in play. Involving the nerves. the facial as well as those of the mouth. For such a condition, it is recommended you obtain the services of a doctor of Chiropractic.

Your mom should stick with fresh of frozen foods. Stay away from canned foods as much as possible. They pack way too much sodium. just eat as healthy and natural as possible and by doing that her cholesteral should go down. As long as she checks her blood suger level regularly too she should be fine there. Make sure that if you want desserts make them with splenda. Try to get no sugar added and sugar free things too. To reduce oils you want to bake, broil, or poach the food. (poaching is pretty much just boiling) If you use oils stick with the healthy natural ones. Well I hope that this info really helps you out. Good luck and your mom will be fine aslong as she lives a healthy lifestyle now.

Yes it is always possible to increase your IQ and Memory if you have enough confidence. The Memory power is always with us and it is the way how we use that. Some people may remember well the numbers and some may remember well the images and some the conversations. Analyze yourself, how are you able to remember things. Form all those things you want to remember in form of images if you are good enough to remember images. Always co-relate things with your un-forgetable incidents in your mind. Always the co-relationship will increase your memory.\n\nWhat ever you hear, grasp well. after some time write that in a piece of paper. Later try to recall that without help of that paper even. This way you can increase your memory.\n\nTo have a good IQ you really need to build your Analytical Reasoning power. Read some interesting books. Take some interesting statements. Analyze that. Argue for and against that. Try to bring out some relationships between them. Slowly apply this kind of exercise for numbers, images and incidents. \n\nPractice makes people perfect. So practice perfectness.

Erythromycin often causes gastrointestinal pain (nausea, vomiting, gastric pain, abdominal cramps). High single doses are not suitable; children experience adverse reactions more frequently. There seem to be hepatotoxic reactions with all erythromycin preparations, but they are reversible after the discontinuation of the drug. The transaminases increase in about 10%; jaundice appears in only 1 of 1000 treated subjects. Ototoxic effects are also infrequent and reversible (hearing loss, ringing in the ear). Other rare side-effects include skin reactions, nephritis, fever and eosinophilia, pancreatitis, colitis and myasthenia.
I always thought that I just had a tailbone that bruised easily until one time last spring when the pain started getting worse and it turned out that' I've always had a pilonidal cyst. I recccommend going to the doctor or the ER if you don't have a doctor. If it's a cyst and hurts that much, there's a good chance it can't drain on it's own and you'll have to have it lanced. Waiting will only make it worse.  The actual cyst is congential, but I think there are several different reasons it can become infected.

So here is the solution:\n*Warm showers with neutral soap.\n*Betametasone cream in the most irritated areas.(diprosone/shering plough)\n*Caliderm cream in the rest of the body.\n*If you feel anxious, Atarax or Benadryl pills.\n*To mostuirize the skin all days, alloe extract, that you will find in the naturist stores.\n\nAll this is called atopic dermatitis, caused by an allergy.\nAll these are suggestions but please go with a dermatologist and allegorist. \n\nSource(s):\n\nhttp://www.mcgovernallergy.com/...

"I think I understand what you're going through. I recently had radiation therapy on my overactive thyroid gland, and I have gained a lot of weight! The problem in the US is that convenient and fast food means crappy and unhealthy food. I will only order things like fish and veggies, grilled chicken and veggies, and if I HAD to do fast food, get a grilled chicken salad with no croutons, and bring your own dressing. Unfortunately this is not a dieters world, and we just have to make the best of it! Why not bring along some Nutrition shakes ""just in case""? I know finding the right foods to eat on the go is a lot harder than doing it at home. Best of luck to you! :)"

restless leg syndrome. there is medication.
If you are numb, it's weird.  You might feel the cold air and you will sense the fact that something is TOUCHING your tooth, but it doesn't hurt.  If your leg ever fell asleep and you tapped on it when it was good and numb, that's kind of the same sensation.
at 12 years old, you're probably feeling a little self-conscious about how your body is changing.  you are right that a bmi of 18.7 is underweight, but as long as you eat a healthy diet, you should be ok.  (you most certainly do not weigh too much)\n\nyour body will continue to change, so the proportions you have now will most likely not be the proportions you have next year.  \n\nbe proud of your height!  you may not like being the tallest girl in your class, but as you get older, you will love how clothes look on you.  hold your head high!
Don't pop them! That makes them worse, & could leave scarring. \n\nDrink alot of water everyday. Wash your face morning, lunch & before you go to bed. Do hot water in morning & night & cold water at lunch. \n\nYou can try rubbing ice cubes on your face as well. \n\nDoing all that should help you out some if not all!

You need to be under a doctors care. You need to be keeping a daily log of your blood sugar, so you can take it to your visit. They can advise you on a diet and exercise plan to help you learn to deal with diabetes. They can also determine if you need to be on oral medications, insulin or just a proper diet. Do not ignore this problem, because it can damage all  of your vital organs if not controlled.
It's a mechanizm the body uses to regulate the O2 levels in the body tissues. If you are in a confined room you are more likely to yawn because of the decreased O2 levels in that room. When you are tired, you yawn because your body has decreased O2 levels in the tissue therefore when you yawn you actually take in a deep breath of air which helps elevate your O2 saturation rate.
Here's some tips.\nQuitting smoking is a great opportunity to learn about ourselves.\nCongratulate yourself  on having the desire to stop - then you are over the worst, but still need to maintain your resolve. It's just so easy to start thinking that just one won't hurt, but it does. Just one achieves nothing except feeling the need for another. Whatever you do, don't have just one. Beware - alcohol will weaken your resolve.\nHere's a few home-brewed tips that might be useful.\nIt's not just nicotine addiction - there are 50+ chemicals in cigarettes. Also the main problem is habit.\nWe have been used to having body sensations which we translate as 'my body needs something', which we have attempted to satisfy by having a cigarette.\nWhen we try to stop smoking, we still get these 'my body needs something' sensations, and we still feel that we want a cigarette. We have to train our body to be more selective. When we feel we need something, we have to work out what it is that we actually need.\nA glass of water is an excellent substitute if nothing else comes to mind, as it helps with the clearance of the toxic substances in our body. Another good substitute is a bag of salted peanuts, used in combination with the water.\nAnother thing to do is to find an activity which occupies the mind or body. Go swimming - nobody wants to smoke while they are swimming. Slowly, as our body adjusts and translates the 'want something' feelings into something other than cigarettes, then the feelings begin to go away. We know its not a cigarette that the body really needs, because as soon as we've had one we still have the feeling, and want another!\nWe will have a few bouts of feeling or even being short tempered. We must try to bite our lip, and control; ourselves. Recognise the short temper as being the removal of toxins which are trying to find a way out. They went in through the mouth, and they try to get out that way to. We must learn to keep our mouth closed, and force the toxins out the other way.\n\nAfter we have stopped for a while we will begin to feel that just one wont to any harm.\nAll that leads to is a desire for just another one. We must guard very strongly against the desire to have just one.
Ask him to try to balance the healthy with the junk. Talk to him and tell him how much you love him and you want to be together for a long time. If he won't eat healthier, try having him exercise a little more. Take romantic walks in the park or just around the neighborhood. You might make some friends that way also.
Exercise more.

The 'condoms' you are referring to are known as dental dams and they are not to be used for sexual or anal intercourse. They are designed strictly for oral sex.\n\nI haven't seen the mini-condom kind around for ages so cannot suggest a source. But you could always just use a regular condom and unroll it to just cover the head leaving the rest trapped below the bottom of the head. Just remember that STI's can be present along the shaft so it might be wiser to cover it all.\n\nAs for oral sex on a female vagina or anyone's anal area, there are a variety of sites that describe dental dam use and how to obtain or make them. A couple are below.

It's produced by the Bartholin's glands, which are just female versions of the cowpers glands in males. The cowpers glands in males are what produces 'pre-cum' that lines the urethra to make smooth bore to shoot through, and also what mixes with the sperm to form semen. the Bartholins glands are connected to the females urethra just like the males cowpers gland, that's why a lot of women think it's pee, cause it comes out of the urethra\n\nExperts debate about what the liquid produced by the females Bartholins glands is for, but they've tested it in a labratory and it is nearly identical to male seminal fluid. There are supposedly also phermones excreted in this fluid. Phermones being the chemical scents that attract the opposite sex.\n\nSomething to remember is, we all start out the same, as females, at conception. We originally all have the same parts. Men have nipples for apparently no reason, other than we started out with them incase we were gonna be female. Same reason women have clitorises, so it would be able to grow into a penis incase they were gonna be male. The clitoris still functions as a receptor of sexual pleasure, just like the penis, however. Females have bartholins glands, that would've become cowpers glands if they became male. Even though they remained female, the  bartholins gland can still function, just like a clitoris, even though it has no useful purpose.
As long as he is alive there is hope, however minute that may be.  \n\nThe only known cure for addictions is consequences, do not try to stop them, let the addict face the music.  \n\nOne of the consequences is loss of family and friends, it is horrible to watch someone go through addiction, heart wrenching, as is the same with MANY illnesses.   You can be supportive and loving from a distance if that is what you choose.\n\nTreatment helps, but often treatment needs to be repeated over and over again.  Which is a tremendous drain on resources but worth the effort. \n\nThere are many, many people who have sucessfully dealt with addictions.  Ask any one of them how they did it and you will most likely get MANY different answers.\n\nI used 7 rehabs (that I remember) and a 12 step group.\n\nI wish you luck.\n\nPeace.

Registered Nurse here; First let me clear up the myth, (untruth about mononucleosis), it does not stay with you for life.  The incubation period is about 7 to 21 days, give or take 3 or 4 days in either direction.  Someone that had mono 6 years ago, is in no way, shape, form or fashion caring it today, unless they have been re-exposed to the viral infection.
Every woman is different, but you should be able to still breastfeed. As soon as your baby is born iniate skin to skin contact and ask the midwife to help you breastfeed, the sooner you commence breastfeeding the better, even if baby only has a few sucks it all helps to stimulate the production of milk, try not to have pethidine in labour as this can make your baby sleepy in the first 24 hours. Your consultant will probably tell you that you can't breastfeed, but remember they tend to deal with general surgery and not midwifery. Most hospitals in the UK have breast feeding advisors that you can talk to before your baby is born.
I had a similar situation and the doctor told me it was nerves, it took 6 months to go away. It was like a knot in my throat when I swallowed. Went to several drs. Finally the throat dr told me to learn to relax.

Treatment and Prevention:\nThere is no specific treatment. Secondary bacterial infections may be treated with antibiotics. Live vaccines are available for vaccination of antibody-negative breeder flocks prior to the start of egg production. Administration is by injection or by addition to the drinking water depending on the type of vaccine available in individual countries. In some areas, transfer of litter to noncontaminated premises and the addition of crude homogenates of tissues from affected chickens to the drinking water have been used to ensure infection and seroconversion of parent flocks before they begin to lay, thereby diminishing the risk of egg transmission. However, these procedures are risky and not recommended. Because of the synergism between CAV and other immunosuppressive viruses, control of the latter is also important.\nAt present, there is no vaccine available to prevent subclinical losses in broilers.
no not at all. sexy is all in the way you view yourself. If you walk confidently people notice and it is sexy no matter what your size is. of course your body type appeals to certain people because everyone has their own preference. some guys like skinny, some like curvy, hell some guys like big mammas. Case in point everyone has their own sexyness that will attract a certain someone if they work it right.  so dont wonder if you are sexy...just be it.

pernicious anemia is caused by vitamin b12 deficiency, you can simply search on the internet, try webmd.com, mayoclinic.com etc, good luck
Nutrilite is the world oldest and largest nutritional supplement company. It's products are plant concentrates rather than synthetically produced isolated vitamins. A badly damaged kidney is going to have problems with virtually anything your sister puts in, so I'd be cautious with any new supplements, or indeed changes in diet. However, if her body is to try to repair itself, it will need the proper nutrients for her cells to function correctly. Being food concentrates Nutrilite is ideal for that. I'd recommend trying Daily and also Omega-3 and if all goes well swapping from Nutrilite Daily to Double X (if available) She may also need Iron as people with damaged kidneys are often anemic. Vitamin C may also be useful. Good luck!
when a cut is fresh it usually does turn white after you take a shower. so its not infected and when you get a carpet burn the scar is sometimes dotted because my carpet burns scar is dotted as well. i was sliding on the carpet floor somewhere. and well yea.so its dotted in a streak manner. but thats my answer.
I observed my roommate doing this to himself while he slept. I think it's a combination of stress and diet. If it gets serious, why not just wear a mitten? Lol.
With regards to a previous answer, several tests are NOT done on blood. For example, gonorrhea is usually cultured from exudate's. Trichomonas from a urinalysis (Trichomonas can only be detected via urinalysis. Trichomonas are protozoan pathogens that are motile flagellates which can be seen during a microscopic urinalysis.)\n\nChlamydia are a intracellular parasite, very similar to bacteria which are sometimes classified as gram-negative, though they are hard to stain. Unlike Trichomonas, it does respond to antibiotics similar to many other gram-negative bacteria.\n\nIt is usually confirmed via a test on vaginal, anal, or urethral exudate's or from a urine sample.\n\nJust because something is a localized infection, doesn't mean it doesn't show up in blood work. Syphilis is localized for some time before it starts to become more systemic. Blood tests are usually against antibodies to the infection, or from reactions to the infection (like the RPR to test for syphilis).\n\nI worked quite a few years in a clinical laboratory, testing for things like this.
You dont need a doctor..all a doctor is going to do is give you medication and way to may people are on medication that dont need to be. I know because my doctor tried to do the same thing to me and I dont need medication. Your depression sounds situational..in fact the reason you are depressed is because you cannot go home. You really want to go home so your frusterated that your not getting what you want. All you can do is be patient and accepting of the situation you are in now and make the most of it..try and be kind to your friends, and speak to those who may have similar experiences to yours. If worse comes to worse speak to a councellor, but dont run off to the doctor and get meds unless you feel like killing yourself etc. Im sure once you come to terms with not getting what you want youll feel a bit happier again.,
maybe it's retaining water.  drink lots of fluids througout the day to prevent water retention.  drinking 6 to 8 glasses of water is best.  be careful about salty fluids or eating salty food, sodium makes you retain water.
Yes.  I have seen numerous adults and children attempt suicide within the first month of starting Paxil.  Usually within the first 2 weeks.\n\nI know this is going on the records at hospitals but I have no idea what is being done about it.\n\nI wouldn't let anyone in my family take Paxil.  There are too many alternatives without the extreme side effects.
"Carbs don't ""turn"" into fat.  \n\nCarbs and all food are energy.  Your body only needs a certain amount of energy so if you eat more ""energy"" than you need, it gets stored as body fat.\n\nCarbs are used for energy before anything else.  Then protein, then dietary fat, then finally body fat.  If you eat too many carbs, then the protein & fat you're eating won't get used because they aren't needed.  If they aren't needed then your body won't use it's fat for energy because you already ate enough calories (energy).\n\nLook at it this way, if you weigh 200 pounds and need 2000 calories to stay that weight, then start eating 1000 calories your body will take 1000 calories from it's body fat to make up the difference.  \n\nYou need to use 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, so after 3 days you would lose 1 pound.\n\nUnless you did the Kimkins diet because it's thermogenic properties easily double that weight loss."
Just eat whatever youre craving!  Make sure youre doing it in a healthy way though.  For example, if you crave a milkshake, try making one with skim milk, crushed ice, protein powder (whatever flavor milkshake youre craving) and a big dollop of cool whip (stick it in the blender).  If it's pizza, make a homemade one with only fresh veggies and/or lean meats with part skim or fat free cheese.  And everything in moderation.  Put exactly one serving on your plate and put the rest away.  Laziness usually wins out, so you probably wont go get more, even if youre still hungry, esp if reheating is involved.  What do you crave?  I can try to give you a healthier alternative if you would like.

simple u just demand to be refered to another consultant its ur right if u feel that ur not getting the best treatment from the one ur seeing now
Scheurmann's Disease is usually associated with adolescents - where the upper back becomes more rounded than normal due to characteristic changes that take place within the vertebral endplates, leading to the bones becoming wedge shaped instead of square.\n\nHave you been diagnosed a long time ago - if so, you may be experiencing some degenerative changes in the small supportive joints in your vertebrae that have been slightly strained all along.\n\nIf that is the case, try something like local heat in the form of a hot water bottle wrapped in a towel every day on the painful part for 15-20 minutes. If you do it every time you have a cup of tea/coffee, it'll really start to help after a few days.\n\nTry to get some simple back strengthening exercises - if the vertebrae are wedge shaped, then your muscles are being stretched all the time, and gentle isometrics can help ease them.\n\nPosture is really important - check out your work and sitting positions - don't sit on anything that encourges you to round your back even more.  \nMake sure you bend your hips and not your back if you're working at paperwork sitting at a table.\n\nWhere do you use your computer - check out computer ergonomics tips online, ie having the top of the monitor at eye level etc.  \n\nAvoid very squashy couches that you sink back into.\n\nThis is going to be a longterm thing - you have to think more about management and less about cure.  I wish you the best of luck with it.

You need to increase the amount of water you are drinking.  Dehydration is the most common cause of constipation.
Its the change in the amount of light we get each day, its less during the fall and winter.  Some people also have condition called seasonal affect disorder where they become tired, depressed and sometimes anxious. This is also associated with the amount of light we are exposed to during the fall and winter. Try to get outside more if this isn't possible try going to a tanning booth.  If your worried about the damage from tanning booths use a good sun block and only stay in the booth for a short time 3 to 4 minutes your not looking to get tanned just to get the benifits of the extra light.  There are also special lights you can buy and sit under for 20 minutes a day.  They are expensive though usually around  $400.00  hope this helps.
Sounds like your typical sebacious cyst.  You can have one of these for a long time and have it NOT flare-up.  And then all of a sudden, it's swollen, red and oozing stinky, smelly fluid.  It's an encapsulated type of growth, so it will need to be excised in its entirety, not simpy drained.  Or it will return at a later date.  The surgeon I work for would most likely put you on antibiotics to calm down the immediate infection and then have you come back to have it excised at a later date while it's much more calmed down.  Simple, in-office procedure...10 minutes tops!!!
Actually a very good choice for a post work out meal if you combine it with some good protein.Shorter chain carbohydrates are a good choice after a work out.Basically what you're getting is maltose(from whatever grain they're made from) and glucose and possibly fructose from the syrup(that includes honey if you prefer that).\nA post work out meal has been shown to be most effective within 15-30 minutes afterwords.This isn't just anecdotal evidence there are studies on such things.You're more likely to replace muscle and liver glycogen if you eat within this window of opportunity.That basically means that those carbs are shunted away from fat cells(adipose tissue) and the carbs stored down as glycogen(stored carbohydrate).\nCombining both milk and eggs with this meal with further enhance recovery as well as cause a greater secretion of growth factors(IGF1 and growth hormone) as well as testosterone.If you use protein powders than a whey protein would be best as it's quickly digested and assimilated and has the highest biological value in humans.

Bedsores are still very much a common occurance.  Also called pressure ulcers. They are caused by lack of blood supply to a particular area.  So if some lies on their side for days and days or even weeks their skin in that particular area will not get the blood flow that it needs (nutrition)  and it will start to break down. They can be horrible extremely big and very hard to heal.  Another common area for bedsores is the heel of the foot and the lower back.  These areas get alot of pressure/lack of nutrition.  Hope this helps

"The first answer is really good, but you might also want to figure out what it is that frightens you.  It's probably something you're making up (like, ""It's brain cancer and I'm going to die!!!!"") and if you recognize that's what's scaring you, you can remind yourself that that's really not what's going on, and is no reason to be scared."
Its pretty simple, you watch what you eat and workout.  You need to burn more calories in a day than you take in. \nTips: \n-drink only water (you can get easily and extra thousand calorie a day from juice and sodas)\n-Excersize every day, even if its just a little. Walking around meal time is great. Get on a bike, play tennis, just stay active and don't sit around.\n-eat a lot of veggies.  Veggies are low in calories and fill you up faster. You can eat a lot more carrots for your calories than you can chocolate.\n-eat negative calorie foods. OK, so they are not really negative calories, but your body burns more calories to digest them that are in them, so it balances out to free calories! foods such as apples, radishes, asparagus...

I'm an Audiologist.\n\nAny sound inside your head is called tinnitus - it's a very broad, generalized term.  Many people just have it naturally.  I have had it my whole life.  The reason it seems louder when you are going to sleep is because there is less external noise to drown it out.  I run a fan to mask the noise in my ears, and many people buy noise machines for this purpose.\n\nSometimes people hear the ringing if there is a blockage of the ear -- from wax, negative pressure restricting eardrum movement, fluid build-up behind the eardrum, or an ear infection. In most cases, once the blockage is removed/treated and the ear has recovered, the ringing goes away. \n\nDoes your ear feel plugged? You don't mention a clogged sensation or fullness or hearing loss. The only way to know if there's a blockage is to have a doctor look in there. If there is fluid behind the eardrum, it may not be visible through the otoscope; the best way to measure the eardrum movement is through a quick and easy test called a tympanogram. It simply changes the air pressure in the ear canal and measure if/how the eardrum responds.\n\nTinnitus is also one of many Migraine Aura and may occur simultaneously with a headache or separately. Caffeine is a known Migraine trigger, so it can trigger/increase tinnitus for some people. In addition, some people who grind their teeth or have problems with their jaw joint (TMJ) can also have tinnitus.\n\nNoise exposure and systemic causes of tinnitus, like smoking or certain medications, typically effect both ears. One might be worse than the other, but almost never is only one ear effected. None of those herbal supplements have been scientifically proven to reduce or cure tinnitus. Ginko Biloba is the ONLY substance to date that has some scientific correlation to tinnitus reduction in SOME patients. \n\nMore serious conditions can cause tinnitus, but usually have other associated symptoms like dizziness or significant hearing loss. Some of these can be Meniere's Disease, Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss and Acoustic Neuroma. \n\nAs you can see, tinnitus is like headache or fever as a symptom - it can be congenital and benign, as it is with me, or it can be symptomatic of an ear or neurological disorder. So if you never had tinnitus, but do now, you should go to the doctor, especially if there are other symptoms, like hearing loss or dizziness, associated with it.  The key is to find the underlying cause, if possible. Therefore, it is crucial to have an accurate diagnosis made. See your family physician and/or an otolaryngologist.

Follow my diet below and you'll lose 20 lbs a month.\n\nThe first things you want to eliminate from what you eat are: sugar, fried foods, and white flour. You want to eat as natural and unprocessed food as possible.\n\nSugar, anything with it is bad. From Coco-Crispies cereal, nearly all sodas, to a small bag a M&M's. All turn into body fat fairly quickly.\n\nFried foods. Chips, french fries, etc. All have very high levels of calories and fats. Cut out mayonaisse and butter while you're at it.\n\nWhite flour. White breads, spahgetti, Ramen noodles, most cereals, tortillas (corn & flour).\n\nYou're going to want to eat 5-7 small meals/snacks in a day. That may seem like a lot of eating, but look at it this way. Say your lost in the woods and you need to make a fire that will last all night. Will the fire last longer throwing all the wood you've collected into the fire once or twice during the night, or if you toss a couple of logs in once every 45 minutes-hour?\n\nYour body is pretty similar. You need to feed it a little bit every 2-3 hours to keep it burning fat. The longer you go in between meals, the more likely your body is going to store what you eat as fat. This is because your body doesn't realize that there is food everywhere in the world we live in. It still thinks your a cave-man. And cave-men didn't get to eat very often. Sometimes once every 3-5 days...starving. So our body is designed to store what we eat as fat, because fat has the most energy (calories) per pound. So, if you sleep all night, then skip breakfast and don't eat until lunch at say 11:30am...you probably haven't ate anything in 12+ hours. So, your body thinks your starving, that there is no food to eat. Then you eat a nice, greasy, calorie-loaded slice of pizza. Your body will then store most of it as fat because it thinks there is a food shortage.\n\nFor your small size, aim for 5-6, 200-250 calorie meals/snacks.\nAlso try to eat 20 grams of protein at each meal. And of course, your going to want to keep even healthy carbs to a minimum (less than 60 grams a day).\n\nThe healthiest carbs are:\nYams\nOatmeal (no sugar)\nSweet Potatoes\nBrown Rice\n\nThe above do not affect your blood sugar levels enough to cause you to store fat, as they are digest very slowly.\n\nOK carbs are:\nWhole-grain bread/buns/tortillas (whole-grain should be the first name on the ingredients list)\nFruits\n\nAside from the carbs listed above, your meals should consist of:\nChicken breast\nTurkey breast\nTuna\nSalmon\nEgg whites\nAlmonds\nLow-fat cheese (cottage, string cheese)\nLots of vegtables\nLots of water\n\nYou need to drink 1 gallon (128oz)minimum per day. Water is what carries the toxins and fat you burn off out of your body through your urine. It also helps keep you feeling full and does wonders for your skin. If your urine isn't clear like water, drink more.\n\nAlso, take a multi-vitamin (like Centrum).\n\nIf you were to do cardio like ride a bike or jog for 20-45 minutes everyday AND diet, you'll be several sizes smaller in no time. But remember, losing weight is 90% about what you eat, not how much you exercise.\n\nBodybuilders and fitness models basically eat this way. Not only is it low calorie, low carb, high in protein and natural...it controls your blood/sugar levels and how your body uses the food based on the glycemic index.\n\nPS+ take a thermogenic fat burner also (hyrdroxycut, xenedrine, etc). Just remember to drink more water.\n\nAnd have 1 cheat meal a week. Gorge yourself on a couple monster burgers, pizza, or french fries...it doesn't matter. It will taste better than it EVER has and also give your mind and body a break.\n\nAlso, if you can lift weights (circut train) 3x a week.
Here is what you need to do, if you are serious about losing weight and keeping it off. Eat 6 small meals a day about every 4 hours. Here what that will do for you, your metabolism will increase (i.e. Loose weight) and you will have  more engry. If you go on a diet and eat less, your metabolism will slow down and store to fat. That is why diets dont work. Only the size of your fist, carbs (examples:baked potato, pasta, oatmeal, beans, corn, melon, apples, fat free yogurt, whole wheat breads)in one and protien (examples:chicken breast, swordfish, shrimp, turkey breast) in the other. You can also eat vegetables and salads with any meal, they dont have none or little fat). 30min cardo exercise every day. Any of these(examples: walking, jogging, swimming,running, biking, ect), Monday cardo, tues upper body (arms: curls, tricep extensions,pull ups, front press)(abdominals: leg pull crunch, leg raises), (chest: bench press, butterfly, pullover)(shoulders: front press, arm pullover, cross county skier machine)(back:seated row, lat pull downs, back extension)(YOU DONT HAVE TO DO IN ONE DAY, mix it up) wed cardo, thurs lower body (legs: leg pull,leg press, squats, lounges) fri cardo, sat upper. Sunday eat anything you want and dont exercising, you do this on sunday so your body doesnt go into starvation mode. YOU NEED TO TAKE SUNDAY OFF. If you stilck with this you will have a great body. also drink aleast 8oz of water daily! Stay away from Mcdonals, Wendys, ect because there is nothing good for you on the menu's even the salads are bad (beaon bits, cheeze, dressing, ect) Good Luck :)
"No. It's a myth.\n\nThis is another myth/hoax/urban legend. The American Cancer Society has this to say about 'sodium lauroy' (Sodium Laureth Sulfate):\n\n""Shampoo \n \nRumor:\n\nOne chain email floating through cyberspace says a common ingredient in many health and beauty aids is known to cause cancer. The warning reads: “Check the ingredients listed on your shampoo bottle, and see if they have this substance by the name of Sodium Laureth Sulfate, or simply SLS. This substance is found in most shampoos, and the manufacturers use it because it produces a lot of foam and it is cheap. BUT the fact is that SLS is used to scrub garage floors, and it is very strong. It is also proven that it can cause cancer in the long run. I went home and checked my shampoo (Vidal Sasoon), it doesn't contain it; however, others such as Vo5, Palmolive, Paul Mitchell, the new Hemp shampoo, etc. contains this substance."" \n\nFact:\n\nSodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and its chemical cousin sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) are known irritants, not known carcinogens. SLS and SLES are powerful surfactants (wetting agents) and detergents. They have industrial uses because they are detergents that exert emulsifying action, thereby removing oil and soil. There is no way of knowing where this Internet information comes from, but there are a variety of Web sites offering health and beauty products that are SLS-free. According to David Emery and his Urban Legends website, ""All these Web sites are maintained by 'independent distributors' for various multi-level marketing companies hawking natural personal care products. As a matter of fact, the majority of URLs returned in a standard Web search on the keywords 'sodium laureth sulfate' all point to versions of the same propaganda."" \n\nhttp://www.cancer.org/docroot/MED/content/MED_6_1x_Shampoo.asp?sitearea=MED"

"So, your cervical spine (top of back) is misaligned, thoracic (middle) spine is sprained, and lumbar is herniated.  First they do conservative methods with meds and physical therapy.  Do whatever you can before you opt for surgery.  They usually do it when the bulge finally ruptures.  The ortho companies are getting better with new products, but your spine is never the same and you usually wind up having more surgery.  I had a herniated disk at L5-S1.  My right leg went numb.  Started at the hip and eventually went down to my toes.  Could not walk or drive.  I ended up having 2 nerve blocks.  After the 2nd, I have been doing my exercises and not abusing my back.  I sit working all day and have to get up very often and ""stretch.""  I have been fine since.  \nA chiropractor usually fixes the subluxations, but if you are hurting all down your spine, that may be scary.  You either like chiropractors or you do not.  There is no middle ground.  I was pushed to try it and it made things worse.  I have friends who live for them.  Good luck."

get it checked out..it could be a blod clot....hurry. (I'm no expert).
It could be a combination of things, stress, diet, weight loss/gain, and hormones.  I was the same way when I was in high school, I would go a couple of months without my period (and I was a virgin so I knew I wasnt pregnant) and then I would get it. If it continues you should see a doctor to make sure it's nothing more like a hormonal inbalance. But you will be ok

"Metoclopramide Tablets (10 mg) PLIVA 430  round\nscored white \nGENERIC NAME: metoclopramide\nBRAND NAME: Reglan\nDRUG CLASS: Metoclopramide is a ""prokinetic"" agent that increases muscle tone of the lower esophagus sphincter. The lower esophagus sphincter, located between the esophagus and stomach, normally prevents reflux of acid and other stomach contents into the esophagus. In patients with Gastroesophageal Reflux (GERD), a weakened lower esophagus sphincter allows reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus, causing heart burn and acid damage to the esophagus (peptic esophagitis). Metoclopramide decreases stomach acid reflux by strengthening the lower esophagus sphincter. Like cisapride (Propulsid), metoclopramide also hastens the stomach emptying of solid and liquid meals into the intestines. Rapid emptying of meals also help decrease the reflux of stomach acid and other contents into the esophagus.\n\nMetoclopramide interferes with dopamine receptors in the brain. Since dopamine causes nausea. Metoclopramide can be an effective anti-nausea medication.\n\nWhile cisapride and metoclopramide are similar in decreasing gastroesophageal reflux, metoclopramide is more likely to cause nervous system side effects such as jitteriness, insomnia, sedation, or anxiety. \n\nPRESCRIPTION: no\n\nGENERIC AVAILABLE: yes\n\nPREPARATIONS: tablets: 5 mg and 10mg. Syrup: 5 mg/5 ml \n\nSTORAGE: Tablets and syrup should be stored at temperature between 15-30C \n(59-86F).\n\nPRESCRIBED FOR: Metoclopramide is used on a short term basis (4 to 12 weeks) for patients with heartburn and esophagitis due to gastroesophageal reflux. Please also read the Gastroesophageal Reflux (GERD) article. Stomach nerve damage due to diabetes (diabetic gastric stasis) can cause delayed stomach emptying, resulting in nausea, vomiting, fullness, and heartburn. Metoclopramide can be effective in relieving nausea and other symptoms related to diabetic gastric stasis. Metoclopramide is also used in the treatment of nausea related to postoperative state and cancer chemotherapy.\n\nDOSING: Metoclopramide is usually given four times daily, 30 minutes before each meal and at bedtime for the treatment of esophageal reflux. Dosage and frequency may be lowered in elderly patients, and in situations where symptoms occur only intermittently and at specific times. Concurrent administration of Anticholinergic medications can decrease the effectiveness of metoclopramide.\n\nDRUG INTERACTIONS: Metoclopramide can have nervous system side effects, such as depression, anxiety, sedation, restlessness, and insomnia. Parkinson patients can experience worsening of symptoms with metoclopramide. Metoclopramide may impair the mental and/or physical abilities to drive or operate machinery. Rarely, metoclopramide can cause involuntary muscle movements, facial grimacing, and dystonic reactions resembling tetanus. Since metoclopramide accelerates stomach emptying, it can increase absorption and effects of other medications. For example, the effects of sedatives such as alcohol and diazepam (Valium) can be accelerated when used together with metoclopramide. Safety in pregnancy, nursing mothers, and children has not been established.\n\nSIDE EFFECTS: Metoclopramide is generally well tolerated when used in low doses for brief periods. The nervous system side effects increase with higher doses and longer periods of treatment. The common side effects are mentioned above under Drug Interactions.\n\n\n 1   Glossary   metoclopramide"

"Teeth are remarkably strong, but they can chip, fracture or break. Teeth usually break as a result of trauma — from biting down on something hard, for example, or from a blow to the face. A child may fracture a tooth falling off a bike or curb during play. Cavities that have weakened the tooth also can cause chipping or fractures.\n\nIf a large piece of the tooth breaks off, it can hurt because the nerve inside the tooth may be damaged. If the nerve inside the tooth is exposed to air, saliva, or hot or cold foods or drinks, it can be extremely uncomfortable.\n\nWhen a tooth cracks or fractures, it may or may not hurt. You may not notice the damage immediately. Minor tooth fractures are unlikely to cause symptoms. Deeper fractures can be painful because the damage may extend to the nerve inside the tooth. Pain from fractures may be constant or may come and go. Many people feel pain when they chew because as they chew they apply pressure to the tooth. As the fractured tooth bites down on the food, the crack in the tooth gets wider, but once the pressure is released, the crack closes again.\n\nLarger fractures may cause a portion of the tooth to break off. \n\n \n  What You Can Do \n \n \n\nFractured Teeth \nThere is no way to treat fractured teeth at home. You need to see your dentist whenever a tooth is sensitive to changes in temperature or if it hurts while you're eating. Pain that's constant is a serious warning sign because it may mean that a fracture has damaged the nerve and live tissues inside the tooth. \nBroken Teeth \nYou'll want to see your dentist as soon as possible. Your dentist will need to determine if the break was caused by decay and if the nerve is in danger. Adults with a damaged nerve usually will require root canal treatment, but in children, there's a possibility the nerve can be saved if the dentist is able to treat the problem immediately.\n\nIn the meantime:\n\nSave the pieces. If the break was relatively clean, your dentist may be able to cement the tooth back together as a temporary measure. \nRinse your mouth well with warm water. If you were able to save the tooth\nfragment(s), rinse them under running water. \nIf an area is bleeding, apply a piece of gauze to the area for about 10 minutes or until the bleeding stops. \nApply a cold compress to the cheek or lips over the broken tooth. This will help reduce swelling and relieve pain. \nIf you can't get to your dentist right away, cover the broken surface of the tooth that is in your mouth with temporary dental cement, available in pharmacies. \nTake an over-the-counter pain reliever. \n \n  What Your Dentist Will Do \n \n \n\nFractured Teeth \nThere are several types of tooth fractures, each of which requires different treatments. These include: \nMinor cracks — Also called ""craze lines,"" these are superficial fractures that affect only the tooth's enamel, the outer white part of the tooth. Minor cracks rarely need treatment. However, your dentist may lightly polish the area to smooth out any rough spots. \n\n\nChips — Minor chips don't always need treatment, although your dentist may recommend repairing the damage with filling material to prevent it from getting worse or to make the tooth look better. If the chip is in the front of the mouth, your dentist probably will use a tooth-colored filling. Often, if the chip is very small, your dentist may lightly sand the area to smooth out any rough spots. \n\n\nCusp fractures — These affect the pointed chewing surfaces (the cusps) of the teeth. They usually do not affect the pulp and are unlikely to cause significant pain. They may interfere with normal chewing, however, so your dentist may need to repair the damage. Minor cusp fractures sometimes are repaired by filing the surfaces of the tooth to restore the shape of the tooth. Frequently, these fractures will require an onlay or crown, in which the tooth is covered with a metal or porcelain material. \n\n"

I would say it is not common for woman to urinate during a climax. What you might think is urination, could be an orgasm. Some females will squirt during their orgasm, but this is usually about 5-10 ml. Some maybe a little more, but not much. If you are passing more than say a big table spoon then you need to go and get checked out by your doctor. \n\nWeak bladder can cause this, but like I said, its not common. Hope this helps out, kind of hard to diagnose over the Internet cause lab tests and exams are a key part of it.

Try heat and ice.  I would suggest visiting a chiropactor who will determine if it is muscular, which it probably is if analgesics helped.

If it blisters, it blisters. There is no way to stop it from blistering, but keeping it cool is a great idea. Usually I get hot glue gun burns.

"Meditation and self-hypnosis tend to be different flavours of a very similar state. \n\nWith a structured outline for your session, self-hypnosis can be orchestrated by your conscious mind to actually achieve particular outcomes. Mainstream forms of Meditation tend to be focused on simply achieving a beneficial state that has a progressive and positive effect upon your levels of anxiety. \n\nIf you are looking at overcoming anxiety or phobias, then self-hypnosis is a far, far more applicable means of achieving this in my opinion and experience. \n\nI am of course deeply biased, but the best selling self-hypnosis book ""The Secrets of Self-Hypnosis: Harnessing The Power of Your Unconscious Mind"" is the best structured way to learn how to use it that I have encountered in 20 years of studying it. I am the author of that so let me give you some others too choose from too: \n\nThe Power of Your Subconscious Mind By Joseph Murphy.\nSelf-Hypnosis By Brian Alman.\nThrough The Open Door By Kevin Hogan.\n\nAll are great ways of learning more about how to communicate with your subconscious mind when you achieve self-hypnotic states."

Sorry to say this, but there's no such thing as spot reduction.  Different people carry and lose weight in different areas then others.  You're actually very lucky.  People that store more fat in areas away from the chest and midsection are much less likely to have heart and other weight related problems.  I'd just perform exercises and cardio that focus on the legs and butt to help tone those areas, and make sure to eat healthy.

Respiratory therapists and respiratory therapy technicians—also known as respiratory care practitioners—evaluate, treat, and care for patients with breathing or other cardiopulmonary disorders. Practicing under the direction of a physician, respiratory therapists assume primary responsibility for all respiratory care therapeutic treatments and diagnostic procedures, including the supervision of respiratory therapy technicians. Respiratory therapy technicians follow specific, well-defined respiratory care procedures under the direction of respiratory therapists and physicians. In clinical practice, many of the daily duties of therapists and technicians overlap; furthermore, the two have the same education and training requirements. However, therapists generally have greater responsibility than technicians. For example, respiratory therapists will consult with physicians and other health care staff to help develop and modify individual patient care plans. Respiratory therapists also are more likely to provide complex therapy requiring considerable independent judgment, such as caring for patients on life support in intensive-care units of hospitals. In this Handbook statement, the term respiratory therapists includes both respiratory therapists and respiratory therapy technicians.\n\nRespiratory therapists evaluate and treat all types of patients, ranging from premature infants whose lungs are not fully developed to elderly people whose lungs are diseased. Respiratory therapists provide temporary relief to patients with chronic asthma or emphysema, as well as emergency care to patients who are victims of a heart attack, stroke, drowning, or shock.\n\nTo evaluate patients, respiratory therapists interview them, perform limited physical examinations, and conduct diagnostic tests. For example, respiratory therapists test patients’ breathing capacity and determine the concentration of oxygen and other gases in patients’ blood. They also measure patients’ pH, which indicates the acidity or alkalinity of the blood. To evaluate a patient’s lung capacity, respiratory therapists have the patient breathe into an instrument that measures the volume and flow of oxygen during inhalation and exhalation. By comparing the reading with the norm for the patient’s age, height, weight, and sex, respiratory therapists can provide information that helps determine whether the patient has any lung deficiencies. To analyze oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pH levels, therapists draw an arterial blood sample, place it in a blood gas analyzer, and relay the results to a physician, who then may make treatment decisions.\n\nTo treat patients, respiratory therapists use oxygen or oxygen mixtures, chest physiotherapy, and aerosol medications. When a patient has difficulty getting enough oxygen into his or her blood, therapists increase the patient’s concentration of oxygen by placing an oxygen mask or nasal cannula on the patient and set the oxygen flow at the level prescribed by a physician. Therapists also connect patients who cannot breathe on their own to ventilators that deliver pressurized oxygen into the lungs. The therapists insert a tube into the patient’s trachea, or windpipe; connect the tube to the ventilator; and set the rate, volume, and oxygen concentration of the oxygen mixture entering the patient’s lungs.\n\nTherapists perform regular assessments of patients and equipment. If the patient appears to be having difficulty breathing or if the oxygen, carbon dioxide, or pH level of the blood is abnormal, therapists change the ventilator setting according to the doctor’s orders or check the equipment for mechanical problems. In home care, therapists teach patients and their families to use ventilators and other life-support systems. In addition, therapists visit patients several times a month to inspect and clean equipment and to ensure its proper use. Therapists also make emergency visits if equipment problems arise.\n\nRespirator
Stop eating CRAP!!  Workout!!! There is no secret to losing weight.  You have to change your life style.  Get a personal trainer, put down the cookies and pick up fruit. Don't be a dumb a**.
As long as the doctors have checked it out, its does sound as if you may need to start by addressing the weight and the stress, get those sorted and if its still there make them check you out again
As an overweight child i have had mush success with weight loss ( i was 150 at 5 foot) It would be very helpful if you checked out your bmi http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/bmicalc.htm and that will give u a general amount of weight you would need to use. I strongly advise going to see a nutritionist.\n\nAs for eating habits http://www.mypyramid.gov/ this site will help you get an eating plan with cups and ounces of certain foods you should eat each day.\n\nExercising, make sure you exercise for 60 minutes a day. Do exercises that make you sweat and bring up your heart rate. Walking is a miracle, walk like you are late for a very important meaning. I started with one mile a day and then gradually got to about 3. Walk with a friend or a dog so you are not bored. DO FUN EXERCISE!!!!! You will lose interest fast if you do something boring. Do squats, crunches, anything, but have fun!\n\nBest of luck to you and God bless
It could be pleuracy which can feel like you are having a heart attack.  Or it could just be heart burn.  In either case you should see a doc because I, of course, am not a specialist in any medical area.  My only experience with your problem is that my Mom thought she was having a heart attack with the same symptoms and you don't want to ignore it.
It's highly unlikely. The seat part of the toilet is usually very clean, and tests have shown that per square centimetre, your office desk has 50 times more bacteria than a toilet seat. In fact, you probably have more germs in your kitchen sink.\n\nAlso, if you think about it, normally only the backs of people's legs touch a toilet seat, and it's not very easy to transmit disease that way.
"That sounds horrible!  If she has been diagnosed with an STD, it is reported to the Department of Health. If she knowingly infects someone else and they become infected; they MAY be able to take legal action only if they have proof it was from her. This is difficult because you cannot always prove ""when"" you were infected. Tell your friend to go to the doctor and seek treatment. Most STDs are curable, but if left untreated many side effects including infertility can occur."
"Do not do sit-ups! All that will do is build the muscle and define abs behind your ""fat"" no matter how little it may be. You want to get a cardio workout to burn the carbs in your body and that will help you lose fat. i suggest running or jump rope, something that gets the heart rate going up to about 160bpm. If your diet is already well balanced then changing your diet isn't usually necessary. You will soon start to notice the inches falling off! good luck!"
Instead of paying tons of money on TV advertisements invest you money in a natural supplement call Yohimbe bark.  It increases circulation and I've known it to work better than Enzyte and is much nicer to your wallet.

1. eat properly\n2. get enough sleep\n3. do not put yourself in a situation that is disturbing, i.e. do not get into debt.\n4. find a doctor you trust and who listens to you.\n5. take your medication, always and on time.\n6. keep your home tidy, do a little at a time, but do it whether you feel like it or not.\n7. stay in touch with your doctor\n8. stay in touch with your family.

"Used to represent a ""life-style"", it was very smartly advertised in the 50´s and 60´s, and must of the famous people around the world used to smoke, even public presenters and performers used to do this in front of the camera, so there were 3 or 4 generations that growth with that cliche of smoking is cool, but from 80 to our days, there is being a social campaign of consciousness of the big damage it can produce to human body, so nothing cool with smoking anymore, other than a teen-age believe the top of the adult by smoking..."

Using veggies gets the job done in a pinch, but a better solution to your problem is to pick up a vibrator or a dildo.  Long term the cost of ownership will be lower, and there is virtually no chance that a vibrator or dildo will break off inside of you as a carrot, banana, or other item may.  You do not want to have to go to the emergency room to have the doctor remove a piece of vegetable from inside of you, or to explain to him exactly how it got there in the first place.\n\nIf you are uncomfortable with the idea of going to an adult bookstore to purchase your toy, you can do it discretely from home, on line. libida.com offers reasonable prices, an acceptable selection, and VERY discrete shipping – no need to be embarrassed.\n\nAt the very least, if you have your heart set on a veggie, or you are just smitten by the look of that cuke in the market – at least roll a condom over it to hold all of its parts together if it decides it can’t take the stress of your love tunnel.  Much easier than going to the emergency room.\n\n\nhttp://www.libida.com/\n\nhttp://www.collegesexadvice.com/masturbation-mistakes.shtml
Lymphocytosis is an increase in the number of lymphocytes in the blood. Lymphocytosis conventionally refers to a lymphocyte count greater than 4000 per microliter, however the number may be higher in infants and children. It is common in acute viral infections, including glandular fever, but it may also be seen with intracellular bacterial infections, such as in tuberculosis. The malignant blood disease chronic lymphocytic leukaemia can cause a massive lymphocytosis, as can other leukaemias. Lymphocytosis, preceded by leukopenia, is also seen in the Icteric Phase of a viral hepatitis infection.

Everybody is different.  Most pregnant women start showing at about 4 or 5 months, but some do earlier or later.  It usually isn't really obvious until about 7 months.  At 4 or 5 months, a pregnant woman can usually feel the uterus in her abdomen.  But it depends on the size of the woman and the size of the baby as to when and how much she shows.  For an overweight woman, she may not show till much later.

Your question is a bit unclear.  Does that mean you want to have fewer periods during the year or that you want your period to be shorter each month.  In either case, if you want less frequent periods there are medications that can reduce your periods to only 4 per year.  This birth control medication is relatively safe if you are in good health, but you should discuss this with your OB/GYN (gynecologist) what would be the best option so that your period wasn't such an inconvenience or more manageable each month.  Without medication, mother nature does what she pleases when it comes to your hormones and how your period is each month.

If you were to reduce your calorie intake by 100 calories a day you could lose weight. For example you swap a coke a day with water. There are various reasons why people lose weight. Some include sickness, stress, worms even. Some explained and others can't be. If you aren't sleeping enough that can also assist with weight loss. So the answer is yes, a person can lose weight without even trying.
Try this for a start, the go on to a well balanced diet and regular exercise.  This does work.......\n\nBASIC  FAT  BURNING  SOUP\n\n6 large green onions                                    2 green peppers                             \n1 or 2 cans of tomatoes [crushed]              1/2 bunch of celery                                 \n1 large head of cabbage                                1 pkg. Lipton onion soup\n4 cups of water\n\nSeason with 1/4 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. pepper, 1/4 tsp. curry, 1 Tbsp. parsley, if desired or bouillon or hot sauce. Cut vegetables in small to medium pieces and cover with water. Boil fast for ten minutes.  Reduce to simmer and continue cooking until vegetables are tender.  This soup can be eaten anytime you are hungry.  Eat as much as you want, whenever you want.  This soup will not add calories.  The more you eat the more you will lose.  Fill a thermos in the morning if you will be away during the day.  If eaten for indefinite periods you would suffer malnutrition.\n=============================================================\n\nDAY ONE:  All fruits except bananas.  Cantaloupe and watermelon are lower in calories than most fruits.  Eat only the soup and fruits.  For drinks; unsweetened tea, cranberry juice, or water.\n\nDAY TWO:  All vegetables.  Eat until you are stuffed with all the fresh, raw, or canned vegetables.  Try to eat green leafy veggies and stay away from dry beans, peas, and corn. Eat along with the soup.  At dinner time on this day, reward yourself with a big baked potato and butter.  Do not eat any fruits.\n\nDAY THREE:  Eat all the soup, fruits, and vegetables you want.  Do not have a baked potato.  If you have eaten for three days as above, and have not cheated, you will have lost 5 to 7 pounds.\n\nDAY FOUR:  Bananas and skim milk. Eat as many as 8 bananas and drink as many glasses of water as you can on this day along with the soup.  Bananas are high in calories and carbohydrates and so is the milk, but on this particular day your body will need the potassium and \nthe carbohydrates, proteins and calcium to lessen your craving for sweets.\n\nDAY FIVE:  Beef and tomatoes.  You may have 10 to 20 ounces of beef and a can of tomatoes or as many as 6 fresh tomatoes on this day.  Try to drink at least 6 to 8 glasses of water\nthis day to wash away the acid in your body.  Eat the soup at least once this day.\n\nDAY SIX:  Beef and veggies.  Eat to your heart's content of the beef and vegetables this day.  You can even have two or three steaks if you like with the green leafy vegetables, but no baked potato.  be sure and eat the soup.\n\nDAY SEVEN:  Brown rice, unsweetened fruit juices and vegetables. Again, stuff yourself.  Be sure to have the soup at least once today.\n\nAt the end of the seventh day, if you have not cheated on the above diet, you will have lost 10 to 17 pounds.  If  you have lost more than 17 pounds, stay off the diet for two days before resuming again from day one.\n \nThis seven day eating plan can be used as often as you like.  As a matter of fact, if correctly followed, it will clean your system of impurities and give you a feeling of well-being as never before.\n\nAfter only seven days of this process, you will begin to feel lighter by at least 10 and possibly 17 pounds, having an abundance of energy.  Continue this plan as long as you wish and feel the difference.\n\nThis diet is fast, fat-burning, and the secret is that you will burn more calories than you take in. It will flush your system of impurities and give you a feeling of well-being.  This diet does not lend itself to drinking any alcoholic beveragesat any time because of the removal of fat build-up in your system.  Go off the diet at least 24 hours before any intake of alcohol.\n\nBecause everyone's digestive system is different, this diet will affect everyone differently.  After day three, you will have more energy than when you began, if you did not cheat.  After\nbeing on this diet for several

Has your doctor checked your beta hcg levels?  That will tell a lot.  Congratulations on being pregnant!  A little FYI, the further you get along in your pregnancy the more anxious for ultrasounds and doctor appointments you will get so try not to get too worried.  I am sure everything is fine or your doctor would have scheduled the necessary for earlier.  Good Luck!  Have a very happy and healthy nine months!

yes there is always a little dribble of sperm first before all of the other seminal fluids catch up during the ejaculation process.  That is why pulling the penis out just before ejaculating is not a good system of birth control.
i am afraid of death .....who knows what comes next? it is a very scary thing ....i think i  am afraid of change i always worry about getting older and i freak out when my life isn't planned out or if things have to change for some reason examples...moving,starting a new job,my kids growing up,my daughter starting school,my son going into junior high this year...this shit scares the hell out of me......i don't like spiders either
You are going to love this.. the water doesn't go bad...\nthe bottle does. :)\nThe platic breaks down, slowly.. so that after months adn months of sitting there, the water starts to have enough plastic molecules floating around in it that you can taste it. Try drinking really old bottled water, you will get a disgusting sticky kinda film on your mouth - that's plastic. I don't know if glass bottles of water have that or not, glass breaks down too, but it's not nearly as soluble in water.
i do. i had a weird symptom, tho. i was having deep, sharp abdominal pains that I couldn't get diagnosed as anything until a surgeon recommended I get an MRI and I found out it was a herniated disc. I went to a chiropractor for about 3 monoths (which never really helped all that much) but once I started working out again, the pain subsided as I got stronger. \n\nMy advice? See a physical therapist because they will be able to strengthen your abs and back to a point where you will overcome the injury. And supposedly, all nerve damage should heal (if it's going to) within 6 months, so after that, you will know if the pain is going to stay with you or not.
duh! they all do!! duh!
yes it will...severly too!

"Eat healthy foods and smaller portions, plus do some exercising.  Bike riding is good for an all around workout.  You can also use free-weights.  A cheap alternative is a resistance band and exercise ball.  Eating healthy is a big one.  Also, cut down on soda and coffee.  Try to replace it with water or 100% juice on occassion.  You can still have your one coffee or soda in the morning, but for the rest of the day try to drink water.  A good diet is always just a combo of eating right and exercising.  Try to pack a snack for yourself during the day... and pack your lunch rather than eating out.  Try some small pretzel sticks or an apple as a snack.  Don't skip breaktfast because it will make you hungry for the rest of the day.  Try a hardboiled egg and a piece of fruit, along with a glass of OJ.  Good luck and just remember... if you ""screw up"" by having a snack, it won't ruin your whole diet... everyone messes up, just try to get yourself back on track!!!"
No, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night
I think the basis of Positive thinking is that whatever your major focus is on, is the best way to make it happen. Not everything will turn out exactly as you want it too..but when your mind is focused on positive things and positive thoughts, you start producing more positive results. The best illustration I can think of is like when you bowl or golf, I was taught that when you let go of the ball in bowling, to leave your arm pointed in the direction you want the ball to go and not to put your arm down immediately. It works. But it's because some people bring their arm down just a fraction of an instant before they let go of the ball and that changes the direction of the ball. So if you leave your arm pointed where you want it to go and it's a habit to do that, then more than likely your ball will head where you want it too. And your mind works the same way. A positive minded person always believes there is a way to accomplish something and most of them do. A negative thinker almost always thinks something can't be done and because of that, they give up and it doesn't happen. You fail before you start because your mind is overwhelmed with the thought that it can't happen in the first place. When you keep your mind focused and believe that something can be done...you usually do find a way to do it. Just make sure you really want what you ask for.
"Why are you counting the days and obsessing about this medication if your doctor gave it to you for a specific disorder?  Do you realize how common it is for treated patients to get off the meds because they somehow convince themselves that ""it's not working for"" them?

If you want to be whole, well and healthy mentally, continue to take your meds until your next office visit.  Some take up to 3 weeks to see complete results.\n\nDo yourself a big favor and think about something productive, please.  Don't talk yourself out of your medication before you give it a chance to work properly or without medical advice.\n\nGod Bless"
"As a general rule antibiotics hurt the liver, and destroy beneficial bacteria without which we cannot be healthy (e.g. digestion, immunity and the ability to eliminate depend on them!), cause yeast overgrowth and resultant immune suppression, and generally fight no more than 7 types of bacteria, which are developing superstrain immunity as we speak.  There is nothing more medieval than giving someone poison to fight an infection, most of which aren't bacterial in origin to begin with.\n\nInstead of taking DEATH, i.e. ""ANTI"" ""BIOTICS"" = translated ""AGAINST LIFE,"" why not start with the safe and effective PROBIOTIC: ""For LIfe.""\n\nDeath dealing medicine is a sick, perverse Joke."
I am most comfortable when the office personnel act in a professional way and are not busy chatting with others in the office over your head and around you.  The assistant should be attentive and friendly but not condescending.  Acting brusque and hurried is a no-no, too.
It is very simple. When one finds himself or herself in an environment where the level of achievement has nothing to do with level of commendation or respect or acceptance it is possible for one's gender o be considered a bad lot. For example in some parts of Africa women still don't have a say in anything, though they may have a stake.
It is a combination of crunches/sit-ups and cardio. Cardio is very important because it burns the fat that sorrounds your ABs. Crunches and sit-ups do not reduce size, they just build and tone muscle.\n\nAnd of course a balanced diet, cutting down on sugars and fat.
I think it's more a case of how their quality of life was until they died. If the person was active and happy and involved in life regardless of their chronologic age...they were too young.

Drink at least 4 liters of water a day, make sure that your getting about 8 hours of sleep a night.  Go in for a massage every other month or so to relax your muscles cause every single day exercising isn't good for them, you want to have at least a day off a week.

It certainly can, but there would normally be other problems as well.   Vertigo and ballance problems can be caused by infections near the vestibular section of the vestibulococlear nerve (cranial nerve 8), that passes through the internal acoustic meatus, which is connected to the teeth because the teeth get sensory innervation from branches of the facial nerve, which also passes through the internal acoustic meatus.  Blurred vision would be a little harder to explain, I'd bet the optic nerve is not being impinged upon, but perhaps the infection is causing pressure inside the orbit and blurring the vision.  I hope you are at the very least on an antibiotic.  This isn't really all that likely to have happened, and it would be a little easier to believe if you also had ringing ears and painful, puffy eyes.  Perhaps the dental infection and the other symptoms are unrelated, but either way they need to be treated.

The one year statute of limitations does not apply to all cases.  Make sure that your attorney does personal injury law.  There are many areas of law.  Do you have any evidence to support your claims?  Medical records, work schedules, work assignment sheets could be used to prove that there has been a substantial change in your ability to do work for that particular employer.  Some states allow up to three years for medical claims due to the outcome of the treatment not being immediately available.\n\nFiling for unemployment compensation should be sought; whether it is awarded or not.  This is done at state level and usually involves filling out paperwork to substantiate your claim.  Your employer will be asked to submit a statement.  This step will help to validate the reasons for your dismissal from work.\n\nSee resource reference:  www.merck.com  \nExtensive loss of body functions can be devastating, causing depression and loss of self-esteem. Learning exactly what has happened and what to expect in the near and distant future helps people cope with the loss. Physical and occupational therapy (see Rehabilitation: Physical Therapy) helps preserve muscle function. Therapists teach people special techniques to help them overcome lost functions. For most people, compassionate and skilled nursing care, psychologic counseling, and emotional support from family members and close friends help. Family members may also benefit from counseling.\n\nPerhaps a neurosurgeon could better diagnose your condition.  A trauma spinal injury may be of several types (see source).  Your attorney should have their (doctor's) statements on file as it pertains to your particular case.  Contact organizations such as the Christopher Reeves Foundation to learn of advancements in spinal cord research.\n\nSome states have departments that specialize in Rehabilitation Services.  They offer training to those who qualify (and pending funding availability).  They test to determine areas of interest and types of work that you can do.  They often pay for education or training that will enable you to continue working.  Learning to do other work may enable you to continue working.  It would help prevent a sense of helplessness and depression due to lack of personal fulfillment.  If your state offers Job Service, speaking with them about Rehabilitative Services may provide a name and telephone number to get things started.\n\nOften physical therapy is part of spinal injury treatment.  One should be careful not to irritate the injury site or create further damage.  If disability was denied on two separate occassions, they probably feel certain of your ability to work.  They, too, may be able to refer you to services designed to help in your recovery from your injury.

I would suggest posting your question in travel, as I got better results there in terms of answers. If people know where you live, they are more apt to know where to locate help for you. To best answer your question, there is a very helpful newsletter for those on the high-functioning autism spectrum and Asperger Syndrome. They also have a networking directory. I will leave their website below. I wish you the best of luck. In the same boat-Aspie79IL

"What form of diabetes?  Controlled, or uncontrolled?\n\nExcessive weight around the middle is a sign of insulin resistance (the classic ""apple shape"").  Excess stress hormone cortisol can also cause you to carry weight around the middle.  If your partner is type 2 diabetic, they may be completely unable to lose weight without being put on the proper medication (something like metformin/glucophage).  If it's caused by stress, pressure from you to lose weight won't help that much.\n\nRather than asking them to lose weight, why not focus on ways you can help?  If you cook the meals or buy the groceries, concentrate on healthier items.  If your partner is insulin resistant, carbohydrates are quite often the guilty party.  Perhaps if you lower your carbohydrate intake to improve your health and/or lose weight yourself and ask your partner to help you, it will be more effective than asking them to lose weight themselves.  You can also add exercise to your life and ask your partner to join you, again to be supportive of you.  Take a walk every day.  Join a gym.  Something you can both do together.  That way, you not only improve both of your health, you also have some additional bonding time.  \n\nMy point is, your partner is most likely aware that they need to lose weight.  Being supportive about it rather than adding more guilt and stress will most likely be more productive in the end, and give you both yet another way to bond.  Good luck to you."
Have you ever peed before? If so, and it has always burned, yes. If this is a *new* condition then your sister must have given you something she caught from your dad. You'd better cut it off before you accidentally breed.
I was raped by my x.  He got 8 months in jail while i recieved the rest of my life with the most beautiful girl.  I tried abortion and was unable to finish it.  \nTake this as a sign from God that there is a reason for this child.  If you are unable to keep it than yes adopt the child out. \nThe child you carry could very well save the world from cancer, come up with the next treatment for sever retardation in children, or invent the most increadible machine ever. \n\nWhat we choose to do makes a differance in the future.  This has happened for a reason.  Go see a doctor, take prenatal vitamans take care of yourself and this baby.  The child living through the abortion pills and inseres makes me believe that this child is wanting to live.  That should have been enough signs but if you are anything like myself I was takingin home preg tests up till 2 weeks before my daughter was born.  I though it would go away.  \nI laugh at this now 12 years later.  I know you are scared and worrid about what this child may turn out like, but believe me if i  have learned nothing in the last 13 years it is that God has a plan.  I may not know what it is but I do know that when I look at the child i carried i still thank God she lived thought the last 13 years of her life.  \n\nI spent the first 9 months trying to figure out how to get rid of this child, and since have spent the last 12 years 3 months trying to figure out how to save her from the tormoils of the world.  \n\nTeenage years here we come.  Take this as a blessing and move on.  See a doctor, take care and always believe that the Lord will bring you through what ever you need.\nI often screamed at God telling him that he has forgoten me, does not realize that i am unable to deal with that which he has given me.  Then i look at my childs eyes and realize.  NOt only did he give me a way to work through the rape, he gave me the most amazing gift any one can have.  A child who loves me for me.  \n\nGood luck and feel free to email me.
"Every 15 minutes or so, look away from the book and focus on something far away for about 30 seconds.  Our eyes are normally ""binocular"", and when we read, they become ""monocular"", focusing on one close thing.  \n\nAlso, try this:  Rub your hands together until they're warm.  ""Palm"" your eyes--that is, place your hands over your eyes, but don't put pressure on them.  Then imagine you're looking at something far, far away; you'll feel the focus changing in your eyes, while the heat will help relax the muscles around them."

"Andy,\n\nThere are two questions here:\n\nA) Are you predisposed to Diabetes? \n\nIn general, if one's parents have diabetes, then it is likely that one will have a genetic predisposition to diabetes -- i.e. if ya daddy got it, and ya mamma got it, then the kids are more likely to get it. \n\nThe number one caution most doctors would recommend to someone worried about diabetes is to: WATCH your weight. Controlling one's weight (suggest web searching for BMI, or body mass index) will be critical and essential to preventing and controlling diabetes. \n\nA glucose of 82, is considered normal. Regular followup of this number is recommended by most physicians.\n\nB) I will defer interpreting your cholesterol test your doctor. A ""target"" (or ""goal"") LDL is based on numerous factors, including clinical history; but in general, the lower the better. For example, an LDL <70 is recommended for persons who have had a heart attack; whereas those with diabetes are urged to keep their LDL <100.\n\nIn general, I suggest you follow with your PMD (primary care doctor) not only so that he/she can interpret results, but give you a ""clinical"" context. \n\nKeep well, keep healthy.\n\n\n\nDisclaimers: \n\nIn addition to the disclaimers already stated by Yahoo.com: \n\nNOTE: The information communicated here does not constitute or imply a patient-doctor interaction or relationship; the reader and/or recipient of any ""answer"" agrees to hold the writer harmless from any loss, harm, injury or damage resulting from or arising out of your submission of the question or your use of or reliance on any response thereto.\n\nAs Stated: Yahoo!

outpatient surgery--in and out- sameday
You might have a bipolar disorder or perhaps even something similar to an obsessive compulsive disorder or phobia against stagnation, or things remaining the same.\n\nMy advice, not including therapy and/or meds, would be to change the little things that you can as often as you can. Wear your hair differently as your mood strikes. Change your clothes often if necessary.\n\nRather than move your furniture around all the time, get some decorative slip covers for your chairs and couch and such. Get a couple different styles and change them often but only move your furniture once in a while. This will save your furniture and your back.\n\nRegarding your job, try to change the things that you can without threatening your job security. If you have your own work space, change the decor as you see fit. Change the flowers, change the pictures that you have. If you've got kids, hang their drawings but change them up. Kids are always making new things.\n\nIn other words, find a way to change that things that you can without having to give up things that you work hard for.  See the big picture of your disorder and conquer it. Don't concentrate on controlling your disorder, but rather controlling yourself. It may seem like a technicality, but it helps some people.
If the screen was flashing you could possibly have migraines caused by the light.  I have a sensitivity to fluorescent lights and cannot stay under just that kind of light for more than an hour or so.  My neurologist said that the lights flash very quickly and it causes a reaction in the brain similar to epilepsy, but not on such a severe scale.  I would get terrible migraines and lose my short-term memory. Good luck!

hi there\ni am very allergic to blueberries. I get horrible stomachaches and a rash as well. the best thing to do, well, really the only thing to do is to avoid them alltogether. it sucks if you like them, but if you want to avoid the stomache pains, you'll have to give them up. also, you may want to talk to your doctor or be referred to an allergist for a test to see if you may be allergic to anything else.\nit also may be a food sensitivity or intolerance rather than an allergy. the outcome is still the same, you'll still have to stop eating them. hope this helps you
hate to say it but its not no issue with me i would like to lose a bout fifty lbs.
"These descirbe your rbc hemoglobin content.  The MCV (mean corpuscular volume) is basically saying ""how much volume is in your reb blodd cells"".  One of the main components of your RBCs is hemoglobin and, you need iron to make hemoglobin.  Thus, a low MCV might mean that you are low on iron.  BUT, your RDW is a commnet to how acccurate the MCV is - the fact that it is high says that the MCV is essentially usuless as a diagnosic number.  The MCH is another measure of hemoglobin in your RBC, but MDs don't use this number much.  It's just given because it's a calcualted value from the other numbers given.\n\nNone of these numbers have anyhting to do with your throid.  Although, the MCV can go up or down depending on your throid status.  But, again, the fact that the RDW is high negates it clinical value.\n\nBIG PICTURE: You are fine, if these are the only numbers that are off in your CBC.  If you are worried about your thyroid, get specific tests for them. All you really need is a TSH."

Sure,\n\nAlso headache, earpain, buzzing.\nAnd they don't even have to appear. They are building up pressure for a long time and could just stop before breaking the surface.

Hello..Visit your doctor again..If you suffer in general fron Panic attacks or Generalized Anxiety disorder it is supposed that you have undergone some adequate cure. If that happened all of a sudden it is more probable to be a post-traumetic stress,associated with panic and anxiety..For that condition the best temporarily used medications are Xanax and Valium(Xanax is better). You should visit a good shrink to prescribe you the proper cure that have to include a SSRI antidepressant(Zoloft works fine) and He/She could add you an anxiolitic drug,like Xanax. Propranolol in general is not well tolerated by the patient and I would not prescribe it..Anyway,your feeling of pressure on your chest can be a side effect of the Propranolol intake..If you feel still unsure contact me..Good luck!!
"Dear Bobo:\n\nI think it is very natural to feel worried about a heart attack if one's father has just died of one a couple of months ago. \n\nHere is my answer:\n\nFIRST: You ARE worried; the question is, SHOULD you be worried? \n\nThe answer is more difficult than just statistics. If you want statistics, cardiac risk, i.e. the risk of a heart attack can be easily calculated:\n\nhttp://hp2010.nhlbihin.net/atpiii/calculator.asp\n\nBut as it states, this calculator, which is used nearly universally by physicians, applies only for those age 20 or greater. Why is that? Because the heart is like pump -- like any mechanical thing, be it one's car or one's sneakers, it wears out over time, and the older one is, the more likely one is have one's heart give out. Since 20 year olds rarely die of heart attacks (i.e. unless you do crack, etc), its not possible to calculate the odds for the ""average"" 16 year old.\n\nSECOND: What IS a heart attack? Generally, it implies a blockage of one of the arteries supplying blood to the heart. The heart, like any muscle, or any machine, requires fuel -- in this case, oxygen, which is supplied to it by the piping called coronary arteries. When these get plugged up, like any pipe, what is needed can't get through. When this happens to living tissue, the tissue dies. In the case of the heart, as it is the main (and only) pump supplying blood to the rest of the body, if the damage is servere enough, then the pump (i.e. heart) completely fails, the entire body is starved of oxygen, and one passes away.\n\nWhat, then, makes one more likely to have a heart attack? Many things, such as genetics, i.e. a family history of heart disease. But, from this discription, anything that stresses or clogs the piping (arteries) to the heart -- i.e. causes heart disease, also known as atherosclerosis. Stuff like high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes (sugar in the piping, like sugar-water on the table, is sticky and gums up the works), high cholesterol, obesity (which is often a cause of SLEEP APNEA), all increase one's risk.\n\nGenerally, when a healthy 16 year old walks into a doctor's office asking, am i at risk for a heart attack, the physician will likely wonder why the patient is asking, rather than being worried about the patient actually being at risk.\n\nWhich brings me to YOUR question: ""could somebody help me?"" \n\n-- the answer I think is: please, please consider talking to a counselor at your school; friends, siblings, a hotline, a doctor. You are worried about your mortality; And right after a family member has died, more so. It's natural, but often, it helps to talk about it. \n\nGo ask your doctor this question, and see what she or he has to say. It'll be worth it. As for heart disease, see your doctor regularly over the years, listen to their advice, and . . .\n\nKeep well, keep healthy.\n\n-------\n\nDisclaimers: \n\nIn addition to the disclaimers already stated by Yahoo.com: \n\nNOTE: The information communicated here does not constitute or imply a patient-doctor interaction or relationship; the reader and/or recipient of any ""answer"" agrees to hold the writer harmless from any loss, harm, injury or damage resulting from or arising out of your submission of the question or your use of or reliance on any response thereto.\n\nAs Stated: Yahoo!

If it burns when you urinate, it may be a urinary tract infection.  For vaginitis, my friend used Desitin (spelling approximate) ointment.

Male or female?...They check sperm count on males and make sure  it is zero..with women they cut and burn the tubes..but there is a small chance that you can get pregnant in your tubes (ectopic pregnancy) (rare but possible) and this can be treated with medication or sometimes surgery.
There are some great books on this, especially for getting kids to eat veggies.  The books have great pics that show you how to make faces out of vegies and just make them more appealing visually.

wow...this is a tough one that should be looked at and answered only by your Doctor! You could have anything from endometriosis to the flu, to spinal meningitis!

The getting dizzy part makes me worry about your circulation and high blood pressure...the neck thing and throat, makes me wonder about so many other things...and having cramps is a major part of having a period...but, if they are that bad, you need to be looked at by a Dr.

Actually both of the first answers are correct.

Hi...these are just tips, but they're useful:\n1-Count the cigarettes you smoke every day, ...-1 each day/week,slowly!\n2-If you're into coffe-cigarette thing, stop drinking coffee!\n3-If you can't help smoking one, smoke it with the hand you usually don't use, don't sit, stay in a place you don't like. Uncomfortable feelings related to smoking do help!\n4-don't buy cigarettes!At least you can ask someone for one.But if you haven't got the packet, it's more difficult to smoke!\n5-No lighters in your house, no ashtrails.No one is allowed to smoke in your house, not even YOU.\n6-Tell everyone you quitted smoking, so if they see you smoking they're going to have fun on you or think you're weak-willed.\n7-Is there a taste in your mouth that doesn't make you smoke at all (for me, strawberry candies)...use it!\n8-Are you into alcohol/beer-cigarette thing?Avoid it!\n9-I think it's better to quit smoking slowly instead of quickly, but if you want to try...then choose an important date (your birthday party, the arrival of a thing you're waiting, your new car's first day, first day of holidays, stuff like that) and from there, you cannot smoke!\n10-You smoke because you're stressed, or need a moment of rest in the day?Buy a fake cigarette. Smoking, apart from nicotine, is a substitute for meditation!Think about it. When you smoke, you slowly inhale, wait, then exhale your breath, slowly, feeling the air coming inside you and going to the lungs and then going out through the mouth/nose...IT IS meditation!Try doing the same process with a fake cigarette, a pencil or whatever.Breathing deeply helps...\nI hope you'll succeed. Good luck!\nCheers
You replace two of your meals with one seriving of their cereal. You wont end up losing very much if any. Their serving size is so small that you will most likely go hungry soon afterwards which will cause you to eat more. And besides, some of their cereals are loaded with sugar and there are much more alternative foods that you can eat that will be more filling and good for your body.

"Obstructed intestines or intestinal obstruction caused by a few things. Typically occurs in older adults (their intestines lose elasticity etc) Also if you had previous surgery(s) then you develop whats called adhesions, scar tissue that sticks to your intestines and can cause stenosis (blockage) because the scar chokes your intestine. Also hernias can damage your small bowel. So, usually adhesions, older people (like 80). And there is another condition that causes a ""telespcoping effect,"" something some baby's are born with. Finally, sometimes it is idiopathic (means ""who knows why it happens, just does"").\n\nMike RN"
"keeping yourself thin thru dehydration is never a good idea. 10 lbs. of water weight is almost in the ""severe"" category which can have extreme negative effects on body's chemistry, potential kidney failure and much more.\n\nIf  the 15lbs weight is purely fat you need to lose it the old fashion way, low impact cardio 5-6 days a week 45 min+ , a low glycemic(sugar) and fat diet with lots of veggies and healthy fats.\n\n use an elliptical machine,rower and high speed circuit weights to protect those knees.\n\n If none of these help, check with nutritionist about fasting as you may have toxic bloating."
"Sometimes keeping a food diary can help. Sometimes we don't remember how much we have snacked on during the day. The food diary can help you see if you are snacking excessively or help you see a bad habit. \n\nIf snacking is your problem you can look into a couple of options. You can cut down on your snacking or plan for healthier snacks. Don't drastically change your diet unless you know that you can stick with it. Otherwise you just gain all of the weight back because you go back to old habits. Just change a little at a time. Try having two ""healthy meals"" a week. Something as simple as having grilled food, instead of something fried. \n\nAlso, to lose weight you really need to do some type of exercise. Find something that you enjoy doing. You will be more likely to stick with it. Maybe walking, swimming, yoga, dance, aerobics. Just whatever you find interesting. If you bore easily you may want to try doing more than one thing. For instance, walking with friends on Monday and Wednesday, yoga on Tuesday and Thursday. The next week try dance on Mon. and wed. and aerobics or Tues. and Thurs.. You just have to find what works for you. The most important thing is to keep it fun and interesting. Take time and try some new things!\n\nI hope these suggestions were helpful. Good luck and just keep the faith in yourself. You can do it. You just have to decide that you are ready to."

"Generally, no a person shouldn't continue with those meds if possible.\n\nPrescribed drugs are a risk to the developing fetus.\nSome drugs that have been considered safe for years are proving to be otherwise (such as Paxil which is now linked with heart defects in babies)\n\nBecause pregnant women generally tend to avoid taking medications when pregnant, not enough studies have been done to deem drugs ""safe"" for a baby.\n\nIf the health of the mother is at risk, the doctor and patient must make the best decision for all involved.  After all, if the health of the mother is compromised that will also have detrimental effects on the developing baby as well.\n\nIf you have the specific names of the drugs, your local pharmacist will be able to tell you more, but often the books will say, ""unknown risk""... simply because not enough pregnant women have risked taking the drug to be sure of the results."
Menopause is caused by changes in body chemistry.  Specifically, the hormone responsible for female characteristics - breasts, hips, periods, fat deposits, etc., is reduced significantly.  These changes can take quite a while to re-establish balance.  Remember puberty and all the changes.  Well, it's happening once again, in reverse, so to speak.  The effects can be lessened to some extent with various therapies, such as hormone replacement (HRT) and over-the-counter (otc) products.  Some HRTs may cause side-effects that are worse than what they are trying to help.

lyrica is not a traditional pain pill, in the sense that it is not like narcotics (oxycontin, percocet) and not like anti inflammatory drug (advil, tylenol)\nIt is called Pre gabalin, which acts on the nervous system and the brain to modulate pain .\nIt is non addictive, but can cause sleepiness, it is best for nerve damage type pain, and shooting pains such as with disc disease and diabetes
you are right... 5 is better than 30.  30 is better than 40.  None is the best.  I smoked and then only had 1 cigarette in July each year.  The mistake about it all is that unlike eating which you can't stop, smoking can be. \n\nMy doctor explained the problem as the effects of one cigarette might be to elevate your blood pressure by constricting your blood vessels.   Not good if you have high blood pressure since the problems compound.  \n\nIf 5 did no harm, how could 5 cigarettes taken 6 times a day hurt you?   Leave them if you are strong enough and they don't control your life.... QUIT

It is not contagious, and recent studies suggest that people with fibromyalgia may be genetically predisposedhttp://fmaware.org/fminfo/brochure.htm. It affects more women than men, with a ratio globally of 3-5:1. Fibromyalgia is seen in 3-10% of the general population, and is mostly found between the ages 20 and 50. The nature of fibromyalgia is not well understood, and there is no cure, though it can be managed.\nHistory\nFibromyalgia has been studied since the early 1800s and referred to by a variety of former names, including muscular rheumatism, neurasthenia and fibrositis. The term fibromyalgia was coined in 1976 to more accurately describe the symptoms, from the Greek my-, meaning muscle, and algia, meaning pain. \nFibromyalgia was once considered an autoimmune disorder, but laboratory results reveal no disturbanc"
Well, for starters, maybe cut back on the coffee a little.  Caffeinated beverages are dehydrating.\n\nActually, though, I think it's probably as simple as breathing through your mouth while you're sleeping.  Is it possible you have a sinus infection or a deviated septum?  \n\nYou might want to give those nighttime nasal strips a shot.  If you're breathing through your mouth while you sleep because your nasal passages are stuffed up, it could help.

I am a nurse and have heard of many people having this done. Sometimes there are complications but the rate for serious harm as in death is minimal.\n\nThey would have him on a low calorie intake for a week (have to lose a few kilos on that) before the surgery and then operate. \n\nThe only problem with LGBS is that once done it cant be reversed. They keep shrinking the stomach until you lose the weight needed but you can never go back to eating normal. \n\nUsually they drink soups or eat a couple of mouthfuls of food and thats all they can fit in their stomach before they are full. Its a different way of life. I suggest your friend talk to someone who has had it done and lost weight to see how dramatically their life has changed with their eating habits. (If you eat too much, they say you vommit) \n\nYes the weight loss is a blessing but does that benefit outweigh the loss of being able to eat a normal meal and fit comfortably in with a group of friends when you are socializing. \n\nCheers
"Lithium is not a drug for epilepsy, as someone else has previously mentioned.  \n\nI feel bad for you, although I am going through a lot of the same frustrations.  I have adult-onset epilepsy and if I don't go three or four days without having a grand-mal, then it is a great week.  Yes, I am considered a ""difficult"" case (or medication refractive, if you want to get technical).  I am on four different seizure meds, so I take 11 pills a day, plus I have a vagus nerve stimulator implanted.  You may want to look into that...it is about the size of a pacemaker and it implanted on the left side of your chest.  There are wires that lead up to your vagus nerve (so there are two surgical incisions, one on your chest and one in your neck to get the wires in place).  Basically, it tries to retroact the seizures by shooting voltage back into your brain.  It takes a little getting used to...I've had mine for about nine months and can barely tell when it goes off.  The surgery is outpatient and you are in the operating room for less than an hour.  Look into that, or ask your doctor.  It also has been shown to help with depression...\n\nJust be careful.  If you get auras before your seizures (mine range from a weird headache to a stomache to dizziness), make sure that you get to some place safe...i.e., the bed, the floor.  Somewhere where you can't hurt yourself.  It also doesn't hurt for your family to educate themselves a bit more on epilepsy, so they know what to do when you have a seizure.  Have someone hold your head so that you don't hit it hard (my husband puts his hand underneath my head), have them turn you a little to the side, in case you vomit and even have them talk to you during and right after your seizure.  You won't hear what they are saying, usually, but it calms the other person and keeps things a bit in order.  My husband will even just sing or tell me nonsense, if he can't think of what to say.  Everyone who knows me knows what to do when I even start to get a little glassy-eyed.  Make sure that you have a Medicalert bracelet or ID tag, just in case you have a seizure when you are out without a loved one.\n\nAnd...I know you really don't want to hear this, but you should NOT be driving.  I had my license yanked pretty quickly after the DMV found out I was having seizures.  \n\nIt does limit your life until you find the right combination of meds/treatment.  Don't feel bad about getting a second, third, fourth opinion.\n\nI wouldn't worry about having a seizure DURING sex, but I know I've had them afterwards.  My seizures are brought on by overstimulation, stress, etc.  \n\nMy best thoughts are with you."
Please please please go and talk to someone who can help you.  A priest (of whatever religion you follow if you do follow one that is) or a professional.  It's good that you have admitted these problems now go and get some help!\n\nGood luck!
You are not overweight!!! You are an ideal weight for your height.  The best way to focus on your goal of toning is to pay attention to what you eat.  Eat a healthy diet of vegetables, chicken, fish, turkey and whole grains will help.  Do not starve yourself and do not eat too many greasy foods.  It is ok to eat fast food from time to time but I recommend you fix your own foods or eat what your parents fix at home because these foods are much better for you.  Eat baked chicken instead of fried.  Any meat the is baked or grilled is better than fried meat. \n\nDo not deprive your self of things you like just make better food choses for example a double cheese burger versus a home made grilled chicken sandwich with no toppings but lettuce and tomato on whole grain bread.....or a healthy salad with chicken and various vegetables.  Take one multi-vitamin.  Evercise for 45 minutes a day.  This should include cardio.  Cardio is running, bike riding, and aerobics.  Cardio is what makes you sweat.  If you sweat you will lose the fat.  \n\nFocus on muscle groups not body parts.  There are various exercises you can do to tone the lower abs and upper abs.  When working on your abs focus on upper lower and sides.  Belly dancing helps tone abs.  Walking up stairs a lot makes you have a nice butt.  \n\nYou could also turn on the music and dance to your favorite tunes at home.  What I recommend is for you to get an exercise tape such as a pilates work out. Pilates works very well.  It will give you the results you need.  Then make sure you have 8 cups of water a day to flush out the fat.  So, just eat right and evercise.  \n\nFocus on overall toning not zone toning.  Last of all accept yourself some parts of you may just be naturally big.  This is what I learned from a personal trainer.  I have big legs and a big chest.  I will always have big legs...the goal here is to just make the big legs look good.  I also have always had a ruler body and had the misconception that everyone should have an hour glass figure.  As a teen, seeing the models on tv made me really believe this.\n\nAccept your body is still beautiful.  A little plumpness is not a sign of being a little too chubby.  Plus my daughter has a little belly poking out but she is not fat.  My advice to her was that she was no longer a size 5 and should be wearing a 7.  After going to the store she found out I was right.  She exercises and eats healthy.  She does not diet.  She just is aware of what she eats making healthier choses and maybe an occasional fast food dinner.  \n\nSo you do not need to really go on a diet. About.com has a whole bunch of information that will help you.  It is loaded with information.\n\nIf you still feel uncomfortable talk to your doctor and he or she will help you understand healthy weight, healthy eating and getting enough exercise.  He or she will be able to let you know what you are doing right or wrong or whether you need to do anything at all.  \n\nBut I still think nothing is wrong.
"I have found that Sara Lee Multi Grain wheat bread is the most healthy all around.  You get a big slice for only about 100 calories & it is 100% whole grain.  The 100% whole grain is the most important thing when buying bread because it is loaded with healthy fiber to keep your digestive tract healthy among many other things.  Brands that state ""made with whole grains"" are NOT the same as 100% whole grains."

I recently saw a news report saying that they did a study on whether lights were more healthy than full flavour cigarettes and the result was they were the same.  It is merely a marketing scheme to make you buy more because you 'think' it is healthier.\n\nIt is just like having the choice of getting beaten with a baseball bat or a hockey stick.  Both are not good for you.
Go see the doctor. If you are worried about asking a parent to take you to the doc, walk into public health. A little embarassment now is much better than having something really be a problem and ignoring it.

You're almost right. \nThe compulsion of  chewing ice cubes is related to iron deficiency ( it's not the cause of it, rather is a consequence of it).\n\nUsually people with anemia will have the urge to chew ice.\n\nYou should advise your friend to make a blood test to check if she has anemia.\n\nIn the meantime, you might tell her to soften the ice in a glass of water for a bit before the chomping. It helps keep the teeth and fillings from breaking. \n\nI hope this can help you a bit!\n\nCheers,\n\nClaire ;P

Symptoms can include abnormal vaginal bleeding or a significant unexplained change in your menstrual cycle, bleeding when something comes in contact with the cervix, such as during sexual intercourse or insertion of a diaphragm, pain during sexual intercourse, and abnormal vaginal discharge containing mucus that may be tinged with blood.  As it progresses, symptoms can include anemia because of abnormal vaginal bleeding, ongoing pelvic, leg, or back pain, urinary problems because of blockage of a kidney or ureter, leakage of urine or fecal content into the vagina because an abnormal opening has developed between the vagina and the bladder or rectum, and weight loss.

microwave is deep heating radiation. plastic melts when the food in it gets too hot, therefore particles from the plastic can mix with the food heated. since plastic is made of chemicals, it is therefore possible that frequent ingestion of microwaved food in plastic containers can cause cancer. anything can possibly cause cancer because cancer is unknown in origin.

I generally wait a few days between shaves - makes it less irritative. I also use a facial scrub the night before I shave - it smooths the skin and makes your razor glide better. \n\nI generally shave up the way, which you shouldn't really do, but the hair under my chin is  quite thick and downwards shaving doesn't give me a very close shave.\n\nI use Gillette shaving gel (which foams up) and a Mach 3. Afterwards I have Clinique after shave cream stuff that is amazing. Expensive, but worth it.
As mentioned by the first answerer (is that even a word) the mayor risk is PE (pulmonary embolism). PE happens when a trombous (aka blod clot) forms in your legs and then migrate to your lungs. \n\nDVP (deep venous trombosis) is associated with flights over 3000 miles. Also, the risk of getting it increases if you smoke, have varicose veins in your legs, you're a woman on the Pill, have a clotting disease (like Leiden's V factor, VonWillebrand's disease...)\n\nWhile you're on a plane, get up at least once every hour, move your leg muscles while sitting, and you should be OK. If you have any disease (not just the ones I mentioned above), go see your doctor about  DVT profilaxis, a medication used to prevent the clots from forming.
"Use a fabric measuring tape and measure around your chest under your breasts (that will be the chest measurement).  Then measure around your chest and over the breasts at the fullest part (don't pull the tape too tight or make it too loose).  Each inch difference between the chest measurement and the breast measurement is a cup size.  For example, if the first number is 34"" and the second is 36"", then you are a size 34B, if it's 34"" and 37"" you are a 34C, etc.  If the measurements are 34 and 34, you are a boy!!

First, most employers outsource their Rx benefits. That means another company, not UHC, decides what is covered and what is not as well as what your cost will be (i.e Medco, Caremark, Express Scripts, etc...).\n\nSecondly, if your diagnosis doesn't match the AMA standards for this medicine no insurance company will approve it. This medication is also being reviewed as a potential cancer risk by the FDA and is only currently recommended if all other treatments have failed.\n\nOf course $$$ is also an issue and if there are other similar medications available, denying this particular one is a way to force you to choose a more economical medication. This is a tier 3 (most expensive-brand name non-formulary) medication, as recently as late May/early June it had been tier 2 (cheaper-brand name). Are you sure it is not covered or is it that the price has doubled?\n\nTalk to your physician about alternatives. Good luck!
Your doctor should have told you and it depends on what they were looking for.  If they were only checking the tissue inside of your cervix because of an abnormal pap, you should be able to continue mild intercourse when you have no more discomfort or bleeding.  If you were being checked for vaginal warts, you should wait until your results come back.  Warts are infectious to your sex partner.  I hope your test comes back clear.  I had this done after an abnormal pap before, it can be scary.  To be sure....call your doctor!

Yes, you have what is called amenorrhea.  Amenorrhea can be caused by many different things and only your doctor can tell for sure.  Amenorrhea can be caused by polycystic ovarian disease, obesity, hyperadrenalism, hyperpituitarism, hyperandrogenism, tumors, etc.  Please see a doctor.  The doctor will most likely test your hormones including: Prolactin, Thyroid Hormones, LH and FSH first.  Perhaps testosterone, DHT and cortisol would be useful.

In a fracture, the tooth is split into two or more fragments, one attached to the socket and one free. The Ellis classification system is used to describe crown fractures. \nAn Ellis class I fracture involves only the enamel and is rarely painful. \nAn Ellis class II fracture is an enamel and dentin fracture that leaves dentin exposed; pain or sensitivity depends on the degree of exposure. \nAn Ellis class III fracture involves enamel and dentin, with pulp and nerve exposure. The tooth involved in an Ellis class III fracture may be sensitive and may be contaminated by bacteria normally found in the mouth.4 An Ellis class III fracture may result in pulp death and may cause serious sequelae, including infection, abscess.\n\nAs tooth fracture relates to prosthodontics and VD; the more time that goes by between fracture of  the tooth and restoration the harder it is to restore because of tooth extrusion or vertical collapse in extreme cases.  Other wise there are no serious immediate consequences, that I can see.

"There is no cure. Asthma is forever.\n\nMy brother was born with it.  He is now 56 years old. He still has it.  He and his doctors have tried every-f***ing thing out there. It doesn't go away.\n\nAll you can do is control it.\n\nKnow what triggers an attack, and avoid it.\n\nWith my brother, it's animals.  He has no pets, and doesn't spend much time at my house...I go visit him.\n\nFor me, it's tree pollen (but not flowers), cigarette smoke, and pollution/smog.  I stay indoors as much as I can during pollen season or high smog days, and call in sick if I have to. It doesn't win me any points at work, but the alternative is only managing a half-day of substandard work before I end up in the emergency room.  As to the cigarette smoke, I avoid bars and nightclubs.  Just because I don't deal well with the smoke does not give me the right to dictate other people's choices.\n\nMy other brother's asthma is triggered by flowers and perfumes.  He avoids gardens, and leaves for work earlier or later than the regular rush hours because some people feel the need to dump an entire bottle of perfume on in the mornings. You can't open the windows on the subway trains, so again, he can choose a non-standard commute time, or go to the hospital.  He's also stopped going to church because of the incense and old ladies overdoing it with perfume.\n\nIn your case, you should probably ask your doctor to do an allergy test as well.  Anything you are allergic to will also trigger an asthma attack.  Most people will not have to go to such extremes as my family does, but ""forewarned is forearmed.""  Knowing what causes an attack will help you control the disease."

As a child or person that has not passed through puberty the genitals are the same color as the rest of the skin on our body.  When you mature one of the first signs of adult hood is the darkening of the skin in the genital area.  So the penis skin is darker and the scrotum skin is darker than the rest of the body.  Why I don't know.  It just occurs.  I don't know why you worry about such things.

Drink tea with the ingredient Senna (dieter's tea), and 10 glasses of water a day. Eat all vegetables and chicken breast, no starch and lots of cardio (Taebo; bicycle) and 100 crunches on alternating days.  I don't know about 5 days, but in a month, you'll have abs that you can wash jeans on!  Oh yeah about that diet tea...make sure you're next to a bathroom on a regular basis.
I have Tuft's, through my employer.  It is not very good for me, because I am in Connecicut and they are a Massachusetts-based provider... there is almost no one in my area as a therapist, and the ones that there are really stink.  They are good for my prescriptions though.\n\nI have had Oxford and Anthem, and both have been quite good, but also through my employer.\n\nIf you are looking to pick one up privately, I suspect that you will have difficulty because of your condition.  The prescriptions can be inexpensive, but because they are maintenance some providers put them on a different pay scale, and make you pay more unless you purchase by mail.
Cymbalta? I take it for anxeity disorder since it's used to treat both...but beware of the side effects.  The first few days on it I was dizzy and sleepy and kept feeling faint and colapsing and crashed into poles and walls.  It does help depression, just note the side effects\nFor depression talk to your doctor about which is best.  Zoloft is used to treat depression, bi-polar, anxeity and others and is non-sedative which is why most doctors recommend it.  But the first wek or two are bad.  Just talk to your doctor about SSRI's and he'll proably start you on Zoloft, if it doesn't work he can try others.
Yes, 9 years ago.  It was a great experience to be able to see w/o glasses or contacts.  I'd do it again in a heartbeat.
Both previous answers (first and second) make sense. You do need to talk to someone. I am Catholic too and this plays a part in keeping me sane. I run a specialised printing company and I am always at work meeting rediculous deadlines. I have worked round the clock on many occasions to get ahead but each new day brings new work and tighter deadlines so I do empathise with your position. I have been currently working 7 days a week with Monday to Fridays from 7am to 8pm and a few hours at the weekend but my family helps and supports me immensely.\n\nConcerning your mind going blank I get that and I am in my 30's. I write everything down and keep a daily planner that carries duties across to the next day if I don't get things done.\n\nChange your diet as well. I take fruit to snack on and have a multi vitamin at my desk while I am eating a sandwich and I have increased my water intake. This has made me feel less lethargic.\n\nThe old saying less haste more speed comes to mind.\n\nHope this helps. I need to get busy myself now. Good luck
Make sure you are drinking enough water, and stay away from caffeine.  It sounds strange to drink a lot of water, when bloating is actually caused by water retention.  But staying hydrated is the best way to make your body not retain water.  Also, don't eat too many salty foods, salt also makes you retain water.  We all need some salt, but most of us get too much from eating bad foods, like fast foods and chips and junk, and processed foods, like canned soups or frozen dinners.\n\nP.S.- Don't take water pills, they can be dangerous.  Only take them if your doctor recommends it.
yes, but u need a special permit from a professional doctor to have them. at least in here it works like this.
cause it hurts dammit. Once you been with a man for a while you might figure out the right ways to touch him. And don't be flickin' his balls, find some other thing to do.

i know! that puzzles me. for a 13 year old to have sex is way too young! emotionally, they are not able to handle these things too well. and they're young, they're gullible.\nMEDIA -- is number 1 to be blamed -- sometimes i could see that there are things on TV that are not censored and kids would see this and think, it's ok.\nHORMONES -- is another thing. it is at this age when the body starts producing hormones. i remember when i was this age, it's like i wanted to bang any guy i see. but i went to a very strict school, and also i grew up in a strict religous upbringing. im kinda glad i waited to be an adult -- because you make better choices and these choices are not based on what you feel.\n\ni think it's disgusting to see 13 year olds having sex nowadays. if i were their mother -- they will give a whole new meaning to the word: WRATH
The Doubling Rule.\nDoctors can also perform quantitative serum beta hCG levels. The measurement is done in mIU/ml, and a level above 25 mIU/ml usually indicates the presence of a pregnancy. Two tests are usually necessary to verify a normal increase, usually 2-3 days apart. The increase in serum hCG can be interactively monitored. Below an hCG level of 1,200 mIU/ml the hCG usually doubles every 48-72 hours, though a rise of 50-60% is still considered normal. Between 1,200 and 6,000 mIU/ml serum the hCG usually takes 72-96 hours to double, and above 6,000 mIU/ml, the hCG often takes more than four days to double. Failure to increase normally may indicate that the pregnancy is not developing well and can be an early sign for a possible miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy.
I really don't understand your question.  If you have leukemia, then you have a diagnosis, if you don't have leukemia, then what makes you think you need to have a diagnosis of leukemia.\nWhatever, if you have or don't have leukemia, you must seek medical attention to resolve this question. There must be resources in your community that can assist you in getting an answer.  The closest medical school usually have clinics in which you can find answers.  An Urgent Care center can do a simple blood test to check for leukemia cells.  We are not talking about great amounts of money in order to make the diagnosis.  A  couple of hundred dollars would be all that is necessary, and then you would know whether or not you have leukemia.  Then you can find out what further actions might be necessary to do.  Get help. Go to your local church or Cancer Society and see what can be done to help you answer your question.  Good luck.  God Bless you.
That is not a weird question at all.  \n\nBut I am not sure why your mom gets a vote on what sort of feminine hygiene products you use.  You don’t get a vote on what sorts of products she uses.  You are becoming an adult, and this is an adult type of situation.  Next time you are at the grocery store chuck a box into the cart, and let it go at that.  Chances are very good that she won’t say a thing about it, and if she does – ask her why she has a problem with tampons.  If you ask very loudly in the store, she will not bother you again.\n\nTampons are the ideal solution for active girls who play sports and especially swim, and even for other girls they are MUCH more comfortable than pads, they are cleaner than pads, and much more environmentally friendly than pads. \n\nTampons do not hurt, and they are not at all uncomfortable, though sometimes girls are a little bit uncomfortable with the idea of inserting them at first.\n\nOne way to get past your fear of using a tampon, is to become better acquainted with yourself.  Some time when you are not on your period, but before your next period, and when you have some time to be alone, take a few minutes to explore and see what the whole area is about.  This is something that is essential for any girl.  \n\nGet comfortable, use a hand mirror, and with your other hand spread yourself open and look around.  It is not dirty, or ugly, or wrong in any way, it is your body, you should know what it is about and how it works.  When you are comfortable, slip a finger inside a few inches.\n\nNext time you have a period, you will be ready to give a tampon a try, and will have a good idea what sort of experience to expect.  It is different, but it is not bad.  Honestly a tampon is WAY better than a pad ever was.  Don’t feel bad if you don’t get it quite right the first few times you try it – it can take a bit of practice.  Just keep trying until you get it right.  When it is right you won’t be able to feel it at all.\n\nUsing a tampon with an applicator is easier at first, but I think the OB without the applicator is easier, more comfy to put in, and much better for the environment.  You will have to pick for yourself.\n\nWhich ever one you get, follow the instructions on the box, and do not leave it in for longer than the instructions say is safe.
"Maybe, but to make sure you get stronger, you need to do what is called ""The push-up game""  See, you do not want to do 110 pushups everyday because your muscles will get used to it and stay the same strong. So to do the pushup game, you try to do more pushups everyday. Say you did 110 pushups on Monday, well then on Tuesday you have to do at LEAST 111 pushups, then Wednesday you have to do at least 112, but it can be more too. You can do 110 on Monday and 120 on Tuesday, but that means on Wednesday you have to do more than 120. This will make your chest really big and your arms pretty big, and will make you very strong."
since this is for alternatives, I will offer something safer than drugs for you and your mother. look at the info on my page.
"""As you clearly know, the human digestive processes are typically able to break asparagus down into smelly by-products with an amazing quickness, often within 15 to 30 minutes after eating. When you use the lavatory, those odorific by-products are released as a rather pungent form of ""asparagus urine."" \n\nThe website WebMD blames this smell on the break-up of a chemical called mercaptan. That said, asparagus contains a half-dozen sulfur-based chemicals identical ones found in other such lovely smells as rotten eggs, garlic breath and skunk spray. There is some controversy in the scientific community over exactly which by-product, or combination of by-products, causes the asparagus urine smell. The first published study on the phenomenon, written in 1891 by a man going by the name of ""Nencki,"" found that the smell was caused by a metabolite called methanethiol. So far, this conclusion seems about as sound as any.\n\nBut the story of asparagus urine is far from ending there. Some people eat asparagus, go to the restroom, and-amazingly-no smell. Further research suggested that, likely due to genetics, some people did not possess the enzymes required to create asparagus urine. Perhaps you've heard it said that a person who's pee smells after eating asparagus has high intelligence? Well, maybe there is some genetic corollary for that. (Just kidding, all you eugenicists out there!) \n\nTo complicate matters even further, however, around 1980 a scientist had the good sense to pass the urine of the non-asparagus urine population in front of the noses of the asparagus urine population, and lo-and-behold, many found they could smell that asparagus urine smell. People are now debating whether genetics controls the ability to produce asparagus urine, the ability to smell asparagus urine, or possibly both.""\n\n http://www.greenworks.tv/askgreenworks/asparagus.htm"
Antifungal creams wont help.  Ask the pharmacist at your local pharmacy.  He will show the correct over the counter med to clear it right up.   And yes it is over the counter.
try the ucas website, www.ucas.com - i think you can search for unis that do the course your looking for. hope that helps.
There are plenty..but don't go in some cosmetic store and just buy one.Go to a pharmacy ,where are selling medical cosmetics and always there's a counsellor(I mean in the best) and will choose one which best suits your skin type,needs,etc..
yep, getting rid of the cat is the only way.   You are actually allergic to the saliva from the cat so when it licks itself you pet it....(this is the way it is with people with severe allergies like myself).  One way you can keep the minor allergen from cats (the dander) is to wipe the cat down with a damp cloth daily.  If the cat is young and you can get it adapted to taking a bath, that will help a little too.  Other than that you will have to suffer through it, take allergy medicines, or get immunotherapy (allergy shots.... they work but they are a total pain in the butt).  Good luck!!!!!!
I have been a caregiver for 16 years...the things I have noticed when I get too stressed are...loss of appetite..insomnia...mood swings..things of that nature.  I just attended a seminar on death and dying and they said that one of the things that we need to do is to take care of ourselves...even though that is something most people that are taking care of others dont do.  You will be much more capable of helping others if you take care of yourself. They said to do something that you enjoy at least once a week...even if it just soaking in a bubble bath for half an hour and reading...just some little thing that you like to do.  If you are caring for a family member you may have to enlist some outside help for that...it may be worth the money to call a local agency on aging to see if they have anyone that will come in and take over for a few hours every week.  They are usually fairly inexpensive and even just a few hours away will help you out. If you are working in a nursing home or hospital maybe request a day off and just sleep late...go shopping...catch a movie...whatever you need to do to have a little break.  Good luck to you!
Good question, i always wondered that myself. Hopefully you will get the right answer and we will all know!
There are several different things that can cause your problem. Retrograde ejaculation, undescended testicles, or blocked or missing ducts. If you have a retorgrade ejactulation your bladder isn't closing correctly, so all the sperm goes backwards. I'm sure you would already know if you have undescended testicles, and that one is pretty straight forward. Blocked or missing ducts would cause a low sperm count.
"Yes, I am constantly analyzing this issue. It probably has to do with being analyzed so much! I have a disorder called Asperger Syndrome, which is on the (high functioning end of the) autistic spectrum. As far as thoughts go, they are very much all at once. They are often very graphic in nature (not ""dirty"" as much as in depth). At times such as now, they become very obsessive and I have to monitor myself for compulsive behavior (such as the urge not to pull an all night-er surfing the web for pictures of Al Pacino). As I learn more about my disorder, my thoughts are one aspect I learn more about. \nI learn how to identify and correct negative thinking by a therapeutic process called ""cognitive therapy"". Otherwise, I don't beat myself up over the thoughts I know are healthy; just a little...unique."
Wonder how I could have ever been so STUPID!!!
Well MW you can rest assure that you ARE NOT alone. Plenty of people are dealing with the same problem. I recently gained weight and im going through something similar. What you need to do is find out wha'ts depressing you...if you can't come up with an answer...look harder..then maybe you should see a doctor about your condition. Basically your depressions stems from being over weight, when you try to lose weight you get weak and depressed and turn to food. Its a VICIOUS CYCLE! it has to stop. Pray...and do all you can to pull yourself out this rut. Life is so beautiful... and if you don't develop tough skin you will get burned. Remember no pain no gain MW. You will make it..all you have to do is believe in yourself, see the bigger picture and try.
Yes! Dehydration kills your skin. I didn't know it would cause unsunburned skin to peel, but it will cause the lips to, so why not?\nIn fact, when you are dehydrated, lotion doesn't soak in either. Luckily, if you go ahead and start now, it won't take long to get back to normal. It also helps you take it easy on the colas and sodium rich food. Did you know one twelve ounce soda takes twice that amount in water from your body to metabolize? So you're taking a step backward for each can.
I'm sure no doctor but know that you have to feed your kidneys to keep them functioning properly.  Drink lots of water.  You can also drink cranberry juice but not too much if your on a diet or are diabetic cause its loaded with sugar.  Still 4 to 8 oz. a day won't hurt you.  Read up on natural antigens and antioxidants.  There are lots out there and they can help.
red, itchy rash/bumps.  generally the bumps will ooze.
Well I would  put some ice on the  bump if  you have one, and take some aleve or advil or tylenol, and rest  but  make  sure  that u have no blurred vision  and that you aren't dizzy when u stand   and if you do  seek medical assitance immeditaley  cause it can be a   concussion..
can you be more specific? Do you have tubes on the molars through the band around them?
Horrible---horrible. You don't want to know, too gruesome. Oh, God! Oh, dear.....   AHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!

That shouldn't have any effect on your ability to develop a six-pack.  In fact, everyone's hips are slightly crooked, our bodies are not perfectly symmetrical.  What can affect your ability to develop a six-pack is your genetics.  Some people have a genetic disposition to a layer of fat on their lower abdomen, but with diligent training and more importantly, the proper training, this is likely something you can achieve.  I doubt that your six-pack would be even noticeably crooked.
No.  I think you are more likely not pregnant than pregnant.  Many things can affect your period, such as stress, dieting, or a lot of exercise.  It may just be late.  Of course, you could still be pregnant, so do another pregnancy test in a week or so.  A doctor may help calm your nerves , make sure everything is all right, and help you get birth control if you would like it.  Take care.
DD probably weigh about 2 1/2 pounds each.
It could be a mental thing - you only think you're smelling it. Sounds like something stress-induced. You need some rest and relxation.
I started smoking because I could not sleep/insomnia after I broke up with someone. Since then I smoke everyday and my insomnia gone totally till now.  \nThe question now how can I stop my addiction? I have tried to quit but many people around me smoke, too. So, I am feeling some kind of peer presure. I know it is not healthy however, I do enjoy smoking because it gives me certain  'buzz' and calm me down when I am stressed. It also enhance my mood!
Canada is kind of a big place what area?.. I listed some general links that'll show spas in Canada
Eye strain due to a deterioration in vision causes headaches. So go and get your eyes tested to find out whether you should be wearing glasses. If you do, wear them and see if the headaches improve after a few weeks and if they don't you can go back to your doctor then. And if you don't need glasses then you can go back to your doctor, but eye strain can cause really bad headaches.
I quit last August (for good) after smoking for 23 years.  It takes 3 days for the nictotine to leave your body.  Drink plenty of water.  Just be careful not to trade one addiction for another...like food.  LOL  Yes, it's worth it.  You will feel and look better.  And soon the smell of others smoking will gross you out.\n\nGood luck!
That's not safe.  It probably took a lot longer to put that weight on so don't expect to be able to drop it quickly without screwing up your body in one way or another.  People who lose weight quickly usually end up putting it all back on and then some.  See a doctor and do it the right way.
Improves Concentration \nAt work, chewing gum helps us concentrate on the task at hand. Many truck drivers find that chewing gum helps them stay alert at the wheel. \n\nEases Tension \nAs early as 1939, scientific studies showed how chewing reduces muscular tension and helps people feel more at ease. Because it is so well-recognized for helping stay alert at the same time it eases tension, the U.S. Armed Forces have supplied chewing gum to its soldiers ever since World War I. It is still included in field and combat rations today. \n\nFreshens Breath \nChewing gum, especially a mint-flavored gum like Wrigley's Spearmint or Doublemint, moistens and refreshes the mouth and throat and sweetens the breath.  \n\nHelps Fight Tooth Decay \nAfter meals, it isn't always convenient to use a toothbrush. Chewing gum stimulates the production of saliva, which helps neutralize acids from foods that may cause tooth decay.
I had them... it DOES hurt. If your teeth are crooked though, it's worth it. Mine weren't though, and my orthodontist ripped off my mom because he made her believe my teeth would EVENTUALLY become crooked. Riiight. When they came off, they looked exactly the same as they did when I had them put on. They really do hurt, though. They'll tear up the insides of your cheeks, and it will hurt so much everytime they tighten the wires. You should try Invisalign, or something.\n\nlol They definitely DON'T look cool either. They make your mouth look all retarded, whether it's open or closed.

Seeds actually do help your immune system work better by a chemical found in the seed, I'm sure it dose other beneficial things to your system as well. Although, if your system is not used to the intake of seeds it could harm something. Better to start slow for those how do not do this already. Apricot seeds are the best. There is a chemical in them that kills cancer among other benefits, don't eat the shell around the seed, just the seed inside.\n\nGenesis 1:29\nI give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it.

Allergy to one's own sweat is often the folk term for something called cholinergic urticaria. This is a chronic condition where a person gets hives (small, itchy papules) whenever their core body temperature rises, whether due to ambient heat (such as being in a too-warm room), from sweating, exercise, strong emotions, and even spicy foods.

yea, as with what everyone else said thus far, here's another fact: one of the substitute sugars they've been inserting in low calorie/diet foods and drinks, I think the Amphet..somethingsomething, isn't even digestable to us humans. It's a total manufactured chemical that our bodies are no knowledge or digestive bacteria to properly digest it. Therefore, it is not good for you. I'd say diet sodas are worse than regular sodas, period. If you want a soda, drink a regular. Otherwise, here's another fact: you can lose an average 10lbs in one year just by cutting soda out of your diet completely. Think about that. The shet is useless to begin with.
A friend from webdatedotcom taught me to do water therapy as a diet. Eat fruits such as apples and watermelons. Do a lot of exercise as well. Do not limit yourself to eating, just lessen it and you'd lose weight in no time.
No. \n\nIn the general population, women have more fatty tissues surrounding their buttocks and legs than men. In some women, the fleshy structures and fat form in a way that makes them seem less tone than men. \n\nFor women with this condition, exersize of the legs and buttocks muscles can reshape and enlarge the buttocks to a more attractive shape. The exersises are leg presses, walking up stairs, Bicycling and face down leg lifts.\n\nThe more the muscles are worked the more they will re-build and enlarge.

- well first of all you should do it twice to three times a week.\n- dont forget to warm up before every session.\n- do not start with an amount of weights which seems difficult: start with something you can easily manage and when you're sure you can do this amount effortless go to something slightly heavier and so on.\n- do whatever exercise you choose 12 times, have a little break (1 or 2 minutes) and do it 12 times again. not more not less this is important.\n- i think the most important things are to keep it regular and steady and to never try something you're not able to do. just wait and practice and eventually you will be able to!
You can use any type of triple antibiotic ointment with pain reliever to coat your ear lobe and the post of the earring, then push the post back through the skin.   A generic store brand ointment is just as good as a name brand.  After you get the earring back in, soak a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol and drip it on your ear piercing as you spin the earring around and around.  Use the alcohol and spinning your earring method two times a day for about 10 days.  Alcohol will burn but will kill any infection and also cause the pierced skin to scar, which will help it not to grow closed anymore. Also, do not remove your earring from a new piercing for the 10 day period.

Wow alot of these answers are horrible! \n\nYou are eating pizza and getting bloated and/or gassy. Everyone has certain foods that make them gassy or just make them feel not so good. For me, it's pop like coke or pepsi. For you, it's pizza. I would avoid pizza as much as you can. It might be the grease, it might be something else... depends what's on the pizza. I read one answer that said take a laxative.. wow.. k, don't do that... all that does is make you poop... alot. You can get some over the counter pills such as GasX... that gets rid of the gas for up to 12 hours. But I would just suggest avoiding eating things that make you feel this way. If they are really bad pains there could be a problem with one of these: gallbladder, pancreas, liver, aorta, kindey's or your spleen. So if they're bad, or it's causing you to have diareah, go to your doctor and they will send you to get a abdomen ultrasound and a G.I. series or barium swallow.\n\nHope this helped. Best of luck!
"hyperventilation is breathing way too fast. Is she having this kind of symptom before she faints?  What kind of symptoms is she having? (besides fainting)  Fainting can be a symptom of so many things... low blood sugar, circulatory problems, blood pressure, pregnancy, and so on.  I bet if you googled  ""fainting"" or looked for a medical site that has a rundown of symptoms, you could better decide what is going on.  Seeing a regular doctor for a physical might help also, ER docs aren't the best resource for diagnosing complicated issues."

Depends on the type of food poisoning. There is  food intoxication that can see symptoms set in within 3 hours.

if you have been doing any sort of regular exercise, this can be expected.  depending on your age, it's most likely just your metabolism.  it tends to speed up when we're younger.  at the risk of sounding rude, enjoy it while it lasts as it does tend to slow down over time.
You have glands all over your body but the ones you want to check are under your jawbones.  If you are very tender and sore as well as feeling some golf ball sized lumps (that's normal, the lumps not the size!!).  You might also want to see a doctor just in case!

The most probable cause of non-sport's related body aches is chronic dehydration. Drinking 6-8 glasses of distilled and remineralized water could cure your pain. Get 3 glass containers and fill them with distilled water. Add 12 grains of  brown rice per gallon. If you have half gallon containers, add 6 grains for example. When you finish one container put fresh grains of brown rice in your container an refill it. This will give your body the fluid it needs to htdrate your body.\n\nChange from using refined table salt to sea salt for adding to your food.

If your looking for a group, weight watchers is the way to go, but if you want to do it on your own you have to change your lifestyle for life.  Be your own trainer and nutritionist, the basic rules to losing weight are no soda, no fast food, lots of chicken, fish, fresh (not canned that’s bad) fruits and vegies, whole wheat stuff, yogurt. Not so many cakes and donuts and cookies. Basic common sense for eating, you just need to enforce it. Get all the bad stuff out of the house right away, just toss it or give it away while your still motivated. No alcohol if that applies. Some juice but make sure its all natural, because the ones that aren't are loaded with sugar and a leading cause in diabetes in children and adults. Lots of water, 3-4 liters a day, not all at once, but spread it out. Its really easy to down a liter or two while your watching tv or on the computer. Also drink some after you eat the bigger meals of the day, it helps your body pick out the nutrients in food when your food is more spread apart.  You also need to stay away from any sports drinks unless you’ve just had a long workout and then you need to limit yourself.  Most atheletes mix Gatorade with water because its two  complex for your body to get all the nutrients out of.  It needs to be diluted.  These rules may be hard to adapt to at first so start with cutting out the things you know you can live without.  Then work from there.  Remember these are  perfect eating habits, it can take you a while to work into it.  If you know you can’t live without your one treat a day, don’t fight it by trying to eat something else, just eat it and make sure that’s the only one you cheat on a day.  Otherwise you’ll get depressed and quit.  Another important point is getting the right amount of sleep every night.  You need 8-9 hours of sleep each night for your body to function correctly.  This is an important factor of losing weight.  Set up a routine for yourself and go to bed at about the same time each night.  \nAs for exercise, lots of cardio. Find something you like. If you have never exercised much before, start with walking 30 minutes a day at a brisk pace. Move on to different terrains that include hills and increase the time spent. After a week or two, try jogging the route. No matter what find an activity you enjoy. Walking to jogging is just an example, try hiking, rollerblading, biking. Once you get into a regular routine, if your not happy with the level of difficulty, try signing up with a gym. Spinning, pilates or kickboxing classes are great. It will also introduce you to working with weights. Talk to a trainer for instruction before using any weights. A cheap investment is a balance ball, it works you stomach while your just sitting on it, like at your computer and its great for posture. There are hundreds of exercises you can use it for for your entire body. I can give you some ideas if you want, just email me.

What that means is both you and your husband where carries and both her  x chromosomes has that genetic disorder. X linked disease happen more often in males, but females can get them too. Its just not as likely
I'm not sure at what age this could start. But with kids of the 80's,90's and today being in the technology age. Using more computers each decade,your hearing more of carpul tunnel more offen but it can be said for those who weren't born in these decades either when using electric typewritters,classic mannual typewritters. \n\nIt's repedative stress injury,that can happen in time to anyone in any age range,background,etc...
It sounds to me that you're bathing her too often and drying her skin out.  I'd let her go a day or two between baths, just sponge bathe her.  Use lots of moisturizer on her.  My twins had spots like that when they were babies too and the doc said I was bathing them too much.  Other than that, I don't know.
Coffee is very acidic in reaction in the body, and that is why we intuitively add milk to balance it out.......coffee will pull alkaline minerals like calcium and magnesium out of the body, and therefore may inhibit the formation of bone.  Coffee consumption also increases the amount of estrogen in the body, which may or may not be good, depending on whether you are male or female.

"yes. but everything in moderation. as a gamer it's nice to see yourself progressing through the game, achieving good scores or passing levels things like that. but one can become WAY too wrapped up in it and forget that the real world exists too. games often promote critical thinking, problem solving skills, dexterity and not to mention determination. even the ""bad"" games like GTA or HALO promote quick reflexes, sharp thinking and lots of determination. just the opposite could also be said for games how they rot ones mind or make people lose their grip on reality. but those people are called losers and emos I believe. as long as things are kept in moderation then everyinthg is cool."

The best diets are low fat and low carb.\nYour problem is not getting enough exercise.\nMost Americans just want to lose weight instead of wanting to be healthy.  You have to exercise for one hour every day and eat right.  Stop whining about how you can't keep with a diet.  It's your fault you are failing. You have to make a decision to eat right and exercise and then stick with it.  You want it to be easy so here's the trick.  Eat right and exercise.  Its that simple.  Take control and stop whining about why you fail. If you don't you will NEVER be healthy and you will never lose weight.

A great source of protein is hard boiled eggs, but just eat the white. Give the yolk to your dog or cat. That way you avoid the fat and cholesterol. Or make scrambled eggs and before cooking separate out the yolk and just use mostly whites, with maybe just one yolk. Lean fish and chicken are great, too, and if you can afford it, buy organic and all-natural meat. You still need to balance it out with fresh green and yellow vegetables, fresh fruit, whole grains (like oatmeal, whole-grain bread, brown rice, etc) for a balanced diet.
A yeast infection is caused by the normal flora of the vagina and tends to cause white discharge and itching.  A bacterial infection is caused by a different type of organism.  It could be bacterial vaginosis, which is also a disturbance of the normal flora of the vagina.  Bacteria can also be transmitted by sex, such as gonorrhea and chlamydia.  There are also some strains of bacteria that can infect the urinary tract, which causes pain with urination.  Your doctor will evaluate your history and your symptoms and probably do a urine test to check for urinary tract infections.  A yeast infection can be treated with an oral medication like Diflucan or a vaginal cream like Monistat.  Bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics, but the specific medicine depends on what type of infection you have.  Good luck!
"i was bulimic for eight years.started in school and i just didnt want to stop after that.its so easy eating chocolates and fatty food and throwing it all up after that.i loved the pleasure food gave me,but always rem it starts from the mind.its all up to you.i didnt take pro help but was disgusted i gained 20 pounds when i tried stopping.\ni am cured now,it wasnt diffcult getting back to normal.i believe if you want to you will.i exercise 4 times a week and never exeed 1400 calories. i m not skinny but healthy and prob stay this way for a bit.\noh i cheated last nite...ate endless bars of chocolates and a tub of ice cream....blamed it on depression.automatically threw some of it up....your body has a reflex action after some time.relax.we are all human.\n\nBulimia is often less about food, and more to do with deep psychological issues and profound feelings of lack of control. Binge/purge episodes can be severe, sometimes involving rapid and out of control feeding that can stop when the sufferers ""are interrupted by another person or when their stomach hurts from over-extension. This cycle may be repeated several times a week or, in serious cases, several times a day.\n\nTreatment is most effective when it is implemented early on in the development of the disorder. Unfortunately, since this disorder is often easier to hide and less physically noticeable, diagnosis and treatment often come when the disorder has already become a static part of the patient’s life. Historically, those with bulimia were often hospitalized to end the pattern and then released as soon as the symptoms had been relieved. However, this is now infrequently used, as this only addresses the surface of the problem, and soon after discharge the symptoms would often reappear as severe, if not worse, than when they had originally been.\n\nThere are several residential treatment centers across the country, which offer long term support, counseling, and symptom interruption. The most popular form of treatment for the disorder involves some form of therapy, often times group psychotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy. Anorexics and bulimics typically go through the same types of treatments and are members of these same treatment groups. This is because anorexia and bulimia often go hand in hand, and it is not unlikely that one has at some point participated in both. Some refer to this as ""symptom swapping"". These forms of therapy address both the underlying issues which cause the patient to engage in these behaviors, as well as the actual food symptoms as well. In combination with therapy, many psychiatrists will prescribe anti-depressants or anti-psychotics"

"I don't like taking antibiotics because they can damage good bacteria.  To help increase your good bacteria you need acidophilus, it also helps decrease infections.\n\nYou can use a saline solution nasal spray (available everywhere) to spray your nose twice a day.  This helps keep your sinuses clean.  \n\nTo help get rid of sinusitis, then you can try Sinus Buster.  It is highly effective way to fight sinus problems.  While a nasal pepper spray may sound painful, it is not as painful as straight pepper.   \n\nYears ago when I could not afford to go to a doctor, I added some water to Cayenne pepper and sprayed it in my nose.  After 30 minutes of crying, sneezing, and yelling in pain, I realized I had ""cured"" the infection I had.  So I think the far less painful Sinus Buster is great."
It's too complex for any of us non-medicinal researchers to understand. It is full of complex mathematical and chemistry equations.
Shouldn't be a big problem. It's a little hard to get your food down to begin with. you want to take small bites, chew real good and flush with water. It's nearly impossible to belch and vomit. After a while when it's all healed and the swelling gone, thing start getting back to some semblance of normal but it takes several months to really feel normal again. Don't worry about it, it really isn't that bad.
Human Papilloma Virus: The human papilloma virus is thought to be one of the main causes of cervical cancer. It has also been linked with other types of cancers of the female reproductive system. While HPV can be treated to reduce the signs and symptoms, there is currently no cure for this virus. \n\nHerpes Virus: Herpes is another STD that presently has no cure. However, treatment is available and there are a number of things you can do yourself at home to help relieve your genital herpes. Herpes symptoms include blisters or sores that periodically break out on the genitals. Take a look at our FAQs on genital herpes to learn even more about this uncomfortable STD. \n\nHepatitis: Although there is no cure for those already infected, there is now a Hepatitis B (HBV) vaccine available to prevent the spread of this infection. Many are asymptomatic, however those who do suffer from Hepatitis B symptoms may have many unpleasant discomforts. Even though there is a possibility that the infection will clear up on its own, some people suffer from chronic infections for many years. Treatment is available for chronic sufferers. Other types of hepatitis infections that can be passed through sexual contact include Hepatitis A and Hepatitis C. \n\nHIV/AIDS: One STD that many people are worried about getting is HIV. While new ways of treating this infection can significantly prolong an infected person's life, for far too many people this infection eventually progresses to AIDS and, ulitmately, death. More than 40 million people worldwide are infected with the HIV virus; women account for 50% of those infected. Many people may not realize they are infected, as the HIV virus is often asymptomatic for the first few years. HIV testing is the only sure way to know if you are infected. However, you can take steps to help prevent the infection. \n\nSyphilis: Throughout history, cases of syphilis have been recorded. While this STD has not always been effectively dealt with, nowadays, syphilis can easily be treated and cured. However, as history has shown, without treatment, syphilis symptoms can progress and affect the nervous system and brain leading to dementia and even death. \n\nTrichomoniasis: Trichomoniasis is one of the most common, curable STDs out there. However, symptoms of trich may be mistaken for a yeast infection causing a women to use the wrong type of treatment for her vaginal discharge. \n\nCommon Infections: Chlamydia and gonorrhea often infect a person at the same time. Although the symptoms of chlamydia are different from gonorrhea symptoms, it is not unusual for a person to be asymptomatic. If you are testing for chlamydia, it may be a good idea to also test for gonorrhea at the same time. Both STDs can be cured but can also do damage to your reproductive system if left untreated. \n\nPubic Lice: A very common STD, crabs are very similar to head lice. While the itchy symptoms can be hard to miss, treatment for pubic lice can easily take care of the discomfort these pests can cause. \n \nRare Infections: Some STDs, like granuloma inguinale and chancroid, are not so well known in North America, but that doesn't mean your not at risk of contracting these infections. Other lesser-talked about STDs include nongonococcal urethritis, molluscum contagiosum, and lymphogranuloma venereum. \n\nHope that helped! Check out this site for more info:

For a 16 year old you are off to a good start! Hang in there and give it some time.  Like some guys you may get bigger and then again you may have reached your full potential  Either way the average for an adult male is 6 to 7 inches.  Sure there are guys with a bigger penis, but there are also a lot of guys with a smaller penis who would trade for yours in a minute.  And as anyone can tell you, it is definitely not the size that counts, it's in knowing  what you are doing with what you already have.  Don't ever feel like you got cheated! Take the time while you are young to explore your body and to learn your likes and dislikes so that you can communicate them to your future sex partner.  Good luck!

"yes, it's sad but true.  they can pretty much ""empty"" if you lose fat, but the cells will still be there.  that's why so many people who lose a lot of weight easily gain it back again, much more quickly than they gained it the first time around.\n\nalthough, new medical techniques may change all that.  first of all, there's liposuction, where the fat cells are vacuumed out through a small tube.  also, i recently read about lipotherapy (i think i have the name right) which involves a certain drug being injected into the fat problem area (for people who aren't overweight, but have a fat area they can't lose) and the drug helps the body process and destroy the fat cells!  pretty amazing.  here's a website with more info about it, and pictures."

Ok first of all...he hurt you. Why would you be willing to get with that again? Second of all...if you think a pregnant ex-girlfriend will not affect your relationship you are so wrong. She and their child will always be a part of this guy's life. How can he guarantee that they will not affect your relationship. And do you want to be a step-mama? To someone who isn't even with his pregnant ex....ask yourself why he is having a child with someone he doesn't want to be with and then ask yourself if you want that to be you....Don't fall for this one girl. There are plenty of non-loser guys out there just waiting to meet you.
Seek counselling by all means, talk to a professional.  Get the help you need and deserve.  Nothing in life is so bad that you should be thinking of hurting yourself.

As every one has mentioned that Infarc is a term for heart attack. It can be mild or major. If they sent you home then chances are that it was an old infarc and that you had no clinical indications for being there, HOWEVER IF YOU ARE CONTINUING TO EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS YOU NEED TO BE RE-EVALUATED. a blood pressure of 74/45 is cause for major concern if you do not normally have low blood pressure. You need to be seen and followed by a cardiologist.  Saying that it was no big deal is WRONG. Especially at 35. \n\nYou need a full work up including laboratory, stress test, and possibly cardiac cath (if testing shows nothing but a possible old MI INSIST ON THE CARDIAC CATH, my best friend was 33 with some cardiac issues considered minor. she had a thallium stress test that revealed nothing, a week later she had a Major MI at work that she did not survive. She was an ER nurse and she died at work.  Nothing they did could save her. Had she insisted on the cardiac cath she might be alive today.\n\nNow you could be having panic attacks that are exacerbated by fear. Perfectly natural, but chances are that you really do need to be re-checked.
Cognitive-behavioral therapy works wonders for some people.\n\nThe goal of Behavior Therapy is to modify and gain control over unwanted behavior. The individual learns to cope with difficult situations, often through controlled exposure to them. This kind of therapy gives the individual a sense of having control over their life.\n\nThe goal of Cognitive Therapy is to change unproductive or harmful thought patterns. The individual examines his feelings and learns to separate realistic from unrealistic thoughts. As with Behavior Therapy, the individual is actively involved in his own recovery and has a sense of control.\n\nMany therapists use a combination of Cognitive and Behavior Therapies, this is often referred to as CBT. One of the benefits of these types therapies is that the patient learns recovery skills that are useful for a lifetime.

"I'm very sorry to hear this, my sympathies go out to you and your family.\n\nMy father-in-law recently passed away from this type of cancer.  It runs in my husband's family as his father, grandfather and uncle were also diagnosed.\n\nMy husband's father was given 6 months to live by his doctors but he survived for 2 whole years.  He refused any radiation or chemotherapy, as he believed that it would have probably done more harm than good.  He did not want to go out that way, he wanted to be as strong as possible for as long as possible.\n\nHe was only 56 when he was diagnosed and 58 when he passed, so since your mother is older she may have different issues to deal with.  But my father-in-law was very active until only a few weeks before his passing.  The only hints that he was ill was the ever-increasing lump in his abdomen (his tumor), it's accompanying pain, and extreme weight-loss.  His pain got slowly worse as time progressed and at the very end he did take pain medications for it as it was quite bad.  The medications made him very confused and at the very end he didn't recognize anyone anymore and couldn't use the bathroom by himself.\n\nHe had a very interesting outlook on his sickness.  When he was diagnosed initially, he decided to spend his last days doing what he loved most - surfing.  He moved to Costa Rica for 8 months and when he didn't die, he decided to come home!  The only remedy he took the entire time - aside from the pain meds at the end - was his own urine!  Yes, it sounds crazy, but there is apparently some sort of urine-drinking therapy program he learned about and decided to try.  It sounded awful, but we couldn't argue with it, as it seemed to be doing something!  And he lived a year and a half longer than expected!\n\nMy husband's uncle who was also diagnosed 6 months after his father opted for chemo and radiation.  They think they caught his early because the tumor grew on a vital duct and gave him very bad jaundice very early on, so he noticed his symptoms right away.  He is recovering now and only experienced pain after his treatments started.  Most of his pain came from his surgeries and from his treatment making him so tired!  He is in his 40s.\n\nGrandfather was in his mid 80s and passed soon after being diagnosed.  Pancreatic cancer is very aggressive and took him quickly.  The only solace we took was in that he had lived a full, long, good life.  He wasn't in much pain because he was heavily medicated which also made him very confused.  He also lost a lot of weight.\n\nAs far as what you should expect ... it's different for everyone.  She is older which vastly decreases her chance of survival.  No matter what, it will cause her pain because of the tumor pressing on vital organs, and if she is on pain medication she will probably be very ""out of it"".\n\nThe one thing I want to say is that, if she is going to pass ... if you have anything you need to say to your mother, please tell her!  It's morbid but it's such a truth.  My husband couldn't find the words to express what he needed to say to his father, even after 2 years of preparation, and it hurt him so deeply.  Don't wait until it's too late.  Say anything you need to now while she is still aware and capable of communicating coherently.\n\nGod bless you and yours, I wish you the best."
Sorry. You can't get rid of cellulite. You're stuck with it. =(
Ususally no. Anything to do with your discs in general are degenerative. So talk to you Dr. there may be some steroids or other medicine to stop the degenerative changes but nothing to make it go away.

i know young fit men can. when i was 23 i was seeing a 17 year old senior in high school. i know this sounds retarded but he was the best sex i ever had. he could keep going and going. we would sometimes rent a room at a motel and have hours and hours of mind blowing sex. it was during these sessions that he would pull out come in my mouth and without missing a beat he would start again.  he could have been a freak of nature because since then, not one man has been able to perform like that.
Talk to the doctor, get the pills and take them. \n\nAsk if he would prescribe pills so you won't have your period for longer than the normal 28 days. Standard bc pills make your body think it is pregnant so the menses are suspended. At some point the pills turn into placebos, or they run out and your body goes back to having the period. So, you have to ask the doctor if you can do it. He will give you pills that won't go to placebo or won't run out before your next desired period.
Lack of blood supply.
Most likely yes. Also remember blonde hair does get darker eventually. Mine's turning dirty blonde (from blonde). My dad's hair is black and my mother's is brown. I THOUGHT I got blonde hair because my grandfather had it, however, my dad's hair used to be blonde and it turned to black. Also I am the only one besides my grandfather to have hazel eyes.... I am the only blonde female. I think they can occur out of nowhere. Because you can't know everyone you are related to nor can you meet them. Some families go many generations back. Like I am Cherokee, but I am 100% white and blonde. So I believe someone along the way might have had light hair and blue eyes... and if these are infants blue eyes change sometimes and so does the light hair. Don't worry so much. Facial features happen to tell everything and if he really is that insercure... paternity tests.
Rhus tox works the best. See links.
Dear Buddy,\n\n   Suppliments and gadgets are all a huge scam. I don't care if it's endorsed by the pope himself, it's a ploy to get your money. The only way to increase penis size is through an operation. This operation is about $4,000 and will give you an extra 1in-2 1/2 in. So if you have the money go for it,but I think you should just focus on other aspects of pleasing your partner. A larger or longer penis won't lead to happiness, more dates, or a happier life. You'll just have a funny lookin longer penis. There are tons of ways to please your partner besides beating (him/her) down with your man stick.LOL So good luck and relax dude:)
You say he wants you to wait til after a d&c...did you have a miscarraige? \n\nIt sounds like you may have an infection.

I hope you find out what it is and get better soon!

"I would insist on another surgical consultation.  Lapriscopic surgery doesn't always get to the borrom of things.  Also, you might have had an inexperienced surgeon.  I would insist on another surgical consultation.That might be hard to do depending on your insurance, but pain is a symptom that something is wrong.  If your doctor is ignoring that, simply because nothing turns up positive on their ""tests"" doesn't mean that there isn't something wonky down there.\n\nI know what it's like to live with chronic pain, and it seems like doctors are more and more likely today to say that it's ""all in your head"" simply because they don't want to pay for expensive tests or treatments.\n\nHave they check for endometriosis?  That can cause the type of pain you describe.  I guess the bottom line is that you have to keep being an advocate for yourself and insist that they get to the bottom of this.

In my first trimester, I had diarrhea instead of morning sickness.  And then came the constipation.  Make sure to eat lots of fiber, you will need it-apples and whole grain pasta, bread, and rice.  And as many fruits, veggies, and glasses of water as you can stand.  That was the first and only time in my life that I was constipated.  It was awful.

A panic attack is scary and can be serious at times.  This panic attack happens because your fight or flight response in your brain (which is there to make you run when you're in danger) is over reacting.  You need to train your brain to set off this fight or flight routine at a higher level of real life threating stress rather than every time you start to worry about your job, your boyfriend, etc.  A panic attack can broadside you for the first time with full blown hyperventilation, tingling in your fingers, burning in your extremeties, and at worst, can paralyze you for a short time.  When you hyperventilate, you take on too much oxygen which affects your muscles.  There are medications like Clonapin that will lower your anxiety level and stop the panic attacks.  Even when you go off of them, you may have retrained your brain to set off the fight or flight response at a higher level.  Your fears whether real or unreal need to be dealt with (with a reputable psychotherapist, social worker or psychologist) in the long run.  Clonapin works very well for some people, but you can't stay on it forever.  It can give you a break from the scary attacks where you can't catch your breath, etc....  Good luck... I feel for you, but do get help now!

Acute bronchitis is usually caused by a virus. It is more common during the winter months, and you often develop it after having an upper respiratory tract illness such as influenza (flu) or a cold. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) may be a cause, especially in adults older than 65. Acute bronchitis is caused by bacteria about 10% of the time.\n\nAcute bronchitis can also be caused by exposure to smoke, chemicals, or air pollution, all of which can irritate the bronchial tubes, or it can develop from accidentally inhaling (aspirating) food, vomit, or mucous material.

It depends on your level of action while playing the game. If you play light and hesitate a lot between directions, it is unlikely that you will notice any great change, but if you play light rather fluidly and consistently for 30+ minutes a week, it is possible that you could lose some weight in the process. To further the effects, you could always try eating better, eating smaller portions, eating slower, and adding more physical activity to your regimen.\n\nGood luck! (It does happen!)

"Tough question.  Its a personal decision.\n\nFirst off, if there is no slipped disk or nerves being pinched or associated weakness and numbness  in extremities, what exactly is the back surgeon going to fix??  I mean I doubt back surgery of any type is going to take away the pain from ""top to bottom.""\n\nI think the following are the factors that you need to think about:\n\n1)Neurological symptoms like leg numbness or weakness, compromised walking.  These symptoms can progress over time and you may not get function back if you wait to long.  Usually there is an identifiable lesion like a slipped disk pushing on a nerve on MRI.\n\n2)Chronic back pain that is amenable to surgery.  For instance anterolithesis or posterolithesis where the vertebral body is slipped forward or backwards.  In conditions like these the pain may became unbearable (this is where personal choice is important) and you can't stand it any longer that surgery is the only option.\n\n3)What does the back surgeon say?  Its important to seek the consult of multiple back surgeons that are reputable. Sometimes, more often then not, back surgery results in more pain and disability.  Some people often have 1 surgery after the next to fix the problems from the previous surgeon.  If 3 surgeon says its not fixable and 1 says they can help I would trust the first 3 surgeons.\n\n4)You have exhausted all your option.  Chiropractors, medications, physical therapy, alternative medicine, massage therapy, accupucture, yoga.\n\nMy sense, again is if you have pain from ""top to bottom"" surgery isn't going to help.  If there is no identifiable cause of this pain, surgery will not improve your situation.  A chronic pain specialist have actually be more helpful."

you may not need to have any teeth pulled out with the new technology involving orthodontics now. Ask you dentist/orthodontist about invisalign (clear braces which arent attached and are only removed for eating or cleaning, you have a set which you wear for 2 weeks each time). There is also damon 3 brackets, visit www.ormco.com/damon. there is often no need for teeth to be removed, treatment time is 6 months less than conventional treatment and is less painful. they are very tiny and you do not need to wear elastics (which is the most cause of friction pain), the wire clips in and out which means less chairside time and discomfort for you, less force when moving is good for adult ortho care. I have them in at the moment. prob with invisalign is you often need to wear brackets after to get the best result. Have a look at the sites and talk to your orthodontist again

Caffeine is a xanthine alkaloid found in the leaves and beans of the coffee tree, in tea, yerba mate, guarana berries, and in small quantities in cocoa, the kola nut and the Yaupon holly. In plants, caffeine acts as a natural pesticide that paralyzes and kills many insects feeding upon them.  Caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant, having the effect of warding off drowsiness and restoring alertness.In nature, caffeine is found with widely varying concentrations of the other xanthine alkaloids theophylline and theobromine, which are cardiac stimulants. When caffeine appears to have different effects depending on the source, it is due primarily to varying concentrations of other stimulants and absorption rates of the mixture.

"Hey SonoranAngel you just answered one of my questions so I thought I'd help you out here. I too suffer from schizophrenia ( as you know) and it has always helped me when others seriously listen and consider what I have to say. I know they probably taught you this but their is usually a logical reason for the individuals fears, worries, ""bizzare""thoughts, etc. However that can take quite a bit of time so what you could do in the meantime is try and get the individual psychiatric treatment (meds) as well as listen. Even if it makes no sense to you. As long as the individual isn't hurting anyone (including himself) go along with what he's saying and try to help him come to some logical conclusion, (reality testing). This has always helped to ground me even when I'm in my more manic stages. Please don't tell the individual that his thoughts and feelings aren't valid based on YOUR perceptions of what ""normal"" is. This has always managed to become more of a hinderance to my well being than anything else. Plus it's really annoying. Make sure the individual \ngets their meds, this can greatly increase their reasoning ability, I know this from personal experience. BTW my grandmother used to think she was Mary, Jesus's mother. And I'd be the first to say that she has lead a fairly successful life as well as dealt with her mental disorder ina very positive manner. NEVER view an individual as hopeless. There is Hope for all of us."

"The following healthy living recommendations will help you if your trying to lose weight, have aspirations of building lean muscle mass, are attempting to get a wash board stomach, or just want to feel better:\n\n*1) Burn more calories then your consuming everyday and measure your results using the following formula: Calories Consumed minus Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) minus Physical Activity. Get a fitness calculator that you can put on your cell phone and computer. This will allow you to easily  calculate this formula, log your daily calorie consumption, and log your physical activities.\n\n*2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement. \n\nAvoid “High Glycemic Load Carbs” (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as white potatoes) and drink lots of water. \n\nDo not try fad diets. Here is an excellent food pyramid that anyone can follow: http://www.rayandterry.com/html/images/PyramidLRG.gif?osCsid=26a424be471d1337e7c2f105d5c64d9d\n\n*3) Exercise on most days by doing cardiovascular training and/or resistance training activities. \n\nRead a book or find a certified trainer to make sure your doing all resistance training exercises correctly. A great book to buy that teaches you the resistance training basics is “Weight Training For Dummies”. A superb magazine to buy with excellent resistance training routines that will not get you bored is ""Muscle and Fitness"". Signup for the free newsletter.\n\nA good book to buy that teaches you the cardiovascular training basics is “Fitness For Dummies”. \n\n*4) Get plenty of sleep. Sleep experts say most adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep each night for optimum performance, health, and safety. \n\n*5) Educate yourself continually on health issues. A good free publication is  “Dietary Guidelines For Americans 2005”. A superb book to read is “You The Owner’s Manual”. An excellent periodic publication is the “Nutrition Action Health Letter”.\n\n*6) Make a life long commitment to good health. A great test you can take to measure your biological age is at http://realage.com Look at other areas where you can improve your health. For example, make improvements on the quality of the air you breath. Review outdoor air quality forecasts where you live and get an indoor air purifier.

"Animal Lover's right: You should see a therapist, if it's consuming so much of your time, energy, and happiness.\n\nAnd yes, you should face those fears head-on. I'm not saying you should deliberately try to drown yourself for instance, but try taking a good swimming course. Afraid of hieghts? Climb up ladders a lot (but let your husband be your spotter, so to speak!) And yes, you might even try some basic rock-climbing. Instead of focusing on those fears- which gives them way more importance than they should have- you should work on convincing yourself of one phrase: ""I Can Do This.""\n\nAnother thing I used to do that helped me work through some situations: Lucid Dreaming. It is actually possible to seize control of your dreams if you don't like the direction they're going, and change them. So if you see yourself falling, for instance- change that to a dream of flying instead. That is a very crude example of course.\n\nGood luck!"
Two pounds per week is (generally) the most you can shed without risking harm or unwanted side effects of a diet.  There's no quick magical way to drop 40 lbs in a very short time, although product ads will try to convince you otherwise.  A strict well-disciplined Weight Watchers Diet for example, can allow you to lose the 40 lbs in about 20 weeks (5 months).
consult a specialist or dermatology perhaps
well.....  'need an answer' you state you are a medical professional. All I can say is thank god I dont have anything to do with you. What a closed mind. As someone also in the medical profession, what you allude to certainly does happen however you are being extremely judgemental here, and remember it's the internet here. sounds like you are purely siding with the doctor.... people usually do that to protect their own.\n\nI prefer to have an open mind and treat each patient as an individual, have in my mind the potential reasons why patients have complications... but assess each case on it's own merits.\n\n'treefrog' - nice answer. Hope you are going well.\n\nTo help the person asking this question however ----\n\nSepsis and septic infection literally means an infection around the site.. which has the potential to travel around the body and cause many more serious problems. It is not uncommon to have infections after a surgery. The professionals involved do everything they can to reduce the risk however  they cannot reduce the risk to zero. We all have bugs that live on our skin happily, healthily fighting off other viruses and bugs that we come into contact with. It's when these bugs get into your system, into a spot they shouldnt that they cause trouble. The treatment you have undegone is fairly standard for your condition and complication ( in regards to the antibiotics) It is vitally important that the infection get under control so that your knee surgery can finally be finished.\n\nHowever if you had told me this story... I would have the following concerns - \n\n1. Sounds like the doctor, by what you describe here, isnt listening to you, or is... but not allaying your fears. that is all about communication. If potentially he isnt hearing what you are saying, or not explaining things properly because you may be too upset to listen properly, my suggestion is to take a friend along to your next appointment. Have a list of questions written down and ask them, one by one. Do not give your doctor the list, just ask them the way you have written them - its your list, you need to understand it.\n\n2. The doctor removing medication from your handbag. I am afraid no professional has the right to do this. The medication is legally prescribed, you have had it legally dispensed from a pharmacist, it has your name on it. It is yours. My question here to him would be... why did you do that... why havent you sent them to me... If he thinks you may be starting to have an addiction to pain medication... then he has handled it poorly. Communication is the key again. He has taken your pain medication and not sent it.... maybe I can jump to conclusions like 'need an answer' did and say the doctor is taking the medication himself and he is addicted????\n\nAssumptions dont help. Getting you comfortable and pain free and on the right treatment is the goal here.\n\nTake a friend along, ask the questions, if you dont get satisfactory answers, then seek a second opinion. Maybe it isnt your fault, but a fault of the doctor in question.\n\nAfter all.... we are all human. sometimes everyone needs to be reminded of that. ( including you, 'need an answer' )
Start by reducing the amount you eat by 10%. This way, you'll be taking in fewer calories, but your body won't go into shock and start hoarding everything you eat. Lower it another 10% every couple of weeks. Don't go lower than 1200 calories unless you're under DIRECT supervision by a doctor!! \n\nYou're not going to get instant results, but they'll be lasting ones.
Grab your vacuum cleaner put a rag of some sort over the end and run it over the mattress you'll find them if they are there.
"Wear chapstick with an SPF to prevent them because the sun can make them pop up. Also if you feel one coming, take an L-Lysine pill (often, as much as the bottle says to take) this also can be taken to prevent them. and try using a product called ""abreva"" its kind of expensive ($17) but works great. The trick is to use it asap because it speeds up the healing process. If they become a big problem try seeing a doctor, my sister used to get them all the time, since she saw a doctor, she prescribed her a strong medication and now she never gets them."
yes, i have too. Not for awhile though. \n\nGet plenty of sleep. If they keep happening, see a doc. They can check psych stuf and run MRI, CRT etc to make sure your physical brain is ok too. Probably when you sleep you will be ok. Make sure.
"Ice cream headache: A headache that occurs when one puts ice, a cold food or chilled beverage in the mouth. Ice cream is by far the most frequent offender. The headache occurs regardless of whether or not the individual suffers from other types of headache, such as migraine. \n\nIce cream headache is characterized by a stabbing, aching pain that begins a few seconds after ingestion of something cold. The pain peaks in 30 to 60 seconds. It is usually located in the midfrontal area (in the middle of the forehead) but may be in the temporal or retro-orbital region (behind the eye). The headache may be accompanied by a toothache. The pain rarely lasts for more a few minutes, if that long. \n\nNo treatment is required for an ice cream headache and it is not necessary to stop eating ice cream. The headache can be ""headed off"" by keeping cold foods and icy beverages away from the back of the palate (the roof of the mouth). The pain of an ice cream headache is a form of referred pain. It is referred from palate where it is triggered to the head and sometimes the teeth.  AKA BRAIN FREEZE!"
Its a natural thing thats why guys avoid being hit there not just becaus of the pain but cos it moves to the tommy region sometimes u could feel like stooling or going to the toilet.It only last  for some mins.

"I fly in my dreams all of the time.  It started when I was very young (5) I am now 42.  I learned a lot about out of body experiences and astral travel.  The Sylvia Brown book is good and also Doreen Virtue ""lightworkers"" book.  It is good to learn about these things so you aren't afraid.  I can control my dreams now (lucid dreaming) and it is great.  Try keeping a notebook and pen by your bed and jot them down.  Do you hear sounds or feel spinning before you take off?  These are signs of astral travel.  There is much to learn about dreamtime out there.  Explore and have fun!"

I had this procedure performed in the L4-L5 region 11 years ago.  It was a miracle - after a year's suffering, even though I awoke in some pain, it was the wrong kind.  The misery was GONE!\n\nI enjoyed a reasonably rapid recovery and although at times still experience some temporary discomfort in the lower back - especially after standing or walking a long time - am very happy with the result.\n\nI cannot speak to limitations on the use of this procedure for vrious back conditions, but I know that instead of major invasive surgery that might well have left me permanently in pain or partially disabled, this worked.
Treatment is ideally directed toward correcting the cause; however, the first aim is to prevent or treat dehydration and nutritional deficiencies. When possible, food intake should be continued even in patients with acute diarrhea. A physician should be consulted as to what type and how much food is permitted. Low-fat diets or more easily digestible fat is useful in some patients. The BRAT diet, which limits food intake to bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast, can help to resolve diarrhea. These foods provide soluble and insoluble fiber without irritation. If the toast is slightly burnt, the charcoal can help sequester toxins and pull them from the body. The patient should drink plenty of fluids, however, in severe cases hospitalization to provide intravenous fluids may be necessary. A physician should be notified if the patient is dehydrated, and if oral replacement is suggested then commercial (Pedialyte and others) or homemade preparations can be used. The World Health Organization(WHO) has provided this easy recipe for home preparation, which can be taken in frequent small sips:\n• table salt: 3/4 teaspoon\n• baking powder: 1 teaspoon\n• orange juice: 1 cup\n• water: 1 quart or liter\nSupplements\nNutrient replacement also plays a role in preventing and treating diarrhea. Zinc especially appears to have an effect on the immune system, and deficiency of this mineral can lead to chronic diarrhea. Also, zinc replacement improves growth in young patients.\nDietary supplements that are generally beneficial in the treatment of digestive disorders include:\n• vitamin C: 50-500 mg daily\n• vitamin B6: 50-150 mg daily\n• magnesium aspartate: 400 mg daily\n• vitamin E: 400 IU daily\n• glutamine: 3,000 mg daily\n• garlic, deodorized: 2,000 mg daily\n• deghycirrhizinated licorice: chew as needed

if you think your metabolism is low you should talk to a doctor to see if there is any health issues. you could also try over the counter thyroid boosters at any pharmacy. but whatever you do keep up the good work. do not restrict your calories too much or your body will think you are starving or going through a famine and will keep your weight on longer for survival. any true long lasting weight loss takes a lot of time and is a lifetime committment so make sure your diet is something you can live with the rest of your life. the items you are cutting out should be replaced with a healthy alternative so you do not feel deprived which could lead to bingeing or yo-yo dieting. good luck.
Are you crazy? You must go to the doctor!!! Whatever the result is, you need treatment pronto. What if it's not malignant? There might be hope and you won't even know it. For your own sake, go to the doctor.

What you are referring to is probably Dupuytrens contracture. This is a genetically related trait which causes thickening and lumps in the palmar fascia( a layer of the hand). People with ancestry from England/Ireland/Scotland/Northern Europe are more likely to have this problem.\n\nAs the fascia thickens, the bands that form can become painful and also pull the fingers into a flexed position. This can be surgically treated by excision of the palmar fascia. This is a detailed big operation, but is safely performed by hand surgeons every day. Dupuytrens contracture can recur after surgery, and the severest form, sometimes referred to as a Dupuytren's diathesis can be rapidly progressive and deforming. Dupuytrens can also be associated with contractures in other fascia, most notably the soles of the feet and a layer of the penis (Sometimes called peyronies disease).\n\nIf you need assessment, be sure you see someone experienced in hand surgery. Many Plastic and Orthopedic surgeons have a special interest in Hand surgery and some have taken an additional year of training to become very proficient in Hand surgery.

Your employer should have one already set up.  Go to your HR department or, if you do not have one, go to a Senior supervisor.  They should be able to tell you where to go.  In any case, you can go to your regular doctor and send the bill to you company.
aww shucks,\n\ndon't worry about it.\n\nthe trip is soo long that you'll probably be out of puke at about the 4th or 5th hour of the car ride.

that's tough. It's really hard to change her thinking about being fat, but you can help build her self esteem. Have her look at herself in the mirrior, and name all the things she likes about herself, and then point out some things that you like about her. That should help her feel better about herself and make her look at herself in a more positive way.
"Are you thinking of the dietary deficency disease called rickets?\n\nRickets was fairly common in the USA until milk was enriched with calcium and the importance of vitamin D was discovered.  \n\nRickets would cause the bones to soften and ""bow"".  But by the time the Babyboomers were born, American diets were much better and rickets has pretty much become a thing of the past.\n\nHere's what Wikipedia has to say:\n\n""Rickets is a severe and prolonged vitamin D deficiency that leads to softening and weakening of the bones in children. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium and phosphate, which children need to build strong bones. Good sources of dietary vitamin D are vitamin D-fortified formulas and milk.""\n\nMy mother who is of the ""Greatest Generation"" has rickets when she was a girl and her jaw bones didn't grow properly and she ended up with a mouthful of very crowded and crooked teeth."
"I'm a dentist.\n\nRead these words carefully:\n\nThere is procedure that your dentist performs that should cause you pain.  The only thing that should hurt is the injection of local anesthetic, which, if done properly, should hurt only minimally.\n\nOnce profound anesthesia of the tooth has been obtained, you should only sense the vibration of the drill and the air/water in your mouth.  There should be no pain.\n\nI cannot tell you, however, how long the procedure will take.  It depends on the extent of the decay, the number of tooth surfaces involved, the doctor's experience, the restoration material to be used, the quality of the doctor's assistant, your ability to open your mouth wide and keep your mouth opened wide (more on this below), and the extent to which you salivate.  Generally, on a good patient, placing a two-surface amalgam filling takes me about ten to fifteen minutes.  A two surface composite (i.e. tooth-colored) filling runs about twenty minutes.  A fidgety patient who repeatedly closes his/her mouth will require more time.\n\nOne of the things that patients do to make our job difficult is not open their f-ing mouths wide.  You tell them ""open wide"" and they'll open wide for two seconds before closing half way again.  The less you open, the less we can see, which understandibly means that the quality of our work is less.  When your doctor says ""open wide"", that means you should open wide and keep your mouth opened wide until he/she tells you to close.  It's in your best interest to do so."
I had my tonsils taken out many years ago.  The operation itself wasn't too bad, as you will be put to sleep during the procedure.  You will have a sore throat for quite a few days after,  I ate lots of mashed potatoes and ice cream....  Some people I know have actually had baby food as well.  It did help me a lot in the long run, as I ended up being a lot heathier overall after having them out,  less colds and coughs,etc.  Good luck.
Do an experiment:\nSimutaneously stick one thermometer up your butt and one in your mouth... wait a couple of minutes.  Read them... Is your butt really any hotter than your mouth?\nYou should publish your results/(shout it from the rooftop also) to let the world know the answer to this truly mind boggling question... all in the name of science.
i'd go see a doctor about that cause it could ruin the spine and the spinal cord.

I guess it would depend on wether or not it's for an over or under active thyroid.  I would think that if it's for a over active one, then if you're taking too much, it would slow everything down, and could very possibly give you swollen feet.
I don't know what it could be, but to prevent it, wear sweaters and such when you intend to stand for awhile, and simply wear underwear or shorts and a tanktop to bed with a fan/AC blowing on you for sleeping.
The hip extensors are responsible for straightening the leg and jumping.\n\nThe hip flexors bend the hip.  You do not bend your hips when jumping off the ground, hence the hip flexors have little involvement in this action.\n\nThe hip extensors are gluteus maximus, medius and minimus.  You can make these muscles larger by doing squats and jumping exercises.
im no doctor, but mickjam could be right.\n\nHematospermia\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to: navigation, search\nHematospermia, or the presence of blood in semen, is most often a benign and idiopathic symptom, but can sometimes result from medical problems such as a urethral stricture, infection of the prostate, or a congenital bleeding disorder, and can occur transiently after surgical procedures such as a prostate biopsy. It is present in less than 2% of urology referrals, although prevalence in the overall population is unknown.\n\nPatients with hematospermia should be evaluated by a urologist to identify or rule out medical causes. Idiopathic hematospermia is sometimes treated with tetracycline and prostatic massage.

I USED to do the stuff. Im a recovering addict. I can tell you that the more pure stuff has a  brownish color to it. But it can by white also. My guess would be that it probably is. Sorry to say. It can come as a powder or also more compressed or it can be sticky.. I hope this helps you and hopefully its not what you think its not a good thing to get on!!! Also if you are really worried that it could be get a drug test kit.
"In my opinion, its more than just sit ups. You have to work all the muscles in your abdominal region. Getting a six pack is almost impossible in one month, because as you work muscles, you need to allow them time to ""heal"". But to start working towards the goal of a six pack, you may want to do 3 or 4 sets of 20 sit ups (remember to breathe) and then gradually progress to using a weight (like a barbell or other type of weight that you can cross across your chest). This will force your body to do more than just lift your body weight. Joining a gym that has a machine to work out your obliques and several machines to work your abs would be helpful as well. Best of luck!"
"Since you both have herpes, it's perfectly fine to have unprotected sex. It's not like you are going to reinfect each other or pass it back and forth to each other. Once you have it, you will always have it. It is a virus and will stay with you the rest of your life. If one of you are on a breakout though, I would suggest you not have sex, because it could cause the other one to breakout also. \n\nThere are a few medications that can suppress herpes. They can be taken daily or just when you are having an outbreak or ""feel"" an outbreak coming on. I personally only take medicine when I am having an outbreak. Valtrex makes me sick to my stomach and makes me dizzy. The more years you have had herpes the less outbreaks you will have too. I have had herpes for about 5 years now, and I get one outbreak a year if that. I've been outbreak free for about a year and a half now, and that's without taking the medicine.\n\nI hope this answered your question! Good luck!"
Consult your doctor.  A thorough history, exam, plus or minus blood work can often yield a diagnosis.  And only by finding what is causing your fatigue can your condition improve.  The symptom of fatigue can be caused by hundreds of reasons.  You relate you fatigue to your sleep but if something was going on you would be fatigued irregardless of how much sleep you get.  In other words, it may have nothing to do with your amount or pattern of sleep.\n\nThe things that come to mind are sleep apnea, anemia, diabetes, thyroid disease, depression, chronic fatigue symptom.  These are just a few things that come to mind.\n\nPlease seek consultation with a doctor.

It is one of the old medications and as such has pretty severe and permanent side affects.  I would suggest you go online and search new medications for bi-polar disorders.  The new medications don't have the harsh affects that lithium does.\n\nSomething else you want to educate yourself on is the fact that a lot of psychotropic medications actually can cause the disorders they are intended to treat.  Depression, mania, fatigue, anorexia, muscle tremors, insomnia.  It becomes a vicious circle.  When the symptoms return instead of looking to see if it is the medication causing it the Dr.   simply increases the amount of the medication or adds other meds to counteract the unpleasant side affects.  Be an informed consumer.  Check out ALL side affects onilne.  The ones they print up at the pharmacy are only the ones that were experienced my 2 percent or more of the test group.
Go to a doctor!!

You might need to strengthen the muscles in that area.  Try doing some back exercises specific to that area.
no, protein does help make you feel full but unless your building muscle, making it the main part of your diet isn't good for weight loss.  The basic rules to losing weight are no soda, no fast food, lots of chicken, fish, fresh (not canned that’s bad) fruits and vegies, whole wheat stuff, yogurt. Not so many cakes and donuts and cookies. Basic common sense for eating, you just need to enforce it. Get all the bad stuff out of the house right away, just toss it or give it away while your still motivated. No alcohol and no smoking  if that applies. Some juice but make sure its all natural, because the ones that aren't are loaded with sugar and a leading cause in diabetes in children and adults. Lots of water, 3-4 liters a day, not all at once, but spread it out. Its really easy to down a liter or two while your watching tv or on the computer. Also drink some after you eat the bigger meals of the day, it helps your body pick out the nutrients in food when your food is more spread apart.  You also need to stay away from any sports drinks unless you’ve just had a long workout and then you need to limit yourself.  Most atheletes mix Gatorade with water because its two  complex for your body to get all the nutrients out of.  It needs to be diluted.  These rules may be hard to adapt to at first so start with cutting out the things you know you can live without.  Then work from there.  Remember these are  perfect eating habits, it can take you a while to work into it.  If you know you can’t live without your one treat a day, don’t fight it by trying to eat something else, just eat it and make sure that’s the only one you cheat on a day.  Otherwise you’ll get depressed and quit.  Another important point is getting the right amount of sleep every night.  You need 8-9 hours of sleep each night for your body to function correctly.  This is an important factor of losing weight.  Set up a routine for yourself and go to bed at about the same time each night.  \nAs for exercise, lots of cardio. Find something you like. If you have never exercised much before, start with walking 30 minutes a day at a brisk pace. Move on to different terrains that include hills and increase the time spent. After a week or two, try jogging the route. No matter what find an activity you enjoy. Walking to jogging is just an example, try hiking, rollerblading, biking. Once you get into a regular routine, if your not happy with the level of difficulty, try signing up with a gym. Spinning, pilates or kickboxing classes are great. It will also introduce you to working with weights. Talk to a trainer for instruction before using any weights. A cheap investment is a balance ball, it works you stomach while your just sitting on it, like at your computer and its great for posture. There are hundreds of exercises you can use it for for your entire body. I can give you some ideas if you want, just email me. Also for more info on the benefits of water go to www.watercure.com Good Luck!

Do you mean hydroxychloroquine?\nIf so, then it's an anti-malarial drug. It's used to treat or to prevent infection from mosquitoes. It's also used as an immune system suppressant for people with autoimmune diseases like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.\nSide effects:\nNausea, stomach cramps, loss of appetite, diarrhea, dizziness, or headache may occur. Those are the most common. This med can also cause eye and muscle damage.

Your ideal weight range is between 98 and 123 lbs. You can check it here\nhttp://www.healthstatus.com/calculate/iwc\n\nYou are obviously underweight. Since you talk about very fast metabolism, do you have problems tolerating hot weather, or sweat a lot or have palpitations? These are all features of overactive thyroid and there are many more.\n\nThe second question is have you been well without any health problems because certain illnesses can make you lose weight.\n\nThirdly, there are people who have fear of eating or obsessed with weight loss such as anorexia.\n\nAll three options need a chat with a doctor. If all is well, after the check up then a dietitian or nutritionist or the doctor can point you in the right direction

Steroid hormones are produced by gonad(testis and ovary),  and adrenal cortex.These have a cyclopentenoperhydrophenanthrene ring.Steroids are insoluble in water.Each hormone has a specific effect.
"Bad cholesterol can be lowered and good cholesterol can be raised by:\n\n1.)  Eliminating hydrogenated oils from your diet.  (Hydrogenated oils are those nasty little trans fats that everyone should avoid.  Read the ingredients list on your foods.)\n2.)  Use predominantly olive oil in your cooking.\n3.)  Adding fish oil capsules to your daily vitamins.\n4.)  Taking a niacin supplement.  (I would strongly recommend the slow release kind.)\n5.)  Consume more whole grains such as old fashioned oatmeal or whole wheat breads and pastas.  Make sure it's whole wheat by reading the ingredients. If it says ""enriched wheat"", go onto the next one.  Enriched means that they've removed all the fiber from it and put just a tiny amount back in.  \n\nGood luck!"

New Orleans will never be the same.  Much of the culture and history of it have been washed away forever with the people that were lost, rather to death or moving away.  I heard a statistic recently that stated the percentages of African Americans there went from like 75-90% down to like less than 10%.  That is so sad.  It will be re-built, urbanized, modernized, commercialized...and de-culturalized.  Bottom line.  I have never had the pleasure of visiting there, before this horrendous tragedy--but had always wanted to.  Now, other then assisting in disaster relief--I don't feel it would be the same experience and don't know that I would still want to go.

"Heavy metals, such as mercury have been found, in trace amounts in shell fish and cold water fish, mostly in the North East, due to pollution from years past.

Shorten both naps to about an hour.  Eventually eliminate one of them.
"Rhythmic muscle contractions occur in the outer third of the vagina, the uterus and anus. The first muscle contractions are the most intense, and occur at a rate of about 1 per second. As the orgasm continues, the contractions become less intense and occur at a more random rate. \n\nA mild orgasm may have 3 -5 contractions, an intense orgasm 10 -15.\n\nThe ""sex flush"" (redness) becomes even more pronounced and may cover a greater percentage of the body.\n\nMuscles throughout the body may contract during orgasm, not just those in the pelvic area.\n\nSome women will emit or spray some fluid from their urethra during orgasm. This is often called female ejaculation. \n\nA woman's facial expression may indicate that she is in pain when she is having a pleasurable orgasm.\n\nAt the peak of orgasm the entire body may become momentarily rigid."
If you mean serious whitening, a dentist or over the counter whitening treatments are the best bet.  Whitening toothpastes can help, but won't make big changes.  You can try rinsing with half perioxide, half water twice a day and/or brushing with baking soda with a little water added to make a paste.

Very dangerous.
A diet that is low in fat, low in cholesterol, low in sugar, and high in fiber will help prevent gallbladder disease. Fat, cholesterol, and sugar all contribute to gallbladder disease. Slow intestinal transit can be prevented by increasing fiber in the diet. And eat more vegetables! A British study showed that vegetarians have a lower incidence of gallbladder disease.
I really feel for you, this is a very hard thing to go through.  My family went through the same experience last year with my grandmother.  \n\nMy grandmother had cancer and it basically debilated her. She was unable to walk or do any of her daily living activities.  \n\n\nYou can try to explain to your grandmother that you can no longer provide the care for her that she requires and tell her that you are doing so because you love her and want her to have the proper care and just hope that she will understand.  This will most likely be one of the hardest things you've ever done, but you are doing the right thing knowing she will have the care she needs. \n\nGood Luck and God Bless.\n\nP.S.  I think some of these answers are pretty harsh.  It is a very hard decision and people don't really understand unless they have lived through it with a loved one.   There are situations when we just are not  physically capable of giving the proper care to a person with sickness or illness.  Try not to let some of the responses discourage you.
Light therapy, or phototherapy, is the administration of doses of bright light in order to treat a variety of sleep and mood disorders. It is most commonly used to re-regulate the body’s internal clock and/or relieve depression.\n\nWhen used to treat SAD or other forms of depression, light therapy has several advantages over prescription antidepressants. Light therapy tends to work faster than medications, alleviating depressive symptoms within two to 14 days after beginning light therapy as opposed to an average of four to six weeks with medication. And unlike antidepressants, which can cause a variety of side effects from nausea to concentration problems, light therapy is extremely well tolerated. Some side effects are possible with light but are generally not serious enough to cause discontinuation of the therapy. There are several other different applications for light therapy, including:\n• Full-spectrum/UV light therapy for disorders of the skin. A subtype of light therapy that is often prescribed to treat skin diseases, rashes, and jaundice.\n• Cold laser therapy. The treatment involves focusing very low-intensity beams of laser light on the skin, and is used in laser acupuncture to treat a myriad of symptoms and illnesses, including pain, stress, and tendinitis.\n• Colored light therapy. In colored light therapy, different colored filters are applied over a light source to achieve specific therapeutic effects. The colored light is then focused on the patient, either with a floodlight which covers the patient with the colored light, or with a beam of light that is focused on the area of the illness.\n• Back of knee light therapy. A 1998 report published in the journal Science reported that the area behind the human knee known as the popliteal region contains photoreceptors that can help to adjust the body’s circadian rhythms. The authors of the study found that they could manipulate circadian rhythms by focusing a bright light on the popliteal region. Further studies are needed to determine the efficacy of this treatment on disorders such as SAD and jet lag.

Yes, I think it is.  The BMI (Body Mass Index) charts put out by the government start at 58 inches and 91 pounds. According to their chart you could weigh up to 127 pounds!\n\nIf you weigh a little on the light side through your life, you will live longer for sure.  I am going to rethink the charts after seeing the answers coming in to your question.  Stay light.

My son has the same type of twitches, he blinks a lot and licks his lips.  He has been diagnosed with tourettes syndrome.  Your best bet would be to take him to the doctor and ask about it.  We went through many tests and have it pretty well controlled by meds.  Does he have any other symptoms?  Is he hyper, or still wets the bed??  My son has trouble controlling himself once and a while but, he get better every year and is almost fifteen now.
My friend has MS.  He says that some spice in Indian food helps.  No joke, I think it begins with a C (but I'm pretty sure its not Curry).\n\nYears ago he was taking some experimental treatment this company AutoImmune Inc. was making, but I don't think it worked that well for him.\n\nI'll email my friend and ask him what the spice is and let you know.\n\nAlso, I do know that he had his fillings (in his teeth) removed and replaced with gold fillings.  I believe the gold is supposed to help as well.
What you did is burn your lungs with the strong chemical reaction and just to be on the safe side I would talk to your family doctor.  Just go outside often and get fresh air it should pass, but like you said it's been there for two days i would check with a doctor just to be on the safe side.  Are you able to email your doctor and communicate via email?  Good luck and please keep me informed and hope you are OK.

"Most people think a shoulder separation refers to the actual should joint; the ball and socket.\n\nIt does not.\n\nA shoulder ""separation"" is a sprain of the acromioclavicular joint, also commonly referred to as the ""A-C Joint"".\n\nThe acromomion process is a piece of your shoulder blade that sticks up at the top, and the clavicle is your ""collar bone"".\n\nThis joint can be sprained just like any other joint in the body, and  a sprain indicates that the ligaments that hold 2 or more bones together has been injured.  There are 3 grades of ligaments injury:\n\nGrade 1: Microscopic injury of the ligament without lengthening of the ligament itself.\n\nGrade 2: Partial tearing of the ligament with some lengthening of the overall structure.\n\nGrade 3:  Complete tear of the ligament.  The ligament is in two pieces and the joint is unstable.\n\nThe good news?  Grade 3 shoulder separations typically heal over a few weeks with no long term problems.  They will often end up permanently deformed with a hard bump sticking up on top of the shoulder.  However, this is usually just a cosmetic problem unless you participate in very heavy contact (football, hockey) or intense weight training."
"If diet pills worked, there would be no fat people around.  NO..don't waste your money.  Just by increasing your activity moderately (like 3 times a week) by walking with a partner or on the beach, riding a bike will help.  Spurts like jogging for a few minutes while walking, will help you burn more calories.\n\nStay on a moderate Exchange Diet (look it up) and drop any fast foods, processed foods, ""white"" carbohydrates.  You will also want to watch your calorie intake.  You can lose 2-3 lbs. a week on a 1000-1200 cal diet.\n\nIncrease your fluids and lay off of the sodas.  Good Luck."

I am not sure where you have gotten your information from but please disregard it.\n\nFor starters.... your blood type is inherited from your parents... as are the potential for many other conditions.. like heart disease... diabetes... and others.\n\nType O blood is the most common in the world therefore your statistics for type O blood people having this condition more, can be said that... since most of the population has type O blood it is reasonable to assume that more people who have heart disease will also have type O blood. You would be quite wrong to say that a specific type of blood causes diseases.\n\nInfections in the blood occur when the infection gets in and overpowers the body's immune system. Your blood plays an important role in your immune system by transporting the white blood cells around the body to fight the infection. If you are low on white blood cells then the infection can take over. If your white cells are ineffective against the infection, then the infection can take over.\n\nBut, the type of blood that you have, has no relationship to diseases, or potential problems.
"Well they get my butt going in the morning.\n\nNicotine is a complex drug.  If you need to be up it will help you pick up and if you need to relax it helps you relax.  \nBasically it magnifies the feelings and emotions that you are trying to get.\n\nCaffine is a stimulant and diuretic so if it doesn't get you going mentally it will get you going ""pee"" wise.\n\nThe combination of the nicotine and caffine are real morning starters, that jump start a person and get them going faster.\n\nMetabolically I would guess it would speed up that as well since it seems to be the same effect on every other system."

"Still in medical school, but I'll give it a go.  Approximately 80% of people with esophagitis (esophageal irritation/inflammation) caused by gastric reflux have a non-progressive form that can be managed by  medications and lifestyle modification (losing weight if overweight; avoiding alcohol, chocolate, citrus juice, tomatoes, peppermint; avoiding large meals and waiting for 3 hours after eating before lying down; raising the head of your bed approximately 8 inches).  Medications used basically decrease the production of acid in your stomach and include things such as Pecid, Zantac, and Prevacid to name a few.  Antacids with meals are also a good idea.\n\nThere are a remaining 20% or so of people whose esophagitis will continue (despite medicaitons) to progress and cause permanent scarring which can increase a person's risk for esophageal cancer.  For those people, the best option is surgical.  Surgery consists of a procedure called a Nissen Fundoplication.  This can be done laparoscopically (camera with small holes, small instruments, small scars, quicker healing).  The procedure basically consists of wrapping the upper portion of the stomach partially around the esophagus.  What happens is that after a meal, the stomach fills up, causing the portion of stomach wrapped around the esophagus to tighten up a bit, creating a valve of sorts.  This prevents acid from refluxing into the esophagus.  Assuming all goes correctly, the procedure typically lasts 2-2.5 hours, you go home in 2 days, and you're back to normal more or less in 2-3 weeks.  ~92% of patients have resolution of symptoms.  No surgery is without it's complications,   so do some reading about it if you're considering.  In addition to ""the usual"" (bleeding, infection, anesthesia complications, etc.), it's always possible that the valve they make will be too tight and you won't be able to properly swallow your food.  Rare, but it happens.  \n\nAs for ""irritated stomach"", I would need more information to know what you mean precisely.  Hope this at least offers some answers to one of your questions.  Good luck to you."

I am not a doctor, but I do own a salon.  I refuse to buy a tanning bed for the reason that you have experienced.  The use of medications can cause burns, and even lead to cancer. Please be care full and use sunscreen in the sun every time.  I would suggest to stop using the tanning at all even in the sun.  I know that this is a sad way to live in the summer but you will live longer
Cosmetic Surgery is very cheap in India.There is one company that is very famous in India that arranges cosmetic surgery for foreigners in India.They are called the Forerunners Healthcare.I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories.I have also read that they arrange financing for american and canadian patients as cosmetic surgery is not covered by insurance.\n\nThey also have photos pasted of their International patients.You can checkout their website.The cost savings are incredible.As a doctor i personally believe that your cosmetic surgery can be easily handled in India as the quality of healthcare available here is simply best in the world.The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.If you still havent got your surgery done,you are better off getting it done in India.\n\n\nmy cousin got a couple of plastic surgery procedures through the forerunners healthcare in India and is all praise for this company.She is more than very happy with the results.hoe this helps
"I have D.I.D. and have been seeing a psychologist/psychiatrist since 1992.  I have been in group therapy and it really helped.

3500 calories are in one pound. For example, if you consume an extra 500 calories/day in a week you can gain one pound (500 calories X 7 days = 3500 calories = 1 pound). The reverse is true for weight loss. If you reduce your caloric intake by 500 calories/day for a week you can lose a pound in that week.

wait do you mean 5'4? I could not image you even being alive at 110 at 6'4. But I am assuming you are 5'4 and it is a pretty realistic goal to make. Do whatever exercises you want, anything that you enjoy, hiking, running, tennis, swimming, biking, ect. You should always do at least twice as much cardio than weight lifting. I would suugest doing pilates and maybe yoga to get toned, and also try weight lifting a little. And cardio depending on what you do could be betweeen 2-5 hours a day at least I woud think. Like tennis I do 3-4 hours a day. But running I would only do about 1/2 hour or an hour, but you would have to do more than just running. If you do not want to bulk up do pilates and yoga instead of weight lifting, and just weight lift your arms a little. Running might bulk you up So try tennis or walking, hiking, I dont know I would not worry too much about bulking up, if you are burinig fat at the same time they wont get bigger, they will just get more muscular and less jiggly. Eating habits, dont change them all at once, try eating more fruits and veggies as a snack instead of chips and cookies, and for meals eat whole grains and protein.
not my type.
I got mine a week ago.  You cant feel it at all.  There was a little cramping when it was put in and thats it.  It is easier if you have it done right after you finish your period.  It takes your body 3-6 months to adjust to it so you may spot on and off for thatr long and then after that most women stop having their period as long as they have the IUD in place.  It rocks not to have to worry about taking pills for contraception

"Well depending on your location.. I am from Texas and there are tiny bugs called ""cheegers"" there . They bite wherever something is tight. IE socks, waistband, bra line, etc...

No, you will pass out because you breath so fast you deprive your brain of oxygen. However, once you pass out, you resume breathing normally. Worst that will happen is a nice paramedic sticking a tube or an ammonia inhalant up your nose.
"Oh you poor thing.  I suffered with the same thing for months after the birth of each of my children.  My Naturopathic Physician said it was the anistetic that was causing the reaction in my case and nothing worked.  Diet helped some (no acidic foods),  I also drank lots of water and no alchohol (well, little and extra water on those days).\n\nI had an MD say that he could get me on the list with the best dermatologist in town, but no body really knows exactly what causes hives and all the derm will do is allergy stress tests and tell you to alkalinize your diet (no meat, sugar, etc.) until the problem goes away. I told him that I had success sleeping through the night using Claritin, so he didn't prescribe me anything stronger (I was nursing anyway - I didn't want anything stronger really).\n\nI think that the hive reaction was caused by stress - tremendous amounts of stress brought on by having a new baby, each time.  I think the single best thing I did for myself was turn to Louise Hay to help have a positive and relaxed attitude about my situation and I think that more than anything helped.  According to Louise Hay, hives are caused by small, hidden fears and making mountains out of mole hills.  She says the cure is to remind yourself as often as you can ""I bring peace to every corner of my life"".\n\nThat's what I did.  I tried to relax and bring my own peace to my own life and before long the hives were gone - I hardly noticed.  Someone said ""How are those hives?""  one day and I said ""wow, you know they haven't bothered me for a while"".  I had just stopped thinking of them.\n\nIn the mean time, cold water compresses can help and soaking in a warm epsom salt bath.  There's also a great product called Coral Calcium, you can put that in the bath and in your drinking water to futher alkalinize your system - lots of veggies will too.\n\nTake heart - it will end.  Peace!"
Your plan sounds excellent.  I think you are letting your muscles recover by not weight lifting everyday so there really is no problem with that.  If your plan is working for you, don't listen to what anybody else says!
Protein will help build muscle, if you want to go natural ginsing and hard work will build endurance.  There are many diffrent types of ginsing out there, so you kind the best for you.  If you are in the military, (God bless you), then you know how to run, which is the best way to build the endurance your looking for.  Due to the fact that your body is put through...discomfort, but yet you still have to push on.  that is my suggestion, and please stay safe.

The only problem with this is that often young men don't take good care of their bodies because they believe that they don't need to work out or eat right, so by the time they're in their 40s or 50s the effects from not being healthy show (health problems) when their metabolisms crash! So basically, while your outsides may still look good now, not exercising and eating right will surely catch up with you in the long run. Just because everything looks fine on the outside does not mean that every thing is fine on the inside as well.

"don't know why you would hate people then ask ""people"" this question.  have you ever thought that maybe the reason people look at you is because people like to look at attractive people (even though the attitude sucks, they don't know that just by looking at you).  unless of course you're disfigured then their staring at you might be good cause to become insensed.  after all that is really rude.  but to answer your question,  all i can say is I don't hate people.  hopefully you're the only one who feels this way."

"Having depression before does not necessarily mean that you will have post partum depression. You can have a baby, and avoid the baby blues or depression, even if you have had depression before. Typical depression can be brought on by many different things (loss, stressful situations, illness, exhaustion, chemical imbalances, etc.) Postnatal Depression is thought to be brought on by an imbalance of hormones.\n\nDr. Claire Weekes has written alot on the subject of anxiety and depression. Her books have helped many learn about the causes behind anxiety and depression, and help many overcome the most debilatating symptoms of anxiety and depression to live normal lives. The greatest thing about her books is that she is very reassuring, and the knowledge that she shares with the reader is empowering. I highly recommend her book ""Hope and Help for your Nerves."" It really helped me to understand the source of where my anxiety/depression came from. Also highly recommended is ""Complete Self Help For Your Nerves."" (See URL below.)\n\nBe sure you are getting alot of rest. Sleep deprivation can make you feel out of sorts. Eat a healthy diet and be sure an include some physical activity that your doctor will approve of (I enjoyed water aerobics.) Be sure and have people available to you to help you out with things when your tired, or to talk with when you need to vent. And speak with your ob-gyn about your concerns. I am sure they will have some advice that will help you feel less anxious and put your mind at ease.\n\nGood Luck, and enjoy the arrival of your new little one! :)"

Yes, I see no reason why not. Metronidazole is an antibiotic, paracetamol and ibuprofen are pain killers and all work in entirely different ways. There shouldn't be any problems taking them at the same time.
Because the website was so poorly designed and it takes forever to load.  They closed it temporarily and still didn't fix the loading problems.  Maybe someone in-house thought they could design and published their own web pages.  If not, they should get their money back from the designer.
Neem’s wide variety of reported benefits include use in the treatment of fever, gastrointestinal disease, dermatologic (skin) disorders, immune dysfunction, respiratory disease, parasites, inflammatory conditions, and infections by some bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Some components have been shown to have antimalarial properties. The seeds contain an insecticidal substance that is EPA approved for use on nonfood crops. Some viral diseases have been treated by components of neem. It may inhibit the multiplication of viruses and prevent them from entering and infecting cells. Some of the diseases that have reportedly been relieved include colds, flu, and conditions caused by herpes, such as chickenpox and shingles. Neem appears to be an appropriate treatment for numerous dermatologic indications. Its anti-inflammatory and pain relieving activity make it potentially useful against psoriasis, eczema, acne, dermatitis, and an assortment of fungal conditions. The neem leaf has been shown to have activity that suppresses the fungi that cause athlete’s foot, ringworm, and Candida. Seed oil and aqueous leaf extracts have been used to treat jock itch, another fungal infection. The oil and leaf extract may be applied externally in the form of lotions and soaps. Leaf preparations may also be used internally for the detoxification properties. Poultices made from the leaf have antiseptic and astringent properties that treat wounds and boils. Both internal and external parasites may be sensitive to the effects of neem. External parasites, such as lice and mites, are often treated in India with aqueous extracts of neem leaves. A medical research center in Nagercoil, India, found that a combination of neem and turmeric cured 97% of patients with scabies within 3–15 days of treatment. Teas are used against internal parasites, including intestinal worms. Perhaps one of the most interesting claims for neem is for the prevention and treatment of malaria. Leaf extracts are said to have the same effectiveness as quinine and chloroquine, the conventional medications that are used. Some studies show that even chloroquine-resistant strains of malaria are sensitive to neem, particularly a component called Irodin A. The recommended preventative measure is to chew and consume the leaves on a daily basis. Twigs and leaves of the neem tree may be used for oral hygiene, and neem bark extracts used in toothpastes and mouthwashes are active against gingivitis. Ayurveda holds that neem has healthful properties for teeth and gum tissue. Ayurvedic tradition holds that neem bark improves resistance to disease. It appears that certain carbohydrates contained in the bark do indeed stimulate the production of antibodies. One source recommends a cyclical use of neem to strengthen the immune system in order to lower the incidence of infections, particularly in people who have conditions that compromise the immune system. The long history of the use of neem in India appears to show that there is a low incidence of side effects when used appropriately. Infants have suffered severe sequelae, and even death as a result of internal use of neem. Avoid using neem products on children.\n\nI don't know about Canada's sellers but you may try Ebay or shopzilla

"People say swimming and that would be right, but I'm a cat and hate water!\nI also don't have a gym membership or a convenient gym that doesn't either make me feel ancient beyond my years or make me wonder if there is much logic in driving so stinking far to get exercise...\n\nWhat to do?\n\nGet some free weights and try some of the exercises listed in my sources?\n\nI'm a cat though, so I can't be even bothered to go get cheap weights from Super-Duper WalMart (Replacing your Super WalMart soon!

Ok, so I'm not THAT much of a cat, so I do all these fun modified push-ups, crab crawls, and yoga stuff that's more catlike than masochistic.\n\nOne of the sites below shows a modified push up that involves facing forward and using the hands behind your back to do a push up on a chair or stack of mats called the ""Close Grip Tricep Dips.""

My doc said within 2 weeks as far as protection goes.  I've been using for a year now.  But I never go 3 months without bleeding/spotting.  The first time I went 6 weeks, then had spotting for a few days.  After my first period on it, I went 8 weeks the next time, with spotting for a few days.  But its so much better than having a period every 28 days.  I love it.
The treatment of hydrocephalus involves surgical insertion of a shunt to allow drainage of the excess fluid and relieve the pressure on the brain. The shunt is a flexible, plastic tube with a one-way valve. The shunt is inserted into the ventricular system of the brain to divert the flow of CSF into another area of the body, where the CSF can drain and be absorbed into the bloodstream. Many children treated for hydrocephalus are able to lead normal lives with few, if any, limitations. In some cases, cognitive impairment in language and non- language functions may occur. Problems with shunt infection or malfunction may require surgical revision of the shunt.
ok heres what works for head lice.  you put mayonaise all in your hair you leave it in your hair for 3 to 4 hours with a shower cap over it.  then you rinse the mayonaise out with vinegar.  then wash your hair and towel dry it.  then take the lice comb and go through your hair with it layer by layer.  continue to do this for about a week.  also wash all sheets, blankets, pillows etc that youve had your head on lately
Neosporin can not hurt. There is also a spray that is sold that helps aid in healing. The name of it escapes me right now. You can buy it at any pharmacy over the counter. It is given to women after childbirth to aid in healing of incisions.
The best advice I ever got from a great allergist in Los Angeles was to do nasal washes three times a day.  In health food stores they have little pots that will help.  Use a little sea salt with warm water to flush out the nasal canals.  This helps greatly.  Plus costs little.  Think about  buying a air purifier, not a ozone one though.  Many people who have reactions to pollution will also get reactions from the air going through ozone purifiers. (I spent hundreds and then got really sick only to find out that I was allergic to the way the machine changed the air).   Look on Dr. Andrew Weils site for some good advice and alternatives.

Typically, you won't be considered to have a problem conceving until you have actively tried for a year. Get to know your cycle. A woman's fertile days are usually the day of ovulation and the four of five days before, not after.

eating right is first, fruit, veg, water, milk everythingthat is healthy food. exercises, maybe lifting light weights and usind abs to tone and get right, light runs will help, not eating all day. sit ups and twist sit ups.
Your diet is the main thing. to get to your abs you need the fat off of them. eat low fat foods and do at least a half hour of cardio a day to burn fat. after that different excercises target different areas. the best excercise i've found to work your whole abdominal area is to get a large excercise ball and get in push-up position with your ankles on the ball. pull your legs up to your chest and stretch back to push-up position. you will have to work up to higher repititions as you go because it will hurt you at first. work up to five sets of twenty five reps. leg throws are also really good. lay on your back and have somebody stand at your feet. raise your legs up to the other persons waist or chest and have them throw them back down. you have to raise your legs back up without letting them touch the floor. work up to five sets of twenty five with those also

If you indeed have PTSD you need to get professional counseling. Its not going to go away with medication. Your doctor is prescribing wellbutrin to deal with the depression that the PTSD is causing you. Theres no medication for PTSD, you have to go through therapy, and I strongly suggest that you do, for your own sake and your children. Your problem will only get worse without proper help. If something traumatic happened to you, you need to get professional help to help you deal with it. good luck.
This is true, but only when the iron and tea are consumed at the same time. Tannin, a compound found in tea, interferes with your body’s ability to absorb iron. Experts suggest waiting an hour to an hour and half after taking a vitamin or iron supplement to drink tea.

It's best to lose 1 - 2 pounds per week.  At that rate, you will be losing fat which is what you want to lose.  Also, when you lose slowly, you are more likely to keep the weight off.
First of all, you are tall, so you can carry more weight.  Do you really think you need to lose 20 lbs?  You are correct that one month is not enough time to lose 20 lbs in a healthy way.  \n\nInstead, try this:  Start a well-rounded fitness program.  \nWalk first, then maybe jog until you can do a mile or two per day ( 2 miles = 200 calories X 30 days = 6000 calories = 1.5 lbs lost).  Time spent = 20 minutes.  \n\nNext, do some simple exercises or aerobic routine at a time when you can devote 15 minutes EVERY day.  (if you work up a sweat, you'll burn another 150 calories per day X 30 days = 4500 calories = 1 lb. lost).  Time spent = 15 minutes\n\nFinally, try removing two or three snacks or fattening portions from your daily food intake.  Skip the fries, have one piece of toast instead of two, and eat low fat yogurt or popcorn instead of ice cream (daily calories avoided = 400 X 30 days = 12,000 calories = 3 lbs lost).   Time spent = 0 minutes.\n\nAdd it up.  By devoting 35 minutes per day and a tiny bit of additional will power you're now down 5.5 lbs. in 30 days.  You're feeling healthier and carrying yourself with pride and confidence (That's 90% of a sexy woman right there!).\n\nAnd, if you keep up the routine, you'll be down about 15 - 20 lbs by the end of summer...still warm enough for that bikini!\n\nGood luck.
You will probably need more than one professional to help you with this, depending on the severity of your child's problem. My daughter's problem was quite severe, and we found that we needed both a psychologist for therapy, and a medical specialist who could prescribe meds (because most psychologists cannot). We had recommendations from other physicians, as well as from friends who had also been through it. Even the Yellow Pages may have listings that mention an expertise with ADD or ADHD. You might also check with your insurance company, or even the counselor at your child's school. Whoever you choose, it's important to have someone your teen feels comfortable with, and who has plenty of experience in this area.  You probably already know this, but if not, or for someone else reading this, it's important to realize just how serious this disorder can be. Lack of attention span is just one small part of it, and ADHD can have a tremendous impact on the life of your teen, and that of your entire family. I hope you find someone who can give you the help you need.

I experienced it.\nMy heart is also pounding during the stressful times. The stress test results negative.  Thank God for that.\n\nMy doctor also thought it's panic attack.\nIf you drink coffee, you should cut down a little bit. This is the advice from my doctor and now I'm drinking decaf. It also help walking away from whatever you're doing from time to time to get some fresh air. Last, learn how to relax such as meditation.
"I think Hoodia Gordonii is use for weight loss !here i find some information regarding hoodia that is :\n\n"" Hoodia Gordonii (pronounced HOO-dee-ah) is also called hoodia, xhooba, khoba, Ghaap, hoodia cactus, and South African desert cactus, is a genus in the plant family Apocynaceae, in the part of the family previously treated as a separate family Asclepiadaceae.

don't be wearing thick cotton athletic socks if that is what you have! They absorb sweat, then they start to chafe...and pretty soon you are either blistered or rubbed raw.\n\nGo to your running store and buy thin socks (short on the ankle, usually some design or something on em, and about $6 or $7 a pair) and wear those.\n\nCheck out this site, it shows the type of sock I am talking about...these are a little more expensive than I like, but they are exactly the size and material:\n\nhttp://www.swimoutlet.com/Triathlong_Socks_s/540.htm\n\nRe the blister...take it easy till it goes down. Sometimes if they are small i pop them and wrap them...but bigger ones just need time...
I am going to say no, because the psychiatrist is not with the patient all the time, and if the patient does not let the psychiatrist know how he is feeling, than the psychiatrist can't help.  It is possible that the psychiatrist might be at fault, but this would not be true for all suicides.
Change your routine.  your body becomes accustomed to the same movements over time and becomes more eficent at doing them.  Find new excersises that target same muscle groups or change your hand positions do 5 sets of 5 for a couple weeks then go back to 3 sets of 8-10. take at least one day off before hitting the same muscle group again.
You can buy over the counter allergy medicine, like alavert,benadryl, etc.That will dry up your nose.
Generally – when you ejaculate, you use a portion of the quantity of  available ejaculate that your body has produced up to that time.\n\nIf you want to ejaculate more on a regular basis, then you need to ejaculate more often, and your body will produce more ejaculate on a regular basis, because your body produces what it needs; this is sort of like keeping a larger supply on hand to meet a larger demand.  Our bodies are wonderfully adaptive that way.  It is sort of like working out – the more you lift, the more you are able to lift, and  the same is true for your ejaculate – the more you ejaculate, the more you will be able to.\n\nIf, for some reason, you just want to ejaculate a large quantity at one specific time, or over a short duration, then you can simply “save up” or not ejaculate for a period of days prior to the event where you wish to be able to provide a large quantity all at once.\n\nThis is why girls like myself, who really enjoy semen, and being coated, will often ask guys to not ejaculate for the few days before they plan on seeing us – we want them to save up a lot of semen for us.
Here's an answer I gave someone else.\n\nUse some 10lbs dumbbells to work your biceps. Do like 3 sets of 25-50reps Mon, Wed, Fri or Tues, Thurs, Sat. Get yourself a good jump rope too and use it daily for around 10-30 minutes. Do the following program of bodyweight exercises everyday. \n\nHindu Squats\nHindu Push-Ups\nBack Bridge\n\nTry to go 25-50 hindu squats with the goal of 500 eventually.\n\nTry for 25 straight Hindu Push Ups with the goal of 100-200 eventually.\n\nGo for a 30 second Back Bridge with the goal of reaching 3 minutes.\n\nFor a detailed explaination of these exercises go to www.bodybuilding.com and do a search. Or purchase the book Combat Conditioning at www.mattfurey.com .\n\nFor your abs do 3 sets of 50-100 crunches daily.\nFor your biceps get two 10lbs dumbbells and do 3 sets 20-50 reps three days a week (Mon, Wed, Fri or Tues, Thurs, Sat). You can get the dumbells from a sporting goods store like Dunhams or Sportauthority.\n\nDon't forget to eat a lot of good nutritious food and get 8 hours of sleep a night! Remember to stretch as well! Try the book stretching by Bob Anderson! Be blessed!

"Humans work on behaviors. They are learned and just a part of our personality. What we need to learn is that we all have what we call ""automatic thoughts"". Just use an automatic thought record. That is stop recognize the quick ""automatic thought"" that comes to you first when posed with a situation or conversation, Think about the emotion attatched to it and then think about what you are to do next. That would be the action, what you do next. By keeping a thought record of this line of thinking, over time you will learn to catch yourself before you have a regret, be it a word that was cutting or an action. I hope that this helps. What it all boils down to is ""think before you react"" and understand why you feel the way you do."
Since the meat we have supplied for us by greedy farmers is what can I call it to be polite.....Forced, pumped with various growth-makers, steroids & hormones.  \nPraps you can smell the Alien stuff!\nI haven't eaten meat in years since I found out they're fed Human Waste or fed on Feed fertilized with Sewage!\n& I honesty don't miss it.\n\nI strongly advise you to go Vegetarian, pronto!
Yes, it can.  I have suffered from hemiplegic migraines since I was 12.  I'm now 33.  In January I had the worst attack ever.  I had a hemiplegic migraine for 2 weeks consecutively.  I ended up going to the emergency room for treatment twice during that time.
I broke my finger years ago. I kept ice on it all night to numb it. Then I went to the doctor and he put a splint on it and wrapped it all up. But, I would defenitely put some ice on it to get rid of the pain.
Swimming in the pool is fine, wear the tampon. Make sure you keep the string hidden from embracing you. You will not produce enough blood to harm anyone, the chemicals will disinfect any leakage. Also remember not to take and use a white towel, use a darker colored one to help conceal and leakage when drying off.\n\n Special Note: when scuba diving if a lady is on her period sharks will not be drawn to them. Blood expelled is dead not what sharks sense,
because of the fluid they put in.  \n\nSome shots have more fluid and some of the fluids are thicker than the others.  The more and thicker the fluid, the more it displaces muscle tissue in your are.  That is what causes the pain to last.  The needle stick itself doesn't hurt for long. The fluid it self can also cause stinging.\n\nSome injections dissolve in fat and some in muscle.  The bigger the muscle the less it hurts
it wont go away just like that! you need to try Abreva. its kind of pricey but it works, it usually take 3 to 4 days
you may be anemic, go to the doctor. In the mean time take iron supplements.\nAlso what do you mean by irregular. To long to short  A cycle can be 28 days or 50 days everyone is different.
Orthotricyclen-lo. Not as much estrogen as regular, so no weird mood swings or weight gain. They say you can have break-through bleeding in the middle of the cycle, but I haven't had that problem. However, all estrogen/progestin pills can cause migraines, and I am having them. But I can't prove that's the cause. Also, it's kind of a pain to have to get a prescription, but it's better than yucky condoms.
"not a doctor, but I guess that the teeth is like the feeling you get when your leg falls asleep and then blood rushed in and it feels weird.  As an adult it sucks, but as a kid it felt cool!  I think the nerve in the mouth is shallow and the and the antitussive is numbing them and the sensation she feels is feeling coming back.  Second the chest could be the same thing.  It probably the flem in the esophagus sliding back in to the lungs tickling the hairs/fimbrea that normally sweep up toward the mouth.  Or it could be an allergic reaction.  I get that same ""tickling"" when I eat a certain type of salsa.  I think its the preservatives.\nI am all about the herbals, but I'd rather try over the counter if my kid is having a reaction to herbal meds."

I worked in a doctor's office for quite a few years and we had a patient who was afraid to swallow her own saliva, she thought it would kill her.  She walked around with a kleenex and was constantly wiping the saliva off of her mouth.

Well i don't know about me judging people who do this. But i wear diapers my self but its because i have to i don't have that choice. I have seen a lot of people on the net that do like to wear them but I guess it would be like any other fetish. If that's your thing then more power to you. As for me well I am use to wearing diapers but its not like I want to wear them I don't have a choice. I try to understand all peoples feelings and not judge them for what they like to do . If someone wants to wear diapers for fun that's up to them NOT me. In fact it has nothing to do with me. If someone i knowed was to tell me that liked to wear diapers I would just say well i am Glad you do but i don't. But i woulden put them down or anything for doin it just except it i guess.

Try this Prana yama breathing exercise, focus your attention on your breathing, ascertain wether you are a upper thorax (shallow breather) or a lower thorax ( deep breather). Most people who suffer from stress and anxiety, will probably find that they are shallow breathers.\nNow sit up straight, adjust your posture to a comfortable position and focus your attention on slowly breathing in deeply, (remember, when you fill a glass with water it fills from the bottom upwards, So should your lungs), as you continue to breathe in you should start to feel first the lower thorax expanding and then the upper thorax expanding, ( do not try to force to much air into your lungs as this may cause discomfort), hold the breath for about 4 seconds and then let your self exhale slowly. Try to achieve a breathing rate of 6 seconds inhalation and 4 seconds holding then 6 second exhalation. Do this exercise for  a few minutes or for as long as is comfortable for you.
I have to go like that also, and have been doing that for quite some time. I have gone to my doc about it, but everything was fine. I have come to the conclusion that I also may have a small bladder...and laying off caffeine does help a bit.
personally i love sally hansen hair remover in the pink bottle. you put it on thickly, spread it around, let it sit for eight minutes ( i do my nails while im waiting) and then sit on edge of the tub and rinse it off and the hair comes off no problem and youre silky smooth!    just so you know, for some reason, if i use this product right before that time of the month, i seem to break out to the product. maybe that skin is more sensitive during then, i dont know. but if i were you id avoid it right before your period.
A few simple precautions can reduce the risk of foodborne diseases:  \nCOOK meat, poultry and eggs thoroughly.  Using a thermometer to measure the internal temperature of meat is a good way to be sure that it is cooked sufficiently to kill bacteria.  For example, ground beef should be cooked to an internal temperature of 160o F.  Eggs should be cooked until the yolk is firm.  \nSEPARATE: Don't cross-contaminate one food with another.  Avoid cross-contaminating foods by washing hands, utensils, and cutting boards after they have been in contact with raw meat or poultry and before they touch another food.  Put cooked meat on a clean platter, rather back on one that held the raw meat.  \nCHILL: Refrigerate leftovers promptly.  Bacteria can grow quickly at room temperature, so refrigerate leftover foods if they are not going to be eaten within 4 hours.  Large volumes of food will cool more quickly if they are divided into several shallow containers for refrigeration.  \nCLEAN: Wash produce.  Rinse fresh fruits and vegetables in running tap water to remove visible dirt and grime.  Remove and discard the outermost leaves of a head of lettuce or cabbage.  Because bacteria can grow well on the cut surface of fruit or vegetable, be careful not to contaminate these foods while slicing them up on the cutting board, and avoid leaving cut produce at room temperature for many hours. Don't be a source of foodborne illness yourself.  Wash your hands with soap and water before preparing food.  Avoid preparing food for others if you yourself have a diarrheal illness.  Changing a baby's diaper while preparing food is a bad idea that can easily spread illness.  \nREPORT: Report suspected foodborne illnesses to your local health department.  The local public health department is an important part of the food safety system. Often calls from concerned citizens are how outbreaks are first detected.  If a public health official contacts you to find our more about an illness you had, your cooperation is important.  In public health investigations, it can be as important to talk to healthy people as to ill people.  Your cooperation may be needed even if you are not ill. 
I'm a recovering cocaine addict. Whenever I feel like blowing money on a sack I go shopping. I buy something nice for myself with the amount of money I would have spent on drugs and while I am buying it the urge to get high subsides because I realize the nice things I can have by not doing drugs.  \n\nI know all guys need toys, it's in their nature. Next time go buy yourself some stereo equipment or something nice for your car instead. Trust me it works.\n\nGood luck on your sobriety

"My question to you is why do you feel you have to act like that to\nyour counselor?  Don't you think he/she ever heard this before?\nIf you are uncomfortable with your counselor - I would suggest\nyou change him/her.  I have had multiple counselors - I had one\nguy tell me I was causing my problems!  I walked out of there,\nwent to his supervisor & I changed immediately! He was very\nerrogant & I didn't need his crap.  You need to find someone you\ncan be 100% with - or it won't help you.\nI have a female counselor now - I am amazed at how much she\nlistens and how much she cares!  Last yr. when I turned 50 - she\nactuallly ""sang"" happy birthday to me on my answering machine,\nbecause she didn't see me that day!  My God!  what a difference!\nI am still seeing her, I often feel that even if no one else gave a\ncrap - at least ""she"" did.  And believe me, you can't tell them anything they haven't heard before!  Why do you think they are in\nthat profession?  Obviously nothing is new??  I am not sure of how you feel, but believe me - if you can't take it and you are\nputting on a mask - how are you helping yourself?  You need to be 100% honest or you will never get better!  Take it from me -\nI've been in counseling for my depression since 1986 and I go\nonce a week.  It sure helps me!"

"Please consider trying other things besides Xanax to help you sleep and to reduce your anxiety.  For one thing, Xanax is very addictive, and is not recommended for long term use.  For another, it's really not the most effective sleep aid, if that's how you are using it.  \n\nI have two recommendations for you and I hope you will at least look in to trying them.  I have tried both and would swear by them as they have worked wonders with both anxiety and insomnia.\n\nOne of the best things I've found that helps me go to sleep at night is a supplement called melatonin. ""At night melatonin is produced to help our bodies regulate our sleep-wake cycles. The amount of melatonin produced by our body seems to lessen as we get older. Scientists believe this may be why young people have less problem sleeping than older people.""\n\nIt has other added benefits like strengthening your immune system. You can buy it at your local health food store, a GNC, Vitamin Shoppe, or online at any vitamin store. It HELPS you get to sleep, it doesn't knock you out or anything, and it doesn't leave me with that ""sleep hangover"" you get from Nyquil.\n\nAs far as anxiety is concerned, a doctor recommended that I try taking the supplement GABA, and I have not had problems with anxiety since then. I have found that it makes me feel calmer and more in control without feeling stupid, sleepy, or drugged. I would strongly, strongly recommend that you give it a try. i have also tried valerian root and did not find it particularly beneficial, but the GABA has truly worked wonders. I have since heard from other friends who have had similar problems, and some of their doctors have also recommended they try GABA.\n\nI wish you the best of luck."
This sounds to me like a classic herpes virus infection.  These are very common.  Shingles is a form of herpes called herpes zoster but I think you have Herpes simplex.  The only way to know for sure is to get checked when you have a fresh outbreak.  A doctor can do a Tzanck preparation which is essentially a free test, they just take a sample and look under the microscope after the slide is stained.  If you want to get high tech, you can ask for a viral pcr test of a fresh lesion.  These are extremely accurate but a bit more expensive.  You may be able to go to a free STD clinic for their expertise.  Although this is not an STD problem, those doctors are pretty skilled with skin conditons.  Good Luck!
I'm struggling with the same issue! Definately exercise AND diet effect every lb.  Make sure if you are on any medication for hypo, that you take it in the morning 1 hour before you eat or 2 hours after you eat.  I kind of see it as a jump start.  Then, write down EVERYTHING you put in your mouth.  At the end of the day, see how you could have chosen better for the day!
"My friend and I have this conversation often. Sometimes you get the feeling like ""Is this all there is?""  THere are days I am completely content and so thankful for all I have...a loving, caring husband, a beautiful 9 month old son that I adore, a wonderful family, and a job that I...well, Love is a strong word...LIKE! \nBut, then there are days I wonder what if???\nI think it is human nature to always wonder what else is out there. And if you had made different choices where would life have led you? Very deep huh? :)"

Depending on how severe it is, you should consult a physician.  It can leave permanent scarring.\n\nYou should wash it (before blisters break out) and keep it from being exposed to sunlight for up to 2 weeks. \n\nCold compresses are recommended.\n\nHere's a site that talks about it, somewhat. Mostly the 2nd half of page 1, continued on page 3.
Of course they DO see it and understand America's appetite for the stuff that instantly satisfies the senses of the average person.  Why do you think they've been around for so long.  They make money off this type of food.  I choose not to eat there and you have that choice also.
funny you should ask...i just had arthoscopic surgery done last friday...in much the same way that they would do the rotator cuff...mine was dislocated and they fixed the cartilidge to prevent it from happening again...\n\nit's a big decission - but not that the surgery is over, i'm so glad i did it...\n\ni was in much of the same situation as you were...limited mobility....above my head...but, was still healing from the dislocation...\n\ni have minimal pain - and today being 4 days after, haven't takenthe pain meds at all...my mobility is pretty good...i do have a sling, and will have to do some physical therapy in a week or so, but the doc tells me that after that my mobility should be back to almost normal.....\n\nsling is only going to be on for about 10-14 days...\n\ni work as a counselor for people in 12-step programs - i'm assuming that your fear is for the drugs afterwards?  i;m sure if you spoke with the surgeon he could figure something out...don't use it as an excuse.....\n\nanyway...not sure if i helped or not...in my opinion the surgery isn't as bad as i expected it to be....and only 4 days later it is already feeling ok...\n\ni'm only 32 and didn't want to feel disabled the rest of my life - reaching the top shelf...washing my hair, etc...\n\ngood luck with your decission....
Mine is 14 and a half inches unflexed. 18 inches flexed.  Hope that helps.
Most likely this is not a result of the fresh urine, but the urine that has remained in the gallon jug over time.  I suggest that you have a urine test from your physician to rule out the possibility of infection, especially if you have any other symptoms.  You probably should not be keeping urine in a jug either, as it could become a breeding ground for all sorts of things.  \n\nAlso, certain foods can affect the smell of urine, so if you have been eating anything different, take that out of your diet for a few days and see if it helps anything.\n\nGood luck...see a doctor first to rule out any possibilities, but you are probably okay!
You have what your doctor would call menorrhagia - excessive menstruation or vaginal bleeding.  The causes are varied. It could be due to fibroids(more common in blacks), endometriosis(the lining of the uterus is called the endometrium), infection, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, rarely endometrial cancer and a host of other reasons eg. if you have a bleeding disorder.\n\nYour doctor needs to examine you and would also probably organize an ultrasound scan to check everything is OK. You may also need blood tests to be sure you are not anaemic.\n\nSee the doctor as early as possible. The good news is sometimes no disease process is found and you are simply given medication to reduce the bleeding!
dont be sad my friend. its all about who GOD want you to be with. dont let the devil discourage you. Pray to GOD and he will send you a woman that will love and cherish you and you will love and cherish them. So the next time you ask a question put a smily face up there. the only ones that needs to be sad are those that dont let JESUS in their lives.
Are you on the King Kong diet? If so, yes.
I am sorry for your dilemma. My son had been sick as an infant and had to use a nebulizer for awhile.\n\nI think you cannot ask them to not smoke in their own home. You can however, not allow him to go over there. You as his mother have a responsibility to protect your child. Your husband should be backing you in protecting his son. Even if they quit smoking when he is there, the fact that they smoked in the room BEFORE he got there is going to affect him too. \n\nIt's affecting your child's life. How can your husband not see this?  I don't understand it. I hope he sees the light soon. Your son is suffering from it.
yes. they use laser to take it out. it also costs more.
Try not to use the hairspray and try one of the more expensive shampoos such as L'orreal (with conditioner). Also when washing, be gentle, don't use your fingernails (just the finger-tips), and use cooler water.
Typically your doctor will tell you 6 weeks, which is when you are supposed to go back to the doctor for a checkup.  During this visit he will let you know if it is ok.
"so a ""normal"" bp is 120/80, however, like body temp, peoples blood pressure runs differently. If you can function normally, without dizziness, fainting then your blood pressure is ""normal"" for you. are you athletic? people who are athletic usually have lower bps than those who are not. Was your bp extremely high before? I think you are just fine, and I would have your bp monitored at regular doctor visits, or if you start to feel faint and dizzy"

Flat coke is great for helping with a poorly tummy.  Put a teaspoon of sugar in it to make it flat but make sure that it's in a large container as it will froth up loads.\n\nGuinness is also good but it isn't to everyone's taste!  (and it can make your poos black!)
When was the last time you had a physical?  It could be a number of things.  You may have high blood pressure or something as simple as a sinus infection.  I strongly suggest you go see a doctor as soon as possible.
Self-injuring WILL escalate over time, because the longer you do it, the deeper you need to injure in order to get the same effects you did at first, when maybe a shallow cut or wound would be enough.  One girl I knew injured herself to the point where she had to get her entire arm STAPLED.  I don't know if you know much about medicine, but we do not usually staple a wound closed....usually it is sutured.  The last time she nearly severed her jugular (a very large and important vein in your neck).  She's just lucky she didn't hit the carotid artery.  She would've bled out if paramedics hadn't hauled her off to the hospital in time.  I'm not trying to scare you, I'm just telling you that it's the nature of the disease.  The longer you do it, the deeper you have to cut yourself to make it hurt.  If it doesn't hurt, you can't feel better.
Not really genetic.  As we get older our throat muscles get flabbier so they vibrate more.  Also, if your mom has gotten heavier, not unusual as you get older, she'll start snoring more.
It is still normal to not have a period yet.  If still no period at 16 then you should see a doctor.

"The problem with diabetes is that in a medically underwritten state, someone with diabetes is usually declined.  There is no ""partial"" diabetic; you either are or you're not.\nUsually you can get Blue Cross Blue Shield as they accept anyone (guaranteed insurability), however you will pay higher rates then normal."
ok im not a doctor, but i do suffer from bi polar disorder, formally known as manic depression.  for me anyway, anti depressants made me violent, so i would not take anything a doc has not prescribed.  there are many mental illness clinics all over the US. i dont know what state you are in, so i cant help you there.  if you have to, go to the emergency room, tell them your freakin out, and they will find someone that can help you.  no they wont lock you up.  i have had thought of suicide, and thoughts of killing peoople, and i have not been locked up.  its a normal part of my illness.  i have never gone thruogh with any of my thoughts.  lithium has helped me tremendously, but only under direct doctor care.  it has many horrible side effects, that if adminsitered correctly, can be subsided by raising or lowering dosage, but only a doctor can do that correctly.  please, get medical help.  forget your family, mine still believe that i'm a spoiled brat, and i only do the things i do for attention.  too bad for them, that they will never get to know the real me.  too bad for them, that someday they may have an affliction, and no one will be there for them either.  take care of yourself, and pray.  find jesus, because he is the only one that can help you get through this terrible journey of getting better that you are about to embark on.  its a bumpy road, but when you get past the dark side of it, its wonderful on the light side. its worth it, i promise!
yes my best friend is
"Use a product called ""Certain Dri."" I think it's either in the deoderant section or medicine section. It's as strong as the ones that doctors prescribe, but u dont need a prescription. It's doctor recommended too. Don't worry. Excessive perspiration is normal. I have it and it used to show a lot and smell even tho I wasn't doing anything either, but then I heard about this product. U must continue to use ur regular deoderant, but use certain dri at night. It's this roll on liquid that u roll onto ur armpits right before u sleep. It minimizes the size of the pores in ur armpit so u sweat less. Try it! I'm sure it will work for u. I spent years wearing triple layers of t-shirts to try to hide the sweat and smell. Not anymore! It's available at almost any store. Try walgreens or walmart.\n\nP.S.\nIt doesn't matter wat deoderant u use because they don't work. I've tried secret (it's the worst! it  doesnt even help at all!), Mitcham (which actually stops u from sweating, but it smells really bad), Dove (weak!), and now I'm on Ban (it's ok). Just use any deoderant u want, but make sure u use Certain Dri at night. It has worked for millions of ppl including me. There are NO side effects."
"I had the same problem when I was first put on it...the first two weeks were hell. My therapist said it can take up to 6 weeks for it to regulate in your body.

For your sex and height, your ideal weight is 135 pounds but the ideal weight range is 127 pounds to 159 pounds. So you see you are just one pound over the range so you are hardly overweight.\nhttp://www.healthstatus.com/calculate/iwc\nYour weight does not just depend on exercise and diet. They are very important and other factors such as genetics, medical conditions, hormones and drugs come into play as well as your mental state. Some medical conditions are related to infertility such as hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome etc.  I think you need to have a chat with your doctor if you want to do something about your weight although as I have shown above, you don't really have a weight problem yet.\n\nI agree with your mates that you look fine. Is your husband backing off because of your weight or because there are no kids? I think you need to have a good chat  and thrash that out. He is supposed to stick by you through thick and thin and so far as you are not doing anything to wreck the marriage, he has no excuse for his behaviour.\n\nAlso remember that true beauty is not just your looks. People will be attracted to you because of your character, how warm you are, how friendly you are etc.\n\nLastly, don't let anyone put you down. You may have gained weight but you are not overweight. \n\nAll the best. If no one loves you, God loves you so forget about everyone else!
What is the treatment for scabies?\n\nSkin lotions containing permethrin, lindane or crotamiton are available through a physician's prescription for the treatment of scabies. The lotions are applied to the whole body except the head and neck. Sometimes, itching may persist but should not be regarded as treatment failure or reinfestation. Persons who have had skin contact with an infested person (including family members, roommates, direct care providers and sexual contacts) should also be treated.\n\nWhat can be done to prevent the spread of scabies?\n\nAvoid physical contact with infested individuals and their belongings, especially clothing and bedding. Health education on the life history of scabies, proper treatment and the need for early diagnosis and treatment of infested individuals and contacts is extremely important.
tell everyone to love their neighbor the same way they love themselves and those close to their hearts.  that is a very simple thing to say and easy to laugh off but think about it, if everyone on earth honestly did that  how could we have any problems at all?

From what I have been able to gather online, she was a member of online anorexia-related forums.  From what I gather, she was from Japan, and posed in a number of anorexia-related pictures that are still circulating online.  It seems as though she died as a result of anorexia nervosa.

It was the rest of your period, the blood had gotten old and so tuerned brown.  My guess is that you are new to this brand of pill and maybe it's just not the best one for you.  I was like that on the depo shot, I never stopped spotting for the 3 months I was on it.  Give your doc a ring and ask about getting switched to a new pill or method, best wishes
All cigaretts are just as addictive and the brand doesnt matter.  Just dont smoke and you have no worries.

At the school I teach at some kids can go into Anaphylaxis shock from the strangest things and they don;t even have to touch them (just be in the same area in some instances):\n\nLatex, fish, excersize, foods, nuts, medicines etc.\n\nBut there are some cases that no reason or link can be made -\n\nUnknown: A substantial proportion of sufferers have no cause found despite all efforts, even in the most expert clinics. Doctors call such unexplained attacks 'idiopathic anaphylaxis' The word 'idiopathic' in practice means we don't know the cause. Worrying as it is, death from this is very rare indeed. However, there must be a cause or causes. Some cases are bound to be simple failure to find a cause and I always regard this diagnosis as provisional, but if a recognised allergy specialist has given you this label it is unlikely that another specialist will do any better. The explanation is NOT psychological in the vast majority. So in most cases this is a disease for which medical science has not yet discovered the cause. Some top experts who have studied hundreds of patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis believe that it is a disorder of mast cells, causing them to release histamine and chemicals with similar actions too easily. There is an excellent book on this condition, quite short, and intended for doctors and patients. Title: 'Idiopathic Anaphylaxis', edited by Roy Patterson, Published by OceanSide Publications Inc, Providence, Rhode Island, 1997, ISBN 0-936587-10-5.
You might need to go to an Orthopedic surgeon. My dad had the same problem, but thedoc said really nothing could be done except draining the knee once to twice a year and munching on salt tablets; that was 15 yrs or so ago. There are new advancements in medicine everyday, so do try a surgeon.

Wouldn't that go under health? As for an open forum for it, search around on the web, I'm sure you'll find one.\nAnd if you have epilepsy, and you're asking for yourself, stay strong, my mom has/had it and recently underwent surgery for it.

Sounds like an optical migraine.  I get those sometimes.  I have to lay down in a dark room and just wait for it to go away.  Sometimes it lasts for a few minutes and other times it takes hours.
I'm not gonna lie..it will be tough in the dating scene. Unfortunately people are very superficial.  You're very brave though! I don't know if I could do that. Make the best of it. Be confident and people will be attracted to that. Show your inner beauty.
It can hurt the first couple of times if your partner has a good size ****. But it will stop hurting after you get use to it. But you should relax and take your time, don't rush in this sex thing. But if you do start to have it on the regular bases then you will become more use to it and then you can in joy it without it hurting you.\nHope this helps.
Water is preferred for dehydration, but a sports drink would be absolutely fine.

I had this for over a year before i was brave enough to go see a dr. I have polycystic ovaries and have had the cysts removed. I am now on birth control which helps prevent cysts from growing back.
Relax my dear for you have just expierenced female ejaculation.  Many women expirence this and most are not aware of it but it is caused from the G spot being stimulated.  \n  The released fluid is not urine but an alkaline liquid secreated by the paraurethral glands. The paraurethral glands produce an enzyme called prostatic acid phosphate and glucose.  These substances are found in much higher quantities in female ejaculate than in urine. The fluid from the paraurethral glands is released during orgasm as a result of pelvic muscle contractions. This occurs from stimulation of the G spot.\n  So relax and let the juices flow.  For more information about the G spot check out  www.The-Clitoris.com.
PMS symptoms may be relieved by avoiding caffeine, sugar, salt, white flour, red meat, dairy, butter, monosodium glutamate (MSG), fried foods, and processed foods during the two weeks prior to menstruation. Food that help to fight PMS include steamed green vegetables, salad, beans, grains, and fruit. To obtain essential fatty acids (omega-3 and omega-6) women can eat flaxseeds, sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, salmon, mackerel, and tuna.\nA variety of herbal remedies may alleviate symptoms associated with menstrual problems. These include:\n• black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa): mood swings,tension, establishing ovulation (an important source of\nphytoestrogens). The German Commission E, however, states that women should not take black cohosh for menstrual problems for longer than six months because of the risk of side effects.\n• black haw (Viburnum prunifolium): cramps\n• chamomile (Matricaria recutita): mood swings, tension, and cramps\n• cramp bark (Viburnum opulus): cramps\n• dandelion (Taraxacum dang gui): fluid retention and bloating\n• dong quai (Benincasa cerifera): PMS symptoms, cramps, irregular cycles, heavy bleeding, or bleeding in between cycles\n• fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum): irregular bowel movements
You should consult your doctor before beginning any vigorous exercise program, especially if you are very out of shape.  But you can begin with light exercise such as walking.  Just make sure to start with a walk for about 15 minutes, and then rest.  If you can't catch your breath after a minute, then you need to slow down.  Note that this is assuming you do not have any knee, hip, or back problems.

Below are a few articles by John Berardi.  He writes articles for t-nation and is considered one of their leading experts on nutrition.  His massive eating diet is what your looking for if you intention is to properly increase calories in order to put on muscle.  I've also included a link to a calculator on his site that will help you figure out how many calories you need.\n\nIf you check my answers in this category you'll see that I often link to t-nation's website.  I don't work for them, I've just made the best gains of my life following their guidelines.  I think they have the best information out there and I'm just trying to spread the wealth.
You'll probably get addicted to the gum, but at least it smells better and won't stain your teeth.\n\nCold turkey is the best way, but you already tried it. Oh well. Could you at least go three days? Just get to day three and it's all gravy from there. Chew regular gum and have a lot of snacks handy. You might gain a bit of weight :)
hang in there- it gets better. be sure to keep the extraction sites clean by swishing salt water gently to remove food particles

well, im physically endowed on that category so my opinion maybe tarnish a little bit. \n\ni have one child, that was 2 decades ago, but my boobs is not saggy or look gross. i can walk anywhere without wearing a bra and im the envy of others. i guess its hereditary that im proudly appreciating my maternal genes. its not that im bragging, my husband always telling me that i should be glad cause its natural, he said, some buy theirs and it don't look normal. some men is scared to touch it if they found out that its not real cause they do not want to damage it or hurt that person if it cause them some harm. so other who prefer to have it, just be cautious and find out all the necessary details so you will be aware of what to do just in case.\n\nregarding fake boobs, that's your own prerogative and if it makes you feel great why not. a lot of people who can afford it, wanted to have it done to add attributes on their personal appearance. some do it for their own satisfaction and some to benefit their loved ones or other half.

"My dad always told me to walk away too.  He always told me to not be the one who started trouble.  But he also told me not to ""run away"" either.  His exact words were, if you cannot reason with them or walk away from them, then pick up a stick and knock them in the head.  In other words, do what it is going to take to win quickly and be done with it.  \n\nOf course I remember mom and dad being a bit miffed when I followed this advice literally and used a fallen pecan branch on the head of a kid who was picking on me. (That kid never messed with me again though.)\n\nA few years later, after we had moved to another town, there were three guys at school who bullied me for a while.  I finally had enough and got one of them alone one day.  Frankly, I went berserk on him.  One of the best days of my entire life.  The next day at school I managed to get one of the others alone behind the gym and had a repeat performance.  The third guy avoided me like the plague.  The knots that had been in my stomach since I arrived in that miserable little town were gone and I was able to once again concentrate on school and play and being a normal kid.  \n\nIt is worthwhile to remember that in every school shooting situation I can remember hearing about it was always a kid who was picked on for a long period who wound up being the shooter.\n\nThere is really only one way to deal with a bully and that is to kick their a$$ properly and with prejudice.  They are usually not expecting it since probably no one else has ever stood up to them and they really are not practiced at handling such a situation.  Once usually cures it.\n\nIf you fight a bully and lose the fight you have still won.  Assuming you inflict as much pain on him as possible in the process.  You still win because he will think twice about the value of coming after you again.  If he knows it is going to cost him every time he will turn his attention elsewhere.\n\nWe do live in a different time than when I was a kid, no one brought knives or guns to school back then.  But the principle is the same.  When you walk away from some jerks, they just take it as a sign of weakness and close in for the kill, so to speak.\n\nUltimately, only you can rear your child.  The best you can do is open your eyes wide and make the best judgment call you can.  I wish you well."
All of them... just leave the lights on. If you turn the lights off you'll be in total blackness... empty, lost, and without protection...\n\nThat's not true. Just stop watching those silly movies before you go to bed and quit playing those wild video games. Plus, try to eat a balanced diet -- junk food can mess with your dreams as well. Also, play some relaxing music, no rap or metal, before you sleep. \n\nActually, when I was young I used to have wild dreams. Some of them were very scary... I am not going to go into any Freudian enlightenment here but, once you face the cause of your fears, or stop growing physically,  the bad dreams fade away quickly to sleepy world of wonder and adventure.  \n\nGood Luck and enjoy.

A propioreceptor indicates muscle activity and the awareness of the body and its relationship with the surrounding environment is mediated by sensation.\n\nThe input to the brain stem about this information ( feel sick, scared and dizzy) emanates from the joint and muscle proprioceptors ( such as theone located on your neck), the vestibular centers in the ears, and from the eyes.
Yes it totally does.  It won't make you hungry either, eat every few hours 200 calories.  You will loose weight.  Limit caffeine after 2:00 pm  or you won't be able to sleep

Please make a doctor's appointment.  This is not normal so you have an issue that only he/she can diagnose.
the best way to do it is to start from kissing her lips(on her face) then slowly work ur way down and tease her by making her think ur about to put ur mouth on it then lick and kiss her thighs ever so gently and then work your way in and kiss the outside gently then lick it lightly and suck her lips(down there) gently but kissing it at the same time. then u put ur tongue in side her lips and just lick it slowly then move ur tongue up and down really fast on her clitoris in a circle and then suck it and keep repeating it...lick suck lick suck and in about a minute she bust
Don't cut it off... Like the other 2 guys before me said you might try stretching it... I am uncircumcised and I have stretched it a little bit yeah it hurts a little so I would suggest try inserting 2 fingers if you can try slowly spreading you fingers... I know of this one guy no kidding... fit eight fingers in there he told me he started with 4 fingers. But if stretching doesn't work for you you might want to get circumcised (sex should be enjoyable).
"I think that would be a dangerous area to step into really.  I can't picture having all these people flying around everywhere in the air........ and can you imagine running into each other up there?  People would be falling from the sky literally.......lol.

Masturbation is not harmful. It is quite natural. If anybody says he / she has not masturbated, they are lying or they have some physical problems.\n\nAnd it has no side effects. \n\nMasturbation becomes a problem only  when you worry about it. That will cause stress and  stress leads to many ailments. \n\nHope this will help set aside your apprehensions.

ivakaty doesnt know what he's talking about. \n\nI've heard of body builders who take in 400+ grams of protien daily. Rule of thumb for lifting weights, try to get your bodyweight in protien daily. So you weight 200 lbs, take in 200 grams of protien. The only side effect i know of is that it makes you fart alot and it smells really bad
Get an interest in something..even if its diets for beauty, or the life of a Band or pop star...and when you have something you are an expert at, you get confidence..\nBeing too self absorbed is what makes you lack confidence...you need to get an interest in something beyond yourself... Working as a volunteer with orphans or sick children is a real eye opener, and you will realise there is more to life than just worrying about getting fat.\nAvoiding all junk food and not drinking fizzy will make sure you stay healthy while becoming involved outside yourself
My husband did about 2 years ago.  He only took it for about a week because they made him dizzy, nervous, shaky and nauseaus.  He actually gained weight during that week, and felt terrible,  It's just not worth risking your health!
No.  Its an anti-inflammatory like Ibuprofen.  It is possible to overdose on it, but it will not cause you to go unconscious and loose memory like a typical date rape drug does.
Yes it is
I don't think this is possible! And may I be so bold as to wonder why you would like to do this? Or is this just a theoretical question?
Nothing over 102 f. and don't stay in longer than 10 minutes.  Be especially careful towards the end of your pregnancy it is easy to fall!  And don't forget, no bath once your water has broken!  The amniotic sac is broken and it puts you and your baby at risk for infection.  Good luck and congratulations!  =)
Typically the bacterial infections (chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and trichomoniasis) take anywhere from a few days to a month to show symptoms, if they show symptoms at all! Most of these won't show symptoms for a few months, so someone could be spreading it without knowing they are doing so. FYI - trich doesn't show symptoms in men most of the time, only women. \n\nThe viral infections are different. Herpes, HPV (genital warts), HIV/AIDS, and Hepatitis are all viral STD infections. Herpes and HPV usually show symptoms within a month, while HIV and Hepatitis don't typically show symptoms - sometimes for years at a time. The only specific testing information I know is for HIV - it takes about 3 months before a test can MOST EFFECTIVELY detect a level of antibodies in your system. If you are worried about HIV infection, make sure that you abstain from any risk behaviors (unprotected sex, sharing needles, or unprotected contact with blood, breast milk, vaginal secretions, or semen)  for 3 months before getting tested. \n\nIf you're worried about any STD exposure, go to a doctor or clinic and get tested. They will talk to you about your risk behaviors/level and they will be able to answer more specific questions for you. \n\nBest wishes!
Some people are allergic to certain colors...  usually reds.  Try a over the counter cream, like hydrocortisone.  If this doesnt work, I hate to say it.. but it may need to be removed.

this depends on how old you are because if you are between 15 and 30 years old 45 kgs is too light and may be at risk of becoming anorexic if you are trying to put on weight i suggest you see a doctor 65 kgs is a more healthy weight and a doctor will be able to help you do it healthily 20 kgs is a lot to put on in two months cant understand 'pounds' that's too hard to work out i think 5 pounds equals 2 kgs good luck see a doctor
"why not take a more diplomatic approach and try to find ways to get her to run after you begging you for it? Examine your own approach and see what ""incentives"" would work for her that you could use to your advantage....lots to read between the lines here but the bottom line is do you know what pushes her buttons? if not, then the answer lies within you..just dig in and try to find it."
hello, how old are you? you shud be glad that its doing something. if your talking about how small it is when erect, thats another story.
no the most you should lose and still be healthy is 2 pounds a week
"the dentists in uk generally have a choice as to whether they work all privately, all NHS (national health service) or a combination of the two. the only time dental treatment is provided ""free"" in the UK is for people on benefits, children or pregnant or nursing mothers. Even if the patient opts to have the treatment on the NHS there are still scales of charges dependant on the treatment provided. Private dentists would obviously charge a good amount for their work and this combined with an acute shortage of NHS dentists is one reason why many people in the UK do not have the standard of oral care that they themselves may wish for. This is generally as a direct consequence of the governments new contracts issued to dentists over the past few months that has caused many of them to opt for a mainly private practice. So, yes, we in the UK may not have the best teeth around and again I say, blame Tony Blair and his idiotic ways pf administering a Health service that was professed to be ""free from the cradle to the grave"" by his Labour predecessors that originated the health service back in the 1940`s.\nIncidentally we pay a tax known as National Insurance that is supposed to cover health care expenditure,so it is not really free anyway."

There are alot of factors those charts don't take into consideration though, such as breast size, butt size, muscle and fat ratios.  The world would be pretty plain without curves.  Don't put too much stock into weight charts.  :)
eat a healthy, high fiber, nutrient dense meal plan and EXERCISE for at least 30 minutes a day increasing to 60 minutes a day.  depending on your height and activity level, i would say you shouldn't be eating more than 1,800 calories to lose weight.  i am 4'9 and to lose weight, i need 1500 calories and to maintain my weight, i need 2000 calories and i'm a fairly active person.  try eating a variety of bright colored fresh fruits and vegies every day along with high fiber oatmeal, cereals, wheat bread/pasta, low fat fiber chips and popcorn.  eat heart healthy nuts, about an ounce a day and skim or soy/ dairy products. try eating more lean chicken and fish and try cutting out most red meat. eat 3 moderate meals a day along with 3 snacks to help keep your metabolism revving.  watch what you put on your pasta and potatoes...use salsa, light sour cream, etc. and watch how much you put on your food.  condiments can be tricky.  drink plenty of green tea, black tea, red tea, and water.
Yes..  the music was too loud.  The next time you go to a club wear some ear plugs.\n\nI'm not sure the mechanism by which this happens but it has happened to me before.  It may be a few days before the ringing goes away.  Also, prolonged exposure to loud music or sounds can cause permanent hearing damage....so wear ear plugs.
great use lots of lube in and outside and start slow then well, your on your own.
I can't help you with the question really, but I did want to say that many researches done have shown that P&G aren't cult worshippers, nor do they support such practices.  I placed a few links below, but typing in Proctor and Gamble and cult in together in google will give you a number of listings.  It says many of these rumours were started by Christians, which appauls me, as I'm a Christian, and I'd hate to think that other Christians would be so judgemental and quick to gossip.  :(

I have large hips too, but the thing is i am very skinny and there isn't any fat, it's just all bone and i highly doubt, there is a way to slim down bones....
Funny you should say that you hit it like a volleyball, I had this same injury from a volleyball. My diagnonsense,...in simple terms I bruised the bones, pinched a nerve (thus that lovely tingling sensation that will abate after a day or so), and broke a cluster of blood vessels, thus the resulting lump.  Do not fear, it will heal, but it will be mildly painful and aggravating for the next week or so depending on how fast you heal,...I found that putting an ace bandage on it worked fairly well to keep me from strainign it. \n\n  And as with most things like this, the injury will fade, but the embarrasment seldom does,...hope you had better luck then me and just hurt your arm,...because at the time of my injury I dived for the volleyball and my pants split straight up the back,...hehehe

Urticaria, commonly known as hives, is a frequent complaint of patients in the ED. It consists of circumscribed areas of raised erythema and edema of the superficial dermis. Urticaria can be acute or chronic, and a variety of urticarial variants exist, such as hereditary angioedema and anaphylaxis. \n\nBy definition, the acute form of urticaria lasts less than 4-6 weeks, and the chronic form lasts more than 4-6 weeks. Although the treatment for urticaria is specific and straightforward, the list of causes is extensive. When a patient presents with acute urticaria within 24 hours of onset, a cause often can be determined. However, in many cases of both acute and chronic urticaria, the cause can be difficult or even impossible to determine. Thus, although the determination of the underlying etiology of urticaria represents a diagnostic challenge, the management of urticaria remains straightforward and generally successful.\nPruritus (itching) and rash are the primary manifestations of urticaria, and hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation are rare. Acute urticaria is usually self-limited and commonly resolves within 24 hours but may last up to 4-6 weeks. Chronic urticaria lasts more than 4-6 weeks. Neither acute nor chronic urticaria results in long-term consequences (other than depression) or death

No. The type of fat in a fat-soluable vitamin is not the same as the type of fat that creates excess weight or weight issues.\n\nYou do, however have to be careful not to overdo fat-soluable vitamins because they can become toxic to the system as they are stored and not flushed.

"Genital herpes (HSV-2) is passed from direct skin to skin contact. Even if you had no sores at the time she gave you a hand job, you could possibly be ""shedding"" the virus. So, I guess if she gave you a hand job and then rubbed her hand on her genital area, theoretically she could get the virus, although that is highly unlikely. \n\nThe best thing she can do is to wash her hands extremely good after she did that to you. Herpes simplex virus 2 has also been known to cause cold sores, which is usually herpes simplex virus 1, even though it is pretty rare. As long as he washed her hands good, and didn't touch her genital area or her mouth after wards, she should be okay."
Talk to your local Mental Health Organization they might be able to help your friend.  Or look in the yellow pages for Homeless Shelters too.  Ask questions and find out as much as you can about the facilities that are out there for homeless individuals.  Don't settle for a place if you know that he won't be happy with.  If you still come up with nothing, then you could ask local churches.  Sometimes they can be of assistance too.  Good luck to you and your friend.\n\nDepending on what your friend is facing in his life will depend upon how willing he is to change his life.  Don't make decisions for him though, you can guide him and support him, but he is the one that has to make the final choice.

Yes, there are absolutely other options than prescribed medication. I myself have grown up with depression and anxiety. For a number of years my doctor had me on all types of anti depressant medication. Though medication can help there are many other options available. If you wanted to go a different route, there are natural supplements which you can buy at most healthfood stores or even online. I have found they can work just as well if not better than prescribed antidepressants. Supplement you should look into are things like St. Johns wart, 5-HTP, SAM-e and believe it or not Omega-3 fatty acids can also really help.  I take 5-HTP instead of prozac which is what I was on and I believe it works just as well, if not better.\nI have also recently come across a product called mind soothe which looks to be very promising http://www.nativeremedies.com/mindsoothe_for_depression.shtml\n\nAs well as taking suppliments..because in reality there is no miricle pill...you might want to try yoga...it can really help\n\nBefore you make any decisions you should talk to your doctor. I hope I was of some help :)
i honestly have had those in my life too... but i do not have herpes at all... and they go away... but you can get herpes my oral sex... also i think if you have been around someone with herpes and used the restroom after they did maybe you could of got something that way... but mine went away and i have never had a venerial disease and chances are you do not either... the best thing to do is to go to the doctor.. i  know you do not want to do this and i would not want to tell my mother either...but that is what are mothers are for... it may be hard but my mother has meant so much to me... i got pregnant at 17 and i just thank god for my mother....i really feel for you to and i know this is something that is really upsetting you... but the best thing to do is to relieve yourself of the worry... talk to your mother or go to a free clinic or some place in your town that will help you.. a lot of times they even do it confidential....hopefully you have a friend you can trust to take you somewhere or maybe even ride a bus... but all in all it would probably be best to confide in your mother...my mother has been wonderful and i hope yours will be too...if you were my daughter i would just take you to the doctor and find out what is wrong.. she will be very relieved herself to know you can talk to her and that you have not been having sexual inercourse with anyone...women have to go through so much it seems to me.. when you do start having sexual relations be sure you always use protection and hopefully you will wait until you can handle the responsibility and with someone that loves you....

"Hi,\nI understand your concern and imagine that you would be alarmed at what you said is happening to you.\nFrom what I understand, you just reached puberty (14?), and at this time, when your body's getting adjusted to the changes that launch you into womanhood, a lot of different confusing things can happen all at once.\nIt is not entirely unusual when a woman's periods are just getting started, to have some irregularities...missed periods, unexpected periods, prolonged periods...e.t.c. The cycles that happen at this time are known as ""anovulatory cycles"", and the hormonal changes taking place are responsible for these.These changes are different for different women.\nChances are there's nothing wrong with you, and there's no reason to be alarmed.\nIf you see a doctor, he'd probably not do a pap smear, as this is usually done to screen for diseases you most likely, given your age and apparent innocence, do not have. He'd probably take a  more detailed history, and may examine you to be sure there is no other reason why you're having the problem. Such reason could include foreign body (like tissue etc) in your vagina, or other incidental reason why you're bleeding, and also may include bleeding disorders. This would however be unlikely if you do not have a history of bleeding much after minor injuries or under the skin resulting in discolorations.\nI hope this was helpful to you. This is however no substitute to getting medical opinion on your health."
the only sure way to find out is to see an eye doctor.  it's only human nature to rub when things irratate our eyes & if something was in it you may well have scratched it.  if the object is still in your eye you will need an eye doctor to find & remove it.  if the eye is scratched, there are special drops that relieve your pain.
watch what you eat! if you want to lose weight fast then i suggest you eat nothing but grilled lean meats and drink tons of water. lean meats have very few carbs and carbs is where you gain a lot of weight. the water flushes your body. you can throw in a few steamed veggies for variety and eggs for breakfast. watch out though if you are on this diet for an extremely long period of time it can be dangerous, but with a little excercise and this diet you will lose the weight. my g/f lost 20 pounds in 2 weeks on that diet
yeah dont worry everyone gets it at different times it all depends on your body...i know some people that didnt get it until they were 16
I see that most of the people who answered your question don't watch the news.

Try stimulating yourself during intercourse. You will get yours and your man will be incredibly turned on from watching you. The best position for this is you lying on your back and him between your legs, kind of like missionary, but on his knees. If you aren't comfortable with him watching at first, do it doggy style and just reach back there (this is also a great way to stroke his scrotum, just the touch will drive him crazy.) Some women just can't orgasm without clitoral stimulation and there is nothing wrong with doing WHATEVER it takes to get yours!!

High doses of Vitamin B6 (300 milligrams or more per day) for long periods of time (greater than 6 months) in a few people has caused peripheral neuropathy.\n\n100 mg/day is considered safe.  I do not know why your doctor is recommending B6 for the treatment of your chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy.  I just did a 'quick' search of Pubmed (where the world's medical research can be reviewed) and found several studies showing the supplement Acetyl-L-Carnitine may be effective for the treatment of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathies.  This might be a better 'bet' than B6.\n\nYou can read these studies by going to Pubmed (enter 'entrez pubmed' in your search engine).  In the search window of Pubmed enter: 'chemotherapy peripheral neuropathy Acetyl-L-Carnitine'.  You may want to share these studies with your doctor.\n\nBest wishes and good luck.

"Sometimes keeping a food diary can help. Sometimes we don't remember how much we have snacked on during the day. The food diary can help you see if you are snacking excessively or help you see a bad habit. \n\nIf snacking is your problem you can look into a couple of options. You can cut down on your snacking or plan for healthier snacks. Don't drastically change your diet unless you know that you can stick with it. Otherwise you just gain all of the weight back because you go back to old habits. Just change a little at a time. Try having two ""healthy meals"" a week. Something as simple as having grilled food, instead of something fried. \n\nAlso, to lose weight you really need to do some type of exercise. Find something that you enjoy doing. You will be more likely to stick with it. Maybe walking, swimming, yoga, dance, aerobics. Just whatever you find interesting. If you bore easily you may want to try doing more than one thing. For instance, walking with friends on Monday and Wednesday, yoga on Tuesday and Thursday. The next week try dance on Mon. and wed. and aerobics or Tues. and Thurs.. You just have to find what works for you. The most important thing is to keep it fun and interesting. Take time and try some new things!\n\nI hope these suggestions were helpful. Good luck and just keep the faith in yourself. You can do it. You just have to decide that you are ready to."
So do you want to have strong abs, or visable abs? \n\nRemember, that everyone has abs. But, everyone also has a layer of fat over them, some more than others. You need to enforce a low fat diet for them to be visable to the eye. Keep up with the situps, pushups, flutter kicks, leg lifts, etc and get on the low fat diet and you'll eventually see them.\n\nDon't get discouraged though; your abs are some of the hardest muscles to make visable to most people. Just keep working at it.
Depression can lead to other things that can kill you. Aside from suicide itself, depressed people tend to have eating disorders- either too much or too little (each bringing with it its own set of problems) and sleeping disorders- either too much or too little (again each with its own set of problems). Depressed people turn to drugs and alcohol to cover the pain- again we know the problems these carry with them.  Depression can take over your life making you dead inside long before a physical death comes to you.
Well, they can smother you if you're breathing them in large quantities (just like many other gasses).

Your poor son. I really think you should seek a second opinion. I was having a very difficult time controlling my sugar too. I didn't even know I was a diabetic until I landed in the hospital with Diabetic Ketoacidosis. My sugar and ketones were in the 500's and I was very sick! When I got home from the hospital, I tried to follow the diabetec diet I was given, but it just did not work. It wasn't working in the hospital either. Anyway, I started testing my sugar before I ate and 2 hours after. I discovered that any kind of grain, even the tiniest amount, would send my sugar soaring! My sister, (whose husband is a doctor) told me to get a book called The Schwarzbein Principle. I did, along with  The Schwarzbein Principle Cookbook and have been doing fine since starting on her program. My 14 day average is in the 90's and I have been able to reduce my insulin (also Lantus) substantially. The pain in my legs and feet is almost nonexistent now. I think it would really help you too. Keep in mind that pain, stress and certain medications can also raise blood sugar levels. Different foods effect people differently, so be sure to test your son to see what is spiking his levels. Ask your doctor how to adjust his Lantus, as small amounts can have a profond effect. I hope this helps you and your son. I know how difficult this must be for both of you. Best wishes.

Sure .. a woman is capable.. sexual abuse isn't just about a man forcing a girl/woman to have sex...  sexual abuse involved anything that one person does to another person against their will that involves any kind of sexual act... touching..  making somebody remove their clothes for the purpose of looking at them... making the person touch the one doing the forcing.. and much more...  so, if this woman made your friend touch her..  or she touched your friend.. in any manner considered sexual, it's sexual abuse.. that includes kissing.. and can include some types of hugging...  could be in some countries the laws are somewhat different... but I believe in Canada and the USA, the laws are similar. I hope your friend files charges if she really feels she was abused.

No I wouldn't harm my friends. I have lost people to many different causes and it is hard to take. Somehow we move on. But in reality we cannot afford to find cures for all the major diseases because as sad as it is its natures way of keeping the population down. Look at the amount of deaths in the world each day, then look at the amount of births.  If you cure all then eventually it would do more harm then good. Or nature would create another new disease.

Unfortunately the answer is no. You cannot control what area of your body will lose fatty tissue. All you can do is maintain sensible eating and exercise habits and as your body loses fat overall it will come off of various portions of your body according to some unknown metabolic factor.\n\nOne tip for losing weight is to know that it takes 15 to 20 minutes for your stomach to signal your brain that it is no longer hungry. When you know this fact, you can eat less and not feel like if you stop before you feel full then you are going to remain hungry until you eat more.
If a rectal exam was normal, your doctor may repeat the PSA test to see if it remains high. Results from this test do not confirm a diagnosis of prostate cancer. Other conditions can raise a PSA level including an enlarged prostate, an infected or inflamed prostate, or prostate biopsy or surgery. Further testing may include a transrectal ultrasound. A tissue biopsy is needed to make the diagnosis of prostate cancer.

The Chlohexidine by far.  It is a prescription mouthwash.  It is an antimicrobial rinse, which kills bacteria, most importantly the bacteria that accumulates into plaque and that is what usually irritates the gums and causes inflammation and bleeding.\nI would not recommend Listerine for a few reasons, most importantly because it has 22% alcohol, that will sting and end up drying out your mouth.\nI also don't recommend rinsing with hydrogen peroxide, just too many bad side effects possible. (ever heard of black hairy tongue?  yep the name explains it, it is an overgrowth of the papillae, a possible side effect of hydrogen peroxide!).\nDid you have just a routine cleaning or did you have periodontal treatment?

Generally, nutritional labels go off of the 2,000 or 2,500 calorie diet.  So, if you need more or less calories, you need to adjust.\n\nIt really depends on the person's metabolism and activity level.  \n\nEven body type cannot determine how many calories a person needs each day. For example, a big guy may have a slow metabolism, and conversely, a small guy could have a high metabolism.  A person with higher metabolism needs more calories a day and vice-versa.\n\nAlso, the more active you are, the more calories you need.  Because, you will be burning up calories through your cardio exercises.  In addition, you probably have more lean muscle mass which burns calories as well.\n\nI personally aim for 2500-2700.  I have a fairly high metabolism and I am pretty active.

Try this for a start, the go on to a well balanced diet and regular exercise.  This does work.......\n\nBASIC  FAT  BURNING  SOUP\n\n6 large green onions                                    2 green peppers                             \n1 or 2 cans of tomatoes [crushed]              1/2 bunch of celery                                 \n1 large head of cabbage                                1 pkg. Lipton onion soup\n4 cups of water\n\nSeason with 1/4 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. pepper, 1/4 tsp. curry, 1 Tbsp. parsley, if desired or bouillon or hot sauce. Cut vegetables in small to medium pieces and cover with water. Boil fast for ten minutes.  Reduce to simmer and continue cooking until vegetables are tender.  This soup can be eaten anytime you are hungry.  Eat as much as you want, whenever you want.  This soup will not add calories.  The more you eat the more you will lose.  Fill a thermos in the morning if you will be away during the day.  If eaten for indefinite periods you would suffer malnutrition.\n=============================================================\n\nDAY ONE:  All fruits except bananas.  Cantaloupe and watermelon are lower in calories than most fruits.  Eat only the soup and fruits.  For drinks; unsweetened tea, cranberry juice, or water.\n\nDAY TWO:  All vegetables.  Eat until you are stuffed with all the fresh, raw, or canned vegetables.  Try to eat green leafy veggies and stay away from dry beans, peas, and corn. Eat along with the soup.  At dinner time on this day, reward yourself with a big baked potato and butter.  Do not eat any fruits.\n\nDAY THREE:  Eat all the soup, fruits, and vegetables you want.  Do not have a baked potato.  If you have eaten for three days as above, and have not cheated, you will have lost 5 to 7 pounds.\n\nDAY FOUR:  Bananas and skim milk. Eat as many as 8 bananas and drink as many glasses of water as you can on this day along with the soup.  Bananas are high in calories and carbohydrates and so is the milk, but on this particular day your body will need the potassium and \nthe carbohydrates, proteins and calcium to lessen your craving for sweets.\n\nDAY FIVE:  Beef and tomatoes.  You may have 10 to 20 ounces of beef and a can of tomatoes or as many as 6 fresh tomatoes on this day.  Try to drink at least 6 to 8 glasses of water\nthis day to wash away the acid in your body.  Eat the soup at least once this day.\n\nDAY SIX:  Beef and veggies.  Eat to your heart's content of the beef and vegetables this day.  You can even have two or three steaks if you like with the green leafy vegetables, but no baked potato.  be sure and eat the soup.\n\nDAY SEVEN:  Brown rice, unsweetened fruit juices and vegetables. Again, stuff yourself.  Be sure to have the soup at least once today.\n\nAt the end of the seventh day, if you have not cheated on the above diet, you will have lost 10 to 17 pounds.  If  you have lost more than 17 pounds, stay off the diet for two days before resuming again from day one.\n \nThis seven day eating plan can be used as often as you like.  As a matter of fact, if correctly followed, it will clean your system of impurities and give you a feeling of well-being as never before.\n\nAfter only seven days of this process, you will begin to feel lighter by at least 10 and possibly 17 pounds, having an abundance of energy.  Continue this plan as long as you wish and feel the difference.\n\nThis diet is fast, fat-burning, and the secret is that you will burn more calories than you take in. It will flush your system of impurities and give you a feeling of well-being.  This diet does not lend itself to drinking any alcoholic beveragesat any time because of the removal of fat build-up in your system.  Go off the diet at least 24 hours before any intake of alcohol.\n\nBecause everyone's digestive system is different, this diet will affect everyone differently.  After day three, you will have more energy than when you began, if you did not cheat.  After\nbeing on this diet for several

For example a 2005 Cadillac Escalade ESV and about 5 more cars and Jet skiis etc. That money is all yours. But contact your lawyer because he should be communicating more with you if you are asking questions on the web when you're paying him.

I've heard of times when a person's thyroid test came back looking basically okay, but there's a sub-clinical problem that won't show on a blood test. I think they do a thyroid biopsy, and can get answers from that. Also, you could have a sleep disorder- yes, you're sleeping, but maybe not getting enough restorative sleep. Depression can cause fatigue. And chronic fatigue syndrome (which I was diagnosed with) could be the problem, but is not something that there's a test for yet, and there's no real cure for it at this point. I think a vitamin B deficiancy can cause fatigue too. And untreated diabetes, but that would have other symptoms too, and may not cause the tiredness after a few hours of working. For more chronic fatigue info. maybe try this link:\n\n\nhttp://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/chronicfatiguesyndrome.html

Be friendly, don't flirt, focus on making your beauty the internal kind.  Be honest, but kind.  Strive to do the right thing in every situation.  And don't talk about yourself.  Just be interested in whatever anyone is saying and ask questions about them.  Take the focus away from yourself and make it on other people.  Because everyone is  most interested in themselves, showing interest in them gives them the cue that you care about what they (even secretly) love to talk about most.  Even if you have to pretend at first, you will be pleasantly surprised to discover that you really WILL become interested in other people.  An exercise in humility.
Wow..........I think that sounds quite beautiful especially on beautiful dark skin. It's funny that you would ask this question because I use to work with a gentleman a few years back who was from Africa and he had red hair, pail skin with freckle's. I mentioned to him that I had never seen a black man with red hair and he told me that everyone in his tribe, back in his home country, all have red hair.\n\nApparently somewhere in your ancestry, you may have family originating from this tribe. I'm sure you know that we carry all of our ancestors gene's. It's the dominate gene that gives us our characteristics. \n\nDon't fret, there is nothing wrong. We all (Black's) come from Africa. It's just real sad that we can probably never find out where our true home land may have been because of slavery separating families.\n\nStay sweet and strut that red hair.

I agree with your doctor, you're only 15 now, your hormones are all over the place, and your chest will need the extra space once your upper body muscle starts growing in....but...\n\nIf you have to ask this one again at 18 or 19, I'd go to a doctor, have my blood tested for hormones.  Really.  Hypo-gonadism is no joke, and neither is hypo-pituitary syndrome.  You did say you were tall though, so if it continues to be an issue in 3-4 YEARS from now, check to make sure your body is producing enough testosterone.\n\nYou may, if you can afford it, also wish to have a combined blood/sperm test for chromosomes....a small number of guys are born with Klinefelter's syndrome, which basically means they get an extra X sexual chromosome, being an XXY male instead of the normal XY.  But that is really rather rare.\n\nAnd like I said, you are too young to sweat it now....give it a few years, if you find yourself having chest/breast issues as you get closer to 20, that is when you need to look into it.
Somebody please drop kick the girl who answered this question before me.\n\nWhah  Whah Whahhhhhhh...Geeze, it's a joke. Get over it\n\nAnyway, to answer your question.  No. I don't dig in my butt in public, even if my booty crack is itching...Matter of fact, my booty crack never itches.  So the next question for you is why does yours? LOL\n\nBTW, Don't let uptight heifers like that chick, discourage you from posting a joke or two here and there. It makes the community more interesting for those who actually do come here for fun
I'm unclear as to your test. If you are referring to the urine microalbumin (normal ratio of microalbumin to creatinine is 0-30), then 66 mean that the kidney has started to spill protein. This is the earliest stage of diabetic kidney damage. If not already on it, Hubby should be started on an ACE inhibitor (enalapril, lisinopril, captopril, etc.). These meds have been proven to delay/prevent further kidney damage. Of course, good control is always essential.
Without trying to sound like a jerk... you are either REALLY screwed up or your doctor is...\n\nThose three drugs are VERY serious medications and if you are taking ALL of them at once... WOW.\n\nWe are talking Andrea Yeats, Son of Sam, Geoffry Dahmer, Charles Manson kind of perscriptions here... Risperdal, Lexapro and Seroquel are major major drugs and I am not exagerating.\n\nIf you do not think you are 'psychotic' or abnormal... you do not hear voices, or you do not see things that are not there, I SERIOUSLY suggest you get a second opinion from another psychologist.\n\n-----------------------\nFYI:\n\nRisperdal is prescribed for the treatment of schizophrenia, a severe mental disorder that can cause delusions (false beliefs) and hallucinations. It is also used for the short-term treatment of mania associated with bipolar disorder. Risperdal is thought to work by muting the impact of dopamine and serotonin, two of the brain's key chemical messengers. \n\nRisperdal may cause tardive dyskinesia, a condition that causes involuntary muscle spasms and twitches in the face and body. This condition can become permanent and is most common among older people, especially women. Tell your doctor immediately if you begin to have any involuntary movement. You may need to discontinue Risperdal therapy. \n\n\nLexapro is prescribed for major depression--a persistently low mood that interferes with daily functioning. To be considered major, depression must occur nearly every day for at least two weeks, and must include at least five of the following symptoms: low mood, loss of interest in usual activities, significant change in weight or appetite, change in sleep patterns, agitation or lethargy, fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or lack of concentration, and thoughts of suicide. \n\nLexapro is also prescribed for generalized anxiety disorder, a condition marked by excessive worry and anxiety that is hard to control and interferes with daily life. To be diagnosed with this disorder, your symptoms must have lasted at least 6 months and you must have at least three of the following: restlessness, fatigue, poor concentration, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbances. \n\nSeroquel is prescribed for the treatment of schizophrenia, a mental disorder marked by delusions (false beliefs), hallucinations, disrupted thinking, and loss of contact with reality. It is also used for the short-term treatment of mania associated with bipolar disorder. \n\nSeroquel is the first in a new class of antipsychotic medications. Researchers believe that it works by diminishing the action of dopamine and serotonin, two of the brain's chief chemical messengers.
Yes. Some people are obese because of irreversible genetic disorders or adverse side effects of medication. For most people, which is 95% of obese people have no excuses. They eat too much of the wrong kinds of food and don't move enough. Ask a triathlete how much he/she eats, and you'll know that calories isn't an issue. It's about eating the right kinds of food, and treating food like fuel. In fact, endurance athletes are notorious for carb-loading. Obesity is about lard, over-consumption and not enough activity. Go out and cycle or run. IT works. I lost 30 lbs in 6 months that way without counting anything.
Many things, but probably a bladder infection or STD. Check it out with your Dr.
they are more comfortable than they look and better than those diapers.\n\nThey come with picture instructions but i will tell you any how\n1. take rapper off\n2. there is an applicator wich you put half way \n3.then u push the bottom half up (it makes the cotton inside the applicator insert in your vagina)\n4. then pull the applicator out (the plastic part)\n5.whats left is a string hanging out and thats what you use to pull it out when you change it\n\nI suggest trying pearl tampons first they are the easiest and smallest to slide in comfortably untill you get the hang of it

Here are some beginning hints. See a dietitian for more advice. Stir-fry foods in tiny amounts of oil and lots of seasonings. Choose nonfat or low-fat selections, such as nonfat or 1% milk or low-fat cheese. Keep portion sizes on target. Avoid fried foods -- bake, grill, broil, or roast vegetables and meat instead.
that depends. does anyone in your family have diabetes or hypoglycemia? true hypoglycemia is rare. more often then not people abuse thier bodies by eating crap and then get surprised when their blood sugar crashes after eating that crap. or people go without eating for extended periods understress and they crash and also assume its hypoglycemia. any and all hypoglycemia is diet controled. usually having a piece of fruit or some other high fiber low gi food every hour prevents me from getting the shakes. if i get the shakes its not very long until i go into shock if i dont have something to increase my blood sugar. my grandfather has diabetes and i inhereted hypoglycemia from him. if you suspect you are hypoglycemic go to your doctor. they can find out for sure.

Gonorrhea, a highly contagious sexually transmitted disease (STD), is one of the most commonly reported diseases in the United States, with more than 350,000 cases each year.\n\nSometimes referred to as the clap, gonorrhea often is characterized by thick discharge from the penis or vagina. However, many people experience no signs or symptoms.\n\nThe bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae, also referred to as gonococcus, causes gonorrhea. The disease spreads through semen or vaginal fluids during unprotected sexual contact, heterosexual or homosexual, with an infected partner. The more sexual partners you have, the greater your risk. An infected pregnant woman also can pass gonorrhea to her baby during delivery. Casual contact, such as kissing, doesn't spread the disease.\n\nAbout three out of four reported cases of gonorrhea in the United States occur in people younger than 30. The highest rates of infection often are present in 15- to 19-year old women and 20- to 24-year-old men.\n\nTreatment for gonorrhea involves a course of antibiotic medications to eliminate the infection. Practicing safe sex is important in preventing gonorrhea.\n\nyes you can catch it....
Yes it does. Penicillins are eliminately primarily through kidney excretion into the urine.  Your urine will smell just like the pills... a wonderful bitter moldy smell.  It shouldn't mean anything at all.
You have to pay $40 each time you get a presciption filled, but there is no yearly minimum you have to reach in out of pocket expenses before the insurance kicks in.\n\nFor example, If you have a $50 deductible and $10 copay, you would have to pay $10 each time you got a presciption, but first you would have to spend $50 of your own money on presciptions.  Then you would pay just the $10 copay and the insurance would pick up the rest.\n\nDeductible is how much you have to spend of your own money before the insurance will cover anything.\n\nCopay is the portion you pay once the insurance starts covering costs.
"Ask your doctor to check ALL of your hormone levels. Your body releases hormones all the time...it's just about the only constant in the human body. So that's where I'd start. Then you can try allergy medicine...could be sinuses...If there would not be any drug/drug contraindications, next sign of a headache take Benadryl. If this works...it's your sinuses.Whatever you do be persistent and DO NOT let your doctor treat you like a ""head case"". Pain is real whether the doctors know the reason for it or not!"

Deep Steam inhalation with vicks vaporub helps a lot. You can do this at home no need to buy the personal steam inhaler. You can put hot water in a small mouth jug, add vaporub into in and put your mnose in the opening and cover your head with a towel and inhale deeply. \nOr buy the personal steam inhaler. \n\nIf your sinus head ache is due to sinus infection -- you should get your doctor to prescribe you an antibiotic.
"I cant really tell what you are asking...\n\nAre you saying that you dont want to work or....\n\nOk as far as negative thinking; A wise woman once told me ""Never let a negative thought stay in your mind for more than 3 minutes.""  So the next time you find yourself thinking negatively, you need to become aware (aka selfaware) and put a STOP to it.  \n\nYou are the only one that can controll you and your thoughts.  So if you HONESTLY want to put a stop to it, you need to use will power and just Stop what it is that you are doing.  \n\nAs for work...You're NEVER going to become successful if you have a negative attitude.  People don't like hanging around negative people.  No one is going to want to be around you if you bring them down.  \n\nSo if you want to be successful, win friends, and influence people, you must become the person that you youself would like to be around. Only you have the power to change.  \n\nNext time you find yourself thinking negatively, look at you watch, give yourself 3 minutes, and get over it!\n\nGood Luck!"

See a doctor, ASAP.\n\nHome preg tests can be wrong, you might have a sexually transmitted infection that is fooling the results.

Yes, it has mutated and IS contagious between humans.  For the H5N1 bird flu virus strain to become a serious threat to human health it will need to mutate further. At the moment it does not infect humans easily, it very rarely jumps from human to human. However, if it infects a human who already has the normal human flu, it could then exchange genetic information with the human flu virus and acquire the ability to transmit from human-to-human easily - a new mutation. Then, we could be facing a serious flu pandemic that would spread around the world within a matter of weeks.

I agree... There are lots of people that would try to take advantage of vulnerable people. \n If you want to know a secret, psychiatrists do little more than listen to you, and repeat what you say in different words.

The exact cause of mouth ulcers is unknown, but in some cases they are thought to be caused by an overreaction by the body's own immune system. Factors that appear to provoke them include stress, fatigue, illness, injury from accidental biting, hormonal changes, menstruation, sudden weight loss, food allergies and deficiencies in vitamin B12, iron and folic acid. Some drugs, such as nicorandil, have been linked with mouth ulcers.\n\nMouth ulcers are thought to form when the body becomes aware of and attacks chemicals which it does not recognize. The presence of the unrecognized molecules garners a reaction by the lymphocytes, which trigger a reaction that causes the damage of a mouth ulcer.\n\nTrauma to the mouth is a common cause of mouth ulcers. Physical trauma, such as toothbrush abrasion, poking with sharp food, accidental biting, or dental braces can cause mouth ulcers by breaking the mucous membrane. Other factors, such as chemical irritants or thermal injury, may also lead to the development of ulcers. However in many cases, the precise cause is unknown.\n\nA common cause of ulcers is gluten intolerance, in which case consumption of wheat, rye, or barley can result in chronic mouth ulcers. If gluten intolerance is the cause, prevention means taking most breads, pastas, cakes, pies, cookies, scones, biscuits, beers etc. out of the diet and substituting gluten-free varieties where available. Artificial sugars, such as those found in diet cola and sugarless gum, have been reported as causes of mouth ulcers as well. They can also be linked to an increased intake of acid such as the acidic form Vitamin C or citric acid. In this case the sores disappear after intake decreases or a non acidic form of the vitamin is taken.\n\nOther disorders can cause mouth ulcers, including oral thrush, leukoplakia, gingivostomatitis, and oral lichen planus. Mouth ulcers are also associated with ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, coeliac disease (gluten sensitivity), bullous pemphigoid, and Behçet's disease. Repeat episodes of mouth ulcers can also be indicative of an immunodeficiency, signalling low levels of immunoglobulin in the mucous membrane of the mouth. Chemotherapy is a common cause of mouth ulcers. The treatment depends on the believed cause.

the only thing you can do is trying to convince him... although i doubt this would make a change... coz almost everyone knows how bad is smoking and drinking a lot. so if he does not want to quit, he won't quit... smoking and drinking can not be controled by anyone but the person himself... do not waste your time. you either take him as he is or leave him...

I am a nuclear medicine technologist.  And I think you are talking about a cardiac stress imaging test.  I don't know exactly how the facility you are doing it at does their's, there's several ways to do it.  I am assuming it is the rest/stress method.  So, what they will do is inject you with a radioisotope while you are at rest, wait about 20 minutes and image your heart for about 15 minutes or so.  Then you come back in about 1-2 hours and they will run you on the treadmill to reach your target heart rate, once in is reached, they will inject a radioisotope again while your heart is in a stress state.  They will put you on the camera again and image your heart for 15-20 minutes.  This time they will hook up some ekg leads to synchronize your heartbeat with the camera.  \n   The purpose of imaging your heart in a rest and stress state is to find spots where the radioactive medicine didn't perfuse to in the heart muscle.  When you exercise the coronary arteries dialate and blood usually perfuses to the heart muscle better.  Now if the pictures show an area where there was no perfusion on rest and stress images, that means that is dead muscle that cannot be repaired by increasing perfusion to the muscle, it probably died when you had a heart attack or some chest pain over time.  But if the images show a area that didn't perfuse on rest, but then it did get blood to it when you exercised and opened up those coronary vessels, then it is fixable.  They will probably put in a stent and/or do blood thinner therapy to get blood to that heart muscle so it doesn't die.
not necessarily. handyman could be considered uneducated vagrant who's good with tools. I'm a pretty decent handyman and am also a mortgage broker. people know me as a broker who's good at fixing things. it's all how people perceive you.
Because it is a drug, and drugs affect your brain. They send litle chemicals called neurotransmitters into your neurons, and give a certain feeling. Since they flood the neurons with that feeling, the neuron shuts off, so the body doesn't ever make that feeling EVER again. So, then since you crave that feeling again, the body wants MORE meth. \nThat's why one hit can make you hoooked.\nDon't try it.

Exercising at home or doing something you love?  Also sometimes siblings can and will irritate us, and not just siblings but other people.  At this point, just think of something pleasant or count to ten.  One guy told me to sleep it off? I don't know, what ever works for you, find out. \n\n...one more thing...just be mature and don't EVER do anything that will sabotage your future whatever you want it to be.
get your mates to write something nice on it and read it at bedtime. you'll soon get used to it being on you and if you are anything like Rooney, it'll soon be healed! good luck and keep away from the roads!
girls can loose their hymen for many different reasons...inserting tampons, saddle use, instrument use, prior intercourse.  the issue at hand here is that if her vagina has not been penetrated by something intentional, she could be still considered a virgin.
Yawning \n\n\nEveryone knows that we yawn more and for longer when we’re bored. That’s one of the reasons it’s so embarrassing. Males who are bored tend to have longer yawns than bored females. And most people assume that we do it because our bodies need more oxygen. That sounds sensible, doesn’t it? After all, when we’re bored or tired, we breathe more slowly, so less air goes through the lungs, so the brain signals the lungs to take a deep breath and so we yawn. The trouble is, even breathing enriched air, or exercising so that we breathe faster, makes no difference to how often we yawn. We don’t yawn because we need more air.\n\nWe can all agree on what a yawn is like though. It’s a very deep breath, taken with the mouth round and wide open. It ventilates all parts of the lungs, something which doesn’t happen with normal quiet breathing. The mouth opens fairly slowly, closing more swiftly. There’s usually a visible swelling of the throat, our eyes close and we lower our brows. Lots of animals appear to yawn, but many of the simpler creatures merely gape – opening the mouth wide and not taking a deep breath. Most mammals yawn just like us though. Scientists have tried hard to classify human yawns, but actually they all look the same. The only thing that changes is when we do it! There seems to be only two basic types; the ‘social yawn’, and the ‘wake-up’ yawn, which just seems part of our general stretching routine. \n\nAnd just like stretching, yawning is a reflex. It even occurs in animals that have been born without a correctly formed brain. But normally it’s triggered by stimuli like tiredness, the sight of others yawning or social stress. Yawning increases blood pressure and heart rate and also flexes muscles and joints. If you try to stifle or prevent it by clenching your jaws shut, a yawn is somehow less ‘satisfying’. For some reason, the stretching of jaw and face muscles is necessary. Yawning seems to keep the brain aroused in situations where sleep is unwanted, like in the early morning and when struggling to stay awake at night. It’s associated with high states of alertness – and stress or fear. At athletics events, you sometimes find participants in the race of their lives standing in the starting block and yawning. Or musicians as they psych themselves up before a concert.\n\nAll yawns seem to last about six seconds and are very difficult to stop once they get going. They really are infectious – it’s not just a coincidence. Studies have shown that forty to sixty percent of people who see a yawn end up by joining in. Yawning can be extraordinarily catching. Hearing one can trigger a yawn. Even sitting alone in a room thinking or reading about one can cause a yawn.\n\nWe have a brain mechanism that detects a yawning face – even in our imagination – and which then triggers the same behaviour. Once the neurological machinery in our head gets underway it’s hard to stop. But why? It seems that contagious yawning is caused by something very important to humans: empathy, the ability to identify with other people’s feelings. \n\nPeople who are particularly prone to contagious yawning also tend to score highly on tests that measure levels of empathy. They are people who are in-tune with what others may be feeling and contagious yawning suggests that they’re inclined, in certain situations, to unconsciously mimic their behaviour. They tend to be the same people who say ‘ouch’ when someone else stubs a toe or steps on a sharp object.\n\nThis ability to feel empathy for others is an important part of being human. It only develops when we are a year or so old – just like contagious yawning – and no animals show any signs of empathy whatsoever, except chimpanzees and orang-utans. It is a definite advantage to us as a species: binding social groups together through their feelings for one another and bringing individuals closer together.\n\nSome schizophrenics are unabl

"Castration is the most effective way to ""cut off"" your testosterone levels, but be warned, your pants are going to fit funny afterwards.

Call him back and tell him you're in pain.  He should have prescribed something in the first place.  My dentist gave me 800mg Motrin, which is basically super-strength Advil.  It'll be achy for 2-3 days.  He should have instructed you to call him back if it still hurts after a week.  \n\nSeriously, medical care has dwindled in the last 10 years.  What is UP with doctors forgetting to tell their patients important information like this?

Don't worry about it, if you get stressed or very upset it can sometimes mess with your menstrual cycle. If your taking the pill or any other contraception which aims at controlling your hormones, this too can affect your cycle. If you really are worried i would just go to the doctor to be on the safe side and to put your mind at ease.
There are several types of eczema. I have the type you describe on your son's hands and feet. Moisturize at least twice a day with a non-scented cream (not lotion) like Eucerin or Cetaphil or a generic equivalent.\n\nProvide them with a mild cleansing bar, such as Dove sensitive, for bathing and hand washing. Most people with eczema are very sensitive to chemicals, so apply their sunscreen and such yourself, avoiding the areas with eczema. They should avoid exposing the affected areas to very hot water, as it makes the itch unbearable.\n\nChildren's Benadryl, orally, can help with severe itching, and eczema can cause really severe itching, but it may make them sleepy. Running cool water over the affected area helps a lot. I have not found that topical Benadryl creams help much. Aveeno oatmeal products are highly recommended, but they don't help me. They're worth a try, though. Actually, the cool water helps more than anything, but it stops working when the area warms up again.\n\nOver the counter cortisone creams may treat the rash, but their doc may need to prescribe something stronger. (And I'm not sure they're recommended for children.) They shouldn't wash dishes without gloves, or mess around in other chemicals when they are having a flare up.\n\nMany kids outgrow eczema. Unfortunately, we don't all <pout>\n\n***EDIT***\n\nI almost forgot! Sunshine (not too much of course) helps many eczema sufferers. Expose the affected area for 10-15 minutes a day. I'm kinda weird about getting too hot, but many people get quite a bit of relief from sunshine. Again, it's worth a try.

Yeah you definintly got strep once you get the time to get to the doctors office you should let him know about that.  He will give you a prescription for it and it should be gone within a week and a half but you have to continue taking the medicine even though the spots are gone always finish the medicine.
From personal experience, both are very toxic, with some really adverse side effects. My body did not like Docetaxel (Taxotere) and tolerated Paclitaxel a little better.  \n\nI wish you well

If you are doing well with the HRT and have found the proper formulation for your specific needs, there is no reason to stop taking it at all.  HRT is usually taken for life unless it becomes contraindicated; for right now, since you are doing well and the HRT is conferring protective benefits on your heart and bones (among other functions), there is no reason why you should stop now or anytime soon.  Keep feeling well.

Avoidance of triggers\n\nMany patients with urticaria assume that a causative agent can be identified and avoidance of the trigger will cure their ailment. This may be possible in acute urticaria, but unfortunately it is not possible in the majority of chronic urticaria cases because of the idiopathic nature of the condition. General education about urticaria and avoidance of triggers can help patients understand their condition and come to terms with it. \n\nIn general, patients should avoid drugs known to either cause or exacerbate hives, such as aspirin, NSAIDs, opiates, and ACE inhibitors. (Alcohol should also be avoided.) Acetaminophen may be a substitute treatment to control pain. Several studies have shown that COX-2 inhibitors, such as rofecoxib and celecoxib, appear to be safely tolerated in these patients(7,8). The recent withdrawals of rofecoxib (Vioxx) and valdecoxib (Bextra) leave celecoxib (Celebrex) as the currently available COX-2 inhibitor in the United States. ACE inhibitors should be discontinued in anyone experiencing angioedema. Can angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) be used in these patients? A recent study(10) showed that a small percentage of patients with angioedema that was induced by ACE inhibitor use continued to have symptoms when their treatment was switched to an ARB. Therefore, caution should be exercised(16). \n\nPharmacotherapy\n\nPharmacotherapeutic options for urticaria are listed in table 2. What is the first-line treatment? Antihistamines, antihistamines, antihistamines! Newer-generation H1 antihistamines are generally quite effective in controlling the condition and have a side effect profile of minimal or no sedation and dry mucous membranes. First-generation antihistamines, such as hydroxyzine (Atarax, Vistaril), diphenhydramine hydrochloride, and cyproheptadine hydrochloride, may be an add-on therapy. Cyproheptadine is the treatment of choice for both cold urticaria and cholinergic urticaria(3). \n\nTaking antihistamines according to a schedule rather than on an as-needed basis is the key to attaining disease control. Doses may need to be adjusted upward, depending on the severity of the disease. The relative potency of these agents needs to be considered; for example, 10 mg of cetirizine (Zyrtec) is about equivalent to 30 mg of hydroxyzine(3,11). In a study of the central nervous system effects of higher doses of the nonsedating antihistamine fexofenadine, Hindmarch and colleagues(17) found that doses of up to 360 mg did not cause psychomotor or cognitive dysfunction. \n\nIf symptoms are not optimally controlled with H1 antihistamines, addition of an H2 blocker should be considered. Another option is to add doxepin hydrochloride (Sinequan), a tricyclic antidepressant with potent H1 and H2 antihistamine properties and strong antipruritic action. Unfortunately, the severe sedation and dry mouth associated with this medication tend to limit its use. Leukotriene receptor blockers used as add-on therapy to H1 antihistamines have been shown to provide some benefit(18,19). However, as solo therapy, they have not been found to be effective(20). Glucocorticoids are generally not necessary and should be avoided, if possible, because of their associated side effects and the tendency for lesions to recur after discontinuation of these drugs. \n\nWhat are the options for patients with severe, unremitting urticaria who have had poor response to standard therapy? To ensure that the diagnosis is correct, a biopsy and a referral to an allergist should be considered. Nonstandard therapy, such as cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral, Sandimmune), has been used with some effectiveness(21). Other nonstandard therapies include intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall), colchicine, dapsone, sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), hydroxychloroquine sulfate (Plaquenil), and warfarin sodium (Coumadin)(21). \n\n\nManagement of angioedema\nManagement of angioedema is more difficult than t

Honor her feelings, don't see them as a problem that needs to be fixed. Ask her what makes her feel good. If it is a bubble bath, always works for me, then buy her some nice bubble bath and a scented eye pillow. Give her some space. If it takes weeks or months to pass talk to a doctor, otherwise let her feel her feelings.

It is not bad for you, but then again it is not beneficial - so I would recommend not eating it.
Honestly, having gone through chemo myself, the best thing to do is to have it trimmed frequently and use good quality (salon only) shampoos and conditioners. Also, she should ask her doctor if she can take a vitamin supplement, which will help her hair grow, when she finishes her therapy.

There are many therapies available today to treat emetophobia.\n\nAll phobias are symptoms of an anxiety disorder because, if you weren't frightened, you wouldn't have the phobia and you shouldn't be frightened of things that don't pose any risk to you. The same is true of Emetophobia.\n\nSo how do you stop the cycle?\n\nSimple...you defeat the anxiety disorder that causes the nausea and the fear of vomiting (emetophobia) and, therefore, you stop the phobia.\n\nThis works every time but you have to know how to stop the anxiety.\n\n\n-Regression Hypnotherapy is one therapy that will allow a person to remember that particular event and review it with 'adult' eyes this time around. This will then allow them to interpret the event correctly and it will no longer be an issue for them\n\nAlternative Therapies\n\nReflexology\n\nFor this your feet and hands are used. They say that certain points on your hands and feet relate and are linked to certain organs or other parts of your body. By massaging specific parts of the hands and feet is said to help with digestion, headaches, solar plexus which should help with anxiety and other parts such as your heart lungs, chest etc...By doing reflexology it may help with your anxiety, stress and tension throughout your body.\n\nMassage\n\nThere are different types of massage which are said to do different things to the body, some use aroma, some manipulate the muscles and joints but the aim is to make you relax which may help with the anxiety and stress of your phobia.\n\nReiki\n\nReiki can help with variety of issues, including emotional health, depression, anxiety, physical health, personal boundaries, and abundance. The practice of Reiki is based on working with, and channelling energy, or a spiritual energy. This energy can be referred to as 'chi', The intention with all these energy techniques is that if you can harmonise your energy system, you are putting your body in the best possible position to heal itself on all levels: physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. A relative of mind is qualified in reiki, the treatment involves you lying down comfortably so that you relax. She then moves her hands around the body ~(no contact is made) channelling energy to problem areas or just around the body in general. Its very relaxing and refreshing. It helps you clear your mind and helps your body to heal and feel revitalised.\n\nShiatsu\n\nThis is similar to acupuncture and reike together but there is no needles involved. The Shiatsu therapist uses his/her finger to put pressure on your energy channel. It is said to stimulate the energy channel and maybe get rid of energy blockages that are causing pain or illness.\n\nAcupuncture\n\nAgain like with reiki and Shiatsu, this works with the Chi (energy) which is said to flow around the body. Needles are used instead of the fingers and are inserted at certain points of the energy channel, which is meant to help with pain relief, anxiety and nausea.\n\nHypnotherapy\n\nThis can be a choice for the treatment of your emetophobia. It involves lying or sitting and relaxing your muscles until you are completely relaxed. Once relaxed the therapist then tells your unconscious mind of how and what changes it can make to make your life better. By using hypnotherapy they may even be able to find the cause of your fear which in theory should help you overcome this. It's hard to say whether or not hypnotherapy can cure you, but it can help you to relax and unwind and maybe even train your mind to cut off from emetophobia.\n\nConventional Therapy\n\nCognitive-Behaviour Therapy or CBT\n\nThis is usually the first choice of treatments by therapists. . It is based on the fact that your phobia creates your anxiety. Using that theory they aim to help you control your anxiety. From my experience what they did was to give you small tasks to do which you wouldn't normally do for example walk to the shops if you don't normally go o

Cocaine is the most addictive (and most dangerous) drug.  It is an alkaloid found in leaves of the South American shrub Erythroxylon coca. It is a powerfully reinforcing psychostimulant. The drug induces a sense of exhilaration in the user primarily by blocking the reuptake of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the midbrain.  As a rule of thumb, it is EXTREMELY unwise to experiment with cocaine.  Scientists have found that the pleasure receptors in the brain experience ONE HUNDRED TIMES more stimulation when using cocaine than when having an orgasm!  Now that's a lot of pleasure!!!  Imagine how addicted you would be if you ever experienced anything like it!  Not to mention that it ruins your life, because nothing will ever bring you as much joy as it used to, now that you've experienced the new high.\n\nBut yeah, the answer to your question is crack cocaine.
Some people who exercise may compensate for the burned calories by eating more (consciously or unconsciously).  Or, they may not be burning as many calories as they think while exercising.  Keep a food diary, writing down everything you eat, even the bite of a donut you steal from your friend.  Do this for a week.  You may surprise yourself.\nIf your gym offers personal trainers, take advantage of this.  The trainer can give you pointers on what you may need to change in your routine.
I believe in myself; I think positive of myself and others; I think of others who have a harder time than myself.  This usually makes me feel alright.

I guess it could be possible that sex could increase your glucose.... especially after ejaculation.  When you ejaculate there is a rush of epinephrine and norepinephrine (adrenaline).  This causes your heart to race, blood pressure to increase and also your liver to release glucose from glycogen.  I am assuming that you are a diabetic... for most people, sex does not alter blood sugar at all (because the body is very good at keeping blood sugar constant... that is, unless you are a diabetic).
That sucks! But no one can really answer your question, except maybe your parents, or grand parents had the same thing, genetics-yeah it can suck big time.

If you continue to have bleeding, then there may be some tissue that didn't get expelled from the uterus.  As long as the bleeding is scant, you can probably just wait and see if the bleeding stops on it's own.  If the bleeding continues, the only thing to do at that point would be a D&C.
I am not familiar with asbergers but I work with adults with mental disabilities that have hygiene issues.  One thing I have them do is set out clean night clothes in the morning, as well as whatever clean clothes they plan on wearing the next day.  When they get ready for bed, it become part of the nightly routine to put on the clothes we laid out earlier.  This does not always work of course but I have noticed improvement.  I also will not allow them in my car to go to appointments, ect if they have a strong body odor.  I will arrive early and make them shower if I need to.  After a while, most of them found it was easier to just shower before I got there.  It takes about 2 weeks for something to become a habit or routine. I wish your friend all the luck in the world. \n\nSide note:  If this child is old enough to take part in social activities, I would recommend People First, The Ark or Special Olympics.  Being around other people with disabilities and doing something he enjoys would be more incentive to keep clean.
You have stress incontinence--it happens when you laugh, sneeze or cough.  Especially  if you are female, have had a few kids, are over 50.

One of the facts which\nshould be well-known to anyone in the field is that THC \ngets stored in the fat cells, so if one is at all overweight\nit's likely that they have THC stored. If the person then\nexercises during the week of testing, it can result in the\nrelease of sufficient THC metabolites into the bloodstream\nto yield a positive test, since the test looks for metabolites,\nand not THC itself. So you won't get stoned when the metabolites\nare released into your bloodstream when you exercise, but the\ntest will still detect them. It can take several years for these\nmetabolites to be released and excreted from the body, so false\npositives in former cannabis users are not uncommon, and this \nshould be taken into consideration by test reporting agencies.\n\nEven normal activities of daily life and the concurrent level\nof metabolism can and will release THC metabolites into the\nbloodstream, and can produce a false positive.\n\nThese are the best I could find. I did a Yahoo Search for ""THC False-Positive Urine Test"".  You might want to continue searching Yahoo and Google for the Answer. I've sited my sources below.
