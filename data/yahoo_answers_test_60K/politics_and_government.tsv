This depends mainly on which state you are . Usually the more immigrants like Texas, California , Florida could take 7 to 15 months. Other states with few cases could be shorter. If you've got the labor permit I believe you are more than halfway in the process, once you start the i485 ( not sure if the correct number) you are done , just a matter of wait. The more  important document you need in this stage is the travel document or travel parole that is only valid for one year and take slike two months to renew so you need to apply every 10 months. with thia paper you are free to move outside of the US and comeback. You do not need a visa anymore just wait until your residence card is ready.

If you are in the United States visiting, most states will recognize the license of your parent country.  A non-resident student may also drive on an out-of-state or foreign license.  Many states require that you carry a passport in addition to your license for it to be valid.\n\nIf you are establishing residence in the United States, each state has a limit on the amount of time you have to get a license.  For instance, in Georgia, a new resident has 30 days to obtain a license.
Whenever a full routine checkup is scheduled. \n\nRegular or emergency treatments are also available, for instance Bill Clinton visited in 1996 after multiple cocaine overdoses and was informed that his nasal septum would be destroyed with further use.

"I'm not from Oklahoma but I can tell you that most goofy laws were set forth due to someone actually committing something relating to them or someone complaining about a situation that happened simular to it.

No.  Popular vote has nothing to do with it.\n\nThere are two methods:\n\nThe first method is for a bill to pass both halves of the legislature, by a two-thirds majority in each. Once the bill has passed both houses, it goes on to the states. This is the route taken by all current amendments. Because of some long outstanding amendments, such as the 27th, Congress will normally put a time limit (typically seven years) for the bill to be approved as an amendment (for example, see the 21st and 22nd).\n\nThe second method prescribed is for a Constitutional Convention to be called by two-thirds of the legislatures of the States, and for that Convention to propose one or more amendments. These amendments are then sent to the states to be approved by three-fourths of the legislatures or conventions. This route has never been taken, and there is discussion in political science circles about just how such a convention would be convened, and what kind of changes it would bring about.
Hmm...well seeing as this question isn't specific to IRAQ (stupid other people in here...) I'd have to say that it is because of people who think that violence is the solution to everything. Unfortunately, there have always been and will always be these people in the world, whether we like it or not. Stupid violent tendencies...

Why is it called war on terror. Was it not called war on terrorism just a few months back ? I think that war is built on a lie. The lie about WMD being ready and able to be a threat to the US. I can only say that this was a picked fight and later grab for any reason to get it started. When it got started it was a point of no return. \nSaddam is and was a crook , he have been that in the  00s in the 90s and in the 80s . Even in the 70s. \n\nHere comes the part I dont understand. Why arming Saddam in the 80s like US did. They knew he was a crook but that didnt matter for Reagan or Bush sr. Who cared about the Iraqi peolpe back then supporting there oppressor. \n\nIn a way by being in Iraq at the moment and hopefully building something that will last will bring some ease on US as a nation that before supported the Iraqi peoples opressor. Like clean up there own mess in a way. \n\nBefore people begin jump me and call me anti american I will point out that US wasnt the only nation that supported Saddam in the 80s. But since the question specific relate to US and Iraq I have limited the answer or more correctly my point view in the issue.
He's obviously someone who should be watched very carefully by sane people, mostly because he can be regarded as crazy and dangerous.  He said that Israel should be wiped off the face of the planet for one thing, and then in order to try to backpeddle from that he said that they should all move to Europe.  This is obviously a guy who might not be able of making reasonable decisions, especially when he sees the world in such a unreasonable viewpoint.

"To be a super power, a country needed to be very strong militarily, economically and in global values.\n\nThe People's Republic of China is often considered a rising major power due to its large and stable population, its rapidly growing economy, and its rapidly growing military spending and capabilities.\n\nSimilar to China, India has a population of over one billion, nuclear weapons, the world's 2nd largest land-force and 4th largest airforce, as well as a thriving economy (4th largest in PPP). India also enjoys the advantage of a large and well-educated English-speaking workforce. The biggest obstacle: India is still a ""developing"" country in many respects with poor infrastructure, a huge poor and under-educated lower class that has a tremendous gap with the middle and upper classes; widespread corruption, brain-drain, social and ethnic tensions as well as potential conflict with its neighbor and rival, Pakistan. Despite India's widespread poverty, the Indian middle class consists of approximately 200 million people and poverty levels have been falling consistently since the '90s, though in rural areas, where most Indians still live, there has been little improvement. Today, approximately 20% of India's population lives in absolute poverty. It is thought that India's democratic foundations ensure some kind of long term government stability.\n\nRussia still possesses some attributes of a world power, notably including the world's largest arsenal of nuclear weapons, inherited from the USSR. It also has the proven ability to conduct manned space travel. Perhaps most importantly, it is the geographically largest country of the world and has control over a variety of strategic raw materials. Russia still has a clear capacity for destructive force, which in light of the current delicate political situation is not calculable beyond the medium-term. As one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Russia also has notable political influence in the world. However, Russia's economy is generally thought to be unstable and less competitive on a global scale. The population has been shrinking since the fall of the Soviet Union and is predicted to fall even lower within the next 10 years, due to drastically shortened life expectancies since 1990 and falling birthrates. Life in what was one of the safest places in the world has become rife with danger and insecure for most people. Furthermore, Russia is unable to control Chechen separatism and terrorism that is threatening neighbouring areas in the south and could lead to the break up of the south of the country. Russia is also unable to prevent illegal Chinese immigration into Asian Russia which may cause the eventual loss of that mineral rich region. A major brain drain of Russia's vast coterie of high quality scientists and engineers, a legacy of its excellent Soviet era education system, is also occurring and undermining Russia's long term economic development. Out of control post Soviet corruption diverts vast sums of government resources away from valuable programs. Corruption is also endemic in its business sector."

"The term ""hazard action"" appears nowhere in the Michigan Compiled Law Service.

Otherwise, I'm afraid that ""hazard action #5"" isn't very helpful."

The United States is a very racially diverse country. According to the 2000 census, it has 31 ethnic groups with at least one million members each, and numerous others represented in smaller amounts.\n\nThe majority of Americans descend from white European immigrants who arrived at the establishment of the first colonies (most after Reconstruction). This majority--69.1% in 2000--decreases each year, and is expected to become a plurality within a few decades. The most frequently stated European ancestries are German (15.2%), Irish (10.8%), English (8.7%), Italian (5.6%) and Scandinavian (3.7%). Many immigrants also hail from Slavic countries such as Poland and Russia. Other significant immigrant populations came from eastern and southern Europe and French Canada.\nTop ancestries in 2000.\nEnlarge\nTop ancestries in 2000.\n\nHispanics from Mexico and South and Central America are the largest minority group in the country, comprising 12.5% of the population (2000 census). People of Mexican descent made up 7.3% of the population in the 2000 census, and this proportion is expected to increase significantly in the coming decades.\n\nAbout 12.3% (2000 census) of the American people are African Americans (Blacks). African Americans are spread throughout the country, but their presence is largest in the South.\n\nAsian Americans--including Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders--are a third significant minority (3.7% of the population in 2000). Most Asian Americans are concentrated on the West Coast and Hawaii. The largest groups are immigrants or descendants of emigrants from the Philippines, China, India, Vietnam, South Korea, and Japan.

Contrary to common sense, the quickest way is NOT to marry her in the Philippines. It is usually faster to get her a fiancee visa, and marry when she comes to U.S. (You have to check for the specific country though).\n\nTo start the process, you need to submit the I-129F petition for fiancee visa to the USCIS. The form is at: http://uscis.gov/graphics/formsfee/forms/i-129f.htm\n\nAfter this gets processed, your fiancee can go to a U.S. embassy for an visa interview.\n\nMarriage visa (K3) takes up to a year to process, while fiancee visa (K1) takes much less (~4 months from petition to visa issued in Bangkok, Thailand, different in different countries).\n\nNote that you also have a slightly more difficult/expensive, but potentially faster option of enrolling her in a U.S. college or English study program, and getting her a student visa (F1)

"the question is too simple... there are pros and cons.  i think it is great to afford women in this country as many of the same opportunities to serve as we can.  but i do think there are some differences that we as a society must be ready to accept if they are going to be on the front lines.  it was hard for americans to see the desecrated bodies of american soldiers in mogadishu-dragged by the locals-how hard will that image be when its a woman? i will agree that women can be as aggressive and intelligent as men when called on to fight. i have seen a lot of impressive things from women troopers-ladies who can keep up with me on a march, and i'm not slow. who can shoot as well as me- and i shhot excellently. but combat involves a lot of ""hurryup and wait"" and boredom sets in...if i was in a foxhole with a female for days waiting for an attack that might never come, what happens when things get sexually heavy? will we be punished? yep. is it a natural instinct to find comfort with the opposite sex? yep. does it screwup the good order and discipline? yep. read robert heilein's starship troopers- or watch the crappy movie- you'll see that american society presently has a lot of gender hangups that make this a flawed effort.  we have some successes, but we have a long way to go.  presently they require seperate showers, berthing, and toilet facilities...which means some navy ships have to be expensively refurbished and welded to provide those spaces... also, it can be a distraction- it just is... as a soldier you train hard to mostly shut off that sexual need, and concentrate on the misery of your life while deployed- the scent of a woman is terribly distracting at those times and requires an even higher effort of selfdiscipline.  if you think the rules for sexual harassment are tough on cvillians-you have no idea what it is here.  also, consider the following tactical scenario... a flight crew gets shot down behind enemy lines and there are only 2 survivors- a male intelligence officer who has tactically important knowledge, and a female grunt who is a lower level iportance to the overall mission.  they hae been trapped in a POW camp for 8 months, and after being raped by her captor she is now pregnant. however, the rescue gets botched and there is only enough room to evacuate one of the prisoners-the intel officer is of tactical advantage, but he (in my opinion) must be left to save the innocent infant-further damaging the mission. i know its a stretch of the iagination, but i think it- and the public's horror and dismay at the jessica lynch episode, demonstrates that in our society's eyes a women captive is of more value than a man, and that gives me pause. and don't tell me about women aren't on the front lines- that's dated WW2 war theory- the front lines in a guerrilla war/ terrorism fight are constantly moving so that nowhere is safe..."

"I don't believe there is a definite answer, and I feel that many of the arguments made both for and against the war are inaccurate.  First, the argument that we are there for oil.  If this were the case, you would have seen American oil companies moving in, special trade agreements, and lower oil and gas prices.  This has not happened, so I doubt this is the case.  Second, that Bush was lying.  Bush didn't lie about the wmd's because he didn't make up the intelligence.  He believed the information given to him by people who also believed in it, and just because it was incorrect does not mean he lied.  \nHowever, I believe wholeheartedly that we should still be there, and continue to be there until things have stabilized.  We made a promise to those people, and we must keep it.  I guarantee you, if this works out, thirty years down the road when this is in the history books, we will be the good guys.  In fact, the majority of the Iraqi people love what we are doing.  So, in conclusion, while me may not have been ""right"" to invade, we are doing the people of Iraq a great service by actually giving them a chance to be free."

Yes, acctually the states that we know as California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah were all once a part of what was known as Northern Mexico.  However, due to a treaty signed on February 2, 1848, known as, The Treaty of Guadeloupe Hidalgo, the U.S. annexed the Northern half of Mexico to a tune of 15 million dollars.  This all came at the conclusion of the Mexican - American War, which started due to the Westward expansion of Americans and the Texas war for Independence.

"In the United States, separation of church and state is governed by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and by legal precedents, some quite controversial, interpreting that clause. Although the Establishment Clause states that, ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,"" the U.S. Supreme Court has long interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment (one of the Reconstruction Amendments) as making the Establishment Clause and other portions of the Bill of Rights binding on state and local governments as well. Many other democratic governments around the world have similar clauses in their respective constitutions.\n\nThe phrase ""separation of church and state"" does not appear in the Constitution, but rather derives from a letter written by Thomas Jefferson to a group identifying themselves as the Danbury Baptists. In that letter, Jefferson referred to a “wall of separation between church and state.” James Madison, the father of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights, wrote in the early 1800s, “Strongly guarded . . . is the separation between religion and government in the Constitution of the United States.” Ulysses S. Grant also called for Americans to ""Keep the church and state forever separate."""

I wish things were that easy to conclude without doubt that a court decision is unconstitutional and such has been debated since ratification.  Even so, there is merit to your concerns but not in the process you suggest.\n\nTo begin with, the Eleventh Amendment was proposed, almost unanimously, at the first meeting of Congress after the decision in Chisholm v. Georgia [1793] which held that a State was liable to be sued by a citizen of another State or of a foreign country. \n\nThe Amendment was recognized and upheld by a number of subsequent cases such as Hans v. Louisiana [1890] which opined, “This Amendment, expressing the will of the ultimate sovereignty of the whole country, superior to all legislatures and all courts, actually reverses the decision of the Supreme Court.”  \n\nWhile this was going on, there was also the debate between the Federal Government and the States as to Sovereignty as relative to State Nullification acts.  That is, a single State legislature deciding that a federal act was unconstitutional and not applicable within the borders of that single State.  This continued until 1868 with the application of the fourteenth Amendment [1868] which was upheld in Texas v. White [1869].\n\nThe point is to get the States back into the game balancing against acts of the federal government.  This can be accomplished with a new Amendment recognizing the Sovereignty of the States and their individual ability to nullify federal acts within their borders.
"A government is the body that has the power to make and enforce laws within an organization or group. In its broadest sense, ""to govern"" means to administer or supervise, whether over an area of land, a set group of people, or a collection of assets. The word governement is derived the Greek Κυβερνήτης (kubernites), which means ""steersman"", ""governor"", ""pilot"" or ""rudder""."

Constitution Memorial Day (Japanese: 憲法記念日, Kenpō Kinen-bi) is a national holiday in Japan. It takes place on May 3 in celebration of the promulgation of the 1947 Constitution of Japan. It is a part of the collection of holidays known as Golden Week.[1]\n\nA holiday since the current Japanese constitution came into effect on May 3, 1947, this is the only day of the year that the National Diet Building (国会議事堂, kokkai-gijidō) is open to the public.[2] Being a day that draws its significance from the Japanese constitution, Constitution Memorial Day is often chosen as a day to reflect on the meaning of democracy and Japanese government. For instance, in 2003, a number of newspapers featured editorials regarding the constitution's embattled Article 9.[3]

who cares
Actually, most funds from wars are from debt financing.  The taxes collected today are really 'repaying' treasury loans from many years ago.  Tax money won't be actually applied towards the Iraq situation for many more years, so the answer to this question is no, tax payers money is not being used (directly) to finance any current wars.
slipery slope! Will probably lead to early treatment options, but I am not sure of the imediate moral implications concerning abortion
Only in the cases where the abortion is absolutely called for.  You know, in cases where the child is determined (pre-natally) to be severly deformed, or severely retarded, etc .  Other examples might also be when the fetus will be born with low IQ, or black, or gay, or ugly, or a mexican born in the US, some fricken hillbilly.

One of the main reasons that there is so much poverty in the world is because of the evil dictators that rule some of these poverty stricken countries.  They take control of any revenue making buisness, as well as funds that other countries send to help out these countries, and keep it all for themselves.  They live in huge palaces living and eating it up,all the while their people are living in shacks and going hungry.\nMost of the people in America do not know true poverty, not to say all, but most, considering that even our poorest own TV's.  There is no reason for any child in this country to go hungry at night, with all the social programs, food banks and such that we have to help others out.
Direct election is a term describing a system of choosing political officeholders in which the voters directly cast ballots for the person, persons or political party that they desire to see elected. The method by which the winner or winners of a direct election are chosen depends upon the electoral system used. The most commonly used systems are the plurality system and the two round system for single winner elections, such as a presidential election, and party-list proportional representation for the election of a legislature.\n\nBy contrast in an indirect election, the voters cast elect an assembly which in turn elects the officeholder in question. Some examples of indirectly elected bodies would include:\n\nthe Parliamentary Assemblies of the Council of Europe, OSCE, the WEU and NATO - in all of these cases, voters elect national parliamentarians, who in turn elect some of their own members to the assembly \nthe election of the government in most parliamentary systems - the voters elect the parliamentarians, who then elect the government from among themselves \nthe German Bundesrat, where voters elect the Landtag members, who then elect the state government, which then appoints its members to the Bundesrat \nthe election of the US President is technically indirect -- the voters elect the electoral college, who then elects the President -- although in practice it resembles a direct election for most purposes \nmost bodies formed of representatives of national governments, e.g. the United Nations General Assembly, can be considered indirectly elected (assuming the national governments are democratically elected in the first place, which is often not the cause)

Romanov (rō'mənŏf, Rus. rəmä'nəf) , ruling dynasty of Russia from 1613 to 1917. The name Romanov was adopted in the 16th cent. by a family of boyars (great nobles) that traced its beginnings to the 14th cent. Czar Ivan IV took as his first wife Anastasia Romanov. Anastasia's brother, Nikita, was a regent for her son, Czar Feodor I. Nikita's son, Philaret, whom Boris Godunov forced to take monastic vows, was patriarch of Moscow from 1619 until his death in 1633. Michael, Philaret's son, was chosen in 1613 as czar of Russia; his election ended a turbulent period in Russian history. Except for the period from 1722 to 1797, the succession was thereafter regulated by the law of primogeniture.\nThe direct successors of Michael were Alexis (1645–76) and Feodor III (1676–82). Ivan V and Peter I (Peter the Great) reigned jointly under the regency of their sister Sophia Alekseyevna until 1689, when Peter assumed sole rule. In 1721, Peter took the title emperor of Russia in addition to that of czar; the new title was borne by all his successors. His succession decree of 1722 denounced the law of primogeniture and declared that the choice of a successor lay solely with the ruling emperor.\n\nIn 1723, Peter made his consort joint ruler as Catherine I, and after his death (1725) she continued to rule until she died in 1727. Peter's son by his first marriage, Czarevich Alexis, had been executed in 1718. His second marriage, with Catherine, produced two daughters: Anna, who married Duke Charles Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp, and Elizabeth. They were bypassed in the succession of 1727 in favor of Peter II (1727–30), son of Czarevich Alexis.\n\nPeter II was the last of the direct male Romanov line, and on his death Anna, duchess of Courland, a daughter of Ivan V, ascended the throne. She died without heirs and was succeeded (1740) by Ivan VI, a great-grandson of Ivan V. He was a German, son of the duke of Brunswick and of Anna Leopoldovna, a princess of Mecklenburg.\n\nThe rule of foreigners was unpopular, and Peter I's daughter Elizabeth executed a coup in 1741 and was proclaimed czarina. Her nephew Peter III succeeded her in 1762 but was deposed (and probably assassinated) that year in a coup that made his consort, a princess of Anhalt-Zerbst, empress as Catherine II (Catherine the Great). There was some argument as to the paternity of Catherine's son and successor, Paul I (1796–1801), but it is now generally believed that he was the son of Peter III.\n\nPaul, who was assassinated, restored the succession by primogeniture in 1797. His successors reigned as Alexander I (1801–25), Nicholas I (1825–55), Alexander II (1855–81; assassinated), Alexander III (1881–94), and Nicholas II (1894–1917). The marriage of Nicholas II to Princess Alix of Hesse (Czarina Alexandra Feodorovna) brought hemophilia into the family; their son, Czarevich Alexis (1904–18), was afflicted with the disease. In 1918, after the Russian Revolution, Nicholas II and his immediate family were executed. The members of the Romanov family who escaped execution fled abroad.
I dont think many countries consider men with men acceptable. It's almost always taboo in society/main religions. I doubt as a whole people will ever really accept the union as a union under god.\n\n\nHowever, they should accept it as a legal union of two people living together, because that's what they're doing. Ignorant people seem to get these two mixed.\n\n\nIt's their business what happens under the sheets.
The name India IPA: /'ɪndiə/, is derived from the Old Persian version of Sindhu, the historic local appellation for the river Indus; see Origin of India's name. The Constitution of India and general usage also recognises Bharat (Hindi: भारत IPA: /bɦaːrət̪/  listen?), which is derived from the Sanskrit name of an ancient Hindu king, whose story is to be found in the Mahabharata, as an official name of equal status. A third name, Hindustan (Hindi: हिन्दुस्तान IPA: /ɦɪn̪d̪ʊst̪aːn/)  listen?, or Land of the Hindus in Persian, has been used since the twelfth century, though its contemporary use is unevenly applied due to domestic disputes over its representiveness as a national signifier.

"You must prove your patriotism by your deeds, not merely by words.  Have you served on active duty in the military?  Do you regularly make your views known to your Congressional representatives?  Do you take the time to keep yourself informed on current events?  Do you know and understand the political, social, and economic history of the nation?  Do you take personal responsibility for the safety and well-being of your country (this idea blatantly stolen from Robert Heinlein)?  Do you teach the young people in your sphere of influence why you are proud of your country, relying on reason and logic instead of just emotion?  If you can honestly answer ""Yes"" to all of these questions, IMHO, you are a patriot."

"aaronsdaddy is not really correct. In any 740 day period, any day a Guardsman/Reservist spends deployed (whether overseas or in the States) is called a ""high tempo day"". If you accumulate more than 400 ""high tempo days"" you become effectively non-deployable. If a deployment will take you over 400 ""high tempo days"" in the middle of the deployment, you greatly lessen your chances of being deployed.\n\nIt is still technically possible to be deployed with more than 400 high tempo days, but the general grade officers that be have to jump through so many hoops they have decided it is just easier to activate someone else who has the high tempo days available to rack up.\n\nIf you are a Reservist and you want to volunteer, just talk to your personnel sergeant. I guarantee you that he will hook you up. And if you want to go, let them know. Maybe someone else who doesn't want to go will owe you a kegger when you get back."
The current capitol building is actually the fourth to serve as the U.S. capitol, after Maryland State House (Maryland), Federal Hall (New York) and Independance Hall (Philadelphia). It is built to house Congress, the legislative branch of the United States government. It was built in Washington, D.C. because it is the capital of the United States.
The war that the terrorists started will end when the terrorists stop terrorizing people. (I won't go into the arguments that GWB is THE terrorist because we'd just be arguing semantics. GWB has never been responsible for the premeditated and deliberate murder of innocent women and children. You've been in the military, so was I...the Army (a combat unit) for 8 years...so you know the true answer to that silly argument.)
Well not every Muslim has become a terrorist in everybodies eyes. However Muslim people are being racially profiled because it saves time, money, and makes sense. Lets face it is not White, Black, Asians, Mexicans on and on that are straping bombs to themselves or crashing airplanes into buildings. I feel badly for the Muslim population that is being profiled but they should be thankfull they are not being interned like the Japenese during ww2. At the same time innocent people/journalist in their countries are being kidnaped and killed on video. The savage brutality of these senseless killings is very unnerving to America, especially when they film and mail it to us. (view videos at michaelsavage.com) Not to mention OBL keeps threatening us with sleepers. He is the biggest enemy of the average Muslim. My last point would be that there are no strong public speakers on behalf of the Muslims. I have been waiting for an intelligent well spoken Muslim to stand up and represent the American Muslim. I feel this would really help there cause.
Yeah, I saw that on TV last night, due to a volcano erruption in Europe (we could also do this with nuck weapons)\n\nNot only would Europe be starving, but the America's (N & S), Africa, Asia, and Austrailia (wow, never noticed that most start with an A... anyway's) depending on the severity of it. \n\nSever: I guess humanity would degress to the dark ages (if we were really bad).  We'd probably slowly start to loose our technology, and after time, we'd be back in the dark ages.  Almost extinct if really bad (like an all out nuck war).  Humans have a big period of anmisia...during Christ's time, in the Alexandian libraray theologians had already come close to making steam engins, and flying macheins.  Somewhere, we experienced a change, which set us into the dark ages, so since history repeats itself, there u go.\n\nLow to Moderate: and if there was a continent that was able to produce food, I'd see the world community comming together and we would turn that area into a giant farm.

When you live in a dictatorship, as we do in America the party in power will always steal tax payer funds.\nAmerica is spending $6 billion a month in Iraq. Congress gave drug companies $250 billion.

There's no set rule for picking a state capitol.\n\nMost capitols were set long ago, in a place central to a state.  This is because state representatives and officials had to ride, by horse and/or carriage, to the capital to conduct business.  I live in Michigan.  Lansing is out capital.\n\nWhile Detroit is our biggest and most popular city, it wouldn't be practicle for a representative to ride from, say, Marquette.  \n(This is actually a poor example because Detroit was the capital of Michigan before Lansing, but the point is the same.)

The issue is what the person intends when they shoot.  If they intend to kill but misfire and hit someone below the waist, it is attempted murder.  Ironically, when it comes to murder itself as a crime intent is less important.  A person who does not intend to murder (i.e. aims below the waist) but nonetheless renders a fatal wound is guilty of murder so long as the person intended to shoot the gun.
"What is the difference between a city and a town?\n\nIn the United States, an incorporated city is a legally defined government entity, with powers delegated by the state and county and created and approved by the voters of the city. It can provide local government services to its citizens.\n\nIn most places in the U.S. a town, village, community, or neighborhood is simply an unincorporated community with no governmental powers. Usually, county governments provide services to these unincorporated communities. Some states do have official designations of ""towns"" that include limited powers.\n\nGenerally in the urban heirarchy, villages are smaller than towns and towns are smaller than cities but each country has its own definition of a city and an urban area."
Lets resolve this overdue question by bringing it to a vote.

A republic is a kind of democracy. Democracy is a wide-reaching term referring to basically any system of government in which the people play a significant part in the running of the government. A pure democracy is one in which every citizen votes on every decision, which is fairly impratical with the size of today's nations. A republic is a representative democracy, meaning people vote for people (president, representative, senator, etc.) to go represent them while actually running the country. This allows people to not spend all of their time voting on every bill, but still gives them control over how it is run, since most elected officials want to be reelected, and also avoid being recalled.
it's nothing more than a buzzword as far as what President Bush wants to do. They talk about democracy this and that, yet we cannot uphold our own. We didn't have a square election in 2000, nor did we have a choice in '04. The difference between the two candidates was nothing more than a coin toss. The real alternatives to them were pushed out by having more money and connections.\n\nAlso people get confused on what our country is. People automatically assume it's a democracy, when in fact it's a republic. Which is a limited democracy. Otherwise if we had a pure democracy, the majority woudl get whatever they want and the minority would be totally screwed. An analogy to that is two wolves tell a lamb whats for dinner. It doesn't and shouldn't work that way. We can barely even keep it a republic though.\nSo to ask what is western democracy, you have to see past what the talking heads preach and realize what is going on.\nYeah, we can elect people. yeah we can put in new laws..for ourselves, on our own account... Except when it gets hijacked by individuals who know how to manipulate it all. Then for the people to not have enough guts/critical thought to overturn the injustice...\nBut for us to force it on others is an antithesis of democracy in the first place.\nI don't recall the world calling a vote for candidate Mr. U.S. govt. and being nominated to decide what country should have a regime change first, especially when Mr. U.S. govt. supported that regime at one point.\n\nThe current aims of the U.S. govt. to coerce 'democracy' stands thus far:\n1) hypocritical, ours is failing\n2) illogical, forcing a democracy defeats itself\n3) moot, U.S. govt. could care less if people in other countries are actually free or not, it's about making the initiatives they create sound pleasant.
"For anyone that ascribes to Darwin's origin of the species theory (where there is no God who could call all things seen and unseen into exsitence with the command of his Word), war should not be a problem, because there is no finite moral standard... it is survival of the fittest.  Eat... or be eaten, Kill or be killed.\nFor those who have a life-trusting faith in God, it is sometimes harder to decide, since we are past those times when God tells his people to go and eliminate this group or that ""so that you may have the land that I have promised you.""\nIn current times we need to be loyal to our friends who call for aid.  We may sometimes need to step out and rescue a people from an unbelievably oppressive governmental hardship, particularly when that government gives all the signs that it not only materially supports terrorism but that it will conduct unprovoked war on other peaceful nations."
Yes, democracy is the best system.  However, it's not without flaws as we learned this week when Hamas won the majority of the vote by the Palestinians.  Hamas is a terrorist group that could really throw off the way much of the world views democracy.\n\nStay tuned, this should be interesting.

My understanding is that you can't be limited to one tv service.  The HOA can restrict how you hook up to a dish service though.

The USA has killed over 15 million people and the vast majority of them did not deserve to die or it was not our right. And if we would stop our support of the Israel and there crimes we would be a whole lot better off.

If you are a member of a congrigation and you know what city you were baptized in, you can tell the parrish center and they can contact your original parrish for you. Believe me, the Catholic Church keeps paperwork. With a couple of phone calls they will be able to get it for you. I know because I had to do the same thing, only my original parrish no longer existed at all and they had to track down my certificate! Took a couple of weeks, but I got it. Best of luck!

Iran is FULL of oil, so really you dont need nuclear energy, you want to have a bomb, your president has publically stated that he will use the bomb on israel (if not other nations too) as soon as he gets it.. thats a first use policy. And yes hiroshima/nakaski was bombed but it was a different case, it really was not known how bad the results would be, and the usa was in a war with japan (remeber that japan started) and by dropping the bomb, MILLIONS of usa lives were saved by not having to go into japan... droping the bomb then, and iran threatening to nuke israel are completely differnt things. perhaps you should really ask why iran hates israel so much, that it would kill millions of people inlcuding jews, muslims and christians!!!
Yes. But that would be irresponsible leadership. A president should be able to stay the course especially when comes to war. By analogy, President Roosevelt could have called US troops from Europe and the Pacific, but where would that leave the world?

Go to the Department of Social Services and tell them you want to report sexual abuse (it would be better if your sister did this).  Don't be afraid to go, and STOP taking Mom's advice (shame on her for making you girls keep quiet about it).  They may not be able to convict him now, but at least people will know what he did, and others will beware of him.  Now, don't be afraid.  I will be praying for you and your sister to stand strong.

The Census does not ask about religion, because it is prohibited by law, so there is no information on so detailed a level. However, the Statistical Abstract of the United States has a table of populations that self-report as Jewish in each state. The latest data says 620,000 in Florida. Assuming Gainesville has an average percentage of Jewish community, that would mean that there are roughly 3,700 Jews in Gainesville.
That depends on the jurisdiction. In general terms, a third degree misdemeanor is one of the least serious criminal charges. There are likely many different third degree misdemeanors in whatever jurisdiction you are talking about, but they all have the same sentencing requirements.

Bless you for even asking.\n\nCan you do it?  Perhaps.  You have no felony convictions, so you are not automatically prohibited from a number of positions.  \n\nCrime scene analysis?  Probably not.  You're talking about working for a law enforcement agency, and I would think the chances of working for a agency while you're on probation are about slim and none.\n\nPreventing crimes against children?  Very possible, though probably not within the criminal justice arena.  Many private organizations do things like this, and you are uniquely qualified for a position in this field.  \n\nHuman trafficking?  Again, probably not within the criminal justice arena.\n\nWant to help out?  It's always possible.  Probably not as an employee, though...certainly not while on probation.\n\nWe can talk more, if you'd like...drop me a note at my user name at yahoo.com.  \n\nSeriously...bless you for wanting to do something.  I especially would like to see you get involved in preventing crimes against children, and you can certainly involve yourself in that field without having to work with or for a law enforcement agency.  \n\nWonderful drug that meth is, huh?  Sounds like it made a mess of your life...it would truly be wonderful if you can find a place in the world where you could help make things better.\n\nGood luck...write if you think I can offer more.

One is eligible to take the bar exam with only law-office study in California, Maine, New York, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming. In addition, you are eligible in California, DC, and New Mexico to take the test if you only have correspondence study. Each state is very different on these requirements, particularly on how long you must work at a law firm, and some of those do require some classroom experience at an ABA accredited law school, even though they don't require a JD or LLD.\n\nThat being said, it is pretty rare for someone to apply for and be accepted to the bar without a law degree. It is simply the easiest, fastest way to learn all of the information necessary for the bar exam.
The National voting age was 21 for both the election years you ask about.  Some states allowed younger voting before it became national law to allow the 18 year old to vote, just as some states had allowed the Womens vote before it became National Law in 1920.  The first National Election that 18 year olds were able to vote in was in 1972 when Richard Nixon won a landslide victory over George McGovern.

The X-generation was the last to have French everyday in public schools through 7th grade.  French remains the first language spoken by all prior to the Baby Boomers.  Almost every little town has its own unique community and people feel a sense of pride in continuing the tradition for generations.

No. We Americans just like our comforts and conveniences. We're free to choose at anytime to do without the alleged  benefits of having petroleum available to us.\n\nBeing a hostage is not a choice...it's being forced do something against one's will. Nobody is forcing anybody to buy their oil; we do so voluntarily. The human race went on perfectly fine for millions of years before petroleum became popular.\n\nSenator McCain might be correct if he is convinced that he speaks for those who don't realize that every person has free will.\n\nPersonally, I love the benefits of having petroleum available. I will choose to buy it for my comfort and convenience until such a time that I can't afford it anymore. It's no different than any other economic commodity.
A child support order is based on a number of factors, including the income and expenses of both parents and the percentage of time each parent has custody or visitation.  The amount of time that each parent spends with the child is already figured into the amount of support paid.  Therefore, payments will generally not be suspended during times when the child is with the non-custodial parent.\n\nSuppose for example, the non-custodial parent has the child 10% of the time.  That person will pay higher support than a non-custodial parent who has custody 40% of the time because there is a presumption that support will be provided during the time of custody.  The bigger the custodial burden, the biggest the monetary support will be.

"Jules Mazarin, born Giulio Raimondo Mazzarino (July 14, 1602, Pescina, Italy – March 9, 1661, Vincennes, France) served as the chief minister of France from 1642, until his death. Mazarin succeeded his mentor, Cardinal Richelieu.\n\nBiography\nMazarin's early military and diplomatic experience, which marked him as a friend of France in the contests between French and Spanish factions in papal politics, recommended him to Richelieu. As papal vice-legate at Avignon (1632), and nuncio extraordinary in France (1634), Mazarin was perceived as an extension of Richelieu's policy, and under Habsburg pressure, Mazarin was dismissed by Urban VIII, January 17, 1636. Mazarin immediately went to Paris, offered his services to Richelieu and was naturalized as a French citizen by April. The apex of his diplomatic services was the secret treaty between France and Tomasso of Savoy signed late in 1640. The following year, at Richelieu's insistence, Mazarin made cardinal.\n\nAs Louis XIII died in 1643, and Louis XIV was only a child — Mazarin functioned essentially as the ruler of France: although the 5-year-old Louis XIV became king in 1643, under the regency of queen mother Anne of Austria, and until his death in 1661, Mazarin directed French policy. His modest manner contrasted with the imperious Richelieu, and Anne was so fond of him and so intimate in her manner with him, that long-standing rumors that they had been secretly married and that the Dauphin was their offspring.\n\nA fictionalized Mazarin is a major character in Alexandre Dumas' novel, Twenty Years After. In it, Mazarin is portrayed as power-hungry, paranoid, and greedy.\n\n[edit]\nMazarin's policies for France\nMazarin continued Richelieu's anti-Habsburg policy and laid the foundation for Louis XIV's expansionism. The victories of Condé and Turenne brought the French party to the bargaining table at the conclusion of the Thirty Years War with the Treaty of Munster and Treaty of Osnabrück (Treaty of Westphalia), in which Mazarin's policies were French rather than Catholic and brought Alsace (though not Strasbourg) to France; he settled Protestant princes in secularized bishoprics and abbacies in reward for their political opposition to Austria. In 1658 he formed the League of the Rhine, which was designed to check the House of Austria in central Germany. In 1659 he made peace with Habsburg Spain in the Peace of the Pyrenees, which added to French territory Roussillon and Cerdagne in the far south and part of the Low Countries.\n\nTowards Protestantism at home, Mazarin pursued a policy of promises and calculated delay to defuse the armed insurrection of the Ardèche (1653) for example, and keep the Huguenots disarmed: for six years they believed themselves to be on the eve of recovering the protections of the Edict of Nantes: in the end they obtained nothing.\n\nTowards the pontificate of the successful Spanish candidate, Cardinal Pamphili, elected pope (15 September, 1644) as Innocent X, there was constant friction. Mazarin protected the Barberini cardinals, nephews of the late pope, and the Bull against them was voted by the Parliament of Paris ""null and abusive""; France made a show of preparing to take Avignon by force, and Innocent backed down. Mazarin was more consistently an enemy of Jansenism, more for its political implications than out of theology, and on his deathbed warned young Louis ""not to tolerate the Jansenist sect, not even their name.""\n\nControversy over the Cardinal's policies, and the weakness of the regency, resulted in two civil wars, known as la Fronde (1648-52). Twice, in 1651 and 1652, he was driven out of the country, by the Parliamentary Fronde and the Fronde of the Nobles. The countless abusive and satirical pamphlets called Mazarinades published against him often invoked his Italian birth. In addition, the increasing authoritarian royal power of France (a process begun under Richelieu), as"

Unless the fire truck is told otherwise, it should go to the fire that it was originally sent to.  The dispatcher will have a much better picture of what resources are available to fight both fires and they should make the decisions on which truck to send to which fire.\n\nLike with any emergency service, the situation can change from minute to minute.  The fire truck should radio the dispatcher and inform them of the new fire.  The dispatcher might already have another fire truck on the way or they might redirect the truck to the recently observed fire.\n\nYou also have to consider the type of fire involved.  A fire at a hospital full of patients will have higher priority than a fire an an empty warehouse.  Each case is different.

"Her's the LONG ANSWER. Don't read on if you have a limited attention span...\n\nMost Liberals don't hate America. Some do no doubt. What I think is that when some consevative talking head comes on the tube and says Liberals are baaaaad!!!!, many people swallow it. There are many impressionable people in this country who are DAMN mad and want to quench the bloodlust generated by the 9/11 attack. Capitalizing on this wave of patriotic zeal the hard core neo-cons (which are not the same as average Republicans) manipulated the entire post attack national conversation. They saw this national tragedy as a way to implement a broad and radical shift in U.S. foreign policy. The Neo-Cons were able to do this because nobody, Republican or Democrat had the balls to stand up to this radiacalism in the shadow of 9/11. The small govornment, fiscaly responsible Republicans have watched in disbelief as our budgetary spending has gone where no tax and spend Liberal ever dared take it. Inflating the budget wouldn't be so bad if it went to sensible programs for security and to update ifrastructure.But instead it is being used as thank you money in the form of ""pork barrel "" spending around the country, into the districts of those congressman and senators who vote in favor of the Neo-Con agenda.\n The term Liberal is batted around so much it's funny. What the traditional notion is referring to is a tax and spend agenda. Giving poor and underprivelaged people breaks and assistance in a multitude of areas, thus taking money from the people who earn money. These Liberals are actually really angry with the current administration for the way it uses tax breaks for the wealthy. Then using the budgetary process gives more money to the wealthy via the industrial war production inflated by the war on terror. Then it gives  no-bid contracts to companies such as KBR (Haliburten) and others connected to the Neo-Con teat.\nWhat you have is a giant spending machine where the profits keep returning to the same people. This notion has yet to sink in with most republicans. They are still too enraged by 9/11 to open their eyes to what is happening. They are being manipulated to cast out the Liberals with all of their uppity talk of Constitutional law and limited Executive power. Those aren't sexy ideas to think about and for this reason most of the ranting conservatives simply roll their eyes and shake their heads,and proclaim ""We should pitty those poor deluded Liberals"".\nWell one day (or not) the rest of the country will wake up and join the Liberals. The old fasion Reagan Conservatives will wake up the quickest. They'll wonder why G.W. hasn't seen fit to put an end to the orgy of spending. Why would we mortgage our future so a handful of companys can prosper in the near-term? That doesn't seem like conservativism. The very reason for anti-Liberal angst (out of controll spending) is the lifeblood of the current administration. Only this time the poor don't see the benefits. It is the mega-corporations getting our tax dollars without the oversight of the Congressional Budget Oversight Commitee.\nIt all boils down to this: Aside from their left wing social views, Liberals are actually doing the work of the minority in any democracy. They are trying to balance the impulse of the current leadership to gorge on as much money and power as they can before their time is up.\nThe rhetoric is so amusing. Those stupid Liberals. When will they ever learn? It seems our job as citizens isn't to think for ouselves but is to regurgitate the meaningless and empty words of our righteous benefactors the Neo-Conservative puppet masters. All of you Liberals and Conservatives should be thinking for youselves. It is a pity there are so many uneducated people in this country who speak so loudly. They try to convince the masses that it is better not to be ""smart"". ""You don't want to be like those elitist "

"One reason, I believe, is because they have gotten more organized and more open in thier ways.  I know that many right-wing conservatives are connected with Christian religions.  I also know that many churches in the past election handed out election materials to their congregations and some preached that it was a moral necessity to vote for the right-wing conservative.  The TV evangelists were especially strong on this, but I know people who said that even in the Catholic church they preached the ""rightness"" of those who opposed abortion.\n\nAs a whole, the left-wing balance is not as organized.  And it has become complacent in the past (meaning they do not tend to vote as much).  \n\nI also know that, as a country, we tend to swing back and forth, like a pendelum.  So the more the right-wing conservatives gain power, the more vocal those in the opposite corner, and many in the middle ground become, and we eventually reach a pivot point where we cycle again toward the middle.\n\nIMHO (in my humble opinion)"

Yes, I know the peldge of allegiance. and Yes I very much so mean it when I say it ever time I say it. The reason being is that i have a husband that served in the united states of america, a friend whom just passed whom served, and a high scholl friend whom just got back nhome from the iraqi war. And to military personell it holds great meaning that if we are not a country that is willing to stand for its beliefs, it politics, it people and their rights, and to believe in god what would become of all of us would we just stop caring, fighting for our rights, and not believeing that their is a god who watches over us. Not this family we strongly believe in the pledge of alleigance and always will not mattter what. And one other thing before I go The most touching thing that I have seen recently and really didn't understand it is when I attended my husbands friends funeral whom just passed his family gave him a military funeral and when they salute the flag and the military personell and you see the flag draped over the casket it hits you like a ton of bricks right in the heart, you start to understand that all of the service members out here fighting for all of us are doing it because it is something to believe in and love for our country and then when they fold the flag and give it to the the family and they hold it in their hands and you see the pain and hurt in their eyes and hearts you can only appreciate the time and the service that they done for their country and it hits home right to the heart, and then when they salute the final salute to the service members whom has passed or whom is comming home it touches you in the deepest part of your heart. So when you ask do I mean it yes yes YES I DO! My final thought is never forget that we as a country need to fight for what is ours, and we are one nation and we need to be proud, and appreciate what our service members previous, yesterday, today, and tommorow are fighting for and salute them for all of the heroic things that they go through because they believe in one nation under god and want to protect it so shouldn't we also. Thank you for the question and I appreciate you asking this. God Bless
Who knows. With the government its hard to tell. To me the definition of politics-liers and cheaters. No offense to any politicians out there, just my oppinion.
Yeah, Virginia is now 5%.
"Usually a kickback is to a person who is in a decision making position or position of influence when it comes to government contracts.\n\nA company tells them, ""If you get us hired or get us the contract, we'll give you x amount of dollars...""  or some other thing of value.\n\nThe person receiving the kickback then accepts the contract or recommends it for approval to whoever makes the decision."

Within the first 5 minutes he will mention 9/11 (amazing how he has turned the biggest failure in our nation's history into the high point of his career) he will also remind us that we're at war with terrism in the first 5 minutes and repeat that and 9/11 at least four more times.\nHe will smirk once and then keep that stupid smirk on his face for the entire speech.\nHe will mispronounce at least ten words. He will mispronounce nucular at least 5 times and terrism and terrists 15 times each.\nHe will wear out every worn out talking points he has already worn out, which are too many to count.\n\nBonus points names you will not hear: Rove, Delay, Abrahamoff, Enron, Kenny Boy Lay, Scooter Libby, Brownie, Halliburton.
The answer is that we live in a real world, not a theoretical argument one.\n\nReality check (be honest): Do you want Iran to have nuclear weapons?\n\nReality: Israel already has nuclear weapons, so you can't take them away.
The article that you posted says it all.  I can't add any more than that.
Although the MOS is being phased out of the US Army, the equipment is still in use today.\n\nThe AN/PPS-5B radar set has been modified from an analog detection system to a digital system. This new system is the AN/PPS-5D and is connected to a ruggedized laptop computer that shows target detection on real time mapping software.

yes,she is my #1 role model!\nfinally someone who agrees with me!
"Technically, children born in the U.S. whose parents are not citizens of the U.S. are not automatically U.S. Citizens (contrary to popular myth).  That being said, even if the child is a U.S. citizen the parents do not automatically become U.S. citizens.  They must go through the naturalization process like every other citizen-to-be must.\n\nThe 17th Amendment deals with the popular election of Senators, not U.S. Citizenship.  The 14th Amendmendment deals with citizenship, the due process of law, and the election of Representatives.\n\nI stand partially corrected, however.  There is currently an ongoing debate whether or not children of illegal immigrants born in the U.S. are automatically citizens.  Since the parents have not vowed to relinquished their loyalty to their home country they are not ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" of the U.S.  This will likely be heatedly debated for the next few years until the illegal immigration problem in this country is worked out.\n\nRegardless, the Canadian parents still need to go through the naturalization process...they cannot ""automatically"" become citizens."
Yes, many terrorist have been making sweet love there for quite some time; however, this is not the only place terrorist have been known to breed.
media is business above everything else. one should understand this before blindly taking in everything that is put forth. Most media organizations have inclinations towards certain political parties and corporate clients. While it is important to keep up ethics, it isnt always easy to do so. the media industry , just like any other industry is pressurised for various issues by various sources. For example , a newspaper might receive huge ad revenue from say a car manufacturer. If that car company launches a new product, the newspaper will be pressurised to cover the event and give it a positive slant though that is not exactly what the newspaper's editorial team would want to do if they werent pressurised into doing so by marketing and sales department. Likewise, a channel which receives majority of its funding from a political party , either directly of indirectly, would put forth stories only in favor of that particular party. Though the stories might appear not appear to be taking stands, subtly and subconsciously , the language used in the script would very discreetly influence the audience and fashion a change in the attitude of the end viewer. This is how we develop certain views about certain issues. This not only applies to an individual but also to the society at large. Continuous exposure to similar content that puts forth sterotypical views about certain issues cause the end receiver to develop the same views as most forms of media are assertive and suggestive rather than interactive. \n\nSo, the question whether the media is biased is a very broad. It is a business at the end of the day and it is how you look at it and how you take it. If you can read between lines and assess what is shown on screen, it isnt biased. But if you cant to do it, yes it is biased. I would say, the media business is a pure play of human psychology. While there isnt anything that is false that is being put forth , one should understand that it isnt entirely true either. So, it all depends on how you look at it and whether you allow the businessmen to play with your weakenesses.
Depends on if you actually want to strap a gun on and go to Iraq...
I haven't had this experience myself, but I located a couple of links. The first is from a 1953 document, stating that only NEMs will be awarded after the existing supply of MCEMs is exhausted.\n\nHowever, I have found notes here and there that lead me to believe that it is has been issued in recent years.\n\nI recommend that you send an email to the address in the second link.
Yes, in fact, drug laws are largely ineffective anyway.  I don't think anything in the constitution gives the govt. the power to control these decisions, which should be decided at the state level. In the case of medical use, what is the risk?
It's not just about taxes. Many illegal immigrants commit violent acts among other things. 9/11 happened because nobody gave a damn when the highjacker's visas expired. Poor border control and illegal immigration is not only costly, it's extremely dangerous.
No one is keeping track of your income. Even if it was correctly reported by your employers to the IRS, the IRS won't have this information at hand for several months, and by that time they will be more than willing to charge you interest and penalties if you have not paid taxes on that income.
A far better question would be..Who is funding her?  Someone has to be supporting her, paying her house note or rent, putting food in her mouth, printing those tshirts and banners and signs, putting gas in her car, paying her insurance.....Where is all that money coming from?  She's not going to a job everyday, so where's the money source?  Who is the money source?  What terrorist group is paying her to harass the US government?\n\nDon't forget that her son was killed AFTER he RE-enlisted.  He would be angry over her actions.  He believed he was doing good.
I haven't been able to find anything like that by searching the US Code, and it doesn't sound like something that is even within Congress' powers. That is clearly something that each state should be able to decide for itself. They would have to make an extremely hard case for it being an interstate commerce issue, and without that, it's definitely unconstitutional.
Hi, I'm from Iran, and I don't like their idea. What kind of reason is to band CNN because they mistakenly said that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad wanted Nuclear Weapons. And knowing that I'm from Iran, no they don't want nuclear weapons. But CNN made a mistake, and it is no reason to be banned. Iran has turned to a very strict country after the revolution 27 years ago. Since the revolution, people can't wear shorts, t-shirts, sandals, or anything. Women have to have their head covered. And must be always be covered. \nSince Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became president, he has banned music. I read recently that bands have moved in the basement, and that they must play illigally.
In every day life its difficult to be 100% honest,,the wrong economics makes it that way,,so the law is there to pretend that we are moving in right direction,,and do the large scale befooling,,
its probably because (in democrats case) they just can't stand having a Republican who didn't go to an Ivy League school from TEXAS actually legally obtain the presidency. Well, they're also kinda rude.

What do you mean by drug tax stamp?  Are you referring to immigrants in the United States?
"Yes, but no one knows where that point is.\n\nGovernment debt increases the cost of capital.  Capital is bought and sold like any other commodity.  When you buy capital, the transaction is called a ""loan"" or ""mortgage.""  Government debt reduces the supply of capital and thus increases the cost (interest rate) of borrowing money.  This inhibits business by making it harder for businesses and individuals to borrow money.\n\nIf government debt becomes too large, business comes to a standstill and the economy would be in danger of collapsing.  No one thinks that the US economy is in danger of standing still or collapsing from government debt."
I would support it if it was necessary to keep the government of Iran from getting nuclear weapons.
A bigger government means more everyday control of its citizens.\n\nA smaller (less) government means less everyday control of its citizens.\n\nControl is the opposite of freedom.\n\nWhich is better depends on whether you prefer being controlled or being free.
Depends on the religion and your definition of religion. I have a relationship with Christ when I became a born-again Christian 35 years ago, and I have never been more free. My freewill is intact and it is awesome to have assurance of eternal life.\n\nThe United States was founded on the precepts of the Bible and the freedom in Christ was the model for the founding fathers to pass on within its framework.

because their value systems are completely different.\n\nno arab countries have yet adopted a modern position that includes the rule of law, equal rights, and the rights of the individual over the rights of the state.  Israel embodies those principles unquestionably.  Thus the conflict.\n\nunfortunately for the arabs, the rest of the world is moving away from the middle age mentality in which tens or hundreds of millions of arabs live.  Therefore you will not see an end to the conflict in your lifetime.

While there is no real definition for what a actual hippie was, at least there wasn't in the day.  People would get together I can remember and discuss who was an actual hippie and who wasn't.  Now the older generation knew for sure that everone who wore their hair long was a for sure hippie, however that was not always the case.  Where did they go, well they went from not trusting anybody over thirty to not trusting anybody below thirty,(seems to be a common age there),some became yuppies and all remain free spirts at heart.  The hippies did not go anywhere they just became the establishment that they used to fight.  It all comes full circle.  Before hippies it was beatnik's each genaration has those that do not fit in to the common, but will always become as they age to perfection.
yes in some places, it is true
CONSERVATIVE
Both major parties have individuals who lean left or right, especially on particular issues.  Liberals lean left or even far left.  Conservatives lean right or even far right.  Moderates are middle of the road on most issues and are present in both parties.  There are also independents who are not a party and are not loyal to either party.  They may be individuals who are even more left or right of center.  Being left or right often refers to the fact that political bodies (such as Congress) are seated such that one party is together on the left of an aisle and the other party is on their right.\n\nLiberals and Conservatives often agree that something needs to be done but often not how to do it, or who should pay for it.\n\nPerhaps Welfare is a good example.  Both Liberals and Conservatives support Welfare, however Liberals allowed the system to reach the point where many people believed that the Government owed then a living while Conservatives saw it as a bridge over troubled circumstances back to self-sufficiency.  Welfare case workers feared losing their jobs if they did not maintain a long client list while others wondered why a low-paid worker should pay taxes to support a person who could work.  Finding the happy medium (the job of the moderates?) is often difficulty.
This Constitutional Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 18) is also referred to as the sweepings clause.  “To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested in the Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.”\n\nThe Constitutional Convention had a great deal of debate concerning the meaning and need for this clause.  In short the initial meaning of this clause was that the congress had the power to enact what was required to enforce its delegated powers, that is, the new laws would be necessary to enforce powers which had been properly delegated to the federal government.  \n\nFrom 1801 to 1835 the Supreme Court of the United States fell under the sway of Chief Justice John Marshall who believe in a very strong general government as did Alexander Hamilton.  Marshall opined (in part) in McCulloch v. Maryland [1819] that the words of Article I, Section 8, Clause 18 “Necessary” and “Proper” had the same meaning.  Therefore laying the foundation for the Congress to enact any law they believed to be necessary.  Both Madison and Jefferson disagreed with this court decision, but it has stood as precedence for ensuing cases to use it to strengthen the position of the federal government.  From this perspective the “Elastic” was stretched out of all shape relative to original intent.

You mean Yahoo as a company or the community of people on Yahoo Answers?\n\nI wouldn't say any of the above have been bias to Mr. Bush. In fact, I've seen people voice all kinds of different opinions on his politics and on his person in Answers.\n\nAnd if some (or many even) of them are negative, this has little to do with Yahoo or being bias. It's about freedom of speech, how the politics affect those people, and lets not forget many of them do not live in the US, but in places like Europe, where Mr. Bush has a quite low popularity quotient.
Ahmadinejad, all the way. Chavez can over react a little. W can be just plain thoughtless, redundant, and a little ignorant.  Ahmadinejad on the other hand is stupid and inflammatory. Not a good combo.

They're on the rolls like everyone else and can get picked, but most likely the attorneys in the case would seek their exclusion. This is what happened a few weeks ago when Justice Breyer reported for jury duty.

There exists no generally accepted distinction.  But there are a few disnctions that people support.  Most notably is that Morality descibes interpersonal relationships, wheares Ethics is a quasi-scientific study of sysytems of morality.\n\nI think it was Kant who made my favorite distiction, that Morality is how I wish to be treated, whereas Ethics are how I wish everyone to be treated.  A difference of scale, if you will.

Good for you, however I wouldn't be posting my children's pics on the web but that's just me.
You really can't.  Almost any source has it's own agenda (whether it being favoring one particular candidate or one particular issue).\nThe best thing you can do for any political race, instead of trying to find one or two good sources, read as many sources as you can.\n\nThis is the Internet age.  Check out the campaign websites, read one or two larger newspapers, one or two smaller newspapers and especially one really local one (like for just your county).  Then you'll get the most possible information, and you'll be able to see what information is accurate and what is bias and make the best, most informed decision.
"if i understand your question correctly, you are asking if a Monarchy is any better/worse than a Constitutional Democracy?\n\nwell - short answer - Absolute Power Absolutely Corrupts. \n\nin a Constitutional society - there are supposed failsafes in place to keep any one person or party from having complete control.\n\nin a Monarchy - complete control is untested, expect by a popular uprising or coup d'etat (overthrowing the current power by force).\n\nhowever, if you look at our current Constitutional Democracy, it almost feels more like a Monarchy. those with the most wealth pay whoever the current leader is to bend the rules for them, to make them more profit. \n\nit just goes to show you - neither method is perfect. \n\ni would say that the one positive that a Monarchy has over a Consitutional society is this: a Consitutional society can become apathetic to its involvement in the government. the ""failsafes"" that are supposed to keep our leaders from corrupting have failed us greatly. \n\ni believe that we, as a nation, rely too heavily on those laws created over 200 years ago, though they do not work any longer.\n\nwe have been lulled into a false sense of security and have too much faith in our leaders and our system. this unflinching faith means that we are not so inclined to put pressure on our corrupt leaders, as the masses of a monarchy would be. \n\nto put it more simply - we think we are safe, so we dont do anything to keep our leaders from abusing us. \n\neither way, though, you generally end up with the same result, because ""Absolute Power Absolutely Corrupts"""
"The term ""social contract"" is metaphorical.  It does not refer to an actual piece of paper which specific parties signed and dated, which can be taken to court and enforced.  A legal contract is all that, for the most part.  It is possible to enforce an oral contract in law, but it is done by analogy to a written contract.  A social contract, in contrast, is not analogous.  It is a way to describe the idea of a committment between government and citizens, or between one group of people and another.  It is a metaphor only, and a judge has no jurisdiction over its enforcement."
"Besides those homeless that, unfortunately, are legitimately mentally ill, there is not much of a reason for poverty. But in this, I do not mean that it is the government's responsibility.\nIt is not the job of our government to ensure you are middle class, rich or whatever. Our government is only there to ensure that the general welfare for every citizen is PROMOTED, not provided. This government/country DOES promote the general welfare. Business is encouraged, freedom is put forth. Everyone has the opportunity to do something in this country.\n\nBut the government does NOT exist, nor should it exist, to redistribute wealth from those that do/have earned it, to give to those who ""feel' they deserve more. It is up to the individual to succeed or fail. That is part of your freedom. If you want to have the $$$ you have to put forth the effort. There is NO excuse. If you want it bad enough, it is up to you to find the way. There are plenty of ways out there. Join the military, work a second job, take a community colege course or two, put forth effort at your job to receive promotion, etc. \n\nI get tired of hearing the whiners with the sob stories. ""But I have 3 kids and I can't do this."" ... well quite frankly you chose to do the things in your life that have led you to this point. Everyone has responsibilities. And as we learned in the military ""Suck it up and drive on."" Do what you have to do. It is not the government's job to make up for the choices we have made as individuals. We make our bed, so we have to lie in it."

Go to www.gowda.com or call (248) 932-0630 ... This is an immigration law firm. Mr. Amarnath Gowda and his associates will have the answers you need or can direct you to someone who does..
Unfortunately you didn't provide enough information to get a clear answer as much depends on your citizenship and your plans. However, even if you are an American citizen he will not be able to enter the United States without a visa, husband or not.  Visa free entry to the US is only for American citizens or citizens of the 39 countries in the Visa Waiver Program (Argentina lost this status in 2002).  Of course, if he is Argentine, he is probably also eligible for citizenship in Spain or Italy (through his ancestry), which passport he could use to come and go freely, for stays up to 90 days.\n\nIf you get married abroad, you will have to file an I-130 petition to get him an immigrant visa in order to enter the United States.  If you reside in Argentina, you can do this in BA.  Buenosaires.USEmbassy.gov. \n\nIf you are truly resident there, meaning usually for more than six months, you can go into American citizen services and file your I-130 petition.  In about six months your husband will have an interview and a physical.  If all is okay, he will get his immigrant visa and then one he arrives in the US, he will be able to get his green card.\n\nAlternately, you could choose to file an I-129 for a fiancee visa, which will have him apply at the Embassy in about a year for a fiancee visa (K-1) to come to the United States for the wedding.  After the wedding, which has to take place within 90 days, he will start the process for his green card.\n\nA third option if you are living in Argentina and have no plans to live in the US is for him to get a tourist visa, which he can use if he can show ties to his country of residence.  A tourist visa is not available to intending immigrants, however, and should not be used to enter the US to get married (a consular officer knowing this fact would refuse anyway) nor to reside.  However, if you can show that you are a bonafide expat, and that he has ties there, it shouldn't be a problem to get a tourist visa.\n\nSo you see, if I knew your situation better I could advise you better, as it really varies.  Good luck.

If they have any favorite foods that are shippping safe, any music that they like that maybe they can not find over there, a personal video of family and friends wishing them well and safe return, pictures, if they have any kids CDS of them talking to them or pics, personal hygiene products.   A very close friends of mine would send her son  deodorant, music CDS, pop tarts, soda, body wash, sun glasses, video pics of family and friends.  I would ask the next time i was in contact with them and ask them what they would really like to have.  Also maybe some phone calling cards so they can talk to everyone they need too.

Political correctness , like racial discrimination, is an invention of the white man, who seems to love cutting off his nose to spite his face.  It makes me wonder whether we're living in some kind of dream world.   What made us this crazy?  Christianity?\nNone of the non-white countries offer any such liberal terms to immigrants (refugees !!!).  In China or Japan, you can spend 20 years there, leading a model life, marry a local girl, ask nothing of the government, give your whole existence to the state.  Will you smell any benefits?  Ha ha ha!  Get citizenship?  Ha ha ha!
Hardly an option, but i guess Pakistan's a little tolerable, due to its physical proximity to India!

They may ask for big fees and it also depends on the amount. Ask the receiver how it could be done.

"The original idea was that if a public entity, such as a local city government, needed a piece of land, and the owner absolutely refused to sell, they could be forced to give it up at fair market value ""for the common good.""  Today, it is being most horribly abused, to condemn people's land so it can be used for commercial enterprises like shopping centers.  The Institute for Justice, which I think is www.ij.org, is on it.  This (and other Libertarian fights against injustice) matters so much to me that I've named the Institute for Justice as the contingent beneficiary in my will.  The fact that my estate is tiny is not the point; it's the thought that counts.  Besides, a hundred tiny estates could add up to a pretty fair chunk of money."
"Muslim outrage huh. OK ... let's do a little historical review. Just some lowlights:\n\n\nMuslims fly commercial airliners into buildings in New York City. No Muslim outrage.\n\nMuslim officials block the exit where school girls are trying to escape a burning building because their faces were exposed. No Muslim outrage.\n\nMuslims cut off the heads of three teenaged girls on -their way to school in Indonesia. A Christian school. No Muslim outrage.\n\nMuslims murder teachers trying to teach Muslim children in Iraq. No Muslim outrage.\n\nMuslims murder over 80 tourists with car bombs outside cafes and hotels in Egypt. No Muslim outrage.\n\nA Muslim attacks a missionary children's school in India. Kills six. No Muslim outrage.\n\nÂ· Muslims slaughter hundreds of children and teachers in Beslan, Russia. Muslims shoot children in the back. No Muslim outrage.\n\nLet's go way back. Muslims kidnap and kill athletes at the Munich Summer Olympics. No Muslim outrage.\n\nMuslims fire rocket-propelled grenades into schools full of children in Israel. No Muslim outrage.\n\nMuslims murder more than 50 commuters in attacks on London subways and busses. Over 700 are injured. No Muslim outrage.\n\nMuslims massacre dozens of innocents at a Passover Seder. No Muslim outrage.\n\nMuslims murder innocent vacationers in Bali. No Muslim outrage.\n\nMuslim newspapers publish anti-Semitic cartoons. No Muslim outrage\n\nMuslims are involved, on one side or the other, in almost every one of the 125+ shooting wars around the world. No Muslim outrage.\n\nMuslims beat the charred bodies of Western civilians with their shoes, then hang them from a bridge. No Muslim outrage.\n\nNewspapers in Denmark and Norway publish cartoons depicting Mohammed. Muslims are outraged.\n\n\nDead children. Dead tourists. Dead teachers. Dead doctors and nurses. Death, destruction and mayhem around the world at the hands of Muslims .. no Muslim outrage ... but publish a cartoon depicting Mohammed with a bomb in his turban and all hell breaks loose.\n\nCome on, is this really about cartoons? They're rampaging and burning flags. They're looking for Europeans to kidnap. They're threatening innkeepers and generally raising holy Muslim hell not because of any outrage over a cartoon. They're outraged because it is part of the Islamic jihadist culture to be outraged. You don't really need a reason. You just need an excuse. Wandering around, destroying property, murdering children, firing guns into the air and feigning outrage over the slightest perceived insult is to a jihadist what tailgating is to a Steeler's fan.\n\nI know and understand that these bloodthirsty murderers do not represent the majority of the world's Muslims. When, though, do they become outraged? When do they take to the streets to express their outrage at the radicals who are making their religion the object of worldwide hatred and ridicule? Islamic writer Salman Rushdie wrote of these silent Muslims in a New York Times article three years ago.\n\n""As their ancient, deeply civilized culture of love, art and philosophical reflection is hijacked by paranoiacs, racists, liars, male supremacists, tyrants, fanatics and violence junkies, why are they not screaming?""\n\nIndeed. Why not?"
Of course freedom of speech is protected.  As with all freedoms it is not cake once baked but a flowing stream where the banks must always be worked with to keep the flowing free. \n\nTo restate the obvious:\n\nCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.  - First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\nThis words as stated are clear and concise, but they are not cast in concrete with no maintenance need.  Rather, they are a fertile bed which needs constant care of weeding and fertilizing.  The court is one type of weeding . . . . \n\n“The main purpose of constitutional provisions like the First Amendment was said to be, to prevent all such previous restraints upon publications as had been practiced by other governments, and they do not prevent the subsequent punishment of such as may be deemed contrary to the public welfare.”\n\nre: Patterson v. Colorado [1907].\n\nJustice Holmes expanded when he opined in Schenck v. United States [1919] “It well may be that the prohibition of laws abridging the freedom of speech is not confined to previous restraints . . . . But the character of every act depends upon the circumstances in which it is done.  (Then he uttered that most famous phrase)  The most Stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic.”\n\nThe point is the that the courts have altered  and refined our view of this amendment (not the freedom).\n\nSo too is lobbying (a form of petitioning) a tool you can use to ensure that your perspective of this amendment (vis-à-vis the individual right of freedom of speech) is given worthy attention.\n\nFreedom of speech is real and protected, but the question is, will you (any you) work to ensure it stays protected?.

wow, you've sure done alot of thinking on the issues. i'm  extremely concerned about us outsourcing our ports to terrorist nations. what the hell - why don't we just outsource the secret service to iraq. as far as katrina is concerned i feel that they did what they could for those people. if you have millions of people in this situation the government  cannot possibly take care of them all. it doesn't matter who's running the show. i would firstly blame the people living there who were warned to evacuate the city but didn't. it falls down to personal responsibility. \n\nperscription benefits for seniors - who will pay? it's a lot of loot.\n\ngeorge bush has failed the people in this country by not securing the borders and  ports and too much spending, something usually done by the dems.  as far as arnold s. is concerned he seems more concerned about making a name for himself then anything else. he has sure switched sides big time. i don't think he is concerned about the ports because people would think he's a racist - go figure.
Jewish political power in America is unassailable, as it had become in Germany before Hitler.  Hitler's solution was the only answer there and then.  It resulted in what he called the Jewish War - WW11.  Because he lost that war, everything he said is now called wrong.  In time, history will vindicate his opinions, unless politically correct hypocrisy succeeds in permanently smothering the truth, as it has done up to now.\nThe terrible mess in Iraq, called a war, is very certainly a Jewish war.  Israel is the one and only country which benefits from it and it was Israel which caused it - or, for the benefit of the brain-dead majority who will read this, the American support of Israel.  It was, dear dumbos, this support which turned the Islamic world against America, culminating in 9/11, which in turn caused the Iraq attack.

"This will be a debated subject for as long as the United States is a functioning republic. There is no question that the initial reaction to any type of violence is repulsion and to some degree fear. You and I (and thankfully most Americans) wake up every day, trying to do what is best for ourselves and our communities. It never crosses our minds to harm another.\n\nBut there is another element in our society that is not wired this way. The are predators who seek out harm innocent people. Most of us will never be a victim of a violent assault or an attempt on our lives or on the lives of a loved one; but, heaven forbid, if that situation were to arises, how would you respond? If you give up control to the predator and let them injure or kill you or your loved one, then that is a conscious choice. If however, you value your life and the the lives of your loved ones, you will realize that the police cannot protect us one on one.\n\nMany studies have shown that weapons in the hand of law abiding citizens are used thousands of times of year to PREVENT a violent act from occurring. A recently published report by the Federal Government stated that the numerous restrictive gun laws (including the Assault Weapons Ban) had had no effect in reducing violent crime. In fact, just the opposite was true. In each of the States that have passed Concealed Weapons Laws, violent crime has been reduced.\n\nIf you take the time to study these statistics in thoughtful way, you may begin to understand that it is not the instrument (the gun) that is inherently harmful.\n\nCareful study of the intent of the 2nd Amendment reveals that citizens of that day were extremely distrustful of a central government. No doubt, the citizens of any repressive regime would agree that only allowing the government, police or military to have the guns is a bad idea.\n\nAnyway, this is just some food for thought. I know that you probably have already made up your mind on this issue. I rarely (if ever) had heard anyone say lately...""Gee, I never thought of it that way...""\n\nPerhaps you will surprise me."
The site listed is correct. Don't forget to return the bracelet to the person or person's family when they come home.
Yes, the Holocaust is a historical fact. The actual number of Jews killed depends on how you compute it.\nComparing the registered Jews in Europe from register before and after the war, you get missing names that vary between 5.8 and 6.2 mil. Body counts go around 3 mil, death camp registers and on-site execution reports may account for over 5 mil deaths.\nThe exact number is unknown but most historians agree to a nunmber a little over 5 million, while revisionists say the number is exaggerate and have tone it down to what direct evidece states (around 3 mil) while Zionists bring the number around 7 mil.
He's not.  Kanye West was so stupid for saying that.  They told those people to EVACUATE New orleans.  The ones that stayed behind were just dumb.  Sorry to be mean, but it's true.  If you live in a city below sea level and see a cat. 5 hurricane heading your way your best bet is to leave!! DERRR.. And it's not like there were only black ppl that live in new orleans.  there were white people on the news too.\n\n\n*sniff* sniff* my feelings were hurt. BLAH\n\nSeriosly I'm sure all the people could have found a way out.  If you're old, call 911 and tell them to come get you and take you somewhere safe.  if you're poor go to a shelter and remember to bring your own food. If people were smart and read up on things they would have realized that most emergency shelters DO NOT provide food/water.  So dont' give me a sob story.  By the way if the continent were flooding you'd better bet your butt I'd atleast find a hollowed out log to jump into when the water started rising.  Not stayed in my apartment like a dumby

"Yes there is a free database on government grants - but government hardly give grants to individuals. \n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nThese government grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.\n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for ""students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices."" Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs."
"I have faith in our young people, they are not nearly as clueless as some think. They see evil for what it is. They know evil by it's works and by it's deeds.\nNeocons want to buy jobs for $12 and have you work for $5. That way they put $7 in their pocket and do nothing. They call it ""Temporay Employeement"". Look at what the Republicans have taken in to date in cash for the next election. The bribes and payoffs are a blight on Americans."

Oh, I an about a million other people really really hope so.  Congress is working on a bill to throw people in jail for giving an illegal immigrant some food or shelter or a ride to work.  For real, I am not exaggerating.  I think/hope/believe they wouldn't do that without at least giving people an opportunity to become legal.  But then again, we've been waiting now almost 5 years with many false alarms.  We wait and hope with the anticipation of the falsly imprisoned making one last appeal.
chslaw beat me to it again.\n\nHe's right.  You have to prove 1st that your lawyer failed to exercise the kind of professional duty you can reasonably expect. (sounds like you've got that).  But 2nd, you have to prove that his failure to do so caused your case to fail.\n\nGood luck finding an attorney to sue.  In my experience, lawyers are very hesitant to sue their own unless there's a very egregious screw up.
Social Security doesn't cover the retired because America doesn't have the funds to keep it going.  We are in a very high deficit right now and are deeper in it since the last Bush was out. We were seeing light at the end of the tunnel when Clinton was in office, but George W. is making that a farther and further reality with this war on terror.  We need to create new companies to provide competition here and abroad to generate revenue to pay off our debts.\n\nHope this helps.

"The issue of Iran is a complicated one.\n\nOh, to answer the nationality question, I'm an American. But I'm also a political scientist, so I look at this a bit differently.\n\nIran's nuclear enrichment program is really a diversion. You have to understand that Iran, along with Iraq and North Korea, were labeled members of an ""axis of evil."" Now, the United States invaded Iraq. And the Iranians know that the United States could overrun North Korea in about six weeks. Add to that the fact that we have troops in Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as Turkey, and what do you have?\n\nA surrounded and very nervous Iran.\n\nThey see that as soon as North Korea starts tossing around nuclear weaponry as a potential, the United States quickly backed off any sort of war footing and started talking negotiation. In reality, nuclear weapons (or the perception therein) give the Iranian government a big bargaining chip.\n\nPlus, the United States is much less likely to invade Iran if they have a suspicion that the minute they step over the boarder, New York vanishes in a cloud of radioactive dust.\n\nAs for nuclear experiements, I'm assuming you mean testing a bomb. They won't, at least if they're smart. THhey'll give the impression that they have one, maybe even parade one down main street of Theran. But to test one would make it clear that they have a nuclear weapon, and that makes them a target.\n\nMy biggest fear about Iran having a weapon of mass destruction is not that the Iranian government would use it. Indeed, they have no system for delivering it, even to Israel. What the fear is for me is that they will lose the bomb - that is, some scientist who feels like the West screwed him might give one to a terrorist.\n\nIn reality, the fewer nuclear weapons on the planet, the safer we all are."
I think McVeigh was one of those people who are looking for validation.  Because he was a little strange, a little different, he didn't get that in the mainstream of society.  So, he got in with a bunch of kooks and he looked pretty normal and as a matter of fact he could stand out and be a leader in that group of right wing conspiracy kooks.  He was relatively smart and he was also very guliible at the same time.  He was perfect lacky for the nut jobs that he associated with.\n\nHe was a model soldier in the U.S. Army because he was gun ho and followed orders, never questioned authority.  But when he was rejected by the Green Berets because he failed their grueling physical tests, he lost faith.  This rejection devasted him.  It created anger toward the American government and military.  He channeled his anger into right wing extremist hate groups.  The very reasons which made him a great soldier for the Army then made him a solider for right wing hate groups.
"There are several types of fire extinguishers available, but the best type for home and farm use is a multipurpose ""ABC"" type extinguisher. ABC type extinguishers generally use ammonium phosphate as the active chemical to extinguish a fire and are capable of putting out most common fires.\n\nExtinguishers are rated for the type of fire they are made to extinguish.\n\n    * A - Ordinary combustible materials such as wood, paper, hay, etc.\n    * B - Flammable liquids such as gas, oil, grease and other petroleum products.\n    * C - Electrical fires. \n\nAs this listing shows, an ABC type extinguisher is capable of extinguishing most fires."

One of the biggest things with this is that it is an american company. Because they are in mexico, the company should have some type of code of ethics policy for working outside the US.

Dictatorships come to save the people from a greater danger. Wrong! They come for dictators (and their business partners) to do their business. And when there's nothing else left to take away, they leave.\n\nDictatorships (at least in Latin America) were only about ideology. Wrong! Dictators (and their accomplices) stole money and properties from the people they captured, killed and took their children away from.\n\nDictatorships are a necessary evil. Wrong! In democracy, a bad government is taken away when its term ends, by voting for a better government. There's no need to call dictators in.\n\nDictatorships have high moral standards, and act according to them. Wrong! What's moral about overthrowing a democratic government, in the first place. And what is moral about killing, robbing, making people disappear, and all of that in the name of a supposed ideology?\n\nDictators are justified in that they know better than the misinformed unprepared people about how to rule a country. Wrong! Even if people are misinformed and unprepared, that is no justification for going against their decisions. Inform and prepare the people better, instead!
The framer's of our constitution intentions was to have a cross section of the American people serving in the U.S. Congress.  What has happened is that you have to be rich in order to get elected therefore we are being represented by the top 2% of the government that gets the largest tax breaks.  Is anybody seeing a theme here.  We have both Liberal and Conservative Millionaires in this country and I find it very hard to believe that any rich person actually has the poor peoples needs at heart.  The reason that the Liberals are having so much trouble getting candidates elected these days is the fact that people are starting to see through this as well as the fact that the voter's that vote are actually more conservative.  For any election there are 40% of Voting Age Population not voting and no one knows where they stand except with the apathetic.
THE UNIMAGINABLE but ultimately inescapable truth is that we are going to have to get ready for war with Iran. \n\nWhile we were chasing phantom nuclear weapons in Mesopotamia, next door Iran was busy building real ones. \n\nThe unavoidable reality is that we now need urgently to steel ourselves to the ugly probability that diplomacy will not now suffice: one or way or another, unconscionable acts of war may now be unavoidable. \n\nThose who say war is unthinkable are right. Military strikes, even limited, targeted and accurate ones, will have devastating consequences for the region and for the world.\n\nIf Iran gets safely and unmolested to nuclear status, it will be a threshold moment in the history of the world, up there with the Bolshevik Revolution and the coming of Hitler. \n\nAnd so we must ready ourselves for what may be the unthinkable necessity.
no because today over 100 immigrants are in USA illegaly which they get a job like a Mcdonalds and a legal us citizen could want a job there, you think a that is fair? and also if you open it the border its US's territoy its like opening your door in the open letting everybody in. Then other military forces like mexico could invade with out a problem.
"Fox news can be considered biased toward the republican party, NPR can be considered biased toward the democratic party.\n\nAlthough, I should point out that only Fox news has been shown to have a bias (the owner directs how news will be covered).  Surveys have shown that people who use Fox news as their primary news source are more likely to believe facts that are untrue such as ""There was a connection between Al-Quida and Iraq"", ""WMDs were found in IRAQ"", ""The majority of Iraqis like America"".\n\nNPR listeners tend to have very little chance of believing these falsehoods.  In my view the NPR reports are unbiased.\n\nIt should be noted however that I myself am a biased democrat ;-)\n\nIf you want extreme democratic bias you can look at Michael Moore, some of his views are also untrue and contested.  But, he is not affiliated with any news organizations.\n\nHope this helps."
Well, now these damn fools are blowing up mosques. That is bound to start a civil war and that is just what the insurgents are hoping they will do.  Our guys should just return to base and let the Shiites and the Sunnis duke it out.  Once the killing spree is over they should give an ultimatum to whoever is left.  Form a secular government or we're going home. Religion is the biggest nemises in Iraq.  It clouds every issue brought to the table.  Unless these bone heads wake up and realize this, they will never resolve their differences.  And that is the good news from Iraq!

His office is legally responsible for doing an in-depth security review of all major company sales by foreign businesses.  They review the deals to ensure there are no legal or security concerns before the deal is allowed to go through.  If they run into any concerns they can take steps to mitigate the risks (such as ensuring no one will be placed into sensitive areas, background checks, rescoping the contract, etc...)  This is naturally done in private since we are talking about security concerns and big business deals that can affect the stock of said companies.\n\nIt is possible that his staff reviewed the deal and gave the go-ahead without his direct involvement and he is merely saying he trusts his staff: heck, he did pick a bunch of people who think exactly like him.  Regardless, after reviewing the facts it sounds like opposing the deal would be akin to prejudice.\n\nWe can't stop foreign companies from controlling american interests.  The company that is trying to take control of the ports (they will not be providing security mind you) does an excellent and professional job of managing other ports around the world.\n\nOf course I do enjoy watching the republicans rip apart Bush on the issue.  I imagine it will eventually blow over, it's just no one wants to look weak on security during an election year and there are few opprotunities to show that.  This looks like smoke and mirrors to me.
I think that's a bit of a schwinging comment to make. During the hurricane season in 2005 when Cancun was hit, the weather forecasters on Fox News made a deliberate attempt to show the forecast for Cancun. It could be argued here in the UK that the weather forecasters turn their back on the Republic of Ireland in protest over the 1921 partition. No they don't, they've got to stand somewhere and wherever they stand, they are going to block part of the UK

"German Submarines were sinking ships that they felt were carrying war supplies to the Allies in Europe.  The U.S. lost some merchant marine ships in that process.  However Germany even sank passenger ships that they felt could also be carrying  war supplies.  When a ship was sank carrying over 150 Americans we dropped our ""Isolationist"" stand over WWI and entered the War in April 1917.  American troops altough aligned with the Allies, fought as a separate enity from our Allies.  Our entry to the war brought it to a much quicker end.  \n\nPresident Wilson went to Europe to assist in negotiate the Peace Treaty at Vesailles and although he was instrumental in the founding of the League of Nations, the U.S.Senate never approved the treaty and we never entered the League of Nations."
Many people think Bush is a member of a similar organization.

"Global warming started long before the ""Industrial Revolution"" and the invention of the internal combustion engine. Global warming began 18,000 years ago as the earth started warming its way out of the Pleistocene Ice Age-- a time when much of North America, Europe, and Asia lay buried beneath great sheets of glacial ice."

Russia doenst even have close to the weaposn we have.  That is why China is working so hard to get the weapon embargo that the USA and Europe have on them.

State House or State Senate? There's also federal congressional districts, but Florida has fewer than 30. The districts in either case have little to do with zip codes, and more to do with major highways. A large format of the maps are at the sites below.\n\nEdit: It's not that zip codes don't matter, but that districts cut through zip codes, so people living in the same zip code could be in different districts. It's best to look at the maps and find out where you are.

First, thanks for your service. You are a great American.\n\nI see where you're coming from with the Parking Meter thing. Yes, part of your tax dollars went to pay for the streets, but not all streets have parking meters/permits. Some are free to park on, some it is illegal to park on.\n\nBy making people buy permits to park on a particular street or neighborhood the local government might be trying to serve the residents of that neighborhood by limiting who parks on the street. By putting up parking meters, a city government might be trying to help local merchants by forcing a turnover of parking spots so that more customers can find parking.\n\nThere can be lots of reasons for local governments to do such things, not the least of which is to generate additional revenue to pay for city services. The real disgrace comes when the local governments are inept or corrupt and do not spend our money wisely.
"I've thought about this one for years.\n\nMy theory is that, for the most part, especially those outside of major cities, Americans don't have to worry about other countries. Who is on our border? Canada? They're Americans! Mexico? They just send over tons of illegals! (Note: I personally don't think those last two things.) \n\nThe rest of the world seems far away and not terribly relevant. And, to be honest, for most Americans that is probably fairly accurate. Unless a local factory is moved to South Korea, why would anyone be concerned about South Korea?\n\nThis contrasts with other countries which are constantly reminded of the rest of the world. Small countries - like say the Baltic States - in particular have very good reasons for wondering if their big neighbors will plow through them. Even major European countries - Germany, Poland, France - are constantly reminded of their neighbors on TV, radio etc.\n\nThis sometimes leads to silly reactions in the US like ""France is a traitor."" Well, even if you think French policies hurt the US, France is still a western democracy and in NATO (more or less). Sometimes it seems that people are equating France with the Soviet Union. Get some perspective people!\n\nBack to the media point, American TV shows and movies are major exports around the world. Everyone gets a chance to see us (to the extent that Desperate Housewives and Charlie's Angels represent us). But how often do foreign shows end up in the US? Sure the British will show up on PBS, but more likely foreign shows are Americanized - from Big Brother to the Office. They even tried an American version of Faulty Towers once! (Staring Bea Arthur, forget the name of the show, it stunk and was quickly canceled.)\n\nOn top of this is the American ideal that we are the beacon of democracy in the world. In many respects this has been a good thing (Marshall Plan) but in other more recent foreign policy adventures - which shall remain nameless - it hasn't worked out so well. I think this gives us a superiority complex. And the worst part about it is, we have a pretty darn good country over all (there are major issues) and so that opinion isn't ridicilous.\n\nSo, basically I think it is because we are a big country, relatively isolated by geography, we have a superiority complex, and that we export culture, so most Americans don't need to know - and so don't care too much - about the rest of the world."
"Difficult question you post that could cause many to drop down a ""knee jerk"" answer.  First of course everyone will say that human life is of more value than any natural resource.  But think of all the people who'd die of cold in the winter without oil.  And the economics of high priced oil can leave millions out of work and in some really dire circumstances.  However it's the ""in the long run"" portion of your question that makes me say that war for oil is not worth it.  The correct thing to do, and I believe this with every fiber in my being, is to find ways around the problem of oil.  Capitalism is suppose to be the perfect system where if a resource is not quite as abundant as one would hope, and therefore more expensive, then the market will find a way around it.  New energies, conservation, etc.  The fact that the powerful in business and politics right now don't want to ""waste"" their money researching these things and would rather ride on others backs to fight for cheaper oil is idiotic.  \nOn the bright side, the President mentioned this exact idea in his State of the Union Address.  Whether it was simple lip service or not remains to be seen."

With a population of 1.2 billion, one of the most serious social and economic problems still facing China is its huge population growth. Every year, China's population grows by 14 million people—three-quarters of Australia's entire population! \n\nUp until the 1970s the Chinese government regarded a growing population as a benefit in bringing about swift economic development. By 1963, the average number of children born to a Chinese woman was 7.5. \n\nIn recent decades, China's government has viewed population growth differently. With one-fifth of the world's population, but only 7 per cent of the world's arable land, continuing strong population growth would bring about great hardships, extreme poverty and famine. \n\nThe Chinese government decided in the 1970s to control population growth. This has proved a very complex task. The main strategy the government introduced in 1982 was a radical family planning program to encourage couples to restrict their family size to just one child. This has become known as the 'One Child Policy'. \n\n\n\nPolicy incentives \n\nsalary bonus (urban) \nbigger land allocation (rural) \nextended maternity leave \npaid medical and hospital expenses \npriority access to housing, employment and schooling for the child \n\nDisobeying the policy \n\nwithdrawal of family allowance and medical benefits \nfines (even against everyone in the village or town) \ndemotion or discharge from a government job \n\n\nExceptions to the rule \n\nmembership of a minority ethnic group (can be allowed two or even more children) \nhaving a first child with a disability that is likely to result in inability to work \npregnancy after adopting a child \nrisk of 'losing the family line' without a second child (the first child being a girl) \nrural families with 'real difficulties' (all children so far being girls)

Barriers is a set of purer-than-pure Berlin school electronica. The Nightcrawlers -- Peter Gulch, Tom Gulch, and David Lunt -- were known for this style of e-music. Unfortunately, their fan base can best be described as a cult following. Despite their purity and excellence, this trio never achieved anything close to the recognition that they deserved. All of their albums and cassettes are long out of print and only a small portion of their prodigious output has been remastered for CD reissue. This rare slice of history is essential electronica. It is worth every effort to track it down. ~ Jim Brenholts, All Music Guide

"The problems in Iraq will be solved when the oppressed people of Islam seek a reformation of their own religion, and they can't do that unless there is a champion to help protect them from abuses.  The U.S. is doing that.

Second, we have to train out children to be cowardly and uncaring, so that protecting our own interests and the interests of freedom and democracy go unnoticed around the globe.  Third, we have to silence the people who speak out about the wrongs conducted at an astonishing rate in other countries, and simply listen more to the people who say it is all our fault.\n\nWe can never win this war.  It will never end.  The enemy will just change names, change religions, change ethnicities, change ideologies.

Monroe Doctrine, principle of American foreign policy enunciated in President James Monroe's message to Congress, Dec. 2, 1823. It initially called for an end to European intervention in the Americas, but it was later extended to justify U.S. imperialism in the Western Hemisphere.Origins and Pronouncement \nThe doctrine grew out of two diplomatic problems. The first was the minor clash with Russia concerning the northwest coast of North America. In this quarrel, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams expressed the principle that the American continents were no longer to be considered as a field for colonization by European powers. That principle was incorporated verbatim in the presidential message. The other and more important part of the doctrine grew out of the fear that the group of reactionary European governments commonly called the Holy Alliance would seek to reduce again to colonial status the Latin American states that had recently gained independence from Spain.\nGreat Britain, which wished to maintain open commerce with the newly formed states, supported Latin American independence. The United States had just recognized the independence of these states, and in Aug., 1823, the British foreign minister, George Canning, proposed to the United States that a joint note be sent by the two governments protesting intervention in the New World by the Holy Alliance. President Monroe consulted with two of his predecessors, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who recommended that Canning's proposal be accepted. Secretary of State Adams dissented. He feared, with some justification, that the British would try to exact a pledge from the United States not to attempt to acquire any territory in Spanish America.\nMeanwhile, Canning had secured an agreement with France (which had earlier made the proposal that the Holy Alliance intervene in Latin America), by which France renounced any intention of intervention, thus obviating the need for a joint U.S.-British protest. However, Adams had by then proposed a unilateral action to President Monroe, who finally agreed to this course. The presidential message, therefore, announced that the United States would not interfere in European affairs but would view with displeasure any attempt by the European powers to subject the nations of the New World to their political systems. Thus in a sense the Monroe Doctrine as a dual principle of foreign policy (no colonization and no intervention by European states in the Americas) complemented the policy expressed by George Washington of noninterference in European affairs.\nApplication and Extension \nThe doctrine was not ratified by any congressional legislation; it did not obtain a place in international law, and the term Monroe Doctrine did not come into general circulation until the 1850s. Yet the doctrine became important in American policy, particularly when President Polk reasserted its ideas in 1845 and 1848 with respect to British claims in Oregon, British and French intrigues to prevent the U.S. annexation of Texas, and the aspirations of European nations in Yucatán.\nThe strained relations with Great Britain concerning its sovereignty over several areas in Central America in the 1850s renewed U.S. interest in the doctrine; Great Britain specifically denied its validity. During the Civil War, the doctrine was invoked unsuccessfully after Spain's reacquisition of the Dominican Republic (formerly Santo Domingo). It was also used, somewhat more effectively, to bring pressure on the French government to withdraw support from Maximilian, who had established an empire in Mexico under French auspices.\nUnder President Grant and his successors the doctrine was expanded. The principle that no territory in the Western Hemisphere could be transferred from one European power to another became part of the Monroe Doctrine. As U.S. imperialistic tendencies grew, the Monroe Doctrine came to be associated not only with the exclusion of European (
It's not a case of the end justifying the means. To the state of CA (and most other states, I'm afraid), model citizenry in another state does not justify violation of parole.\n\nTo be honest, the parolee staying out of trouble will keep him under the radar for only so long.

Sadly, they're not giving the parolee the benefit of a doubt, either.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for, but it is the perspective of the law.

Hereisyourwayoutofpaydayloans\nPayday debt[how to get out]\nWe first got into the loan because we needed car repairs and didn’t have enough money then someone told us we could get a payday loan.  We went to the payday store and it was so easy just needed to provide a bank statement, pay stub and post dated check for two weeks, my next payday, $575.00 they handed over $500.00 cash.  We really thought we would be able to pay it back and that would be that.  Then when payday came along $575.00 out of it would be hard as we were already living payday to payday.  We went back to the payday store and were told we could just pay the $575.00 cash then re-borrow again that sounded good we just didn’t think of the very high interest rate.  So if you borrow every two weeks at $75.00 interest for 26 weeks that equals $1,950.00 in a year.  So when we would re-borrow that would not  cover all of the bills because we would be short the $150.00 from the interest so we went to the next payday store to cover the monthly bills then we found we needed more money for some other need.  Then when we needed to pay off that loan we were short so we had to go to another to cover that loan then another and another before we knew it we were into four paydays per month.  Here is the calculation $75.00 x 4 loans =$300.00 per two weeks x 26 weeks per year $7,800.00 x 3 years $23.400.00. Paydays are suppose to be a happy time but when you are into them like we were it is a nightmare and very stressful, robbing Peter to pay Paul, running from one store to another. What was amazing is as I was going from one to another I would see the same people at each store, sad but true. \nOur website is    Hereisyourwayoutofpaydayloans

"There was an election then, and pretty much everyone wanted Corey Aquino to win. When Ferdinand Marcos was elected anyway, there were massive protests of ""vote fraud"". So bad that Marcos left the country and Aquino's party (The People's Party) was moved into office. This was known at the time as ""The People's Revolution""."
"Who is ""they?""\n\nIt's warrant, not warrent.  \n\nYes...""they""...can.  I do it all the time, and it's perfectly legal, and just because you are arrested does not mean you must have your Miranda rights read to you (at least in California)."

Because that would lead to inflation. The more money a government prints, the less value the money in circulation will have.
I think the western media doesn't understand that religion has a higher priority in the Arab culture. We are used to the separation of church and state. Yes it is a clash of civilizations but then we have had this since the crusades.
As long as people do not agree that their religion is the only religion there will always be a rift.  The same could be said for other religious groups.  Most people just do their own thing and let other people do theirs, it's the radicals and extremist that 'cause a great deal of the problems.  Just my opinion.
I recently had a bankruptcy finalized in Aug. '05. You should really be sure it's the only option left open to you. If there are any debts that can be taken care of by offers in compromise or payment schedules you might want to take that route. Are your debts more than one years income?

"The cop said ""Shut up"" NOT get up! The guy ran from them and was acting like a dangerous criminal and was treated like one. Not until later was the guy identified as a member of the armed forces.\n\n**MattDCNavy** He made no threatening moves? How about standing up after fleeing from the police (A felony) that’s not threatening?? How many times you ever been in a high speed chase and pulled a guy 2X your size out of a car? As for the power trip... I actually have to agree with you. But I want to add this... Police have to be different from most people (Same with Service members) when people are shooting or beating people or threaten to blow things up MOST NORMAL people run away. Cops & soldiers have to have the mindset to be able to run towards the situation. This causes us to maybe be alittle arrogant at times."
Capitalization means proprely using capital letters. Capitalism is an economic philosophy.
Yes, but it is not the most modern one (there is also SPAS 15, 16). SPAS 12 (Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun ) is a Semi/Pump action shotgun. Semi is gas operated, which means quicjer reload withouth having to ue your hand to reload, while the pump action..... well, i'm sure you've seen how pump action shotguns are reloaded. For ammo it uses 12 gauge shells. One more thing- this rifles are used in many law enforcement forces all over the world. If you're interested in shotguns check out Benelli's guns (www.benelliusa.com ).

Biological or chemical would be my guess. Nuclear weapons are a bit beyond the reach of terrorists so far, but a dirty bomb might be a possibility.\n\nWhatever the next attack is going to be - and it's a matter of when, not if - I have no doubt that it will be devastatingly spectacular.

it depends on your view of human nature. i'd say no because cops are only humans and humans are inately greedy. they become corrupt because they want more than what they have, be it in terms of power, monay, love or anything else and until humans can stop wanting, they'll always be corruption.
It was a case of mistaken identity, according to  the Israelis. It happened during the Six Day War, the IDF/AF were taking out any and all enemy ships and planes to prevent an attack on them. \n\nIsrael paid $13,000,000 in indeminties to the US and lodged a formal apology. \n\nHowever the incident is slightly shady, since the American ship did not look at all like an Arab ship, and it was also an intelligence vessel.\n\nThe reason it got covered up is obvious. One, its an intelligence vessel. The press loves finding intelligence gaps, and losing a ship like that is an embarresment to the US. Two, it could badly damage US-Israeli relations, which werent strong then but were now. That's probably why this story took so long to get out.\n\nto the other guy who answered, you are thinking of the USS Cole, which was attacked in Yemen and was not covered up. The terrorists responsible escaped from a Yemeni prison.
I think it's a smokescreen. There's a lot of noise being raised about Ms. Clinton, and most of it's coming from the Republicans. I think the plan is to get the recognition factor going, and hope that she gets nominated, because the GOP think they'll have an easy time beating her. If they try that Swift Boat garbage with her, they just might. She's a very polarizing figure, and if you've been on Yahoo Answers awhile, you know that there's people that absolutely despise the Clinton name. As for why Spitzer or Biden isn't mentioned, it's whistling past the graveyard.

Actually,\nsmart middle eastern countries are preparing for this.\nTake Dubai as an example.\nThey are foreseeing that oil will run out at sometime in the near future. So what they are transitioning into a tourist attraction. They are infact building super luxury manmade islands in the shape of the continents, and have built a super luxury island in the shape of a palm tree!!! Since I am a proffesional soils engineer i can tell you that what they are doing there is truly magnificent in engineering terms and very smart in terms of business. \n\nSo in a way you are already right in your question. Dubai is already selling sand!!! And even more amazing, wealthy people are already buying it at astounding prices!!!
Bcoz, before elections america support them n ensured them that they are the best in their country and can bring good changes, but after election america force them to do all those crampy things in Muslim wrold which are not the part of muslims culture and wanted them to obey him, want to ruled them, want to make their counrty as his colony, which is unbareable........
I think it is a travesty. I don't understand and (never will) why people just assume this is about saving lives. It's about rights of women. People are so quick to jump on the bandwagon to take rights away from women. Rights that women had to fight tooth and nail for. If this was a right given to men I doubt we would even be discussing this.A woman should not be forced by the government to carry a pregnancy to term. Especially not if she was raped. Imagine the 15 year old girl raped by her father who gets pregnant. There are already thousands(or more) children born every year to families who do not want them. They are abused and neglected.why is it better to have them born into that? I think it will be a sad sad day when women lose their rights under Roe Vs. Wade. I heard on the news that South Dakota is planning on it being sent to the supreme court so that Roe can be challenged. South Dakota only has 1 abortion clinic to begin with. I think its absolutely horrible that men lawmakers force what rights women are allowed to have. Its our bodies. Men can walk away from a pregnancy. Women should at least be able to have the same option.Whether or not you are against abortion,please don't let women lose their rights.I don't like abortion but we are all forced to make hard decisions we don't want to make.Reversing Roe Vs.Wade will cause women to revert to back-alley abortions using coat hangers and such causing injury to women and death. All because law makers have to be right.Sad indeed.To Alayna:Reverting to back-alley abortions is NOT done out of stupidity. It is done out of desperation. You probably have never been in a horribly desperate situation.As a survivor of domestic abuse sometimes you have no other choice. Had I gotten pregnant by my abuser, I would have rather aborted then let my abuser abuse my child. You speak from an uneducated and judgemental point of view.How can you not see this as women losing rights? Losing rights (regardless of what you think of those rights)is horrible.And really how many men want the baby that the woman aborts? I am sure it is a small small minority especially when compared with the number of dead beat dads.

That question is a bit vague.  The Federal government operates under a system of checks and balances, by which the Judicial Branch (court system), Legsilative Branch (Senate and House of Representatives) and Executive Branch (President) create and implement laws, all the while theoretically assuring that no one branch gets too much power at any time.

GOD BLESS THE U.S.A.
Government is the ordering of the unwilling by the incompetent for the ungrateful.\n\nActually, the purpose of government is to do that which is socially necssary but which all people cannot or will not do willingly.  I mean, if you had to go around for a collection box to pave a road, would everyone who drives on that road contribute?  How many people would chip in on a voluntary basis to build a prison?  Would the majority agree that police should be stopping speeders?  Everybody likes to speed.\n\nAnd, of course, government is the legitimator of force.  Only with government permission may one adult use physical force against another.  And that's the way it should be.
Yes they still have to pay you. Do you have receipts and can prove they are work related? I would turn in the expense report and receipts as soon as possible. But make sure you have a copy of them for your records also.\nGood luck with this.

Ray Nagin was democratically elected as Mayor of New Orleans. If he were for some reason removed from office, then the deputy mayor would be in charge. That is how 'democracy' works.\n\nIf you are looking to put the blame on what happened before, during and after Katrina. A large percentage should be put on the local and state government. It was the govenors job to call for federal assistance BEFORE or even the day OF the hurricane. She should be impeached. \n\nWith that said, the federal government did wait entirely too long to allow the resources to enter the city. Everyone was caught up in their beaurocractic bs and failed to realise the urgency of the situation.\n\nReminds me of Love Canal..

There is no good way to tell. You have to always be careful not to say anything that you would get in some kind of trouble for.
"As someone has already said, empires rise and fall. One of the first signs of weakness is when a country thinks it is so powerful that it can do what it wants. I think the US has stood for lots of good things in the past and has helped a lot of countries but Guantanamo, for example, lessens its moral authority. The war in Iraq seemed to be a knee jerk reaction. They had to nail some bad guy (with the right ethnic and/or religious background) whether he had anything to do with 9/11 or not. You expect things like this from a totalitarian government, not from the US. They would have been a lot better off concentrating on Afghanistan where they could have made a real difference.  \n\nHowever, if the US works more closely with other countries which, by the way, have had democracy for as long or longer, they will do a lot better than following the adage ""my way or highway"". As a great admirer of Roosevelt and Lincoln I can only shake my head in dismay when I think of the commander in chief you have now. The sooner he goes, the quicker the US will make ammends. By the way, I am no admirer of the Democrats. I just like people in charge who know what they are doing."
Just 2 words. A mess.
If you run into problems, you could talk to your congressman's office and they will assist you in the process, they may even rush things a little for the bigger things.
I really don't know enough about her, I do belieive in the school of thought that people have the right to do and think what the believe in.  If it is illegal they can be arrested but if it is morally wrong, than god will take control and you just have to make sure that the individual is not doing harm to others.
Just because the Prosecution has evidence, it doesn’t mean their interpretation of it is representative of reality.  It is the job of the defense attorney to find fault with the prosecution’s interpretation of that evidence.  To do that the needs a working understanding of the law and how it works.  \n\nAll of the work of the prosecution and the defense attorney is judged by the jury as to its validity.  \n\nTogether their goal is to produce justice as allowable within the context of the law and the common sense of the jury.
Yes it was too many people to ask mother may I .

"Too many variables to consider, it's impossible to answer in this forum.  First of all, what do you mean by ""nuclear bomb.""  There are crude nuclear devices, which is called ""dirty bomb.""  A dirty bomb is basically a normal bomb with whole bunch of radioactive waste.  The explosion will send the particles into  the air, making SOME people die and thousands sick.  Also, decontainmenation would be a nightmare and public panic.  A small bomb could also be a tactical nuclear device.  Those are the so called ""suitcase"" bombs developed during the cold war.  They are, for the most part, not very effective.  Consider that it's very heavy and easy to detect by our current sensors in major cities.  If your definition of small is something like a ""small"" nuclear missile from states like.... say Iran/North Korea, then 25 mile radius will pretty much be wasted.  That being said, it's hard to denote a nuclear weapon by terrorist in NYC.  For starters, the Dept of Homeland Security has nuclear sensors around critical infrastuctures.  Nuclear signatures are VERY easy to detect, esp crude devices that could be used by a terrorist. There are tons of resources for this.  But it might be too difficult to explain to high school students.\n\nI don't know what the person below me is saying.  First, people in direct vincity of Nagasaki, all 120,000 of them, were VAPORIZED immediately. Second, WWII era nuclear weapons are like nothing of what we have now.  A single cold war era multi warhead ICBM missile could destory ALL life in the U.S East Coast.  A typical U.S. MIRV has ten sepearte warheads.  Don't think of this as ten different Nagaskais because EACH of those warheads are HUNDREDS of times more powerful than the ""fatman"" dropped on Japan.  A single U.S Trident U.S. submarine could destory a whole nation."

I came here because of my deep interest and affection for a land settled by the Dutch in the mid-seventeenth century, then taken over by the British, and at last independent; a land in which the native inhabitants were at first subdued, but relations with whom remain a problem to this day; a land which defined itself on a hostile frontier; a land which has tamed rich natural resources through the energetic application of modern technology; a land which once imported slaves, and now must struggle to wipe out the last traces of that former bondage. I refer, of course, to the United States of America. \n     But I am glad to come here to South Africa. I am already enjoying my visit. I am making an effort to meet and exchange views with people from all walks of life, and all segments of South African opinion, including those who represent the views of the government. Today I am glad to meet with the National Union of South African Students. For a decade, NUSAS has stood and worked for the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights--principles which embody the collective hopes of men of good will all around the world.\n\n     Your work, at home and in international student affairs, has brought great credit to yourselves and to your country. I know the National Student Association in the United States feels a particularly close relationship to NUSAS. And I wish to thank especially Mr. Ian Robertson, who first extended this invitation on behalf of NUSAS, for his kindness to me. It's too bad he can't be with us today.\n\n     This is a Day of Affirmation, a celebration of liberty. We stand here in the name of freedom.\n\n     At the heart of that Western freedom and democracy is the belief that the individual man, the child of God, is the touchstone of value, and all society, groups, the state, exist for his benefit. Therefore the enlargement of liberty for individual human beings must be the supreme goal and the abiding practice of any Western society.\n\n     The first element of this individual liberty is the freedom of speech: the right to express and communicate ideas, to set oneself apart from the dumb beasts of field and forest; to recall governments to their duties and obligations; above all, the right to affirm one's membership and allegiance to the body politic--to society--to the men with whom we share our land, our heritage, and our children's future.\n\n     Hand in hand with freedom of speech goes the power to be heard, to share in the decisions of government which shape men's lives. Everything that makes man's life worthwhile--family, work, education, a place to rear one's children and a place to rest one's head--all this depends on decisions of government; all can be swept away by a government which does not heed the demands of its people. Therefore, the essential humanity of men can be protected and preserved only where government must answer--not just to the wealthy, not just to those of a particular religion, or a particular race, but to all its people.\n\n     And even government by the consent of the governed, as in our own Constitution, must be limited in its power to act against its people; so that there may be no interference with the right to worship, or with the security of the home; no arbitrary imposition of pains or penalties by officials high or low; no restrictions on the freedom of men to seek education or work or opportunity of any kind, so that each man may become all he is capable of becoming.\n\n     These are the sacred rights of Western society. These were the essential differences between us and Nazi Germany, as they were between Athens and Persia.\n\n     They are the essence of our differences with communism today. I am unalterably opposed to communism because it exalts the state over the individual and the family, and because of the lack of freedom of speech, of protest, of religion, and of the press, which is the characteristic of totalitarian stat

Hopefully the U.N. finally decides to become something useful and deals with Iran.  At the rate they're going, there won't be an Iran soon.  But, I really, really hope the U.S. stays out of it as much as possible.  If Iran wants to mess around with Nukes, they are committing suicide.  Given their history they cannot be trusted with them.  Actually, they cannot even be trusted with Nuclear power because of the potential disasters involved, including terrorists.

They are not.The large seeded Virginia Group peanuts are grown in Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and parts of Georgia.\nThe major producers/exporters of peanuts are the United States, Argentina, Sudan, Senegal, and Brazil.It is also illegal under Federal Law to grow peanuts on more than one acre (4,000 m²) of land for commercial consumption. This effectively creates a peanut monopoly, as it is not economically feasible to grow peanuts on only one acre (4,000 m²) of land, while drastically increasing prices.

"The President of the United States of America (often abbreviated to ""POTUS"") is the head of state of the United States. Under the U.S. Constitution, the President is also the chief executive of the federal government and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.\n\nBecause of the superpower status of the United States, the American President is widely considered to be the most powerful person on the earth, and is usually one of the world's best-known public figures. During the Cold War, the President was sometimes referred to as ""the leader of the free world,"" a phrase that is still invoked today.\n\nPowers and Dueties of the President of the United States \nThe President, according to the Constitution, must ""take care that the laws be faithfully executed."" To carry out this responsibility, the president presides over the executive branch of the federal government; a vast organization of about 4 million people, including 1 million active-duty military personnel. A President-elect will make as many as 6,000 appointments to government positions, including appointments to the federal judiciary. The Senate must consent to all judicial appointments as well as the appointments of all principal officers. The President may veto laws made by the United States Congress but cannot personally initiate laws. Congress can overturn the veto with a two-thirds majority in both houses. He is Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces and may make treaties, but the Senate must confirm these. The political scientist Richard Neustadt said, ""Presidential power is the power to persuade and the power to persuade is the ability to bargain"". He was commenting on the fact that the President's domestically constitutional power is limited, despite the modern expectation of Presidents to have a legislative program, and successful bargaining with Congress is usually essential to Presidential success.\n\nas for perks well that would be Command, Salary, Service, Meting People, & Fullfillmetn of Goals Set"

However a tax search can be pulled by anyone and that will tell the person doing the search what the amount of the last loan was and when(unless something has changed recently because tax searches on the internet are usually upto 6 months behind). Any agent or broker has the access to see what the taxes are on any property in the state which they are licensed in.  Good Luck!!

I always thought that marriage should be like a lease.  Try it for say, 5 years and then if you want, you can re-up on it.  Sounds reasonable to me!
"Agreed.\n\nThat part of the world is so messed up, I can barely consider them human.\n\nMR. POLITICS your answers is disgusting. How can you justify their actions? They are not reasonable, they are not civilized and they are an angry nation of ""people"". You need a slap.\n\nAnd of course! America is invading, something needs to be done, and I've just developed a new-found respect for President Bush!"
San Marino (301 AD) is often claimed to be the oldest republic in the world. (worldatlas.com/geoquiz) also lists France (486 AD),Bulgaria (632 AD), Denmark (950 AD), Portugal (1143 AD), Andorra (1278 AD), Switzerland (1291 AD) \n\nIf you define Antarctica as a country, then its borders have never ever really changed, except some minor territorial claims.\n\nMost Pacific islands have probably maintained their borders for the last 1000 years at least, if you neglect brief colonisation followed by independence e.g. Pitcairn Island, Tahiti, Federated Micronesia...\n\nI first thought Australia seemed like a reasonable guess, by default.\n\nPolitically speaking, the internal borders of England are unchanged since 1066, if you consider England separately to the United Kingdom.\n\nVery interesting discussion at second link below.
This just proves how dysfunctional the bush administration has become.  Years of corruption and cronyism has deteriorated our government to what we see today.\n\nFor the Bush administration to state that they had no idea that this would happen is a complete lie.

To quash a warrant would require an attorney.\n\nI would be a little curious how one could and would do that?  More of the reason the warrant was issued and why you would want it quashed.

I have seen twelve people serve in this capacity, eleven of whom were elected, one appointed.  That was Gerald Ford.  Six of these individuals were democrats, and six were republican.  Seven were president during a wartime situation, five were not.  Four of our wartime presidents were democrats and three were republicans.  A few skirmishes that ocurred, such as 'the bay of pigs', the 'Ghana rescue mission', are not identified here as wartime situations.  It is difficult to rate these men in order of effectiveness except to say that Franklin Delano Roosevelt stands out as an accomplish leader. He brought this nation out of a depression, he  was in office when social security began, and he guided this nation through WWII.  He showed courage and leadership when others cowered, and he did all this from a wheelchair.
Since cigarettes and alcohol are legal, the only question is if it is against your own beliefs.  \n\nIf you feel uncomfortable about it don't do it.
Take a look at the U.S. and decide for yourself.  Would the U.S. be as successful if it were a collection of 50 independant states, each responsible for its own treaties, currency, and armed forces?  The redundancy and inability to coordinate and consolidate efforts would likely render the whole as ineffective.\n\nThere should be, however, reasonable limitations on the powers of the chief executive of the federation.  The U.S. bestows tremendous powers on its President.
no, some are just cold and calculating, Some out of passion, and some in self defense such as solders. I agree that some like the lady that drove her kids into a lake and the one that drowned her kids in a bath tub lacked a few leaves in their tree. I am sure there are more. Like serial killers that are disfunctional.
I took a class on the Radical Republicans (Reconstruction, actually, but they played a big part in it).  Simply put, the South thought of the Radical Republicans as occupants.  They took over the Confederate States and ran them as territories: military governors and strict laws.  The former slaves considered them saviors.  They instituted laws directed at helping out their freedom, to a point.  There were a lot of empty promises made by these Republicans, but it is no surprise that almost all former slaves registered as Repulbicans.  The north is where most of the Republicans came from.  For more information on the northern view, look for anything regarding Andrew Johnson's tenure in office.  For the former slaves and southern perspectives, look for information on Reconstruction or the Hayes' election, which ended Reconstruction.
"great question, ty. The history is clear. Neocons have long wanted the USA out of the UN. They do not support peaceful contact with other Nations. The Neocons always point to the fact that we pay the most. The truth is they do not want to share any power with anyone. They also have no interest in what the other countries think or say. Neocons like Bu$h think ""my way or the highway"". A UN peacekeeping force could be in Iraq now (no ours) but for giving up the power and the control of oil, the wealth and the Contracts.\nThe Saudis are not stupid. When they felt Saddam was going to invade and control the oil, they got US tax payers to pay for the defense of the oil. Saddam was a Arab problem, Arabs got the US tax payers to solve the problem.  \nWe also deal with the loss of life and money for our own people. The Saudis should pay the $6 billion per month in Iraq not USA tax payers."
Thomas Jefferson was 57 years old when he was elected president. (Born April 13, 1743; elected president on Feb 17, 1801)
"The US electorate needs to be impeached.  Everything Bush has done could have been predicted from his history in other offices. All of the information is in the public domain.  Was anything more telling about him than his address to his gods ""the haves and the have mores""?  \n\nThe recent FEMA tape demonstrates Bush's consistent lying.  Where are all those outraged and offended congressmen who initiated the last impeachment?  Lying about extramarital sex must be more harmful to the nation than starting wars, bankrupting the country, murdering 2297 US troops and wounding maybe another 48000. Awarding no bid payback contracts to Halliburton and their subsidiaries was bad enough, but when an audit reported excessive fees, where the usual adjustment in favor of the contractor is between 10% and 20%, Kellogg, Brown & Root will collect virtually all of the questioned charges. The list of offenses against American ideals, and the American people is endless. \n\nFor me torturing the definition of torture, indefinite imprisonment without recourse, humiliating and degrading prisoners and avoiding Supreme Court review to prevent a negative ruling on issues that are clearly not permitted under our Constitution are shameful acts. Most Americans want the U.S.to be better than that.\n\nImpeachment?  Better think long and hard. Want other ""get even"" Congresses to be ridding us of each subsequent President? Ridicule will join the worldwide contempt we now experience."

Mohammed was a raping terrorist and I think the Portrait of him with Dynamite was an awesome idea.\n\nHey if it is ok to make art that makes fun of Christianity and Judaism then how come it's not ok to do the same in the case of Islam?
First, what career are you referring to? He will not run for President in 2008, so his career is over anyway.\n\nNow, if he was continuing on his political career, no, this would not effect it. It was an accident. If it wasn't, I'm sure the guy would have been hurt worst.
Well if you are counting foreign forces only Great Britain is second with just over 100 soldiers. Although if you count the Iraqi people as well. They have lost far more than any of the other countries combined.
In what state?\n\nPOST THE STATE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, PEOPLE!\n\nSorry.  But state laws vary from state to state, and it's almost always impossible to answer a legal question without knowing what state's laws are being asked about.

there are many countries which are not better to live in than the US.  maybe it would be easier to ask which ones are better.  in this case i would say the scandinavian countries, holland, switzerland, luxembourg, canada undoubtedly.  Maybe some other european nations too, but this could be disputed.  Yes, I have been to these countries, and, especially in the case of most of the scandinavian countries, I found they typically enjoyed a higher quality of life, more freedoms, a more rational justice system, and social protections which do not exist here.  There are many good things about america too, but people who insist that it is the best have obviously not traveled much.  likewise, people that consider it one of the worst have probably not traveled much either, because it is definitely towards the top, if not quite at the top.
no- a wall dident work in Germany, its certainly not going to work here.

First, the Pentagon is *always* formulating combat strategies against other countries -even our allies.  Some strategies just have more priority than others.\n\nBut besides that, Bush is not going to reinstitute the draft.  First, it would be total political suicide if he did, second, the Pentagon has explicitly said they *don't* want any drafted personnel, and third, we have a lot more personnel available for a sustained campaign against Iran (should we go to war) than is reported.  The main problem would be maintaining a force in Iran until the country's rebuilt -that's the main concern the Pentagon has when it comes to troop levels.  Of course, the Army always wants more soldiers in a location, no matter how many are there already.\n\nAlso, Charlie Rangel is a member of the House of Representatives, not the Senate.  Though it is true that he introduced the draft bill & voted against it.  But that was just a political stunt.

Politics is just a way to govern. Think as if you had five million dollars and fifteen million people. 5% are low income people and need assistance, 25% are small business owners and need some help starting their own business, 65% are a good median class workers and they are paying taxes that are giving you those five million dollars and only 5% are people who are helping you out running things out, yet each of those 5% have to report and give the best to the people who they are representing, poor, small business owners, median class workers etc.. If you do not know how to negotiate all the money could go into one grup and not the others that will not be good for you as the keeper of the money and one of the ones who has to decide how to spend it. There is where politics have to be used, negociate, deal, trade, share, meet, built, and somethimes get upset, but always keeping in mind that it is for the greather good of all the individuals eventhough some get the longest part of the stick, but that is how the game is played, those who know the rules they learn to apply them towards their advantage and those who desire to ignore or not learn them are stuck under the ones who know how to play the game. Just know how Monopoly is a great game to start in politics 101.
I don't think there is any one thing that defines them.  You don't have to figure out which one.  If you really want to pick one, it's basically a matter of which you has more philosophies and policies you agree with.  Democrats tend to be more inclined to spend money on social services and impose taxes on the wealthier portions of society to pay for it.  Republicans tend to favor private businesses as a means of aiding the impoverished portion of society, and consequently often advocate lower taxes and reduced spending.  However, there are always exceptions, and there is a huge range of variation within the parties (people are going to object to this - lets just say it's signficant relative to the total variability and mainstream American politics).  If you identify with more one party or the other that's fine, but if not, you don't have to choose.  And whatever you do, don't vote for a bill or a candiate just because your party supports it/him/her.  Vote for it becaues you think it/he/she is a good bill/candidate.  Whatever you decide is fine, just make sure you're deciding for yourself!

"Well, first off, it's important to make sure any deal is carefully vetted (and this one was, both by the Committee on Foreign Investment as well as U.S. intelligence).  Second, it should be noted that though the UAE has had problems with money-laundering by terrorists, and 2 of the 9/11 hijackers were from there, is actually an ally of the U.S.  They did give us a base from which to stage the invasion of Iraq, the UAE has given major support to U.S. and other Western intelligence services, and U.S. ships make port calls to Dubai all the time -speaking of which, the same company who oversees operations at the port(s) is the very same company now attempting to take over managing of the ports here in the U.S.  If they wanted to do any serious damage, they could have already done so with some of our warships.\n\nHowever, it's more important to realize that actual *ownership* of the ports will remain the port authorities of each city/region.  Security will still be their responsibility, as well as that of U.S. Customs & the Coast Guard.  All Dubai Ports World will do is take over day-to-day running of the operations.  So, really, nobody is actually turning our ports over to anyone.  As it is, most of our ports are *already* run by other countries.  And most maritime security experts have already stated that the management of the ports by DPW won't actually mean a breach of security, unless the Port Authorities decide to slack off.\n\nJust because it's an Arab country doesn't mean it's automatically an enemy.  Sure, such countries can expect more of a vetting than a company from Britain or France, but, really, it's ludicrous to ban a country simply because of the acts (however terrible) of some of its citizens.  Otherwise, we'd have to ban every country in the world -including ourselves.  Remember Jose Padilla or John Walker Lindh?\n\nAll the fuss is really about is the complaints of the longshoremen's unions, who are afraid of possibly losing their jobs.  Now, while I can totally accept that as a valid concern, there has to be a balance point between ""run this company/entity as profitably as possible"" and ""don't do ANYTHING new, because otherwise we might end up being replaced by computers"".\n\nPoliticians on both sides talk of ""the need to win the hearts and minds of the Arab people"".  If we ban this company on the basis of being from an Arab country, without any thought as to what the country is actually like, what does that really say about the U.S.?"

Was mom turning a blind eye in love or denying that anything was wrong, that he was just a teen misbehaving? (I'm not speaking poorly of the dead, just a thought in observation) Now that's just my first thought because I see things happen everyday with youth that is ignored until it explodes.. and everyone wonders why? The old adage of ""An ounce of preventions is worth a pound of cure"" comes to mind. (Again not trying to intend disrespect to anyoness views of this situation)\n\nBut excuses are just that excuses...you break the law you have to pay for it. Why do we support waiting to carry out the final death penalty?...because we study the case .. use it for profiling ...what made the crime occur, if there was a prevention available, if this person actually did the crime, and to see if any forensic studies can prove them innocent even if the jury has found them guilty.\n\nMy personal opinion...If it's caught on tape and undeniable that this person is guilty and deserving of the death penalty.. it should be done within a month TOPS!! Unfortunately the wheels of justice turn way too slowly."

fruit shipments can contain insects or parasites which are not native to the country of destination. when organisms are introduced to an ecosystem, there are not levels in place to ensure that the balance is maintained. for example, some exotic fly wouldn't be population controlled because no native spider is used to eating it. this uncontrolled population growth of invasive organisms can upset the balance of the food chain, or destroy entire crops.

Hmmmm....let's see.\n\nFBI wiretap released in the 80s of a phone conversation between a CIA agent and a known mob boss in Miami right before Kennedy's trip to Miami.  The agent stating they were going get Kennedy in Miami.  Prostitute beat up days before Kennedy's trip to Miami told police they are going to kill Kennedy.  Dispatch sent to all FBI wires of assisintation attempt in Miami.  Nothing happens there but Kennedy is killed in his second stop in Dallas.\n\nOswald denounces citizenship and flies on $2k trip with only $50 in his bank account.  Marries KGB Colonel's daughter and comes back with her to the US.  While in Russia U2 spyplane is shot down and Oswald is a Radar technician. No questioning of him and his wife. Oswald storms into FBI office and threatens head agent to quit bothering his wife or he will expose things.  Assasination time police storm book depository immediately and find Oswald sitting on the second story break room finishing a coke.  Famous picture of Oswald standing in the book depository door as police move     back and forth around him, he looks bewildered.  He is later arrested and questioned for 48 hours by FBI, all interview notes are destroyed.  Oswald claims he is a patsy.  He is killed by Ruby.\n\nRuby arrested and jailed.  Warren commission interviews him in prison and he states he must leave that prison or he will be killed and another form of government will take over this country.\n\nAfter the Warren commission concludes it was a lone gunman the federal government years later launches an internal investigation and classifies it's findings.  It's findings were declassified in the early 90s and the conclusion of it was there were more than one shooter and a consipiracy.\n\nThings that happened right before the assasination.  Kennedy was fooled by the CIA.  Kennedy had planned on pulling out of Vietnam and an incident happened orchestrated by the CIA that made it impossible to leave immediately.  Kennedy signed a presidential order dismanteling the CIA altogether.  He publicly stated he will splinter the CIA in a million peices.  He fires the head of the CIA and many others.  Assasination happens shortly after.  \n\nSo was it the CIA that did it?  Absolutely not, no proof of it.
There are more taxes placed on business than indivuals. And what you see is the effect of taxing the businesses which trickles down to the consumer, which is us. So when a business gets more taxes they have to make money to pay it. So, that ends up to be part of the extra money we have to pay to the companies. Someone has to pay it..

I think Iran's desire along with it's radical goverment is a serious and alot more of a threat to a total middle east breakout than Iraq ever was! I don't think Israel along with the United States will stand by and let this continue.

I think your question makes quite clear that you don't give a damn what I say, but I'm going to say it anyway.\n\nIf a woman is raped and becomes pregnant, she cannot be held responsible for her pregnancy.  Forcing her to carry the child to term is very much akin to slavery in that her body is forced to perform work for the benefit of another (the fetus) against her will.  It's reducing her to nothing more than a baby factory.\n\nI'm assuming you're male.  No woman could adopt the attitude that it is always the woman's fault if she becomes pregnant.  To say that she is necessarily responsible is simply not fair.\n\nIsn't it far worse to be brought into the world only to be wrapped in a plastic bag and thrown in a dumpster than not to be born at all?  That's what happens to many unwanted babies.\n\nAbortion isn't punishing the fetus.  A fetus at the stages in which it can be aborted can't survive outside the womb.  It lacks functional organs, and does not think or feel.  Why should it's life be valued above the that of the mother?  And for all those who will try to quote Christian morality, the bible says that the soul enters the body when the first breath is taken.  That happens when the child is born, not when it is concieved.\n\nIf men could get pregnant, I don't think there would be anyone out there suggesting abortion is murder.\n\nIn an ectopic pregnancy, it is an accepted medical fact that the fetus will die.  Terminating the pregancy saves the mother.  If the pregancy is allowed to continue, the mother will die too.  There's no possibility of saving the child.  I've heard plenty argue that abortion is wrong, but you're the first I've seen suggest that terminating an ectopic pregnacy is wrong.  That's simply idiotic.

Depending on where the new legislative member is from it is important for them to get on a committee that oversees an issue important to their constituency. For example a senator from Idaho would want to get on the Agricultural Committee. This way he can attempt to get favorable legislation passed for people in his district.

gender discrimination has always been a part of human history.  even chimps display what we would consider gender discrimination.  i think it most likely arose from the differences in male and female bodies and behaviors.  males were typically stronger, more aggressive, and more expendable in battles (if a male died it was not such a big loss, that just meant more females to go around, but if a female died it would hurt the population - one less female to raise children.)  this put females at a disadvantage.  this original disadvantage probably increased as societies became more complex, and the males began to craft policies which benefitted them, and gender discrimination was institutionalized.

No.  South Africa was a European colony.  [This is also where Gahandi become inspired to fight against the injustice before he went back to India.]  There are similarities between our (the USA) struggles with integration of the races and South Africa's, but they didn't need us to teach them how to oppress.

It is very unlikely that you would be arrested.  You have a dispute about a debt, and there is no crime involved in that.  (It can be a crime to commit fraud by passing a bad check, but that doesn't fit your situation, and it is highly unlikely the police or da would issue an arrest warrant even if the car shop owner doesn't correctly describe the facts.  Perhaps you can remind the guy that if he has you arrested on false facts he will be liable for false arrest.)\n\nWhat is more likely is that he will sue you.\n\nResponse to additional info/questions:\n\nHe can sue and continue to collect.  You should write to the collection agency, and tell them that you did not recieve the services contracted for from the garage, and there is no valid debt.  Tell them to remove any negative reports about your credit (and tell the garage owner the same.  It is a violation of federal law to report a bad debt to credit agencies of the matter is in dispute.)\n\nIf he sues you, make the appropriate motion in court to stop the actions of the collection agency until the matter is settled.  Threaten to countersue the garage owner if he does not stop the collection agency and fix any harm to your credit.\n\nI don't know how much the bill is for.  Dealing with this in court may end up being more expensive than just paying.  The advice to consult a lawyer is good.  If the garage is a AAA affliated shop, and you are a member, they have a process for resolving disputes.  (By the way, the major credit cards do too -- if you had told Mastercard or Visa to stop payment, then he would have to battle the credit card company to get it, at least til they investigated and disagreed with your position.)

I guess it depends what kind of government you want and what kind of country you want to live in.\n\nFor the kind of place I prefer to live, a media voice questioning the integrity of government behavior is absolutely essential as is it's right to do so. Inflamitory media is an American institution and without such voices, this country, as we know it, would not exist. We'd probably still be part of the British Empire.

I would guess that Pacifists or at least people who basically believe in the basic principles of Pacificism are in a majority in U.S. and even larger majority in the world.

Polls show that a growing majority oppose the war in Iraq.

Why dont you contact the SCA and ask them...Since they are into a hobby where a lot of peple carry swords in public they should know.

Because Africa is basically a politically unstable, economically depressed, disease ridden mess. \n\nSorry, I love Africa and have lived and worked there several times over the years but I wouldn't live there and I sure wouldn't want to bring up children there.\n\nEven the more stable countries like South Africa don't look like remaining stable in the long term, especially with the looming effectsof an HIV epidemic, and with examples like Zimbabwe to look upon people for what happens when such societies collapse people are understandably nervous.\n\nAdd to that the very limited oportunities for the middle class to make money and even the best African countries look like a poor choice compared to the 'Western' world for an educated young person.\n\nWhich is a shame because the best chance of solving those problems comes frm the educated young people. Unfortunately in a globalised world you can't really prevent brain drain. All you can do is adress the factors that promote it.

According to some 12 hours of tapes of meetings between Saddam, his son's and Cabinent back in 1995. Saddam says that he has told the U.S. that any attack to the U.S. with weapons of mass destruction would not come from a country, but in fact from a terrorist group.  These tapes also reveal his son's speaking of moving WMD's so that the U.N. Inspectors would not have access to them.  Tareq Aziz the Vice President of Iraq stated that with one batch of chemicals in a water supply could effect 100,000 people then why would a country go to war when this could be accomplished with a small group of terrorist's.\n\nGoing to a wider scope of things if these countries that are so against the Western Culture can figure out that using terrorists to do battle with us makes more sense than actually declaring war on us themselves, thereby leaving us not knowing exactly where to turn to fight back.  Is it no wonder that these governments have been manipulating us to battle the way that we have been doing it so far.  Did Saddam have WMD's, yes we know he did, he used them on his own people, we know that for a fact.  The public now also knows that the Clinton White House was warned of an impending terrorist attack on U.S. Soil as far as 6 years in advance in 1995.  We also know that he was moving WMD's that he said he did not have around the country to avoid the inspectors as far back as 1995 or 4 years after he was no longer supposed to have them.  We also know that he continued to trade for arms and other war supplies during the U.N. Sanctions by the evidence that we found in the early part of the 2003 Iraq war.  Is all of this intellegence faulty, fabracated, or fact?  In 2001 Bill Clinton said that his administration would have been better able to handle the attacks of 9/11 than the new Bush administration, and why not?  He had 6 years notice to prepare for it, was this knowledge even passed to the new administration, some say yes, others say no, and others still are not sure.  I believe that it was passed on and just as Clinton had nothing really to go on neither did Bush until it happened.  Could we have been more prepared?  Yes, should we have been more prepared?  Well from this side of it, it certainly looks that way.  This is one time that we need to have actually learned from history, these terrorist's are telling us exactly what they want to do, and they are pulling us in a direction where we are going to hit it straight on like two freight trains coming at each other on the same track.  After the accounts that I have read I certainly believe that Saddam warned us that we were a target and I believe that we should be listening to those who are speaking to us now because they are telling us the same truths today as they were 10 or so years ago.  Let us not be manipulated into the next phase of this war, let us lead ourselves down the path we must take.

Well, I don't understand why denying that Islam has problems and should be corrected.  it drives me nuts when ppl say that those religious terrorists groups are not real muslims. then who is real and what is real? you should first cleanse Islam openly and honestly from all hatred rules toward others. say that the rules that violate laws should be thrown away, not the opposite.  it is interesting ppl say that those are not real Muslims while they say Saudi is best or Iranian is best and both they endorse or do nothing to hate.   clerics you hear them from time to time, saying that hate to the infidels and non-muslims is duty!!! and those who say anyone cooperate with christian and jews are traitors or infidels or whatever.

First off, Hitler may have won over seas, but they would have never taken the US. Even if he had won WWII he would have been overthrown quickly afterwards, there is no way the other countries of Europe would have lived under Hitler rule. So basicly the end result would have been the same, but it may have taken longer.\n\nGermany and Japan coming to the states is another non factor. The outcome would be the same there as well. You can never win a war against free men and women. What we lack in military might, we gain in creativity, and knowledge we gained as free people. Every last man and women in the US would fight until their death if it came down to losing our freedom.\n\nThe only way we lose a war is if we are nuked off the face of the earth.

The previous answer mentioned Gross Deutchland, which was a regular army Wehrmacht elite division, not SS.

Of these 3 classic SS divisions, i'd pick the 1st at the most proficient, only because they bore their leader's name.

Two years ago, I had a part-time job instructing at a college in New York.  There were a few Muslim students from the Middle East and Asia studying there.  None of them said they had been harassed by US immigration when they came from the Middle East; their documents were checked very thoroughly, but they were let into the US without any problem.\nUnfortunately, the media in the Muslim countries are very similar to those in the West, in that they can mis-report stories and make every little incident into a huge issue.  Personally, I don't trust much of what the media report from any country overseas.  I take into account the experiences that I have had working with people from foreign countries.  I know from experience that most Muslims are kind, gracious people.  And I hope that Muslims will learn that most of us in the West are the same.\nIt seems to me that the biggest problem Saudi students face when they come to the US to study is that they are placed into a culture that is VERY different from the one in which they were raised.  They do not have to become Westernized, but they do need to understand and accept the differences.\nPeople of good will , no matter what their culture, can usually work out differences peacefully if they try hard enough.

I think that it just depends... if there is tons of evidence to prove the person guilty then by all means lock 'em up! But if you can't prove the person for the accused wrong doing.. then dont punish an innocent person. It also depends on the crime... if someone had done something so undescribable... then do the same undescribeable thing right back at that person.. i think that anyone that does anything to an innocent child should definatly be locked up forever or given the death penalty... they didnt even give that innocent child a chance at life... i will leave with this forever one to think about... our lives are not determined by what happens to us but by how we react to what happens, not by what life brings to us, but by the attitude we bring to life. A positive attitude causes a chain reaction of positive thoughts, events, and outcomes. It is that one amazing spark that creates extraordinary results!!!

When considering the giants of Canadian politics, T.C. Douglas surely stands at the forefront. Tommy Douglas was a remarkable Canadian whose contributions have helped to shape our great nation. Although he is most famous as the founding father of Medicare, the most advanced health-care system in the world, Douglas’ contributions to Saskatchewan and Canada were tremendous. Douglas established democratic socialism as a mainstream in Canadian politics and his CCF government became the first socialist government in North America. A visionary who achieved his dreams, Douglas changed the face of Canadian politics. More importantly, Tommy Douglas was a politician who put the good of the people he represented first and foremost.\n\nTommy Clement Douglas was born on October 20, 1904 in Falkirk, Scotland. In 1911, Tommy, his mother and his sister moved to Winnipeg to join his father who had moved there the previous year. Shortly after settling in Winnipeg, Tommy was diagnosed with osteomyelitis in his right leg. Tommy’s family was not wealthy and subsequently his family could not pay for the best or most immediate treatment. The delay nearly cost Tommy his leg. This experience marked the beginning of Tommy’s quest for universal, public health care. By the time he was 18, Tommy set his sights on a career as a preacher.\n\nIn 1924, when Tommy reached 20 years of age, he enrolled at Brandon College in Manitoba. Brandon College, which was founded by the missionary Baptists of Ontario, provided young ministers with the opportunity to receive an educational background. In college, Tommy was active in elocution classes, drama, and debating. His peers accepted Douglas as a natural leader and scholar. During weekends and summer months, Tommy would speak at rural churches. At one such trip Tommy met Irma Dempsey, his future wife. By the time he had left Brandon College, Tommy had earned his Bachelor’s degree in the Faculty of Arts.\n\nIn the fall of 1929, Tommy became a minister at Calvary Baptist church in Weyburn, Saskatchewan. The town immediately opened its arms to the young preacher who possessed boundless energy and eloquence. His time in Weyburn allowed Douglas a first hand perspective of the harshness of the Depression in the prairies. Douglas knew that something had to be done for the common man. His experience with the vast unemployment and poverty transformed T.C. Douglas, the clergyman, into a social activist.\n\nBy 1932, Douglas helped organize an Independent Labour Party in Weyburn of which he became president. Saskatchewan’s Independent Labour movement was not large in numbers but they began raising awareness for socialist politics. The movement soon evolved into the Farmer Labour Party. The Farmer Labour Party offered hospital care for everyone on an equal basis, including unemployment insurance and universal pension. By July of 1932, the labour parties of the four western provinces formed an alliance under the name Cooperative Commonwealth Federation. The CCF became Canada’s first national socialist party. The Farmer Labour Party now had something it desperately lacked, the backing of a national movement. In 1934, Douglas made his first foray in the Saskatchewan provincial election. Although he lost, this sparked an internal flame which could not be extinguished.\n\nIn 1935, Douglas was elected into parliament under the CCF. This was a time of great turmoil for Canadian politics. Nearly all the provincial governments had been tossed out of office as Canadians turned to anyone who promised to lead them out of the troubled times. Along with Douglas, there were only four other members of the CCF caucus. At the tender age of 31, the young Douglas impressed the House of Commons with his fiery, yet relevant, speeches. The CCF, with only five seats, did not have much political clout, but that did not stop Douglas from fighting for legislation to support the western provinces. By the end of the 193 Os, the Depression and Worl

They elect:\nThe governor, lieutenant governor, and eight elected department heads form the North Carolina Council of State. Ten other department heads appointed by the Governor form the North Carolina Cabinet.\n\nThe North Carolina General Assembly consists of two houses, a 50-member Senate and a 120-member House of Representatives. For the 2005–2006 session, the current President Pro Tempore of the Senate is Democrat Marc Basnight (the Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina is the President of the Senate); The House Speaker is Democrat James B.

What does the original lease say?  This is what needs to be read.  If it states an amendment can be made with XX days notice then yes the amendment is legal since you've already signed allowing it.  If you disagree with the amendment then you can terminate the lease since it's changed, but you can't force them to not follow the amendment unless your original lease states that.

Cautiously O... is right. England turned protestent because the catholic church refused to allow the king to divorce his wife. once breaking an engangment used to be ground of lawsuit. divorce can be considered grounds 4 suit on breich of legally witnessed verbal contract or agreement. but it is accepted that when marrying one knows on what grounds other person can cancle this contract.

"Capitalism isn't about fairness.  Fairness is a child's version of the concept of Justice.  The world, and capitalism, is not fair.  But capitalism is just.  Those who make the effort, have the creativity, have the intellegence, the strength, the wisdom, the (fill in the blank with at least something that is of value) get to keep the money and decide where to spend it.\nNo, they aren't ""worth"" that much.  No one is worth anything.  Another childhood concept is believing that we are owed something for our good deeds, and then we define ""good"" as anything we want to.  Silly.\nThe system is the most open in the world for people to figure out the rules and make themselves rich as well.  No other economic system makes that possible.  People who want it ""their way"" will never figure out how to use capitalism, but will always complain, blame others, make excuses for why they didn't have time or that no one would give them a break.\n\nNo one owes you a break.  And forcing it is called socialism.  Not in my U.S."

First, try and get the employer to just give you the money, and inform them that you're willing to file a claim with the Industrial Commission. If they don't, then fill out the wage claim form at the first site using the instructions at the second. The third site is a FAQ on wage claims.
One city I believe it was Palo Alto made it illegal to smoke outdoors except in clearly marked designated smoking area's.  California has some of the strictest laws regarding smoking however this is not something that has gone statewide, yet.
No not uless the President instructs congress to do so. If it does happen please remeber to take the flag all the way to the top then lower it down and when taking down take the flag back to the top and then take it down. this done because the American flag never stop in the middle it must all ways be brought to the top.

I do not criticize JFK for the way he handled the crisis, because he knew what the outcome would be because he had the knowledge of the true power of the Soviets and knew they would back down and that more sensible minds in the USSR would keep Krushev in line. Kennedy knew we were so strong that we could destroy Russia and so did the Russians .  Good Question

No!  The person who's life is being terminated has no voice in this matter, and that is not reasonable.  Today, with birth control pills, morning after pills, condoms, etc., there is no reason for people to get pregnant.  Granted, it still happens, but when you fail to use any of the precautions that are available, it is my opinion that you give up your right to terminate a life because of your own negligence.  That baby will be well received in a myriad of households who pray to God for the chance to be a parent.  Those out there who decide they do not want the child, please carry it to term and give it up.  There are people who will pay you for your inconvenience, consider it!
It sounds like you see through the spin and wordplay used to promote the  present united states government's quest to rule the world. Terrorist is a word used to describe a person or persons that uses force to influence with fear. I would have to say that the Bush administration is the biggest and most organized terrorist group in the world at the time. They rule with fear and that is their only hope for money and power that they wish. The american public is starting to wake up to this fact, but I think it is far too late for Iraq's sake and we have caused a lot of long term problems by going into that country.
Yep.  Although, the argument can be made that it rarely has been civil.  The rhetoric around the Civil War may actually rival what is going on now.

"i agree. it confirms what i have gathered here and there in news or articles about relegious percecutions. \nit is really sums up the situation here. \n\n   As far as stand of muslim terrorist organization about US presence in muslim countries is concerned it may be right upto some extent. but it does not condone their world wide activities. their own government is also responsible for the US presence. they need to look there and start cleaning up their system. \n\n  the terrorist organization have become a buissness. most of the recruits are jobless youth who not only get money(collected in the name of islam by thier rich brothers) for this world and promise of heaven if dead. then they go out , kill innocents , work as mersinaries of muslim countries in countries like india. we have even hindu(ULFA) and communist terrorist organization funded by anti indian countries.\n\nthe BIG talk about justice for islam is a sham in such incidents. how can ethnic cleansing of hindus from kashmeer can or otherwise innocent deaths are going to improve conditions in saudi arab. why if muslims are in majority in a small area they start asking for free islamic country but when in minority they want others to be secular?\n\ni am not happy with the situation and really have not much idea as how to change it while keeping  a ballace; so that it does not turn into percecution nor the guilty could slip by.\n\nAs I scrolled to other pages such as hinduism i know it to be accurate first hand.-----\n\n"" The Persecution of Hindus has existed throughout history. ..in Bangladesh ..from the partition of India in 1947 until today. Hindus who initially ... 30% of the population there have now dwindled to around 10%. Almost all of those driven out are now refugees in the North Eastern states in India. This ethnic cleansing has gone largely unnoticed by the rest of the world.\n\n...report documents the long history of anti-Hindu atrocities in Bangladesh..... including targeted attacks against temples, open theft of Hindu property, and rape of young Hindu women and enticements to convert to Islam, have increased sharply in recent years ...\n\nBut that is only the latest chapter ....estimated loss of 20 million Bangladeshi Hindus is because of an ongoing genocide and forced exodus.... \n\nHindus in  Pakistan have declined from 23 % of the total population in 1947 to less than 2% today.........state-sponsored religious discrimination against Hindus through bigoted ""anti-blasphemy"" laws.. millions of Hindus being held as ""bonded laborers"" ...in rural Pakistan, something repeatedly ignored by the Pakistani government. Pakistan aggressively portrays its struggle against India as a Hindu-Muslim conflict, making it clear that its own Hindu minority is fair game for persecution.\n\nEven within India, the pattern is the same. The combination of Pakistani-sponsored violence and local anti-Hindu sentiment has led to a similar ""religious cleansing"" of the Kashmir valley, where almost all the Hindus have fled.\n\nMuch like the Bangladeshi Hindu refugees in India, the Kashmiri Hindus are an unpalatable subject for many Indians, an ideological embarrassment for some people who feel uneasy about discussing the persecution of Hindus by Muslims. ... ignoring the campaign launched by various Muslim groups to use public threats and violence, including murder, to terrify the local Hindus into leaving.\n\nSome Indians ... do not want to be reminded about the problems of Hindus outside their milieu. And for some in the Indian intelligentsia, it is a badge of honour to distance themselves from these pogroms as a mark of their supposed enlightenment, oddly trashing their own ethos in the process. Many more Indians are reluctant to speak out against atrocities committed against Hindus for fear of being labeled ""communal"". Merely speaking about human rights for Hindus is for them a form of communalism.\n\n........ Human rights activists in B"

Money is generally what buys most elections.  Whoever has the biggest budget generally wins the election.  This goes from City Elections to National Elections whoever spend the most usually wins.  Elections are not bought per say in any other way.  There may have been things that have happened on a local scale that may not be up to par, however when this happens there is usually one party a lot stronger than the other in that area.  On a National Scale there is no way and the Electoral College keeps it that way.
If there is space in the b's then normally an SGT will stay there. If they need space in the b's then SGT's are the first to move out. The whole issue is LQA. If your unit wants the give it, they need a reason to justify the cost of LQA for a single SGT.

"Visit the Viet Cong tunnels in the village of Cu Chi (about 2 hours drive NW from Saigon) and talk to the hold hands there who are giving tours and showing documentary films. \n\nSecondly, visit the war museum in Hanoi, and strike up a conversation with the old guys there. In addition to some interesting conversation you'll see plenty of American war materiele which was captured, shot down, or just left behind during the war.\n\nOh by the way, over there you don't call it the Vietnam War.  You call it ""The American War"" or ""The War of Liberation"". And don't be offended if someone over there often refers to some of the North Vietnamese soldiers as ""American-Killer Heroes""! and their South Vietnamese counterparts as ""Traitor-Collaborators"".  The feeling is still hot among older north Vietnamese government officials.  Retired soldiers have pretty much mellowed out. And many Vietnamese Southerners are still secretely pro-american and anti-north."

Cohens v. Virginia \nCohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. 264 (1821), was a United States Supreme Court decision most noted for the Marshall Court's assertion of its power to review state supreme court decisions in criminal law matters. The Court had previously asserted a similar jurisdiction over civil cases in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 14 U.S. 304 (1816).\n\nIn this case, the Cohens were prosecuted successfully by the state of Virginia for selling lottery tickets from the District of Columbia in Virginia, thereby violating Virginia state law. The Supreme Court upheld their convictions.\n\n\nSee also\nList of United States Supreme Court cases \n\nReferences\nJean Edward Smith, John Marshall: Definer Of A Nation, New York: Henry Holt & Company, 1996. \n\nExternal links\nLII: full text of Cohens v.

"BUSH, all the way!!!  I could defend him all day and all night.  He's a great president.  I defy anyone who complains about him to do better.  It is the liberal media that is bad-mouthing him because he happens to have moral values, and ignorant, immoral people are listening and believing this trash without knowing what the facts really are.  These ""polls"" are saying that his ratings are lower than ever, blah, blah, blah, blah, yet, somehow, he managed to get elected TWICE!  I've NEVER been polled!!!  Ignorant people are believing these ""polls"" as gospel truth.  Oh, please!!!  There happen to still be a lot of people left in this country with values, who believe in morality, hard work, supporting themselves and not mooching off the government, etc."
"President Wilson was completely devastated by World War I, but even more so after the war.  He wanted to create the league of nations to prevent another world war, but the American public didn't go along with the idea.  So Wilson toured all over the United States to garner support, but to no avail.  The senate confirmation bill to ratified the league of nations was voted down.  Afterward, he lived a life of a ghost, finally dead a year later, a broken man.\n\nFor Roosevelt, he wanted to realize his goal of the four world policeman to prevent another world war. He had litte doubt that the allies would win the war. Therefore, he focused most of his efforts with secret diplomacy with Stalin, the best known being the ""blue pencil"" agreement.  Stalin always carried a blue pencil around.  When Roosevelt was discussing post war world with Stalin, Stalin took out a pencil and basically draw out parts of Eastern Europe as the Soviet sphere, American sphere and British sphere. However, Roosevelt never saw his plans become reality and he kept all of it secret from his vice president, Harry Truman."

"What I find fuuny is one of the big arguments I keep hearing is ""they come to our country and get free food stamps"" when this is not true at all.  I use to be a food stamp worker, and if you are undocumented (ILLEGAL immigrant) you do not qualify. Yes, they pay taxes when they purchase things.  What I think annoys me the most is a lot of these comments are aimed towards Mexicans yet most other countries are welcome to come?  What is that?"

Knowing Bush, he simply went for some authentic Asian food at the taxpayers' expense.
It is no a law yet. It is a proposal agreed upon by the senate judiciary committee. It must be passed now by the senate and the house, the two must reach a consensus and after that the president must sign it so it's a long way until it becomes a law. It will most likely change in some way before it is passed.\nThe law tries to deal with the issue of illegal immigration and address issues such as a guest worker program.
"Ahhh....Harvey.\n\nDefendant has multiple charges against him/her.  Rather than go through a lengthy trial, and point out what a rotten person defendant really is, the lawyers might agree to have the defendant plead guilty to counts one and three, and Harvey waive count two.\n\nIt's basically like a ""King's X"" where the defendant isn't being prosecuted for the charge any more, but the judge is still allowed to consider the charge for sentencing purposes.  So maybe you've got trespassing and vandalism, and everybody agrees to Harvey waive the vandalism charge for whatever reason.  When the judge sentences the defendant on the trespassing charge, he or she can consider the vandalism charge and maybe order restitution in an amount to fix the damages, even though the defendant wasn't convicted of the vandalism.  \n\nThat's my really limited understanding of it.  I'm not no attorney, only a guy who has been in and out of courtrooms for a long time.

Beside the law, if they are decent human beings and the adoption issue is open with the child, welcome the Christmas presents and the caring adults into the child's life.  Should you be having trouble with these people, I believe they do not have any legal recourse, but I also think this is untested in the courts.  So, president would have to be set by a first case of adopted grandparents trying for visitation of the child.  I am not a lawyer and I do not know court cases well.

Other than disputes between tribal chiefs the political situation is stable with no noticable exploitation.\n\nThis is the information provided by a friend of mine from Bawku near Bolgatanga in the Northeast region of Ghana.
The median profits per partner figure at America's 100 top-grossing law firms in 2003 was $792,500, up almost 9.3 percent from 2002. The average was even more astonishing: $930,700, up about 10 percent. Ten years ago, million-dollar partner paydays were limited to two or three firms. No more. Thirty-two of the firms on this year's chart enjoyed average profits per partner of $1 million or more, and they aren't just the usual New York and Los Angeles suspects. Bingham McCutchen, Dechert, and Howrey Simon Arnold & White were all over $1 million for the first time, each with profitability jumps of 14 percent or more. Partnership was very, very good to a lot of big-firm lawyers in 2003. \n-- taken from the article referenced below.\n\nNote that these are averages for partners, generally, at these firms, not managing partners, who tend to make at the top of the scale.

At this time, it might be too late.  You can start a petition drive to change the rules that have been adopted by your state Medical Board.

Women and children are to be treated with the utmost respect according to the Koran (which is not a dirty book). The extremists misinterpret Mohammad's writings to meet their personal needs, just like Christian extremists misinterpret the Bible to meet their personal needs (regarding homosexuality for example). \n\nThe prisoners you're referring to have not yet been convicted of anything, and many have been released over the last 3 years because there was no evidence to hold them, which means there must be more that are being held without evidence as well. Until they're convicted of terrorism, they should be treated as we would want to be treated in that situation (think of the Americans that are kidnapped in Iraq -- we want them treated with respect).\n\nI don't understand why the Afghan government thinks it's ok to execute a man for converting to Christianity. That is not Mohammad's teachings. See the democratically elected government we helped put into place? Pretty similar to the Taliban, isn't it? God help them all.

Because people are selfish and not open-minded. Unstead of trying to do things to get more knowledgable, such as doing research, contacting politicians, etc, they just listen to what the media says or what someone else's opinions are, and then they make their opinions the same. Also, when things don't go people's ways, or when usual things are disrrupted, they blame the President. Case in point, the gas prices. Bush doesn't control if the prices go up or down, but as stated above, people base things on what they hear or read, instead of making their own opinion.

"As to the Jewish question, the only serious contender that quickly comes to mind was Senator Joseph Liebermans' run for the Vice Presidency/Presidency a few years ago.  I don't know why there haven't been more contenders through the years.  I think this country would elect a Jewish President and I do not think most voters would automatically discount a Jewish contender just because of religion.\n\nOf course John F. Kennedy was our first, and so far our only, Catholic President.  His election proved that the American people would elect a Catholic President, and no doubt there will be others elected in the future.  The biggest reason that no Catholic was elected President prior to JFK was the fear that a Catholic President might be controlled by the Vatican (Pope).  The history of the Catholic Church tends to legitimize this fear to some extent.\n\nThe history of Europe in the last 1500 years is inextricably intertwined with the history of the Catholic Church.  The Vatican held a virtual stranglehold over the European continent for many centuries and was the power behind the political institutions of the day.  Much harm was done to many people for many many years in the name of religion.  Of course religious conflict still exists all over the world.\n\nTwo of the founding principles of the United States were the freedom of religion and the separation of Church and State.  These principles were the direct result of the lessons learned from the study of the history of Europe.\n\nThe Christian religion is divided into two basic camps, Catholic and Protestant.  While the Protestant religion has fragmented into many sects (Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist, etc.), the Catholic religion has remained centralized with power residing in the Pope and the Vatican.  They still wield considerable power throughout the world and this power is still feared by many people.  \n\nAs a group, Protestants outnumber Catholics by significant numbers in the United States.  This voting block has kept the so called ""Catholic menace"" at bay for most of our history.  Only JFK's skill as a politician enabled him to overcome the obstacles presented by his religion.  I think he proved to most people that a President of the United States, who is of the Catholic faith, could lead this nation without being unduly influenced by the Pope or the political arm of the Vatican. I'm sure there will be others to come.\n\nHistory is fascinating to me because I think to know where we are going, we first must know where we have been.  I firmly believe in that the old saying, ""Those who fail to learn from their mistakes are doomed to repeat them"".  The study of history is, in part, a study of those mistakes.  Do you see a repetition of the past in the events taking place in the world today?\n\nInteresting questions always make a person think.  Thanks for your question.\n\nBest wishes to you and yours."

Most of eternity was poverty. Something radical happened in the last few-hundred-years, in the west.\n1. The Enlightenment fostered thinking, and thinking that you could create something.\n2. The abandonment of primitive concepts such as serfdoms, replaced by property ownership which gives people a vested interest in continually improving, rather than stagnating.\n3. The means to displace existing products & technologies, w/o being slaughtered for it.\n\nAll of this really means the freedom to act and the protection by the government to be free. Look at the poor nations & you'll see there are no institutions of freedom.

From an employers prospective, I think it would be cost they are looking at. They have to pay a temp to do your job  or have someone take on your job that works there for the time that you are away. Production for the time would be low and a money loss, either by paying a new temp or the guy who has to do your job and his.  Employers are not threatened by you taking the time, in fact, a lot of employers know there are life issues that need to be delt with.

"We have so many of their illegal aliens inside our own borders, what would really be the difference? We could take all of that $$ and energy that we put toward ""border control"" and put it to use somewhere else-like the real war we are fighting in Iraq. Anyway, yes we should allow it. We should own Mexico, we practically do anyway-they are in debt up to their ears with us. And we are paying for their illegal citizens to come live in our country. We are paying double! It would save time and money if we just encompassed them into us. We're both bilingual countries anyway. I don't see that it would make that much of a difference to us. To Mexico it would."

I would give a shot to the new member countries, Hungary Poland, Slovenia. But probably - maybe this is a bit risky solution I would try to gain citizenship in a country which is NOT a EU member at the moment, but has a very good chance to join. But the citizenship process is not easy, and forget that any country - at least within th EU - will hand it like candy. If it`s important for your further wellbeings I`ll try to provide you with more assistance, as recently I am still a EU citizen ( living in Australia ) but have fairly good idea about the process.

How not to get called would be to never register to vote, do not get a drivers license, do not register a vehicle, do not own property.

No, it is not true. Since Bush came to office, the public debt has increased by $2.5 trillion, but not because he borrowed all of that. First, Congress sets the budget, so THEY borrowed the money. Second, not all of it is borrowed, but interest that has been accruing. Third, not all of the debt is owned by foreign countries. 41% of the current debt holdings are held by US government agencies, not by people, foreign or otherwise. The vast majority of the rest of the debt is held by American citizens and companies.

"EDIT to Sqwirlsgirl:\nI tried to send you a message to thank you for the very nice remark, offer to reply any doubts / or exchange ideas and to burry the hatchet. Unfortunately YA said you must confirm your e-mail address first (I think you do this by editing your profile). Peace.\nEND of Edit\n  \nEDIT to Ku Lok´s answer:\n \nAt first I agreed with what Ku Lok said, but didn´t quite grasp how that would help define racism. Since he makes such an important point and (for me) takes a new approach to racism, but doesn´t make it clear, I´ve decided to add this edit to underscore his observations (which would easily fit as one of my ""lose thoughts"" below.\n \nIf a white (or non minority) does an act that may be construed as racism, someone might take advantage of that and play the race card. Others that go along, believing it to be racists without getting to all the facts correctly are themselves being racists. To use one of his examples, if he takes a managemant decision to promote a white person or fire a black on, it could be because of racism or not. To suppose it is, is a racist interpretation of the fact: ""he´s white, therefore that decision was probably because he´s racist"" or ""he wouldn´t have fired Thompson if he were white"". How can you possibly know that? How manny people even bother looking for the whole facts before making up there minds?\n \nPS: I don´t get the anger towards Airforce1989´s answer and it seemed that the bashing was uncalled for. The question should stand on its own and people don´t have any obligation other than try to give an honest answer to the question that was posted, which she did. At most, you could only expect that the answerer take the forum into account, anything other than that is completely optional. IMHO\n \nEND of EDIT\n------------------------------------------\n \nThis is such a complicated issue. Before I posted the answer I wrote, I read some of the others and found most questions focus on negative racism but almost completely disregard positive racism. Although it doesn´t seem as bad, you must remember that the negative only exists because od the positive.\n\nHere are some lose thoughts on this subject:\n1) Any kind of pre-evaluation based solely on racial characteristics. \nFor example: ""Jose is Mexican so he must be illegal (or lazy)"" and ""Thompson is black so he´s likely to do drugs"" are obviuos cases of racism. But, ""This Thompson is really amazing, having become a Harvard lawyer being black and all"" and ""It´s really nice to see how Jose is good in math, since you´d might expect that he didn´t have very good schools down in Mexico"" are also very racists because you automatically suppose they weren´t rich spoiled kids from Belair or something.\n \n2) Other obvious are ""he´s black so must be good in basketball"" or ""ask her the answer because she´s Korean"".\n \n3) Sometimes it´s not verbalised but can show as a pattern. I have a jewish friend who would alway speak positively of any other jew. If we were talking about the business´s managers, he would trash most of them, except the really good ones and the jewish ones. If we were talking about the sexy film stars, he would always praise the jewish a little higher. It bacame annoying once you got on to it. I think that is racism.\n \n4) Unequal employment opportunities are also obvious.\n \n5) A fine line: I´m white and the only black female actresses I feel sexually atracted to are Hale Barry and Tandy Newton (arguably ""whitenned"" to fit Hollywood´s standards). Is that racism? I think so. Lets put it another way. Would I ever treat two female co-workers (one white and one black) differently? No. Would I be equally likely to befriend them? I believe so. Would I feel equally sexually atracted to the black one (given she was as atractive)? So far, I have never even felt that attraction. Is that racism? I´m sure it "

"""The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."" -- Edmund Burke \n\n""War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things.

"No, the 16th Amendment says, ""The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""

Definitely want to talk to an attorney.\n\nGood luck.

I know it's a little long but you asked...Mexican-born men, for example, are more likely to be in the labor force than any other racial or ethnic group, according to the Census Bureau. Nearly half of Latino immigrants own their own homes. While most immigrants from Latin America, especially Mexico and Central America, lag in educational attainment, their children are far more likely to stay in school: according to research by the Pew Hispanic Center, 80 percent of second-generation Latinos graduate from high school. Almost half of second-generation Latinos ages 25 to 44 have attended college, and those who graduate earn more on average than non-Hispanic white workers. \n\nLatino immigrants are also starting their own businesses at a rapid pace. The Census Bureau reported that entrepreneurship among Latinos is increasing at a rate three times faster than that of other Americans. Americans of Hispanic descent now own 1.6 million businesses generating $222 billion annually; and while Census data didn't distinguish between immigrants and American-born Hispanics, it suggested that much of this growth occurred in heavily immigrant communities. \n\nLike every generation of immigrants before them, Latinos start out on the bottom rungs of the economic ladder, but they don't stay there. They are learning English as quickly as their predecessors, perhaps more quickly thanks to television (a majority of third-generation Latinos speak only English). They are intermarrying at faster rates than earlier ethnic groups, too, with about one-third of married American-born Latinos having a non-Hispanic spouse.
In the movie Fahrenheit 9/11 Michael More closed it with thie question.  He attempted to get members of Congress to send their children to serve in Iraq as a way of pointing out the class divide between the United States' leaders and the people who serve in the military. Moore did acknowledge that at the start of the war in Iraq, there appears to have been only one member of Congress with a child serving in Iraq: Sen. Tim Johnson (D-South Dakota), whose son Brooks serves in the Army.\n\nTwo more Congressmen had sons who reportedly were being sent to Iraq in late 2003 or early 2004: Representatives Joe Wilson (R-South Carolina) and Duncan Hunter (R-California).\n\nIn addition, there are some other members of Congress and the Bush administration with children or relatives serving in the military if not necessarily in Iraq. For example, Representative Mark Kennedy (R-Minnesota), who was seen in Fahrenheit 9/11, reportedly has a nephew serving in Afghanistan, and one of his four children reportedly was thinking of joining the navy. Attorney General John Ashcroft's son Andrew also reportedly has served in the Navy in the Persian Gulf.

No. Although it is not clear how central a role she has played in the foreign policy debacles, she certainly has been a willing partner in the marketing of the war and other questionable policies.\nShe obviously is bright, and might be a better president than Bush, but I cannot support anyone who has played such a strong role in our failed policies.\nRemember her testimony before the 9-11 commission when she was claiming that we couldn't have known about the 9-11 attacks, and she had to be coerced into reading the title of a memo that warned of such attacks?

War decisions are based on Control ... and so are peaceful decisions.  It is a calculation of whether or not a person will be more in control through war.
I feel bad for you because I have read your other questions and answers.  You sound like a very nice person.  Let me tell you what I know....\n\nFor Washington State, the Statute of Limitations (SOL) to enforce a written contract is 6 years.   You are too late to sue him.  Your best shot would be if he had made any payments on the contract anytime during the 7 years.  Each payment makes the 6 year SOL start over.  SO if he made a payment during the 4th year, you have 6 years from that point to sue him.  In that case, you have a good, enforceable case.  Or, if he didnt make a payment but at least acknowledged the debt in some form of writing to you, that may also trigger the 6 year SOL to start over from the date he made written acknowledgement of the debt.  \n\nLastly, you could just sue him anyway even with no payments or written acknowledment of the debt from him. Once you sue and state your case in your court papers (dont mention anything about the SOL in your papers) the burden woulb be on him to raise the defense of the 6 year SOL applying to teh case.  If he did, you'd lose.  If he is not aware of the 6 year SOL, you can just act like it doesnt exist and move forward to slam dunk him in court. GOOD LUCK!!!
When the Army steps up and does its job as well as the Marine Corps.  The official mission of the Marine Corps has been over since the first part of the war.

The thing people forget or are confusing in this whole issue is that that the people that are rioting over the Danish cartoons think that the governernment of Denmark has something to do with the printing/content of that paper. Here, is the US, decisions on what to print are made by editors based on what they personally deem 'newsworthy' or what will sell papers, providing it isn't libelous or slanderous. Freedom of speech means you cansay anything you want and I will defend your right to say it. I DO NOT have to agree with what you are saying to want you to be able to express it. I personally, thought the cartoons were in poor taste, as I would any cartoons of someone else's religion. But it isn't illegal in the US to print bad taste. See most all of our newspapers for reference...\n\nWhere there is no free speech/free press, what is in the papers is an extension of the government. Here, the press is frequently counter to the goverment. They help to keep them in check.\n\nHolocaust/racist cartoons don't get printed in the mainstream press not because they against the law, but because they will upset people and cause the paper not to be bought. The Islamic cartoons weren't printed here, either, for the same reasons.

"KGB is the Russian-language acronym for State Security Committee, Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti).\n\nFrom March 13, 1954 to November 6, 1991 KGB was the umbrella organisation name for:\n\n    * the principal Soviet security agency;\n\n    * the principal intelligence agency;\n\n    * the principal secret police agency.\n\nRoughly, the KGB's operational domain encompassed functions and powers like those exercised by the United States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the counterintelligence (internal security) division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Federal Protective Service, and the Secret Service.\n\nIn March 1953, Lavrenty Beria consolidated the MVD and the MGB into one body--the MVD; within a year, Beria was executed and MVD was split. The re-formed MVD retained its police and law enforcement powers, while the second, new agency, KGB, assumed internal and external security functions, and was subordinate to the Council of Ministers. On July 5, 1978 the KGB was re-christened as the ""KGB of the Soviet Union"", with its chairman holding a ministerial council seat.\n\nThe KGB was dissolved when its chief, Colonel-General Vladimir Kryuchkov, used the KGB's resources in aid of the August 1991 coup attempt to overthrow Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. On August 23, 1991 Colonel-General Kryuchkov was arrested, and General Vadim Bakatin was appointed KGB Chairman--and mandated to dissolve the KGB of the Soviet Union. On November 6, 1991, the KGB officially ceased existing, though its successor national state security organisation, the Russian Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti (FSB), is functionally much like the Soviet KGB.\n\nBelarus is the only post-Soviet Union era country where the successor state security organization continues to be known as KGB. Belarus is also the birthplace of Felix Dzerzhinsky, one of the founders of the KGB.\nFelix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky\nFelix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky\n\nTasks and organization\n\nIts tasked responsibilities were external espionage, counter-espionage, the liquidation of anti-Soviet and counter-revolutionary organisations within the Soviet Union, guarding the national borders, guarding the Communist Party and State leaders, and critical state property. Also, it investigated and prosecuted thieves of State and socialist property and white collar criminals. Unlike Western intelligence agencies, the KGB (theoretically) was uninterested in learning the enemy's intentions--only their capabilities; intentions were political decisions based upon Marxist theory.\n\nIn espionage, the KGB mostly relied on human intelligence (HUMINT), unlike their Western counterparts, who relied more on technology--imagery intelligence (IMINT) and signals intelligence (SIGINT). Using ideological attraction, the Soviets successfully recruited many high-level spies. Most notable are the KGB successes in gathering US atomic secrets, and, in the UK, the Cambridge Five, especially Kim Philby of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS). Ideological recruitment abroad was nearly impossible after the Soviet Union crushed the 1956 Hungarian uprising. Instead, KGB was forced to rely upon blackmail and bribery to control most of its defectors. Still, this achieved notable successes, such as CIA mole Aldrich Ames and FBI mole Robert Hanssen, but fewer than in earlier decades.\n\nParalleling developments at MI5 and the CIA, the KGB had, before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, commercialized its advanced technologies for business applications. Artificial intelligence software which was formerly used to sort and filter signals intelligence has become available through companies such as Autonomy (an MI5 spin-off) and InfoTame (ex-KGB technologists).\n\nNotable KGB operations\nNKVD Headquarters on Lubyanka Square were designed by Aleksey Schusev.\nEnlarge\nNKVD Headquarters on Lubyanka Square were designed by Aleksey Schusev.\n\nDuring the 1945-1991 Cold War, the KGB of the Sov"
"There have been other reports to that effect.  The White House had no comment to the Washington Post when asked about the Ha'aretz story, which is a strong hint that they could not deny it.  I'll see if I can find sources for you.\n\nIn the meantime, Bush has made similar statements about being specifically guided by God.  He told Bob Woodward that he doesn't have to pay attention to his father, the ex-President's advice, because he answers to a higher Father.\n\nAnd here are more reports: Earlier, Jackson Lears in the New York Times reported Bush as saying, ""''Events aren't moved by blind change and chance''..., but by ''the hand of a just and faithful God.'' From the outset he has been convinced that his presidency is part of a divine plan, even telling a friend while he was governor of Texas, ''I believe God wants me to run for president.'' This conviction that he is doing God's will has surfaced more openly since 9/11. In his State of the Union addresses and other public forums, he has presented himself as the leader of a global war against evil. As for a war in Iraq, ''we do not claim to know all the ways of Providence, yet we can trust in them.'' God is at work in world affairs, he says, calling for the United States to lead a liberating crusade in the Middle East, and ''this call of history has come to the right country.''""

A stuttering former alcoholic turned born again christian who murders 20 year old kids in Iraq and then makes JOKES about it for an explanation isn't my idea of morning entertainment. He makes me SICK. For the person below me... People stutter and mispronounce when they're nervous and consciously aware that they're lying or feeding out BS.

I agree, I am a former US Marine and a firefighter hopeful, but we as humans need stimuli, like entertainment, so we pay through the nose to get it, because so many people watch sports. the advertisers pay to sponser teams, and the palyers get alot of that money to keep the games interesting enough to keep the money coming in!!! but yes US Marines and firefighters and police and EMTs should be paid a whole lot more, but then again, the people who are doing it now for such crumby pay, do it because they truely care for mankind, if the money was better, we would have a bunch of asswipes who wouldn't risk their lives...sad paradox.
mass producing alcohol descreatly is nearly impossibly so its easy to tax. pot grows anywhere & the yield is so high that the only way to cash in on it is legality. look at who gets paid; growers, transporters, wholesalers & retailers. thats alot of jobs created & the money made is good for the economy. but wait, theres more! who also gets paid; lawyers, courts, county, federal subsidies(taxes)(goes to cops, survailance, cop cars, ect.), all the court ordered programs, jails & prisons. its the greatest cash crop ever (besides war). \ncourt ordered programs: all government offices are alotted money for the year. if they use it all, they get more next year & so on. as long as they can stuff warm bodies into these programs, theyll get more money. taxes will never dry up as long as they can steal it outa your check before you get it.\nprisons: the unit i was in is an agriculture unit. we grew okra, cabbage, peas, & corn. orange unit down the way was a packaging unit. styles unit is steel fabrication that makes the buildings we (inmates) are stored in. fregison was a textile unit. we are a self preservation society. get it. look up TCI on the stock market. stands for 'texas correctional industries. we are a workforce that houses, feeds, clothes & maintains ourselves while producing free world goods. NEVER believe that bullsht that it costs tens of thousands per inmate per year. prisons are money makers.

If US intervenes in a civil war situation, then it's no more civil war. Civil war by definition is a war that takes part between factions native to the same country on that country's sovereign territory. If US gets involved and as Iraq is under occupation there can be no civil war.
Strong back,weak mind, you get the picture? Now to become a Marine is a little more demanding.

He's an adult at 18 regardless of military status.  Your child support obligations ended the day he turned 18.

Go to the Federal Bankruptcy Court you will be filing with, pick-up the packet they provide with all the paperwork. The clerks cannot give legal advice (should you include this or that), but they can answer questions about the process itself (the steps you take, where it will go, time periods between filing, meeting the trustee, period creditors can oppose, when it finally it is discharged). This all is if it's cut and dry Chapter 7 and once you read through the packet you should be able to figure if it's too complicated and should get a lawyer.\nYou do the majority of the work whether it's Chapter 7 or 11, by yourself or a lawyer, so don't pay 3 months salary for something that could be as easy as filing a 1040EZ tax form.\nEducate yourself before your make someone else responsible for your future.\nI know people will yell at me, so what.\nBTW: the vast majority of bankruptcies are businesses and not individuals, so don't let someone guilt you out.

"As far as land and property goes, in the ""old days"" you simply staked out a claim.  In present time, you actually have to purchase the land you live on and hold a title to that land.  Without a title of ownership, anyone can take it from you.  It's like finders keepers.  If I take something from you and you cannot prove that it was yours with documentation or present some sort of proof in court that you possessed it or I stole it, it's mine and there is nothing you can do about it. Drop $100 bill on the street and see if you can get it back from the person who picks it up.\n\nAs far as rights and the constitution.  You do not have to claim the rights of the country you were born in.  If you are born in the United States you recieve a birth certificate and the government documents your existance with a Social Security number.  If you have these thing, you automatically recieve the rights granted to you under the constition."
"Only pursue becoming a lawyer if you are doing it for the right reasons.

Just read an article about the incidence of substance abuse, mental illness, etc. in the lawyer population as opposed to the general population.  There are a lot of unhealthy, unhappy lawyers.\n\nIf you go for it, then make sure you have hobbies that you keep up with after practice.  Don't let practice swallow you whole.  Also, despite the prevailing view that firm practice is the ONLY practice, make sure you consider what are currently considered ""alternative"" forms of practice that may suit you.\n\nI'm finally in what many would consider an alternative form of practice, and I still have difficulties and stress, but I'm much, much happier and actually enjoy practice now.  Do what makes you feel like a real person (cause firm life can make you feel like a soulless drone).\n\nGood luck."

It shouldn't be the government that does this.  I am an Economics major, and spent a semester studying Environmental Economics.  The solution can, will, and should come from the private sector.  There are many companies out there researching alternate sources of energy, and when it becomes more economical to use these new advances in technology, the market will use them.  Right now it is too cost prohibitive to use alternate forms of energy, but as other resources become more scarce, the price of them will go up, and we as a society will use alternate forms of energy, all without having to get the government involved.

"I moved to serbia just after he was sent to hague,i also felt that it was a good move but was shocked at how this country has crumbled since his departure.\n yes he was a criminal by that i mean he stole from his own people to finance the 10year war ,he gave rise to mafia and parasites which steal and feed from the poor but thats another story.\n  The fact is he is as guilty as the croatian and muslim leaders who started the break up and war, its just that the poor serbs arent catholic or muslim but orthodox which means they must be destroyed by all means so the jews and most of the world who were  allies of serbia and not to mention that if it wasnt for the serbs there wouldnt be many jews in europe today as they saved the jews from the nazis, all ended up going against serbia for some stupid reason.\n  therefore milosevic was portrayed by the media as a ""dictator"" and ""mass murderer"" and accused of running ""concentration camps"" but notice how the media used all of the above to pull jewish support by reminding them of the nazis but croatia was a fascist state which was with the nazis and murdered over 750 000 serbs,jews and romas living in croatia,not to mention the muslims who were also with the nazis and wanted help to destroy israel.\n  isnt it bizzare?\nfor everyone who feels sorry for albaninians should read how they lived in kosovo\n  they had theyre own schools shops albanian was the main language spoken and taught at school serbian was second IN serbia imagine mexican being the main languge spoken in texas and having special rights for mexicans thats the truth on how they lived but its not enough so they started terrorising serbs and tried to remove them from kosovo before milosevic stepped in as the terrorists tried to claim it as theyre own country.\n Kosovo has always been the heart and begining of serbia this man was only saving his own people and country! people should look back to history and see what really went on in these states before they judge someone from what they watch on american news.\n  \n  everyone should read up on how many Serbs were killed in kosovo by albanian terrorist before milosevic came in and doesnt ever country have the right to exterminate all terrorists? america actually goes into other countries to do this and its seems ok????  I am happy that the hague did not achive its main goal and i hope that they all rot in hell especially the main people who run the show. did anyone watch his trial anyway? he was always one step above them and they wouldnt of got him on much considering all the crappy evidence they had and not to mention lying witnesses which was a disgrace for such a court even the judges couldnt believe it but thats something they dont show on american tv.

"Absent a specific state law that permits you to file for injunctive relief in the circumstances you describe, in order to enjoin a governmental agency from acting, you must demonstrate that you have standing to sue, by alleging that you have suffered, or will imminently suffer, a particularized and concrete, injury in fact, fairly traceable to the defendant, for which a court can provide relief. \n\nCourts generally hold that standing as a taxpayer is not a sufficiently direct injury to satisfy the standing requirement for injunctive relief, except where the government is spending taxpayer money in violation of the Establishment Clause of the Constitution, by promoting a particular religious belief or sect, advances or inhibits religion generally, or creates unnecessary entanglements with religion (this is known in Constitutional Law as the ""Lemon"" test).\n\nSo, absent a religious connection between the agency action and the expenditure of funds, or a showing that the agency's actions will harm you directly, for example by failing to keep a tree on public land in your neighborhood trimmed, that there is an imminent danger of the tree falling on your property or person, you have no case.\n\nTherefore your risk, is that you will be wasting a lot of money and time, and that the court will simply dismiss your action as failing to state a case for which relief may be granted.\n\nYour only recourse is to contact your legislative representatives and demand and investigation or removal of the persons who are mismanaging the public fisc."
It won't be built directly on the border.  It will be built slightly inside the US territory.  So I doubt illegals will be hired.

Mexico diverted it a bit.  A park the US had built on the river's edge became Mexican property because the new route for the river put the park on the southern side of the river.

Some argue that liberalism (capitalism) will bring people want to not only have choice in their goods and services but also in their governments.  This is not always the case, ironically, a state could continue to be authoritarian but accomodate liberalism.  In essence swinging from communism to fascism.  I think the chances of China moving towards democracy are greater than North Korea's.  However the Republic of Korea (South Korea) has its Sunshine Policy that ultimate seeks the reuniting of the two countries and if this occured, it would most certainly be a democracy.  Time will tell in those two countries.\n\n   As far as communism goes.  The idea is utopian and relies too much on the good will of human beings being their best all the time.  Unfortunately few are saints and this system of economics and government has proven to be a failure.

It depends on how long his A school is going to be. \nMy ex was in A school for nearly two years, (during which we were going to be married), and we would have had base housing. (Thankfully that relationship didn't work out). \n\nMy hubby now is in also in the Navy..must be the uniforms, lol. From my knowledge, you can visit anytime you want. Check to see what his base offers. There should be a Navy Lodge there (although it does cost money per night, but has discounts on weeks), or maybe some temporary apartments to house family members when they visit. Also, you might be able to stay with him in the barracks since your married, however, that all depends on how strict his BPO is (Building Petty Officer). \n\nThis part doesn't pertain to your question. Since you are marrying a Navy guy, I suggest getting involved with some of the support groups they have at his base for Navy wives, and checking thing out on line. Get all the information out there that you can. This is something I should have done, but I didn't. Now that he's out on cruise, I regret it. It's a tuff life, and the long seperations totally suck, so prepare yourself for it ahead of time, and make sure you have a good support system in place. \nHere's a site I really like:\nhttp://www.military.org\nThey have a part under Navy for spouses. \n\nI wish you the best of luck and much happiness in life.

You have to use common sense.  If countries felt the US would not use force to stop them from gaining nuclear weapons.  WHat would make them fear going for them.  Look at Iran has the UN done anything NO!  The only thing they fear is our military right now we are tied up in Iraq so they are betting we wont attack because we dont have the forces.

My opinion ... war has no winners\n\nI'll probably get flamed for that, but Oh Well
"""Secure borders"" is a fantasy, just like the ""war on drugs"" and the ""war on terror"".  Politicians talk about it in the hope that people believe the government is doing something about it.  It is an insane and mistaken proposition that you can somehow defend against the action of a single determined individual.  Yet the government keeps pouring our tax dollars into a big black hole all the while telling us to trust them.  I don't think so.\n\nYou can't be free and at the same time have the ability to stop an individual from doing something they want to do.  It doesn't matter whether it's crossing a border, taking drugs, or committing an act of terror.  We can't even stop Americans from robbing, terrorizing, and killing each other, let alone prevent it on a global scale.  If we give up rights and freedoms in order to be ""secure"" then what have we accomplished?\n\nAs a country, we are now in the process of repeating the same mistakes made by past nations/civilizations.  Those who advocate building walls, profiling, and other such measures in the name of security should take some time to review their history.  There is no fortress that can't be overcome and a ""fortress America"" would be no different.  If you believe that history won't repeat itself and the fate of the US will be different, you're only fooling yourself.\n\nDon't buy the jingoism and the macho statements of the day like ""we need to fight them over there so we don't have to fight them over here"" or ""they hate us for our freedoms"".  Those are meaningless statements.  The government has failed the American people and the people of many other nations because it fails to walk the talk.  And because those making US foreign policy have almost always resorted to flexing their muscle, rather than working toward a win-win solution in the best interests of the American people and other affected nations.  We are now paying dearly for such a short-sighted approach.\n\nTo be secure, we need to address the root cause of problems.  Treating symptoms is almost always more costly in the long run and it just doesn't work.  Unresolved problems may go away for awhile, or they may fester, but they always come back and sometimes worse than before.  Tolerance for others along with fairness, and integrity in all of our dealings with others would go a long way toward creating a more peaceful and secure world.  Peace."
Well, if you swim the Rio Grande, then you'll probably end up in Juarez...not a good place to be to begin with! I wouldn't be worried about getting arrested. I'd be worried about getting kidnapped and held up for ransom...as it is constantly being done there. Or, if you are a female, I'd worry about being kidnapped and being sold as a sex slave...as is being done there. Oh, and the police won't help you. This, of course, is assuming you don't get severely sick since the Rio Grande is polluted so bad. \nHowever, the party scene there is really big. So, I'd watch out getting hit by a drunk American eighteen year old while your out in the streets protesting.
"The law under which the Selective Service System operates is the Military Selective Service Act. (Act of June 24, 1948, c. 625, 62 Stat. 604, as amended; 50 U.S.C. App. 451 et seq.). Selective Service Regulations are contained in Part 1600 of Title 32 of the Code of Federal Regulations (32 CFR 1600).\n\nWho must register? according to http://www.sss.gov/must.htm\nAlmost all male U.S. citizens regardless of where they live, and male immigrant aliens residing in the U.S., are required to be registered with Selective Service if they are at least 18 years old but are not yet 26 years old. Men who are 26 years old and older are too old to register. \n\nWhat are the penalties if you do not register?  According to http://www.sss.gov/FSbenefits.htm \nRegistration is the law. A man who fails to register may, if prosecuted and convicted, face a fine of up to $250,000 and/or a prison term of up to five years. \n\nEven if not tried, a man who fails to register with Selective Service before turning age 26 may find that some doors are permanently closed.\n\n\nAh, okay I got your drift now.  A google search of ""step forward selective services"" comes up with a number of ways to avoid INDUCTION when registering.

I'm going to copy-and-paste my Sunni/Shiite rant from another question and then elaborate:\n\nThe split between the Shiite and the Sunni Muslims occured when Ali, leader of the Arab Empire was assasinated in 661 AD.\n\nThe Shiite believe that when Ali was killed he was the last true caliph (ruler) and everybody after him weren't true leaders because they weren't his descendants. Shiite are the majority in Iraq and Iran.\n\nThe Sunni Muslims accepted the Umayyad rule after Ali and make up thr overall majority of thr Middle East. \n\nNow they aren't fighting as much over the rightful kings, but fighting because they were brought up as rivals. Its like Yankee fans vs Red Sox fans. They are just rivals and it isn't as much about the cause of the rivalry anymore.\n\nNew Material Here:\n\nThis isn't the only clashing between Arabs; there are arabs that don't fit into either category and some who are just plain terrorists/ terrorist supporters.  \n\nWith an area so deeply divided it wouldn't work well.  They need to be governed strongly because of how tough the area is.  A democracy or republic isn't very easy to pull off in the Middle East.  It wouldn't last very long because of militant groups trying to attack any form of power.  \n\nThe only force strong enough to keep control over in the present-day Middle East is a dictator.  But that isn't a great thing to have, either.  What they really need is a strong Oligarchy.  This is my random opinion from out-of-the-blue.  \n\nWith an oligarchy they'd have a few ruling people.  This means that they'd most likely be fair because they can argue amongst themselves and as long as none plan to assasinate another, then it'd be like the Middle East version of a republic as long as they got the right to vote on some issues.

"Please do note that this was not a ""deal"" that the administration cooked up.   It was a sale of a business by a private company which required, like many other sales involving work in the U.S., review by the administration to make sure it meets legal muster.  Nor was the ""deal"" covert -- it was made public several months ago (when the leading bidder for the London company's business -- a Singapore company-- withdrew their offer).\n\nSo, as a matter of legal fairness, if the company has followed all the U.S. laws there is no proper reason to disallow the sale.   To do so, on no legal grounds, is to tell an Arab country which has, since 9-11 been very helpful in combatting terrorism (in precisely such areas as port security, esp. container inspection), that the rules we apply to all other nations don't apply to them.  That would also discourage other Arab countries thinking of co-operating with us from thinking it's worth doing so.\n\nThere may also be some specific ways the UAE has helped us in the past few years that the administration cannot, for security reasons, give details about  (i.e., you don't want to divulge what you know about terrorist groups you are pursuing, nor all the sources of that information, because that would put them at risk and dry up potential sources, who would fear being outted themselves).   Of course, the administration would want to CONTINUE to get this kind of help and nixing business sales might threaten such assistance going forward.\n\nAs for the question, 'why a UAE business, not an American one?'   Simple answer: NO American companies bid to purchase the London company's business.  They were welcome to do so.  But, in fact, there really are not any American companies vying to manage these port terminal operations.  And again, the administration was never ""pushing"" for Dubai Port Worlds to make this purchase.  That agreement was made between the parties before the U.S. government had any involvement in the matter.\n\nFinally, it would be wise to inform yourself about what exactly the ""business"" is, who would be doing the actual work etc.  (Short answer -- it is basically about loading and unloading boats in specific port terminals, NOT running the entire port, much less port security;   the on site workers will continue to be the AMERICAN dock workers who worked for the London company selling the business.)\n\nThese, any a few other points, were made (more clearly) in an email from Bush administrations officials a couple of weeks ago.   I don't have a copy of the full text, but a number of excerpts may be found at the link below."
"Non-conformity?\n\nAre you suggesting that chaos is a much better fashion statement than organization (although I firmly believe that chaos itself is an order.)\n\nAlthough I haven't seen the movie, a good friend of mine did and raised this same question to me. My response is now as it was then...\n\nThe major problem that we are facing as earthlings is our seeming inclination to NOT take responsiblity for our own actions. Because of our society's inability to do as such, we are left with one of two choices: 1) Let people do as they please and allow society to become a land of goons and selfish, self-righteous individuals who care not about their society... or 2) Control every facet of life so that people who choose not to make responsible decisions are made to pay...\n\nAgain, brother, the problem is not that people are unable to make their own decisions, it is that people don't appear to be willing to take responsiblity for those decisions, thus leading to other's distress...\n\nI believe, personally, from things that I have learned, encountered, and dealt with in this truly exciting experience that we call ""Life,"" that freedom truly is free if we all assume it. However, people are not all alike and sadly, we are left to the majority of opinion controlling our society. Because of that, there are people who are left dissatisfied. \n\nThis dissatisfaction leads to unrest. Unrest of one, leads to manipulation of more to regain a sense of control to bring about change. From there comes the usage of the most controlling item to balance the scales (in this case MONEY). Once that is achieved, anyone with this sort of controlling factor will want to bring about changes in accordance with what they (and whoever else has assisted them in this monetary augmentation) want. Then you have the ongoing condition of our country soon to follow.\n\nIf you see, the situation went from what is good for the people, to what is good for the persons... \n\nThis, I believe, may have been the thinking behind the development of religious supremacy. If we all believe in one thing and are for one cause, then it is much more likely that we will succeed and progress. If we are all fighting as individuals with unwaivering and unforgiving beliefs, then we will hardly find any success that brings about a true progression. \n\nWhat is most frightening to me, is that it isn't the single belief in a single God or entity that is the key (it may be on a personal level, but is presently impossible at this time in the world on a global scale), it is the simple belief in the human condition and the acceptance and love of all of our earthling inhabitants that will bring about this free society.\n\nThings that are loved and cared for are hardly mistreated. If nothing is mistreated, nothing is offended, and nothing is erased. This is a very simple concept. \n\nIn the end, this sort of ideology does not request conformity, it incites appreciation of all and is ultimately our true road to freedom. \n\nHope that helps..."

"Sort of like ""Nafta Plus"" or closer to EU. I'm not sure about that one. If Mexico and/or Canada wanted to join the US, then I would be in favor of that perhaps.\n\nI think the US should be open to expanision, but I think it should be others joining our union not an amagamation. Mexico's government is deeply flawed. Canada's government borders on not being entirely a Democracy- their senate is appointed and representation in their lower house is not proportionate to their population. \n\nAnd opening the south border to Mexicans to come and go is such a crazy idea... that it might just work."

Economy Mexico \nEconomy - overview: Mexico has a free market economy that recently entered the trillion dollar class. It contains a mixture of modern and outmoded industry and agriculture, increasingly dominated by the private sector. Recent administrations have expanded competition in seaports, railroads, telecommunications, electricity generation, natural gas distribution, and airports. Per capita income is one-fourth that of the US; income distribution remains highly unequal. Trade with the US and Canada has tripled since the implementation of NAFTA in 1994. Mexico has 12 free trade agreements with over 40 countries including, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, the European Free Trade Area, and Japan, putting more than 90% of trade under free trade agreements. The government is cognizant of the need to upgrade infrastructure, modernize the tax system and labor laws, and provide incentives to invest in the energy sector, but progress is slow.  \nGDP (purchasing power parity): $1.006 trillion (2004 est.)  \nGDP - real growth rate: 4.1% (2004 est.)  \nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $9,600 (2004 est.)  \nGDP - composition by sector: agriculture: 4% \nindustry: 27.2% \nservices: 68.9% (2004 est.)  \nLabor force: 34.73 million (2004 est.)  \nLabor force - by occupation: agriculture 18%, industry 24%, services 58% (2003)  \nUnemployment rate: 3.2% plus underemployment of perhaps 25% (2004 est.)  \nPopulation below poverty line: 40% (2003 est.)  \nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share: lowest 10%: 1.6% \nhighest 10%: 35.6% (2002)  \nDistribution of family income - Gini index: 53.1 (1998)  \nInflation rate (consumer prices): 5.4% (2004 est.)  \nInvestment (gross fixed): 19.4% of GDP (2004 est.)  \nBudget: revenues: $160 billion \nexpenditures: $158 billion, including capital expenditures of NA (2004 est.)  \nPublic debt: 23.5% of GDP (2004 est.)  \nAgriculture - products: corn, wheat, soybeans, rice, beans, cotton, coffee, fruit, tomatoes; beef, poultry, dairy products; wood products  \nIndustries: food and beverages, tobacco, chemicals, iron and steel, petroleum, mining, textiles, clothing, motor vehicles, consumer durables, tourism

Actually, The governor appoints a new senator. He/She needs no approval from the State Legislature. The only thing is that if it is over a year from the next election for that seat, a special election must be held. But if it is less than a year they may serve out the rest of the term. In 2005, New Jersey senator Jon Corzine was elected governor. He was sworn in in January and he had the privilege of picking his own successor for that seat, Rep. Rob Menendez. Since the next election for that seat in in November, there will be no special election

I have lived in an area where there is a total smoking ban in restaurants and bars...actually any public place and it's great.  The way I look at it I have a RIGHT to breathe smokers need to respect that right.  In Ottawa there was a case where a waitress who had never smoked developed lung cancer...it was one of the things that influenced the smoking ban.\n\nIn short I think that Yes you have the right to enjoy your meal without breathing in smoke. \n\nI also don't understand when they say that denying smoking would hurt business.  I know my friends and I ... all non smokers go out much more now that we know we won't come home smelling of second hand smoke.

"Who says they aren't held accountable? The following is taken from Associated Press:\n\n""Since the 1970s, more than a dozen congressmen have been convicted in criminal court. Their cases and sentences include: \n\n— Rep. Andrew J. Hinshaw, R-Calif., spent a year in jail after being convicted in 1976 of accepting bribes when he was county tax assessor. He lost the primary election and resigned at the end of his term. \n\n— Rep. Charles Diggs Jr., D-Mich., was convicted in 1978 of operating a payroll kickback scheme in his congressional office. He served seven months of a three-year prison term. He was re-elected, then resigned in 1980. \n\n— Rep. Michael Myers, D-Pa., served 20 ½ months of a three-year prison sentence for accepting bribes from FBI agents impersonating Arab businessmen. He was convicted in 1980 and expelled from Congress. \n\n— Four other House members were convicted in the Arab businessmen bribery scandal: Democratic Reps. John Murphy of New York, Frank Thompson and John Jenrette of New Jersey, and Raymond Lederer of South Carolina. Thompson and Murphy were sentenced to three years; Jenrette, two years; and Lederer, one year. \n\n— Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., was convicted in 1988 of extorting nearly $2 million from defense contractor Wedtech Corp. He resigned from Congress and served two years and two months of an eight-year sentence. He was defeated for re-election in 1992.\n\n— Rep. Mel Reynolds, D-Ill., was sentenced in 1995 to five years in prison for having sex with an underage campaign worker. He resigned from Congress, then was sentenced in 1997 to 6 ½ years for bank fraud and other violations. The second sentence, which was to run at the same time as first, was commuted in 2001 by President Clinton. \n\n— Rep. Walter Tucker III, D-Calif., was sentenced in 1996 to two years and three months in prison for accepting and demanding bribes while mayor of a Los Angeles suburb. He resigned from Congress a week after his 1995 conviction. \n\n— Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., pleaded guilty in 1996 to two felony mail fraud charges, lost re-election and served 15 months in prison. Clinton pardoned him in 2000."""

Hostile work environment is also one of the two legal categories of sexual harassment.
The court determines if the arrest of an individual meets with state laws.  Corrections serves to remove those convicted individuals from the society and hopefully for them to change before returning to society.
"To be more specific and accurate, this should be called ""state socialism,"" so as to differentiate it from other forms of socialism that do not require or call for government ownership and control of the means of production.  Simply calling it ""socialism"" is too vague.\n\nThere are a range of examples in the history of the last century of state socialism, but the most prominent would be the Soviet Union, as well as its satellites and allies in Eastern Europe.  China is currently the most obvious example of this system, though it is evolving toward a mixed system of state control and free markets.\n\nThe links below will help sort this out.  Be warned that the first wikipedia link is not well written, and offers no sources.  The second is much better, but offers a much broader definition.  The PBS link is especially valuable for its timeline.  The fourth link, to the Concise Encyclopedia of Economics, is well written, but highly negative, and a number of people would disagree with Heibroner's definitions, but it is still valuable."

Zine El Abidine Ben Ali\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n \n\nZine El Abidine Ben AliZine El Abidine Ben Ali (زين العابدين بن علي; born in Hammam-Sousse on September 3, 1936) is the President of the Republic of Tunisia since November 7, 1987 and only the second one since its Independence from France on March 20, 1956.\n\n\nEarly life and training\n\nAs a young militant of President Bourguiba's Neo-Destour party, he was sent to France for military training. He graduated from the Inter-Arms School of Saint-Cyr and the Artillery School in Châlons-sur-Marne, and then continued his military training in the United States.\n\n\n\nGovernment appointment\nHe was appointed to establish and manage the Defense Ministry's Military Security in 1964, which he ran until 1974. General Ben Ali was promoted to director-general of National Security at the Ministry of the Interior in 1977 after serving as military attaché to the Kingdom of Morocco. He returned from four years as Ambassador to Poland to become once again head of National Security at the Ministry of the Interior but this time with Cabinet rank. He assumed this post at a time of increasingly radical Islamist activity. For his success in dealing with this threat to the regime he was promoted to Minister of the Interior, and retained this position until he was appointed Prime Minister. Many disappearances deaths and torture cases were reported to the human rights organisations.\n\nBen Ali was appointed Prime Minister and constitutional successor by President Habib Bourguiba on October 1, 1987. Only five weeks after becoming head of the government, he had President Bourguiba declared medically unfit for the duties of the office and assumed the presidency on November 7, 1987. The constitutional destitution of President Bourguiba was popular and legitimately based on Article 57, that allowed the procedure; the political life of the country having been deadlocked in an unending presidential succession debate and political crisis, cronyism and economic stagnation.\n\nHe then retained his predecessor's pro-western foreign policy and supported the economy which has been growing since the early 1990s. Big public works projects, including airports, highways or housing, have been undertaken. However, unemployment remains the biggest economic problem.\n\n\n\n\n[edit]\nWork as President\nBen Ali continued running the country with an iron's fist. Although he announced a fake political pluralism in 1992, his Democratic Constitutional Rally (formerly Neo-Destour party) continues to dominate the national politics and there is no genuine open political debate. In 1999, although two unknown alternative candidates were permitted for the first time to stand in the presidential elections, Ben Ali was reelected with 99.66% of the vote. Both candidates were arrested and sued for daring to challenge him. He was again reelected on October 24, 2004, officially taking 94.48% of the vote, after a controversial constitutional referendum in 2002 which allowed him to seek reelection and contemplate the possibility of remaining in office until 2014. Freedom of the press is officially guaranteed and condoned. However, human rights organizations state that no freedom of expression is evident in any of the authorized publications as honest criticism, public accountability and scrutiny of the government and it's ministers is totally absent. Cronyism and a mafia-like management style is the norm for running public affairs, and political dissent is not allowed. Jail and fines or confiscation of newspapers is very common, say human rights organizations. Many political prisoners remain in jails or in exile in and out of the country. Many arrests are a result of indiviuals venturing into the internet to bypass government propaganda and controlled press.\n\nHe was first married to Naima Kefi, the daughter of General Kefi, Tunisia's first Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and

The Shia and the Sunni have been rivals since shortly after the death of Muhammad (whom both recognize as thier first prophet) when the two groups could not agree on who was teh rightful hier to Muhammad.  One group supported on person, the other group supported someone else.  As a westerner, I can never truly understand the ethnic tensions between teh two groups, or why in some cases they live in peace while in others, they fight each other.  In Iraq the tensions relate to more modern times.  Although the country of Iraq is mostly Shia (60-something percent), during the reign of Saddam Hussien (who is a Sunni), the Sunni held th epowere and badly mistreated the Shia population.  Once saddam and his regime were removed from power, the Shia began to retaliate for the decades of persecution.  The Sunni (in the government, at least) were ruthless and brutal to the Shia Maojority- of course the Shia are angry now.  Unfortunately, thier retribuative actions against the sunni have only helped to increase teh violence between the two groups.  Until teh Sunni and teh Shia start to work together, Iraq is going to be locked into a downward spiral.  The trick to sucess in Iraq is that the Iraqis have to learn to live together.  No one else can make them do that, certainly not America.
Many patent attorneys figure that if an idea is likely to be be successful that investors (who are better at predicting success of new ideas) will back the idea and fund the patent.  \n\nThat being said, you may be able to find a patent attorney who would be willing to take legal fees on contingency, for share of company, future royalties, etc.  However, I'd be willing to bet that they'd require you to pay the filing fees, etc.  Fronting legal services is one thing, paying money out of pocket is another.\n\nA good place to start is posting on Craigslist that you are looking for an attorney to take on a deferred payment arrangement.\n\nGood luck.
Interesting thought,  The US was settled by people trying to get to a place where they could have religious freedom.  We have send many of our men and women to die to fight for others freedoms.  Would it not be hypocritical to say your free to be religious as long as it is the same as mine.\nAs far as being poluted by other religions, we welcome the diversity.  That is what makes America great.  Where people from all walks of life can have a equal say as to there spititual lifes.\n\nOne thing I would be looking at is how the countries are doing in the long run when they exclude people based on religion.  China is just now getting into the Industrial age after being backwards for the past 60 years under comunist rule.  Saudi Arabia is only going to last until the oil runs out, and even now the Saudies can't even wipe their own butts because they have been so dependent on outside talent.\n\nThe overwhelming thought in America is that you have the right to be free and to be seen as equal, no matter who you pray to.

Probably not. Unlike Iraq, Iran has a respectable military and I doubt many people would welcome American forces (as happened at first in Iraq). Such a war would be long and bloody, with no clear winner. The U.S. would have the advantage of training, equipment, and the general qualities of troops, but Iran can field a much larger army and the citizens themselves would probably take up arms in large numbers (whereas in Iraq the numbers are comparably small).\n\nTo have a chance, America would need to pirate the media airways in Iran and broadcast the truth, as opposed to Iranian propaganda, for several years before the population itself would even be manageable.\n\nWhat, then, would be the goal of a U.S. attack against Iran? The best that could be hoped for is an eventual truce where Iran is a little more reasonable than it has been.
Most definitely. We have people who are really struggling to make it now. Our middle class is being snuffed out completely. Our kids aren't being educated. Those that are least able to take care of themselves are suffering the most, and our government is turning away from them. \n\nTo the person that said we should give more individually, I do give. I volunteer about 40 hours a month to help needy children. I donate money and services to help those who are less fortunate. If you look around you, you will see how great the need is, and these are not people who are able to change their situation. We pay taxes and those tax dollars would be much better spent helping people at home than detroying lives on the other side of the world.

Go to a safe place.  Contact the police, report the situation.  After that, they will issue an emergency protective order that will restrict your abuser from contacting you.  Go to the courthouse and get a permanent protective order.  Contact a domestic violence center in your community for additional information on formulating a safety pland and counseling for the abuse.
The intent of this amendment was clear, but in today's world there may be need for an adjustment.  The problem of abuse is a big issue, and with thousands of illegal Mexican immigrants streaming into this country for the sole purpose of giving birth on US soil, something needs to be done. This is a different era than in 1776, when Muslim terror was not even dreamed of and Mexico was virtually non-existent. But today, with the Mexican government clearly backing illegal immigration to the United States, and with the President of Mexico meddling in US politics, changes need to be made. Children of illegal immigrants should be exempted from the protection afforded by this amandment. Children should bear the same citizenship of their parents, so the child of an illegal Mexican immigrant born in the US would legally be a Mexican citizen.  International criminals (including Muslim terrorists) should not be afforded the Constitutional protections of American citizens, but instead should fall under the jurisdiction of a military tribunal.  This is after all, OUR country, not theirs.

Because the Jewish have become a force in the world. The American natives prefer to live their lives as they are, quite aware that the material world isn't as important as people seem to believe. \n\nThe Jews used their influence and remorse over the Holocaust to cover their genocide of the Palestinians and to acquire the land that's now called Israel.\n\nAnd one of the previous answers here needs a factual correction. Saddam ordered the killing in cold blod of about 10 thousand Iraqi's in three rows. The Bush family (the Sr and the Jr) managed to kill more than 1.5 million and the count still goes on, where near 1 million were killed due to the embargo that preceeded the oil-for-food programme, embargo which they thought would help to ignire a revolution in Iraq to topple Saddam. Instead it lead to a humanitarian disaster, where a million people died due to the lack of food and medical supplies. UN reports counted about 500 thousand children that died due to direct effects of the embargo, reports which in turn led to the resignation of the chief of the UN aid envoy to Iraq.\nConsidering the counting still goes on, I believe the numbers speak for themselves. You can't say that 10 thousand bodies are genocide ... but the 1.5 million are indeed.

Facts indicates the issues of fact that have already been decided or are not disputed. For instance, if someone were pleading an insanity defense, the facts section would include the specifics of the crime, since they are not in dispute. The procedural history would include facts about what happened SINCE the crime, e.g. so and so was arrested and arraigned, blah blah, preliminary hearing, blah blah. Facts covers everything before arrest, while procedural history covers everything afterward.\n\nEdit: In a child custody case, the facts could detail things like dates of support payments, number of days spent with one parent or the other, reasons for the divorce and/or separation, any convictions one of the parent received, etc. The procedural history would include only the facts about what the court has already done in this matter. If this is a first pleading on an issue that has not been heard before, there would likely be no procedural history. It really only applies to appeals.
"This is a very big question, and is going to get a lot of press in this coming election year.\n\nI think I agree with President Bush that we need to have ""guest workers"" here in the States, because most American workers would prefer to sit on their butts and live on welfare rather than work picking crops or doing other menial labor that these ""guest workers"" would do.  If we had to pay a wage high enough to attract American workers for these jobs, then imagine how much a loaf of bread or a pound of potatoes would cost.\n\nI do not approve of foreigners entering this country illegally, or staying in this country illegally and becoming a drain on society while they're here.  If they do not register as guest workers, then they should be rounded up and sent back where they came from."

well, obviously its not good. I would contact the American embassy in japan immediately. If anyone can help, it would be them. The sooner the better, i was stationed in Okinawa and i can tell you, there prisons over there are not the country clubs we have here. i hope for the best for you and your son.

Congress's last serious attempt to reduce wasteful spending occurred in 1995 and 1996, when the 104th Congress terminated several programs whose irrelevance was proven by how quickly they were forgotten. But Congress then committed several strategic errors, such as overreaching and shutting down the federal government in 1995. After President Bill Clinton deftly exploited theses mistakes, budget cutters overreacted to Clinton's tactics by completely abandoning the mission of smaller government. Federal spending subsequently skyrocketed as a paralyzed Congress decided that budget confrontations with the Clinton White House could never be won and should be avoided at all costs.\n\nIn 2003, reducing wasteful spending is more important than ever. Defense, homeland security, and expensive entitlements are stretching the federal government thin while a high tax burden is weighing down the economy. Yet, although President Clinton is no longer in office and budget-cutting strategies have improved, Congress and (albeit to a lesser extent) President Bush still maintain a reflexive fear of attacking wasteful spending.\n\nIt is time to step back and think about the role of government, the obligations of the private sector, and the delineation between federal and state responsibilities.
who said it was over.. it's going to be a long time before this thing ends... just hope that we don't have another draft for this war.

I don't really know. We are doing all we can, but he fails to realize one thing...it is a war that can't be won! We are wasting all of our tax dollars on something that will never end! You can't beat terrorism. I think he is a good President, but he has a blind spot on the subject of terrorism.

Adrian Năstase (born June 22, 1950) is a Romanian politician who was the Prime Minister of Romania from December 2000 to December 2004.\n\nHe competed as the Social Democratic Party (PSD) candidate in the 2004 presidential election, but was defeated by center-right Justice and Truth (DA) Alliance candidate Traian Băsescu.\n\nHe was the President of the Chamber of Deputies from December 21, 2004 until 15 March 2006, when he resigned due to corruption charges.
I've often asked that myself...in America think of all the food that goes to waste here. Why Doesn't Pres Bush focus on this rather than killing people in Iraq. He says he is saving Iraq from a dictator well what about saving starving children in Africa...where is the outrage??

No because if you really cared about what was going on you would do something to change or support it and voting is a form of that. It's available to you, it's free, if you don't do it you're just lazy.
A myth.  A true democracy is where everyone votes on all issues all the time.  It is to easy for the majority to form a tyranny over the minority.  It has never existed and never will.\n\nOur founders were Representativesocracy because that would give the populace the opportunity to vote money for themselves instead of the National good.  That is why we are a Federal Republic, where we choose representives with divided and diffused powers.  Each branch has a clearly defined role and cannot violate that role.

Better question is how does someone who was not elected by the democracy he serves become president? I'd compare that to Iraq, but at least Hussein was elected (Even if it was by way of threats and force)
to satisfy their alter-ego?!
Well it's an interesting question. It's really a no win situation. Lets say that we pulled all of our troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan and brought them home. Then six months from that time we get another terrorist attack. I'm sure the finger pointing would start about why wasn't something done and the president dropped the ball etc. The honest truth is Americans sit back and play Monday morning quarterback and gripe about anything they can. We just love a scape goat to blame.

Sorry, you are both wrong, it was during the Pullman Strike in the 1800's. Because of working conditions, rail workers refused to work on trains with Pullman cars, so management put Pullman cars on trains that were carrying US Mail. This made the labor action a federal crime.
all that he is allowed to say by law is the dates you were employed for the company and would you be eligible for rehire.  Anything else and he is violating Federal Law.
The end of the civil war and the fact the the United States remained united. If the civil war had ended in the other way, then America would look more like Europe and would probably be at least 4 or 5 countries. Everything would have been different and America would have never been such a super power. It would have changed world history.
"That's not necessarly true.  They love LIBERAL Christians.  But hate all the Christians that speak out against Homosexuality and Abortion, two subjects the city prides itself on (In the name of Liberty and Personal Freedom).  San Francisco has been gay since the 1940's, but didn't come out of the closet until the early 1970's when Mayor Masconi and Harvey Milk invited the LGBTQ all there.  San Francisco is the most ultra-liberal city in California, that is because of the largely LGBTQ population, abortion rights advocates and Hippies and Emos of all ages.  Christianity is fundamentally stands against the philosophies they hold dear, which are ""Do what thou wilt, that is the whole of the law. Love is the law."" and ""Tune in, turn on and drop out"" AND ""Do your own thing, just as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else"", Christians believe in following God's law and believe if you are ""doing your own thing"" you are actually following your own evil impulses."
The most important is sovereign (ruling) power.\nThe second is population which submit to the sovereign power.\nThe third is identity which differentiate one from the others.\nThese are essentials for a state.\nIf the state has a territiory (land) it is a popular state and if there is no territory, the state may be existing in exile. \nThis aspect is recognized in the modern concepts of politics.

well there are many causes for what is happening in Afghan but the simple thing is Afghanistan is not in war because it was giving shelter to OSAMA BINLADEN or AL QAEDA it is because of the greedy american govrnment  who wanted to destroy the power of afghans which they themselves provided during war with russia .They say taliban and al qaeda are terrorist well the fact is america which forgets is the one who provided weapons to them and when their mission was completed ie russia broke into tiny peices they needed a reason to show the international community to destroy the emerging power of afghanistan and as said by many those ruling america those barbarian, greedy shameless people , murderers of 1000000's of afghans and muslims all over the world they started this and when there is a revenge they kill more .... saying look these terrorist are a threat ..Those are not terrorist they are hero's who fought for there country and liberated afghanistan and its people from those animals ie russia ..... thanks too all those participated in afghan war ..... Well If you think that taliban and al qaeda are still problem u should think again cause american government need war and murder to sell there weapons they even dont think about there own people what the hell they will help you people out . Look at the facts not the media controlled by Americans and JEWS which are true enimies of islam and muslims .....

The people deserve the government they have.  This is especialy true in this country because we, the people, elected this government we have.  \n\nIf you don't like what Congress is doing or not doing, tell your Representative and Senators about it.  It worked with the Dubai Ports World deal.  The people said they didn't want it, and Congress stopped it.  \n\nThis is still a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.  And if the people do not like their government, they have the power to change it.
They're hypocrites!!!!
I'm not sure what you are asking.  However, most military training sites have had (and do have) facilities to train troops to handle gas attacks by the enemy.
The terms of Iraq's surrender, in gulf war one, were not met, including but not limited to unobstructed united nations inspections. without any other authority required, the war could be continued. Everything else, legally speaking, is media noise, partisan politics, and what was needed to be said to get the right people to support the continuation of the war.

"Each state has their own laws in place for this sort of thing. but as far as your situation goes, it sounds like the court would hear a request for emancipation, especially if it is supported by you. You must remember though, emancipation not only frees the child from restrictions by the parents(or guardian in your case) but it frees the parents/guardians from burden of responsibility for the child. There is not a ""set"" age at which one can become emancipated, Judges will rule based on the circumstances presented to them if an emancipation is appropriate or not. However there is a bar minimum, that is to say, a judge is not going to emancipate a 9 year old. Just the same as a judge would not emancipate a 16 year old who wants to run off with her juvenile delinquent boyfriend to Tijuana. You sound like you may have a case, if you can provide the judge with some evidence that you can properly care for your daughter, as well as your daughters testimony that she prefers to reside with you, than I think you can make a go at an emancipation. My advice is to hire a good lawyer and see what he thinks. Hope this was helpful to you. Also I may add as well, it might be a good idea to go to the D.A. with your daughter and have her explain to him or his assistant what you mentioned above about Him touching her inappropriately. As well as file a police report. If he even touches her in what she deems to be a carnal way, then it is illegal. If the state decides they would like to pick up any charges on him, then your daughter would most likely be remanded to the custody of the parent deemed ""most fit"""
You should read up on police states. Your question and my answer tells me that we are not in a police state - yet. However, I think the country is moving that way. If the people in general take on the attitude that there is nothing that they can do, then it could come.
Germany did not invade Sweden because Sweden was Germany's largest supplier of Iron Ore, without which the German economy would have collapsed.\n\nThis was the reason in 1940, before the invasion of France, Germany invaded Norway days ahead of a British-French invasion fleet at Narvik. During the winter time, the northern Swedish ports in the Baltic would freeze closed. Because the Germans had initially seized all of the major air fields in Norway, the Allied forces found themselves isolated and had to evacuate.\n\nAs an added bonus, the Germans were then able to use the Norwegian fjords both to launch submarines against Allied convoys supplying Soviet Russia and to sneak their warships such as the Bismark around the British blockade.\n\nThe previous answer is thinking of Switzerland, which did act as both a bank and a supplier of precision parts to Germany.
Absolutly not.  The US Military is the most highly educated armed force in history.  Reading levels alone are 3 grades higher than the US Average.  Soldiers work in every field from the tactical, language, and culural knowledge of the infantry/Cavalry/Armor Soldier/Marine to the PHD knowledge level of satalite command and control.\n\nHighly educated sailors run the nuclear reactors on Navy ships.  Every officer must have a 4-year degree, and many have masters and PHDs.  My degree is industrial engineering and am now working on a masters.  For some areas, a masters is required for promotion.  The military is at the forfront of R&D across many fields from Nano-tech to Hybrid/alt-fuel engines to medicine.\n\nNow, if you mean the joke by us non-military intell guys concerning the acquisistion, analysis, and dicimination of information to us ground-pounders then you must realize that the Military Intelligence (MI) process is VERY difficult to do correctly even half the time.\n\nMI does everything it can but does fail at times.  They work very hard and are very dedicated, but they are trying to find a needle in a haystack that has more hay added every second.

As they exist today...we don't.  Unions were not meant to be and should not be permanent organizations.\n\nThe truth is that what labor unions were originally is very different from the large corporate unions of today.  When unions got started the scenario went something like this:\n\nA group of workers in a weaving factory are concerned about getting thier hair caught in the machines, which is in fact a distinct possibility.  They have mentioned this danger to thier supervisor, but nothing is done to make the workers safer.  \n\nOne day a twelve year old female worker does get her hair caught in the machines and is nearly scalped before the woman on the loom next to hers can get the machine to stop.  The supervisor orders the workers to keep working and sends for the doctor while the girl bleeds onto the floor.  The doctors do the best they can, but the girl dies.\n\nThe workers beg thier supervisor to see that changes are made, but nothing happens. The workers get together and decide to strike until the factory owner makes the machines safer thus forming a union. The strike causes production to significantly drop and the factory owner decides to fix the machines in order to save his business.  Once the machines are in working order, the women go to work and the union disbands. \n\nToday, unions are permanent, powerful, politically active, big money organizations who often act contrary to workers interests.  This is the problem.

"If by legalized you mean de-criminalized and regulated by an administrative body, then I would say yes.\n\nDrugs are not a moral issue, but rather a health and safety issue, which is where we're confused in America.  It seems we'd be far better off if the $$$ from the ""drug war"" was redirected into rehabilitation and education.  Currently illegal drugs could be taxed and regulated, which would produce revenue, as well as be more efficiently researched, along with the potential benefits of other derivative chemicals and drugs.\n\nBesides, the ""war on drugs"" is as much a retarded child of propaganda as the ""war on terrorism.""  These aren't nations or even ideals, but a pervasive problem that must be treated at the source, not fought."

Our reaction to color is almost instantaneous and has a profound impact on the choices we make everyday. Below is a quick look at general responses to colors based on research, historical significance of color and word association studies. Different cultures react to colors differently and this brief overview focuses on the responses of people in the Western Hemisphere. \n\nRed has more personal associations than any other color. Recognized as a stimulant red is inherently exciting and the amount of red is directly related to the level of energy perceived. Red draws attention and a keen use of red as an accent can immediately focus attention on a particular element. \n\nOrange, a close relative of red, sparks more controversy than any other hue. There is usually strong positive or negative association to orange and true orange generally elicits a stronger “love it” or “hate it” response than other colors. Fun and flamboyant orange radiates warmth and energy. Interestingly, some of the tones of orange such as terra cotta, peach or rust have very broad appeal. \n\nYellow shines with optimism, enlightenment, and happiness. Shades of golden yellow carry the promise of a positive future. Yellow will advance from surrounding colors and instill optimism and energy as well as spark creative thoughts. \n\nGreen occupies more space in the spectrum visible to the human eye and is second only to blue as a favorite color. Green is the pervasive color in the natural world that is an ideal backdrop in interior design because we are so used to seeing it everywhere. The natural greens, from forest to lime, are seen as tranquil and refreshing, with a natural balance of cool and warm (blue and yellow) undertones. Green is considered the color of peace and ecology. However, there is an “institutional” side to green, associated with illness or Government-issued that conjure up negative emotions as do the “slimy” or bilious greens. \n\nBlue is the overwhelming “favorite color.” Blue is seen as trustworthy, dependable and committed. The color of sky and the ocean, blue is perceived as a constant in our lives. As the collective color of the spirit, it invokes rest and can cause the body to produce chemicals that are calming; however not all blues are serene and sedate. Electric or brilliant blues become dynamic and dramatic, an engaging color that expresses exhilaration. Some shades or the overuse of blue may come across as cold or uncaring. Blue is the least “gender specific” color, having equal appeal to both men and women. \n\nPurple embodies the balance of red simulation and blue calm. This dichotomy can cause unrest or uneasiness unless the undertone is clearly defined at which point the purple takes on the characteristics of its undertone. A sense of mystic and royal qualities, purple is a color often well liked by very creative or eccentric types and is the favorite color of adolescent girls. \n\nBrown says stability, reliability, and approachability. It is the color of our earth and is associated with all things natural or organic. \n\nGray is timeless, practical, and solid. A longstanding favorite suit color, gray can mix well with any color. Although well like and often worn, people rarely name gray as a favorite color possibly because Gray also is associated with loss or depression. \n\nBlack is authoritative and powerful; because black can evoke strong emotions too much can be overwhelming. A classic color for clothing possibly because it makes the wearer appear thinner and more sophisticated. \n\nWhite projects purity, cleanliness, and neutrality. Doctors don white coats, brides traditionally were white gowns and a white picket fence surrounds a safe and happy home.

The best I could find was a reference to Dennis Rader, the BTK killer, who served in Okinawa with the United States Air Force, and who is suspected of potential involvement in some unsolved murders there between 1966 and 1970.  Those crimes, however, did not fit Rader's traditional technique, so it is doubtful that he was involved.  Did you mean the United States Air Force or some other air force?  Do you have any other details you can provide?  The question is just too ambiguous for much more detail.
How do you know it's expired? There may very well be more than one charge pending against you and not all of them may have the same statute of limitations. The law may have changed. I would see an attorney, under the attorney client privilege they cannot turn you in or they may stand to  lose their license to practice law.
Actually, Japanese citizens and citizens of Brunei and Singapore do not need visas to go to many countries in Europe and North America.\n\nThe reason is simple.  Due to disparate standards of living, without immigration controls, such as visas, large numbers of the population of developing countries would crowd into the countries requiring visas, resulting in high unemployment and an upswing in social problems.  this has been demonstrated in very many cases over the last 100 years.  There was even a time when immigrants from Europe to the US returned to Europe because there were too many of them and they couldn't make a living (Italian to US immigration backflow of the early 20th century).\n\nBy imposing a visa regime, the country requiring the visa gets to look at applicants for a visa to determine if they intend to try to become economic refugees (so to speak).  Yes, it is true that many people aren't interested in illegally immigrating, but many are.  When you have almost 10,000,000 people in the country illegally already, it is a strain on the infrastructure in some places.\n\nThe countries with visa regimes generally have ways to obtain an immigrant visa to go into their country legally.  this is to limit the number of people to a manageable group.\n\nOn the other hand, there aren't a lot of people who are looking to immigrate from the United States or Britain to the Philippines to improve their lives and economic condition.  It is as simple as that.  Once you can demonstrate good ties to your home country (better than average job, property; in other words, the things that make you a credible tourist) you will find it easy to get a visa.  \n\nIf you are upset because it is hard to get a visa to go and stay with your cousin in LA fora month and the air ticket price represents two months wages, it is hard to justify yourself as a bonifide tourist (just an example, I don't know your details).
"Oh, please. Knock off your woe is me, ""America is bad"" sh*t. It gets real old."
The US conquers the world through trade, not by militarily taking countries. That's their dirty little secret, and also why they can fool their people by telling them it's the freest country in the world. Free as long as you buy American products and obey their capitalist system. Notice how the American armed forces don't hesitate to attack any country supporting communism/socialism. Hell, as early as 1853, America sent it's Navy to Japan to bully them into trading with us? If that doesn't say something, I don't know what does!\n\nMy biggest fear is not Iran, but what other countries like Russia and China will do. All they have to do is ship the right missiles to Iran, and the US Army will suffer tremendous damage.

America and then some  migrated to what is now known as the southeastern part of the USA. We were treated bad by the Europeans who took over our lands. That was history, Chris, today is today. We got over it. Life goes on. It is a different place.\n\n We now have laws that all people must abide by. That includes the citizens of the USA, the Native Americans on the reservations and immigrants who come here legally. ILLEGAL immigrants are lawbreakers from the git-go. They should be arrested and deported and not allowed back in our country unless they do it the legal way and then they should be made to wait for a few years for punishment.\n\nIn that time they should be working to improve their life in their own homeland instead of trying to grab the way of life the American citizens worked and died for. They should work with their own leaders, voice their dissent, complain about their social services, demand better living conditions. By staying there, and working for a better way of life they will enjoy the fruits of their labor, if not their own generations, they will improve it for their future generations, like our forefathers did. Then they can be proud to be citizens of the beautiful country of Mexico.\n\nP.S.- Chris,  Yes some people ARE entitled to live and work in the USA, the United States Citizens!! We have ALL rights and entitlement. Illegal immigrants have ""NO rights NO entitlement""  whatsoever."

"Winston Churchill\n\nEdit:\nActually I stand corrected (see 2nd link)\n\n""If you're not a liberal when you're 25, you have no heart.  If you're not a conservative by the time you're 35, you have no brain."" There is no record of anyone hearing Churchill say this. Paul Addison of Edinburgh University makes this comment: ""Surely Churchill can't have used the words attributed to him. He'd been a Conservative at 15 and a Liberal at 35!  And would he have talked so disrespectfully of Clemmie, who is generally thought to have been a lifelong Liberal?"""
"The Chinese Civil War (Traditional Chinese: 國共内戰; Simplified Chinese: 国共内战; Hanyu Pinyin: guógòng neìzhàn; literally ""Nationalist-Communist Civil War"") was a conflict in China between the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party; KMT) and the Communist Party of China (CCP). It began in 1927 after the Northern Expedition when the right-wing faction of the KMT, led by Chiang Kai-shek, purged the Communists from a KMT-CCP alliance. It ended in 1950 with an unofficial cessation of major hostilities, with the Communists controlling mainland China (including Hainan Island) and the Nationalists restricted to their remaining territories of Taiwan, Penghu, and several outlying Fujianese islands."
"It depends upon a lot of factors.  In a totalitarian state where elections have only one candidate, it would make very little diffence in the gov't, although you might get noticed and persecuted for not voting, as was the case in the former Soviet Union.\n\nIn very large nations, like the US, if even half the people, or even fewer, vote, it is still a large enough sample of citizens to ensure that the will of the people is heard.  Think of sampling in polling research to understand this.  If a sample is carefully randomized and stratified a very small number of ""votes"" will tell you what the majority of the people want, or are thinking.\n\nBut in a true democracy, if all, or a very large percent, of the people don't vote, then it becomes quite easy for the gov't to become totalitarian and change the nature of the entire society from democracy to some form of autocracy.  It has been said by some very wise person that, in a democracy, the people always get the gov't they deserve.  If they don't take advantage of the freedoms of a democracy, like voting, they will lose that right and most of their other rights; and that's what a non-voting society deserves."
Tennessee, like most states, does not recognize common law marriage.
I was stationed in Berlin Germany right during the fall of the Berlin Wall and East Germany was coming out from under Communist control. There was a story of little children in an art class after communism fell and were told they could draw anything they wanted and none of them drew anything. When asked they explained that they had always been told what to draw. Also another interesting thought is that state approved car in East Germany was made of a wood frame with a plastic exterior body and a 2-cycle engine (the size that is used on your push mower).

The latest leadership trend is all about power hungry.  We see most of the countries, the politicians are busy fighting for a leadership.  what they are interested in, is only MONEY and nothing else!What they are forgetting is that people who are always busy voting for them, have nothing in their homes to eat.  Please dont be power-hungry? Pple are starving.
I truly don't see why we should have to choose.  Many of the homeland security issues are a direct outflow of isolationist and/or imperialistic foreign policies which have caused nations to become envious and to fear and loathe us.  That is from where insecurity and terrorism emerges.  Quite frankly, if our federal government would make better choices, and not perpetually make America-centric policies to the detriment of the less-developed peoples of the world, we could go back to feeling far more secure without the constant infringements of our Constitutionally-derived and Constitutionally-protected privacy by the same government.
"Probably that they will cut oil production.\nNot much they can do otherwise.\nOf course they can continue with what they are doing already.. plotting attacks against our people.\nBut, since they are doing that already (or sponsoring it), the only ""pain"" they can cause is to slow oil production.  \n\nWe are not direct buyers of their crude, but the EU is, thus, we would be effected."
I was at my doctors for an appointment sitting in the waiting room and they had the TV on when they broke in with what was happening. I was numb along with everyone else that was there. \n\nI just sat there and watched, couldn't believe what was happening, watched both towers fall on live TV, along with news about the Pentagon and Flight 93 in Pa. Overwhelmed with emotion, I felt grief, astonishment and even anger (I don't get mad very often) I was crying along with many others that were there. \n\nThe whole office just stopped what it was doing and watched for the longest time. I finally seen my doctor and went straight home and just sat there the rest of the day and watched the TV. I cried and thought of all those people that had been murdered for no reason by a few evil minded people.\n\nI'll never forget where I was and what I was doing that morning and I'll never forget all of them, I'll remember them always, my heart goes out to all those that lost someone that morning.\n\nGod bless them all.

I hold the local governments more responsible not just for their lack of preperation but because the federal help couldn't be deployed except at the request of the local authorities, and they did not request help until well later than they should have.

Legal immigrants are people who enter the country lawfully by obtaining a visa (immigrant and non-immigrant) from the American Embassy.\nThey usually go through background checks, criminal checks and have to provide medical records to be allowed to get the visa. They also have to wait for their priority date (each country has different priority dates). \nOnce they enter the U.S. they go to a Custom and Border Protection Offficer/Agent to be inspected before they are allowed into the U.S.\n\nIllegal Aliens bypass these checks by entering the country without inspection and any kind of checks.  Usually by crossing the border through Mexico or Canada.

I can give you the general process. A U.S citizen can file an immigrant visa I-130 for his/her spouse, fiancee, children, son, daughter married and unmarried, parents, siblings. The I-130 petition is usually filed with the local BCIS (formerly INS) office. After approval this petition is forwarded to National Visa Center in New Hempshire. NVC completes certain requirements like Affidavit of support from the petitioner.  After that the file is forwarded to the overseas U.S embassy or consulate having jusrisdiction over the place of beneficiary's place of residence.  The Embassy then calls in the beneficiary for an interview and reviews all the local documentation as well. If every thing is in order an immigrant visa is issued.\n\nA green card holder can also file an immigrant visa petititon but only for spouse, children, unmarried sons and daughter.\n\nNow there are two basic categories one is called Immediate relative category and other one is preference category.  Immediate relative categories are not governed by any quota and all the applicants filing are processed e.g. spouse, children under 21 and parents of U.S citizen. All other categories are governed by a quota set by the federal government for each country per year. For example when a green card holder files a petition for the spouse the waiting period in this category is approximately 4 years.\n\nTo obtain further information on cutoff priority dates for preference categories check the following link:\n\nhttp://travel.state.gov/visa/frvi/bulletin/bulletin_1770.html

"Well, you have to accept that you may have to spend a lot of time a part. My father was in the Navy and was gone 6 months at a time, and this was at a time of peace. We are living in a time of war so you're partner may be gone for a much longer time and face much greater risks.\n\nYour family may have to relocate as your partner is assigned to new duty stations. For some, this is exciting, but for others, it's dreaded. I loved moving as a child, but as an adult in the Air Force, I had difficulty with the thought of moving my own children around, so I separated. \n\nThere are benefits for military families including housing, medical and dental, VA home loans, education benefits, and discounts at local merchants. As a military spouse you may qualify for 50% tuition assistance should you choose to go to school. Military families can take ""hops"" on military carriers for a fraction of the cost of a regular airline.\n\nMilitary relationships are challenging, but they can be great. It depends on if you're up for it."

You can apply for a green card as soon as you're legally married to a US citizen.  It can take anywhere from a couple months to a couple years to get approved depending on your location and the circumstances.\n\nOnce you get your green card you're a conditional permanent resident but not a US citizen.  You have to apply two years later for non-conditional permanent residency.  At any point during this process you can be revoked if you're no longer married.  You generally are not subject to revocation if you are the victim of spousal abuse.\n\nUS citizenship is separate and you can generally apply after seven years of legal residency.

Actually, France was not in good shape in 1940, regardless of what conservative revisionism would have you believe. France never really recovered from the Great Depression because the conservatives never allowed any sort of monetary reform but instead stayed with the gold standard which allowed no fiscal flexibility. France had further ruined herself with the construction of the Maginot Line which was cripplingly expensive. During the time when Germany was still making reparations, the French government seemed more interested in punishing Germany than in rebuilding France, so many of the products demanded were expensive yet only moderately useful. When the liberal government came to power, entrenched business interests further weakened the economy rather than see Socialists have any good news. Then, when Germany invaded Poland, Marshall Gaimlan (I'm sure the spelling is way wrong) felt that it was better to have Germany bordering Russia than to have a free Poland, so he did not allow French armies to advance even to the Rhine and then quickly retreated. As to the advice received that the invasion would be through Holland, Britain sent two of its best agents to investigate but it turned out to be a plant and the agents were captured and spent the entire war in captivity. In the interwar years, all of France's eastern European allies had signed separate non-agression pacts with Germany, while England and the conservatives in France would not allow any sort of meaningful negotiations with Soviet Russia (not necessarily a bad idea since Stalin was so untrustworthy and had made a total mess of Spain). When the invasion finally did occur, the French nation was economically exhausted, politically isolated, and militarily led by officers who thought only of their own political careers, who would rather see Hitler victorious than see Daladier have another term as Premier.

In response to some of the enlighting liberal answers above;\n1.  Liberals are cowards.  Did liberals support our military in Veitnam?  NO!  In Korea?  NO!  Did they support Regan during the cold war?  NO!  Did liberals want to get involved with the Gulf War?  NO!  Did Liberal Bill Clinton find out who attacked the WTC in 1993?  NO!  Did the Clinton adminisration cut and run from Mogadishu?  YES!!  Did the clinton adminisration do anything about the USS Cole being attacked and killing 17 troops?  NO!  Um libs - there seems to be a pattern developing and all of mainstream america can see it.\n2.  Libs have you ever heard of John Kerry (you know he fought in nam), I believe that idiot threw his war metals over the fence of the white house and then lied to congress about war crimes our troops never committed for political gain.  If that's not mocking and disrespecting our troops, then I don't know what is. Didn't liberals keep a running count of troop deaths in the begining of the Iraq invasion?  I recall they couldn't wait to get to the magic number of 1500 dead troops.  I am sure they thought that would cause the adminisrtation to retreat.  How many innocent babies are murdered because people don't use protection?  Anybody keeping a running count?  How many americans die on the roadways everyday?  Anybody keeping a running count?  How about cancer and dieseases?  Any count on those deaths?\n3.  Retreat, defeat, pandering, appeasing, and self blame are the tenets that liberals live by.  Liberals have set themselves up to look good when something terrible happens to america.  It's a sad thing to be a liberal these days.
That seems fairly common these days.
War and the deaths of over 100,000 people in 6 years. New Orleans and the African American population being ignored and another 6000 lives lost. Budget cuts to the elderly towards medications. No Child Left Behind Act favors the rich school districts over the poor that need the help the most. Illegal immigrants in America taking jobs from Americans. Outsourcing jobs to Communist China over American workers. Selling the ports to OPEC the oil moguls over Americans. Fuel and utility costs have tripled while the oil company's report record profits. George Bush hates Northern people and says we are Yankees. Conservative Christians that like to kill people in Iraq. Republicans that abuse the rest of the world that are not Republicans. He's just a down right prick!

"""they say that white people are racist and just like other whites""\n\nYou just answered your own question. Your family who made this statement is racist against white people. Most racism seems to begin at home, what parents teach their kids. If people at school don't discrimniate then they haven't been taught to hate.\n\nIf you don't learn to hate a race blindly then chances are you'll never be a racist. Better to hate the person who wrongs you then their whole background."

Yes.  If you get caught later on, you'll get fired, and then you'll have to explain an even larger gap in your employment history.  If you're going to make it on the outside, you have to put the felony behind an uninterrupted work-history, so you can't afford to get fired.  Get a short term job, if necessary, and then find a better one.  Be reliable especially at short-term jobs, though, because you really don't want to lose that reference.  Good luck.
probably lol.
Probably yes
Well, you have the right to fire your lawyer and retain any other counsel you wish.\n\nBut I'd bet that the retainer agreement you signed with your lawyer states that he is entitled to a percentage of your recovery even if you fire him.  That means that, while you're entitled to a different lawyer, you'll probably end up paying attorneys twice before taking your share.\n\nIt sounds to me as though your lawyer's opinions about the case are accurate and his actions are reasonable although I can't be sure.  Turning over your medical records is something you'll have to do in a lawsuit.  The amount you sue for is usually just a made up number with no relationship to anything.  (In my state, you don't even put an amount in the complaint anymore.)\n\nIt sounds like your real problem is one of communication.  You should have a good relationship with your lawyer and should be able to speak with him at length until you understand his advice.  If you don't trust your lawyer, something's wrong.  My advice is to call your lawyer and say just that:  I don't understand what you're doing and I don't trust you.  Ask him to sit with you and explain everything that is happening.  Then have a consultation with another personal injury lawyer to see if what you were told makes sense.\n\nIf your lawyer communicates with you appropriately, I'm sure you'll feel a lot better and the entire process will end up being much easier for you.
You either have to believe it yourself or get comfortable enough to lie without a change in pulse. A lot of it is confidence that you will beat it. If you are anxious, the needles WILL move.
No, of course not! For those of us who are American citizens, this is our inheritance. We have been born into an astonishing country, with astonishing values. And it is our job, as citizens, to help keep alive in whatever small way we can, because, like any inheritance, it can be squandered. And the only thing that will keep it intact is if we, who have been lucky enough to inherit it, try to keep faith with those who bequeathed it to us, and do our best to preserve and enhance it for those who come after us. I love America.

How is a jury supposed to convict an alleged rapist with no evidence, the evidence doesn't lie, but people do. It really doesn't matter what state your in, a person is judged by a jury of random people who listen to the testimonies of both sides. now, 4 YEARS later, this girl wants to come forward? the question is, does she have a witness? any evidence what so ever? ANY proof that this person allegedly raped her FOUR YEARS ago??? come on, who's going to believe her.

There is no such thing.  Once you experience war for yourself, you'll see that there is nothing civil about war at all.  It's not supposed to be about civility, but survival.

"Four problems.\n\nThe first is that the military includes a massive amount of psychological conditioning, and can be very demoralizing. It's  basically government-sponsored indoctrination, and (if compelled) that's a potential constitutional problem because it requires people to accept/support a government-sponsored/approved message. There's also the freedom of association problem, in addition to the free speech problem.\n\nSecond, not everyone is physically capable of meeting requirements for enlistment. That means either dual standards, which is always a bad idea, or you end up with kids having a way out by choosing to be unhealthy. Worse idea.\n\nThird, the military currently discriminates based on sexual orientation. So again, you're either going to have a dual standard, or people will be in violation of the law based on their sexual preferences. ""Don't Ask Don't Tell"" is/was a huge disaster when the military was volunteer. It gets much worse when service is mandatory.\n\nFinally, many people and many religions do not support the use of force to solve problems. The military mindset is might-makes-right. That's why conscientious objector status exists. Mandatory service would brand everyone who didn't serve as an outside, in many cases based on their religious beliefs. That is again government-sponsored viewpoint-based religious discrimination, and that's also against the constitution."
"The word stranger is equivalent to enemy in many people's languages. The Jew's have been a people who never melted into most nations that they lived. A large part of this was the religious fanaticism which held sway in Europe during the dark ages and still holds sway in the middle east today. \n\nAs such Jews in many nations were considered sub-citizens. They were often unable to own property. Often had little legal recourse in the nations they lived. Whenever a religious witch hunt started up the Jews would be one of the first rounded up since they openly practiced a minority religion. Likewise marrying a Jew and for Jewish culture to marry outsiders was taboo. As such few Jews and non-Jews married to soften the boundaries between Jewish and non-Jewish culture. Only in the last 50 years in North American and European nations has this begun to finally happen. Jewish neighborhoods in America are fast disappearing. \n\nMoney lending was considered a lowly trade in the ancient world. It required owning no property and at times has even been banned. A perfect trade for a people unable to better themselves by any other means. So Jews found themselves doing the things others in European and Islamic nations did not want to do. Jews were also frequent targets of crime and discrimination. So for a Jew to survive they had to be carefull with each penny as who knew when the next time somebody would come to take everything away from them would be. \n\nMoney lenders are not popular people. True people like to borrow money but who ever actually wants to pay it back. That a person needs to borrow money is a sign of financial distress in the first place. Collecting debts from the unwilling will make a person even more unpopular. What has further hurt the Jews is exactly what allowed them to survive in the first place. The penny pinching and expecting the worst to happen means that when economies collapsed in a nation the Jews tended to survive such catastrophes in stride. After all daily life often held the risk of a catastrophe anyway. Jews by taking up essential tasks assured that when all else failed they would have a living. The worse economics became around them the better off they appeared to be doing compared to non-Jewish countrymen. Germany during the pre-world war two days is one of many examples. \n\nSo these strangers who refused to convert to the faith pre-dominant in the nation, who did not intermarry, who did the work deemed unfit for most others were easy targets for prejudice and discrimination. Jews are just one example, most other ethnic groups who tried to exist like the Jews were either eventually assimilated or destroyed. The Gypsies are another example of such an ethnic group which survived and also suffered a great deal of discrimination and prejudice. Gypsies were yanked into Nazi concentration camps almost as fast as the Jews. Gypsy like Jew were murdered by Stalin's death machine. Before the 1900s Gypsy and Jew suffered similar fates at the hands of Inquisitions, witch hunts and other various murder fests. So it is not hate directed at Jews. It is hate directed at people who do not fit. \n\nWith this history Israel was founded. Mostly by survivors of World War II Europe but quite a few Jews from around the world came to Israel during this time. Islamic nations still carry the convert by the sword and death to the infidel attitude. Had it been Quakers who took over land owned by Muslims they'd gotten the same reaction. The hatred is not of Jews but one of somebody other than a Muslim owning what Muslim's consider Muslim lands. What aggravates this even more is that so many holy sites to the Muslim faith exist in a land controlled by another faith. The same kind of sentiment which helped populate the Crusader armies. The Crusades themselves were mostly an attempt to end in-fighting between European nations. Recovering the ""Holy lands"" was what inspired so many Europeans to take up the ban"

Sure do.  I also think they should be required to have regular physicals and STD tests in order to be licensed.  Then they should have their license suspended or revoked and get thrown in jail for not using condoms.  If a prostitute has (business) sex after being diagnosed with an STD, s/he should be prosecuted either for assault or attempted homicide (depending on the disease).  It would be much better regulated if it were legal.

To be found guilty of attempted murder, the prosecution has to prove that you intended to kill someone, so its irrelavent as to whether or not you actually hit someone with your bullet or not.  You could miss and still be found guilty.\n\nOf course, the circumstances make all the difference.  In Florida, if you are in fear of your life and sufficient proof of that exists, you can shoot anyone - leathally or not.  Its prefectly legal and no charges, not even an arrest, will follow.\n\nThen again, in North Carolina, you can shoot a burglar in the butt if he is trying to get away.  In Florida, I don't think that's alowed.  The idea is that if his back is to you, then you can't be in fear of your life.

That's hard to predict.  America's economic strength, and the military strength that is a byproduct of it, come from having a established institutions - government, economic, and social - that allow people to pursue interests, and succeed or fail, then allow them to try again.  Most other countries in the world do not have the same depth of institutional strength in all these areas as the US, but as they develop them, China and India in the long term have the best chance of overtaking the US, though that may take at least 100 years.  Europe, should it ever truly develop into  something closer to the US in structure, and reform its institutions, could overtake the US more quickly if it made the effort, but the nations of western Europe would need to find more common ground with each other for that to happen, and the common ground is not going to be defined in Brussels.

"Pulled this outta your link and I think you should read it!!!!\n\nA retired border patrol agent shows some common sense. \n\nThis letter sent to Tennessee Senator Bill Frist from a retired border patrol agent, and it has more common sense than all the bull being spewed from the Senate, with the exception of a few sensible representatives. \n\nDear Senator Frist: \n\nThere is a huge amount of propaganda and myths circulating about illegal aliens, particularly illegal Mexican, Salvadorian, Guatemalan and Honduran \naliens. \n#1. Illegal aliens generally do NOT want U.S. citizenship. Americans are very vain thinking that everybody in the world wants to be a U.S. citizen. Mexicans, and other nationalities want to remain citizens of their home \ncountries while obtaining the benefits offered by the United States such as employment, medical care, in-state tuition, government subsidized housing and free education for their offspring. Their main attraction is employment \nand their loyalty usually remains at home. They want benefits earned and subsidized by middle class Americans. What illegal aliens want are benefits of American residence without paying the price. \n\n#2. There are no jobs that Americans won't do. Illegal aliens are doing jobs that Americans can't take and still support their families. Illegal aliens take low wage jobs, live dozens in a single residence home, share expenses \nand send money to their home country. There are no jobs that Americans won't do for a decent wage. \n\n#3. Every person who illegally entered this nation left a home. They are NOT homeless and they are NOT Americans. Some left jobs in their home countries. They come to send money to their real home as evidenced by the more than 20 \nbillion dollars sent out of the country each year by illegal aliens. These illegal aliens knowingly and willfully entered this nation in violation of the law and therefore assumed the risk of detection and deportation. Those who brought their alien children assumed the responsibility and risk on behalf of their children. \n\n#4. Illegal aliens are NOT critical to the economy. Illegal aliens constitute less than 5% of the workforce. However, they reduce wages and benefits for lawful U.S. residents. \n\n#5. This is NOT an immigrant nation. There are 280 million native born Americans. While it is true that this nation was settled and founded by immigrants (legal immigrants), it is also true that there is not a nation on this planet that was not settled by immigrants at one time or another. \n\n#6. The United States is welcome to legal immigrants. Illegal aliens are not immigrants by definition. The U.S. accepts more lawful immigrants every year than the rest of the world combined. \n\n#7. There is no such thing as the ""Hispanic vote"". Hispanics are white, brown, black and every shade in between. Hispanics are Republicans, Democrats, Anarchists, Communists, Marxists and Independents. The so-called ""Hispanic vote"" is a myth. Pandering to illegal aliens to get the Hispanic vote is a dead end. \n\n#8. Mexico is NOT a friend of the United States. Since 1848 Mexicans have resented the United States. During World War I Mexico allowed German Spies to operate freely in Mexico to spy on the U.S. During World War II. Mexico allowed the Axis powers to spy on the U.S. from Mexico. During the Cold War Mexico allowed spies hostile to the U.S. to operate freely. The attack on the Twin Towers in 2001 was cheered and applauded all across Mexico. Today Mexican school children are taught that the U.S. stole California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. If you don't believe it, check out some Mexican textbooks written for their schoolchildren. \n\n#9. Although some illegal aliens enter this country for a better life, there are 6 billion people on this planet. At least 1 billion of those live on less than one dollar a day. If wanting a better life is a valid excuse to \nbreak the law and sneak into America, t"

"There is only one reason, on the Statue of Liberty, in the New York Harbor is inscribed "" Give me your poor and huddled masses, and I will give them rest.""

"If someone has several charges or cases pending against them, rather than hearing each case individually, the court can ""consolidate"" the charges/cases by hearing and rendering a verdict on more than one case at the same time."
"Eminent domain (US), compulsory purchase (United Kingdom, New Zealand), compulsory acquisition (Australia) or expropriation (Canada, South Africa) in common law legal systems is the lawful power of the state to expropriate private property without the owner's consent, either for its own use or on behalf of a third party. The term eminent domain is used primarily in the United States, where the term was derived in the mid-19th century from a legal treatise written by the Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius in 1625. The term compulsory purchase, also originating in the mid-19th Century, is used primarily in England and Wales, and other jurisdictions that follow the principles of English law. Originally, the power of eminent domain was assumed to arise from natural law as an inherent power of the sovereign.\n\nGovernments most commonly use the power of eminent domain when the acquisition of real property is necessary for the completion of a public project such as a road, and the owner of the required property is unwilling to negotiate a price for its sale. In many jurisdictions the power of eminent domain is tempered with a right that just compensation be made for the appropriation.\n\nSome coined the term expropriation to refer to ""appropriation"" under eminent domain law, and may especially be used with regard to cases where no compensation is made for the confiscated property. Examples include the 1960 Cuban expropriation of property held by U.S. citizens, following a breakdown in economic and diplomatic relations between the Eisenhower Administration and the Cuban government under Fidel Castro. U.S. nationals and corporations held vast amounts of Cuba's prime real-estate. Cuban authorities offered just compensation for US properties, as they had successfully done for Spanish, British and French properties when they nationalized private property in Cuba, for the common good. However, U.S. authorities refused, adhering to the notion that those properties are still privately owned by U.S. interests forty five years later. This is in direct contrast with recent rulings by the US Supreme Court which allows a corporation to displace a private citizen from his/her realty, if the corporate development is considered to be in the best interest of the municipality.\n\nThe term ""condemnation"" is used to describe the act of a government exercising its authority of eminent domain. It is not to be confused with the term of the same name that describes the legal process whereby real property, generally a building, is deemed legally unfit for habitation due to its physical defects. Condemnation via eminent domain indicates the government is taking the property; usually, the only thing that remains to be decided is the amount of just compensation. Condemnation of buildings on grounds of health and safety hazards or gross zoning violation usually does not deprive the owner of the property condemned but requires the owner to rectify the offending situation.\n\nThe exercise of eminent domain is not limited merely to real property. Governments may also condemn the value in a contract such as a franchise agreement (which is why many franchise agreements will stipulate that in condemnation proceedings, the franchise itself has no value)."
If you're going to feel guilty, put that feeling into action. This is anecdotal evidence, but I have seen what a terrible effect Wal-Mart has had on the small Texas town where I grew up in the 70s. Most of the family-owned retail shops have closed; downtown is in ruins - there's no good excuse for kids to hang out there the way they used to. Money that used to be reinvested in the community gets paid to a corporate conglomerate with draconian labor practices and wages that are so low that the U.S. taxpayer has subsidizes Wal-Mart employees who don't get benefits packages.\n\nThe place is sterile, the employees cultish. There's no specialized knowledge built up in individual departments. When there was a record shop on Hiram Street, the man who ran it and the kids who worked for him knew about music. The tire store salesman knew about tires. No one at Wal-Mart has that kind of institutional expertise. They're all about being low-priced and friendly, but they're completely removed from the products that they sell. And it's all sanitized, scripted, and carefully censored so that nobody gets his/her sensibilities challenged. \n\nWorst of all, I think Wal-Mart has played a pivotal role in making people believe that they need things they don't need, and want things they don't have any use for. The whole store is a tease, a come-on without a pay-off. (In this respect, Wal-Mart is no different from other players in modern consumer culture; except that Wal-Mart has found a way to destabilize and manipulate people who really don't have very much into wanting more and having even less. It's like a casino in that respect.)\n\nWhere are all the Wal-Schools and Wal-Computers and Wal-Vaccination programs? The Wal-Institute for Public Health? It may be my ignorance in play here, but the Walton family has been fabulously wealthy for a very long time, but they don't seem to have developed a public conscience. They hide behind the good-old-boy image of their late founder. But it's time they started giving back. They've helped destroy a landscape in my hometown that's irreplaceable.

For that to be true he would have to have absolute power.  And anyone who thinks he did have absolute power, needs to brush up on their American government.\n\nActually, that is incorrect.  A) Republicans do not control the Supreme Court, though they do like to take more than their fair share of power, not matter whose appointees are on the bench.  B) Rep. can hardly be called a cohesive unit - just as the democrats cannot.  These are individual people, though they share many beliefs, they are not all 100% for touting the party line (which would have to be true for them to have absolute power).  An example of this woul be the recent immigration debate, where several Republicans did not join their party majority, but sided with the Dems.  I must assume that when you said that is as close as they can come to absolute power, you meant is our form of government.  Otherwise, you would be dead wrong.

Just takes a little time to get on to the system.  Also if you are reading the law books keep a law reference dictionary handy.\n\nIf you need to know this info because you are in some sort of trouble, contact an attorney asap.
"If you make money with those images, or use those images in conjunction with your business, you must get permission from them.  Otherwise, yes they can force you to pay.  And, by the way, you don't get to say how much money those images helped you make and therefore how much you should pay Disney.   They get to say how much those images are worth, get money from you for their worth, and can also get you to pay punitive damages - in other words, extra money just to punish you for doing wrong.  This applies even if you ""bought"" an image (say, a line art drawing on a clipart CD); read the copyright information on all software, pattern books, etc. before using images."
This is a tough question under any circumstances let alone the one your family is going through. \n\nFirst check with the providence you are in and ask the magistrates exactly what your MOTHER is entitled to, since you are over the age of 18 and not legally a deed holder in the real estate, it will have to be your mother who does the asking and who would legally gain anything from the divorce. \n\nAlso check into whether Australia has any alimony laws, [law libararys are alwasy a big help online] and since your father makes more then your mother, if they do have alimony then she would be entitled to a percentiage/payment on a monthly basis from your fathers wages providing she doesn't remarry. \n\nIt gets really tricky here because it really depends on the laws of the country as well as the indiviual laws of each state/providence so collectively all will determine IF and HOW much your mother will get or is entitled to. \n\nSo whatever you do, SEEK AN ATTORNEY IMMEDIATELY. \n\nDivorce is NEVER the time to try to skimp on fees or to try to represent yourself or your family....an attorney is not only knowledgable in the laws of each state/providence and country but they also have access to hidden or obscure laws and loopholes which will gain you or entitled you to more then meets the eye per se. \n\nSo again; never guess and or take ANYONE'S [including mine] words at face value...seek counsel ASAP. \nGood Luck.
Bearing in mind the indestructability of plastic in land-fill sites and the effect on the environment, perhaps it's about time we did pay for plastic bags.  I tend to use the large re-usable Sainsbury's bags for supermarket shopping (Tesco's have caught on now and sell theirs for 75p), and I find them much easier to pack.  Not because I'm 'green' but because I have the smallest car on the market and whatever else it can do smartly, boot capacity wasn't high on the list.  But I can get two of those bags in with no problem, and that's usually all I need.\n\nWould I be happy to pay?  Not really; I'm on a fairly tight budget!
No. Its a federal matter, not a state one.
"Those are the games the government plays when you're getting ""free"" money.  I know, I know.  You worked for it.  Well, this way you have to work to get what they promised and more than likely they won't have to pay out the full amount they promised.\n\nPlus there's no guarantee that the program will last the whole time it takes for you to get everything promised to you.  If congress decides they want to cut the benefits to save money, they can and will do that too.  So don't waste too much time getting what is owed to you.\n\nJust like everywhere else in life, you have to read the fine print.\n\nThe one time I got a nice chunk o' money from them was when they were short in my career field my first reinlistment and they offered me a nice bonus not to get out.  I took them up on the offer.  A bit over $6000 after taxes.  Got me a used car and a nice 30% down payment on a mobile home.  Poof!  All gone!"
Take advantage of DLAB schools. Always good to be fluent in a 2nd language. Military Intelligence would be best bet, but you should also have a college degree as well. Contact the CIA or visit their web site. Few people realize it, but they have college programs/scholarships similar to the military, but they are selective.
You're friend can not take the fifth unless she somehow incriminates herself by testifying. For example, there are two  business CEO. CEO 1 is on trial. CEO 2 would take the fifth testifying in CEO 1's trial if he's testimony would incriminate himself.\n\nSince she is the victim of on assult I would say taking the fifth is not a logical choice.\n\nIt depends on the case as far as if she has to testify or not. The judge can make her come to court and testify by issuing a subpoena (which should be delivered by mail and/or a cop knocking on the door). If she chooses NOT to go to court even though a subpoena was issued she can be in BIG trouble and action can be taken against her. \n\nIf she doesn't want to testify she should go to the court house (as soon as possible) and get information from the District Attorney, Clerk of Court and/or the prosecuting attorney in determining whether she has to testify or not.
Renters rights are basically the same from state to state with few variences. Call your local court house and ask for information for where to call for landlord/tenant laws. Or do a google search for landlord/tenant laws in Georgia. You might find some sites with info.

No, because we'd then be sinking to their subterranean level of pure evil, ignorance and hate. We're better than that and must conduct ourselves accordingly.\n\nWhat I would propose is having them spend a day at the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, perhaps including some conversations with actual camp survivors.

"You can start the process by filling form I-130 Petition for Alien Relative, you can find the form and information on how to fill it here:\nhttp://www.uscis.gov/graphics/formsfee/forms/i-130.htm\n\nSpouses and children(under 21) of green card holders are subject to a quota of 114,200 visas/year. Currently there is an aprox 4 year backlog of visa issuing under your wife and children's category ( category 2A), which means that if you apply now  , although your I-130 will be approved in about a year, they will have to wait about 3-4 years for a visa number to become available. If your children are over 21 the wait is about 10 years for them.\n\nSpouses and children (under 21) of US citizens are not subject to any quota so you may wish to wait and sponsor them after you become a US citizen (i.e. if you can become a US citizen in the next 2 years then it may faster to sponsor them then, otherwise it's faster to sponsor them now)\n\nTo avoid all this problems you should've applied for a green card for your wife and children at the same time that you got yours.\n\nYou could bring them to the US under a non-immigrant visa (i.e. student or work), like this they can be with you while waiting for their permanent residency. When approved they can adjust their status.\n\nP.S. ""Jerry_Garcia_97"" is right, attorneys are waist of money, they can't speed up the process, all you need to do is fill the I-130 and wait"

Maybe, but not by itself. Iran is a nobody on the world scene. People would scream and complain if the US invaded tomorrow, and the war would take even more troops away from other posts, but I really doubt it would get too much worse than it already is with Iraq. What Iran needs to start WW3 are some allies, especially if they're big, like, oh I dunno, Russia. Europe is also close enough to have a significant interest in what goes on in the region, but they're mostly interested in sorting out the messes in Africa.\n\nIf Russia or even a significant number of other Middle-Eastern or central Asian countries posted some of their military in Iran to physically protect it, they would all be drawn into an American invasion and the war would quickly spread. Also, the region is dangerous enough as is; Iran borders Pakistan, who like it's antagonistic neighbor India has nuclear weapons, and Isreal is also suspected of such. A major war enveloping the Middle East would likely touch off these sideshows too. Maybe China would take the opportunity to go for Taiwan while the US is too busy to look, and maybe North Korea will try moving south again. Who knows how far it could spread?

"Generally it's only 30 days, but your lease may reflect something else.  I would suggest starting there.\n\nIf he is a slum lord and you have withheld rent, pending repairs that are impairing you having a decent apartment (I'm talking about repairs that involve not being able to shower or flush the toilet, or windows that don't close or a furnace that doesn't work...etc.)   If you are withholding rent because you lost your job and don't have money, or want new carpeting and he says no...then don't bother suing him.  You will lose.\n\nSome states have laws that don't permit evictions during the school year, if the tenant has school age children...if you have children...look into that.   \n\nAs far as how they work.....you landlord must notify you in writing.  Some get all dramatic about it and post the big ""EVICTION"" notice on your door.   Some prefer to send you a registered letter.   If he tells you verbally....it won't hold up.\n\nNow, once he's notified you in writing and given you a date to get out....you need to get out or have a judge alter his eviction date.    On that day, he has the right to have either a constable or sheriff deputy open the door and remove you from the premisis.   If you are not home, he is able to remove all of your belongings and put them in a storage unit (of which you will pay for).   Some will wait and just charge you for storing it in the apartment.   Once your belongings are removed...he may clean and rerent the apartment.\n\nIf you owe back rent, that is sufficiently more than your deposit, he may petition the court for permission to sell your belongings to recover his losses."

"The stupid idea of ""You can't get an ID without an ID"". Try to explain this to them and ask THEM for their opinion on your situation. Most of the time they are helpful and will point you to the right direction.\n\nI had a similar situation with my husband. He had an old expired ID from another country and that country's consulate wouldn't give him an ID, the DMV wouldn't give him an ID. SO, we just asked the DMV what we should do? They suggested official school records, you request them and keep them sealed and let the DMV open them. They just want to make sure it's you. Hope that helps!"
Cheap and illegal labor are a crutch American businesses need to ween themselves off of and what better time than now? If illegal immigrants stopped doing these jobs companies would be forced to pay decent wages (with benefits) to American citizens. The hiring of cheap, illegal labor hurts us all by lowering wages across the board, making benefits less common and by lowering the amount of taxes that go back into the economy not to mention the drain on government and social services. Yes, we might have to pay a little more for our oranges or our chickens or to have our lawns mowed but so what, it's worth it to all of us in the long run. I propose a boycott against companies that rely on cheap, illegal labor that hurts us all. \n\nI think the argument that illegals only take jobs that Americans don't want is a complete falsehood. I know there are lots of Americans who are out of work and would be happy to take jobs on farms, in hotels, in factories or plants if they offered decent wages and benefits again. The fact is companies that rely on cheap, illegal labor don't have to offer good wages to anyone, or benefits either. I remember when the janitor at my grade school could still afford to own a house, put food on the table and send his kids to college. Do you think that could happen now? I doubt it. So how about we make every day a boycott day!
I'm sorry to say but there is really not much of a chance, especially, not a easy one.\n\nGetting married remains the easiest, unfortunately same sex marriages are not recognized by the federal government.\n\nYou can try the Diversity Visa Lottery program, if you are lucky you can win a permanent residency.\n\nWork permits are generally granted to highly qualified professionals (minimum bachelor's degree) if you are one you have a chance.\n\nIf you are young you can try some work exchange program.\n\nOther then that you can stay in the US 6month per year as a tourist but you can't work.\n\nThis is exactly why there are so many illegals, it is very difficult to immigrate legally.
You think it might be the 1.9 million dollar tax return he just got back from the IRS. Next years return will show that as earned income. It shows it right on the 1040. Gravy is an understatement.
"in the real ones you can ""feel"" the ink on the darker blue items in the front, is like thermo ink and pops a little bit, then you feel the texture, also the paper is not white white, cames with a tiny blue particles.

Man, that's awful. My roommate finally got money from her deadbeat dad. She got 20k for it. It's just so awful that there are people that selfish out there. I say sterilize those who dont support thier own children!
I'm a Air Force wife and think its the best for family benefits. It also seems that we currently have the shortest deployment times (good info if you want to career military and marry/ have kids). The housing is much better, but benefits are very similar to other branches. The biggest bonus to me is knowing my husband is serving in Iraq, but is not on the front lines. The marines are very physical, the Navy....big boat, lots of water, teeny living space. It just depends on your wants and personal phobias. But as a female I'd suggest Air Force. The thought of a female on the front lines and being prisoner/ tortured is just hard to think about. Just listen to the other posters about not believing the recruiters. If I could find my hubby's, I'd strangle him!!! See if you can find a base near you, or put up a question her to talk to other military women in the branch you choose. Personal experience is always better than a smooth talking recruiter.\nAnd check about benefits! Signing bonuses and signing up for 6 yrs instead of 4 and getting more rank for doing it. And good luck! It can be a good career path, or just a chance to grow up and learn alot about yourself.
If you're going to stay in the military, you may as well go Active Army as you can be deployed just the same.  I guess it just depends on if you enjoy the army lifestyle or not.
I equate illegal immigration to someone breaking into your house, taking your money, then calling you a rascist if you complain.
That's the problem,they DON'T remember....thanks for reminding them!
He's fishing for a bribe.
No! We shouldn't support illegals.\n\nThis is a very complex issue because there are very  good pro's & con's.  \n\nIt seems to me that the illegals will work harder and for less pay but by the same token I have also seen Americans working the same way.  Example, I have a friend that work as a housekeeper for a national hotel chain. She works 6 days a week 10-12 hours a day.  She gets paid more than minimum wage but less than $10 an hour and she has had this job for more than 10 years.\n\nI believe that America should take care of our own first but by no means ignore the rest of the world.\n\nI don't think we should make the existing illegals felons but I also don't think we should give another blanket amnesty.  So where is the happy medium I don't know. I wish I were smarter so I could come up with it.

Democracy is a government run by the people.  Democracy alone doesn't necessarily provide freedom.  After all, the PEOPLE might not want everyone to have freedom.  \n\nAs for starving people, that's not really a democracy thing.  You're now thinking more along the lines of socialism or communism which is more concerned with even distribution of resources.    \n\nbtw, the United States isn't a democracy, it's a republic.
"First, I like the way you posed your question; quite eloquent.\n\nNow, sure I agree somewhat with your perception of things. However, the world, the Earth that is, is a pretty big place. But, alas, that's not what you're getting at. What YOU'RE really talking about is revealed in this passage:\n\n""A conspiracy to eliminate all souls from an isolated planet. Millions are apart of this plan and are oblivious to its existence. Do you think that when Jesus was tempted on the mount, he was tempted as you and I are tempted today? ""\n\nBasically, you're talking about the battle between GOOD and EVIL, I'm like totally sure and stuff, except maybe just remove the ""GOOD"" from the equation, and POOF! we get your message. ONE completely rational hypothesis; yet can never be proven, AND there are also an infinite number of other equally possible hypothesese.\n\nSo, the essence of these ""Elders"" are controlling the choices of the people in power, ehh? The people in power ONLY? You say, ""The elders are the spirits of the under world. Their leader is the great morning star...They appoint our leaders and use their most powerful appointees to implement their plan. Things will be done their way and nothing will stop them..."" You see.. I'm not really down with that logic. Why wouldn't the elders just screw with everyone's minds? It sounds like these ""elders"" are somewhat god-like. So, they're more like a spirit or something? This isn't jiving.\n\nWho the heck is this ""Morning Star"" character though? That doesn't make sense? What? It's the thing that controls the ""elders?"" It sounds like a kind-of, whatdyacallit, FRACTAL, but a fractal of CONTROL. Analogous to the ""size"" of the universe compared to the ""size"" of subatomic particals, so is it so with that which controls the will of man. Ans so pessimistic! I'm not buying it. You gotta get the fact that there's always two opposing forces. Whatever it be. Light and Dark. Up and Down. Male and Female. GOOD and EVIL. Sounds like you're really seeing the EVIL side of things through a GOOD person's eyes (possibly?).\n\nFinal answer? Instigate. Perpetuate. Propogate. Investigate. PERORATE!\n\nIn any case, I like that thing about the ""Great Plan of the Elders which dates back to before Adam and Eve. Adam and Eve played their roles as we play ours..."" That's pretty interesting. It could either mean, before the earth even existed? Or else it could mean, the communities and civilizations that existed before this ""Adam and Eve"" EXPERIMENT took place."

first of all you need to find some available land, or get alot of weapons to take land from somewhere else.  then you would need to find a way to get subjects, or citizens.  then you would need to create an economy wether it be agriculture or industry.  and then you would need a parlement or congress to make sure that you dont go hitler or something.  thats about it, oh yeah and you need to collect taxes to fund your government and raise them incrementally to give yourself a raise every once and a while.

"Commonly held general causes for WWII are the rise of nationalism, the rise of militarism, and the presence of unresolved territorial issues. In Germany, resentment of the harsh Treaty of Versailles, specifically article 231 the ""Guilt Clause"", the belief in the Dolchstosslegende, combined with the onset of the Great Depression fueled the rise to power of Adolf Hitler's militarist National Socialist German Workers Party (the Nazi Party); meanwhile the treaty's provisions were laxly enforced, due to the fear of another war. The League of Nations also failed in its mission of preventing war, for similar reasons. Closely related is the failure of the British and French policy of appeasement, which also through fear of war, gave Hitler time to re-arm.\n\nJapan in the 1930s was ruled by a militarist clique devoted to Japan's becoming a world power. Japan invaded China to secure additional natural resources to compensate for Japan's lack of natural resources. This angered the United States, which reacted by making loans to China, giving China covert military assistance (see Flying Tigers), and instituting progressively more inclusive embargoes of raw materials against Japan. The embargo of oil and other raw materials by the U.S. would have eventually wrecked Japan's economy; Japan was faced with the choice of withdrawing from China or going to war in order to conquer the oil resources of the Dutch East Indies. It chose to go ahead with plans for the Greater East Asia War in the Pacific\n\nAs far as the US joining, we Pearl Harbor pushed us into joining, but we were supporting the allies via trade for much of the war anyway, and many people were pushing us to join. We hesitiated because for many people it seemed like a War that had nothing to do with us, we really weren't protected ourselves, just coming to the allies aid. Remember, we weren't superpowers until after WWII."
Unfortunately, there is still no documented proof that the thimerosol in the vaccines injured our children.  A recent study came out that suggested the rate of new autism diagnoses has decreased since they took thimerosol out of the vaccines, but the results are still under debate.\n\nI doubt that there will ever be a settlement for the families dealing with autism.  Even if they did do something wrong, the drug companies are too big and have too much money and political pull to get punished for it.

Its not about the WMD, its about the oil, but the debate will heats up when oil is mention.\n\nLets look at how this all turn out, American planner knew that there were not WMD, they also knew that by attacking Iraq, two possibility can occurs;\n- winning the war\n- not winning the war\n\nIf American win the war, the oil will flush, but it will not help American economy in any way by having too much oil in the market, likewise, American planner also knew that oil peak had passed, whats left are good enough for the next few decades, this in one thing we have to consider about.\n\nIf American did not win the war or the war prolong, the oil supply will be affected, oil price will go out, again will this affect the American economy? not much as most of the refineries are located in the west, having oil and having gas are 2 different thing.\n\nAmerican can still get their oil somewhere, may not be the cheapest, but there are supplies.\n\nOverall if you look how all this evolve, I will say that all of this is about containtment, after all the rising oil price only help the Russian become more communist/socialist, the Arabs with money but still can't figure out what to do with the money.\n\nThen who are being contained? think about this.

If you know the town or city, and date of arrest, you can check the local newspaper on-line for the police blotter. If it was a more serious crime, you can check for local TV news stations and see they say anything about it.\n\nAlso, if you know if it was city, or county police that arrested him, you can sometimes call them and explain that you are a friend from out-of-state, and that he has asked you for help, but you want to be sure he isn't lying to you about the charge. Since it's public record, they may offer to tell you over the phone.

Oxymoron...
The quality of the answers to this question so far, except one is really disturbing.  First of all, the U.S. is not in a war with Iraq.  The Iraqi Government is working with the United States to put down an insurgency which challenges the legitimate elected authority of the Iraqi Government.\n\nAlso, Russia does not pose a great threat to the US from a conventional point of view, although they still have nuclear weapons.  Relations between the US and Russia are not bad at all, although there are bumps from time to time.  YOu should be more worried about the Iranian or North Korean situation at this point.  Between those two, North Korea has a much more impressive, although logistically hollow military.  Iran is not considered to be an offensive threat, but could and would defend itself fairly well against invasion.

There's still prejudice feelings out there, whether slavery is over or not. You can't always change how people view others, its hard to tell someone who was programmed to hate other races that everyone is equal under the eyes of God. No one is perfect. It's hard, not only for blacks and Jews, but for everyone in this world. It's so hard.\n\nOh yeah, saying ""colored"" is kinda racist. Think about that."

Economics is important because it is the philosophical approach of redistributing the scarce resources in order to achieve the maximization of social welfare. The essence of economics is achieving Pareto efficiency, the point where you cannot make someone better off without making someone else worse off. \n\nI hope my answer is satisfying.

Incarcaration is considered to be their punishment.  In addition, they are barred from some jobs after they are released.

"The flag, called ""Tae Kuk,"" symbolizes the thought, philosophy, and mysticism of the Far East. \n\nThe circle in the center, red upper half and blue lower half, represents absolute, or the essential unity of all being. The Yang (positive) and the Yin (negative) divisions within the circle represent duality. Examples of duality are heaven and hell, fire and water, life and death, good and evil, or night and day \n\nThe four trigrams also indicate the duality of opposites and balances. In the upper left trigram, three unbroken lines symbolize Heaven; opposite them in the lower right, three broken lines represent Earth. In the upper right trigram, two broken lines separated by an unbroken line is the symbol of Water; opposite them is Fire, symbolized by two unbroken lines separated by a broken line. \n\nSymbolic of the nation is the white background (the land), the circle (people), and the four trigrams (the government). All three make up the essential elements of the nation."

If you're asking then you can't.  I say that with all kindness, but only a DA, prosecutor can write an indictment.

Senior BJP leader Pramod Mahajan, who underwent a second surgery last night after he developed complications in the kidneys, has been put on dialysis and his condition continues to be critical.\n\nHinduja hospital Director (administration) Anupam Verma told reporters today that Mr Mahajan is still on the ventilator. \n\nHe is under medication for his blood pressure.\n\nHe said the BJP leader's kidney functions are poor and, therefore, he has been put on dialysis. Mr Mahajan is being monitored closely for his pancreatic and liver injuries even though his liver bleeding has stopped. \n\nMr Verma said efforts are on by Dr G B Davar and his team to stabilise him before contemplating any further intervention.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr Stefen Dave, vice president of the Australian College of Surgeons, has arrived here to to see Mr Mahajan, on the request of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi. Dr Dave, a trauma specialist, has been conducting training for doctors across India for the last six years. \n\nDr Dave said he was in Ahmedabad as a part of a training programme and was asked by Mr Modi to visit Mr Mahajan in Mumbai. \n\nHe said he was impressed by the treatment given to Mr Mahajan and added that a high-level British team of doctors is already present and appropriate medication and decisions are in place.\n\nMr Mahajan has sustained three bullet wounds when his brother Pravin allegedly shot him at his Worli residence here on Saturday morning

Racism typically refers to a system of oppression.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism\n\nUsually when an -ism is used, it is only meant to define the oppresor. For example, it is typical that sexism refers to men as the oppresor, since men have historically been the sexist, and women the victim of sexism. Of course we know, there are some seriously sexist women out there, and as women gain more and more power in society, sexist will refer more and more to women. This is because sexism, like racism, suggest that the person who is being described has power due to his sex or race and uses that power to oppress. Sexism typically means a man uses his sex to exert power over the other sex. Racism usually means a race of people use their race to exert power over other races. In this country, the race of people who has historically used their race as a source of power has been the white race. As blacks and other people gain more and more power, just like with women, you will see more of other races being called racist too. Meaning, people of other races are now using their race to have power over other races, including the white race. \n\nIn short, racism, sexism, and other -isms suggest that the perp is uses his race or sex or whatever as a source of POWER. One would be more accurate in calling blacks who can't use their race solely for gain, prejudice or race haters, which just basically means that they don't like or they hate people of another race but not that they use their race as a source of financial, political,academic, or social power in general.

"I think you ask a really good question.  I can't make a blanket statement by saying that all forms of violence are terrorism.  I think any kind of violence that is not for the greater cause of justice for humanity and overall human rights (not just one specific cultures' ethnocentric aim at human rights) could be considered terrorism.  I would assert that the allies struggle against facism in World War II was not terrorism, but a fight AGAINST terrorism - but there are very few wars like that in our world's history.  \nThis war in Iraq IS NOT WWII.  I think I probably would assert that the US is asserting a form of terrorism because while we may be figting for the people of Iraq, we ARE MOST DEFINITELY also fighting for our own interests. that is exactly what the Muslims are doing.  Innoncent people have been killed and I'm quite sure there was terror when we bombed Baghdad.  Terrorism is most definitely not a Muslim ideal.  the only true way to not be a terrorist, however, is to utlimately seek the SELFLESS cause of peace for humanity - not just for yourself or your own culture - and we must divorce the idea of violence being the only away to achieve justice from our thinking. The minute you resort to violence for whatever reason, you begin down a path of perpetual violence that leads to terrorism.

"This is only a partial responce to your question and partly a responce to the idiots who ansewred before me.\n\nA true American is a person born under the legal qualifications of citizenship as determined by the U.S. Constitution.  It says if you are born to a U.S. Citizen or on U.S. soil, you are a natural citizen.  If you studied hard and folloewd the imigration laws and rules, you can be naturalized and be a citized too.\n\nA ""Native American"" is any person born on U.S. soil to U.S. citizen parents.\n\nAn modern American Indian is a decendant of those Asians who migrated across the Bering Straight land bridge.\n\nAll settlers who came here before there was a country came here legally because, according to the American Indian Tribes, ""No man owned the land"".\n\nIf somebody were to break into your house and demand you feed them, you'd kick them out.  That's what Illegal immigrants did.\n\nIf you wait in line at the bank for 30 minutes and some guy comes in and cuts infront of your, you'd send him to the end of the line.  That's what Illegal Immigrants did to the Legal immigrants.\n\nThis country may need immigrants, since out current birthrate is too low to support our needs, but why not let the Legal immigrant who has been waiting for 10 years to get the job?  This is not a racial thing.\n\nAnybody who takes off work or school to march on May 1st doesn't need their job or their education (or doesn't want it) and their dismissal from work or suspension from school is appropriate.\n\nIf all the Mexicans who are here illegally (over 10 million) were to march on Mexico City demanding to have better jobs, economy, and living conditions, Presidente Fox would run for his life.\n\nRemember, Mexico requires Identification to get jobs and shoots anybody sneeking in their country illegally."
Between 1964 and 1972, the U.S. Government spent $24 Billion every year.That was $2 Billion every month we were in Vietnam.By the time we pulled out of Vietnam, we spent $192 Billion for eight years of war.The Vietnam war was pretty much paid for by taking money out of other government programs and putting it toward Vietnam.By the way, I read a while back on the internet that the war in Iraq right now will cost more than Vietnam did.Scary Huh?
It happened to one of our instructors when I was at NTC Great Lakes int he Navy. He was a FC1 (E-6) up for Chief (E-7). He got busted for fraternizing with a student and lost a stripe for it (busted to E-5). Doesn't sound like much of a punishment, but it set him back 6 years in his career. He had to wait 3 years before he was eligible for E-6 again, then 3 years before he go up for Chief again.\n\nFraternization does not need to be sexual. This was a teacher and student hanging out having some beers after school.

I disagree with some of what Rumsfeld has done, particularly in regard to making our military do more with less and consolidating bases (didn't we learn anything from Pearl Harbor?).  But overall, I think he has done a good job.\nFiring him would probably increase the threat level somewhat.  Who in the current Administration is qualified to take his place?\n(P.S. Thank you for your emailed comments.  I wish there were more like you in both parties.  Keep up the good work!)
A protest march alone does not create a sustainable economy, which is the problem in Mexico.  We can simply choose to reform our immigration laws, and it's done.  They need to spend decades working on strengthening their economy.  It's not politics at issue down there, it's economics.  So if they put all that effort into a march there--the effect would be precisely nothing.\n\nNot to mention that not all of the immigrant workers in the US are from Mexico.     \n\nThey have come here to try and make a better life, as my ancestors did, and yours.  That openness is part of the character of America, and I don't want to see that change.  I don't want the US to be like all the European countries who are scared of immigrants from Turkey.  I want us to be the ones who make it work.  \n\nWe rely on their labor, plain and simple.  For years we have let illegal immigration go on--don't ask don't tell, if you will--but now security concerns have made us crack down.  So we're changing the game halfway through, and they're calling foul.  We need to legally open channels for people who just want jobs, so that we can maintain the border security that we need.  The current system is a mess.

A) They may read your letters, but if there isn't enough other people supporting your position that the politician knows about, your letter will most likely be ignored.\n\nB) Even if the other person gets in office, the one you voted for, there's no guarantee that they'll support your views or aren't as corrupt as the politician they're replacing.\n\nC) Speaking as a group is bound to get your more attention.  This seems the best of you suggestions thus far.\n\nD) This will get you arrested for vandalism, though I can understand your anger.\n\nRegarding politicans, the vast majority were once lawyers.  As we all know, most lawyers are the scum of the earth, especially those driven by a lust of power, which consequently are the only ones that endeavor for political position.

"Not saying this to piss anybody off, but if we had younger leaders of different races that were genuinely concerned about the country and problems at hand rather than trying to make it seem as if everyone is out to harm their race, then yes, I think it would be great.

Equality is just as violated if someone is given special privleges because they are a ""minority"".  A fresh way of thinking combined with the old way of thinking COULD be great, if the fresh way of thinking can get over trying to convince everyone that they are so mistreated because of past, such as countries we were once at war with or people that were mistreated here over a hundred years ago."

What is meant by a balanced budget is subject to interpretation and handled differently in many states. See this chart from the National Conference of State Legislatures (which is an organization that serves state legislators across the country and compares how issues are handled differently by different states).\n\nhttp://www.ncsl.org/programs/fiscal/balbuda.htm\n\nNew York state's requirements are considered not stringent, the Governor is required to prepare a balanced budget but the legislature is not required to pass a balanced budget, and the State is permitted to carry an operating deficit across a fiscal year boundary. \n\nAlso note, even in states with more stringent requirements it is often unclear how a balanced budget amendment can really be enforced. And New York state politicians have been notorious for the last decade or so for passing budgets later than the deadline the state is supposed to meet.

Global warming is a warming trend that has been noticed since about 1860, while the greenhouse effect is a hypothesis that some scientists believe explains why this is happening (they say increased carbon dioxide levels have increased temperatures). \n\nHowever, from 1940-1960 temperatures actually decreased even though this was a time of heavy industrialization (Europe was rebuilding and the U.S. was in a rapid economic expansion). Also, NASA's satellite data (which is considered more accurate and measures the atmospheric temperature but has only been calculated since 1979), actually shows the earth cooling since 1993, in complete disagreement with ground tempertures. IMO, while it is completely possible that the greenhouse effect is why ground temperatures continue to rise, there is simply not enough information yet to support that conclusion.

Unfortunately, there is no one decent to vote for.\n\nNo politician is going to take on those issues, and if they do, they won't get any support from their colleagues and they won't be reelected.\n\nGeorge Bush tries to act like the biggest issues that our country faces are Social Security and Immigration.  This with two wars that are making little or no progress, a record deficit, jobs being outsourced at record rates and many of our biggest employing companies operating in or on the brink of bankruptcy.\n\nIf he won't acknowledge those issues, he certainly won't suddenly care about homelessness, poverty or starving children.\n\nAlthough I've been using Bush for the sake of my example, you could substitute the name of any politician, it would be the same.

For that first answerer: It is not entrapment. Entrapment is defined as forcing someone into doing something they wouldn't normally do. In other words, if I came up to you and asked you to sell me crack for 1 million dollars, you would probably hunt down the nearest drug dealer, take a ball bat to his head and and take his crack to sell to me. However if I asked you for the same amount of crack for its normal price, you'd tell me to pound pavement. These sting operations catch people in the act of doing something that they normally do. I hope they go to jail, and I hope one of the jailers violates his civil rights and tells the other inmates that this guy is a freakin' pervert.
Victor,\n\nThe statement that if you buy a house you become a citizen is wrong, this is not true in Australia.\n\nYou don't mention what work you do, but there is a skill shortage list in Australia, if you can perform one of these skills (and prove you can) then you can immigate there.\n\nAnother option is to find someone who will sponsor you to work there, this is not impossible but not very easy either.\n\nIf you are very well off financially then you can go in on a Business Visa but you have to open a business and invest a lot of money into it.\n\nI really hope you can move to my homeland, so good luck and your English is pretty good to me!\n\nJonathan
Abortion is a descision! Why shouldnt woman have a choice? If abortion was legalized like it was back in the days a strong willed woman will find a way to abort the baby herself. Oops I fell down the stairs, I wasnt hungry so I didnt eat for 2 weeks, its only a telephone pole it wont hurt that much. A woman will do what they can to deport a baby if they dont want it. Why not do it a healthy way without hurting other people. Also have you heard of how many children go through the foster system now? If all woman who had an abortion kept their baby than put it into foster care the foster care system would be out of control! If a woman has a baby keeps it for a while and then hands it over to social services that is just one more child in the system that will have to find a loving home. Personally I would rather have an abortion than to have a child and put a child through emotional distress.  An abortion is a short procedure that kills a fetus. Having a baby and not loving it is a life long emotional rollar coaster for a child. Which is better?
First, the oil companies are making around 10% margins on gas.  See Exxon's income statement here: http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=XOM&annual\n\nSo, if the government decided to chop off some of that last 10%, you might get back some of that.  Most people aren't going to be happy with just a few cents, though.\n\nFrom basic economics, if you impose a price ceiling, supply drops: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_ceiling\n\nFirms try to maximize their profits, so they'll be willing to produce less at a lower price.  If you lower it so that each gallon of gas is giving them negative profit (P < AVC), they'll just stop producing gas completely because it's dumb to keep on losing more and more money unless you're MSFT selling Xboxes trying to get market share.\n\nThey could also just sell it elsewhere and start exporting, where they can get a better price for it.  China and India are starting to demand more oil as their economies grow.  Or even sell the crude oil (without refining it) on the futures market and drive that down a little.\n\nEither way, the most likely scenario of a drastic price ceiling is long gas lines, similar to what happened in the 70s.  It's arguable whether this is more or less desirable than higher gas prices.

As far as what GWB has done to this country:\n1.  he has created one of the best economies in decades\n2.  he has lowered the job unemployment and created jobs- and good paying jobs.\n3.  there has not been a terrorist attack on american soil since 911.\n4.  he has crushed 95% of al queda's leadership.\n5.  he has helped raise millions of dollars to fight aids in africa\n6.  he has liberated the peolpe in Afganistan & Iraq and planted democracy in a part of the world that needs to come out of the 8th century.  \n\nAnd one last thing - just like a typical liberal when you start to run out of facts to debate you go and pull the race card!!  Rightful owners to america - Native American.  What a load of crap.  Is that supposed to make me feel guilty or something?  Native americans were nomadic savages that killed and enslaved one another before anyone from England landed.  How can I say this with out sounding smug - white settlers tried to befriend indians and had little success.  It's kind of like the Jews and Palestinians or oil and water, it just doesn't mix - and the white settlers had guns. There were many battles fought but the bigger and better armed side won.  Hence Darwinianism.
John Wayne, I don't remember his real name but was born in Ohio.
Someday,  You can be a proud mom with your son actually in the military.  I think it is one of the best things a young man or woman can do as they prepare for life.  I remind my soldiers that they need to recognize that the military is one step on the part of life and that it is only part of who they will be in the future.  The military teaches discipline and gives confidence to young adults. I once heard that if you could give your children one thing, it shoul be confidence, because with it all else is possible--education, money, love, success. \nThat said, couple confidence with discipline, and you have success.  Finally, yes the Army Trucks M915, M916 and HETS have room for him and you.  And oh by the way, we have McDonald,s, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Charley's Steak, Taco Bell and Other Fast Food Restaurants on our base camps and I know --because I am at war here in Iraq as we speak.
I would love to see it! I used to work in Mexico as a Plant Manager. I think it might have a better effect if all American plants and companies in Mexico were shut down on the Cino De Mayo as well. I still can't see how these idiots can justify demanding rights when they have no right to demand anything if they are illegal. I don't think there would be any impact if white Americans walked out on cinco de mayo because they really have no effect on our economy in the first place.
In the Marine Corps your promotion to E4 and E5 is based on your composite score and your MOS's cutting score.  Your composite score is based on your pro's and con's and your PFT score and rifle score.  They also give you points for how long you've been in and how long you've been at the rank you are.  To get promoted to E6 you have to have been an E5 for at least 2 years before you are eligible to pick up (unless it is a field (combat) promotion)then it is up to recommendations from your SNCO's and up.  They don't have NCO school they have CPL's Course and SGT's Course some MOS's require you to go some recommend you go and some could care less if you go or not.
that won't happen in our lifetime.
No our military is already stretched pretty thin we don't need to have another war.

i don't have a problem with legal immagration. i mean, if someone wants to live in american that's cool, but i don't think they should do so by sneaking into the country and ducking taxes.\nand as far as 'we the people' goes, try to find out the names of your congressmen and contact them. find other people who care and rally them to call and write a gazillion messages. quite a few bills have been changed, stopped or written because a bunch of people were bugging the congressmen. \ni'm not sure if this is what you were asking, but i think it was.
More or less, this is true. It can be a time consuming and stressful process dealing with bureaucrats though. For instance, if you are arrested in your city and then later the police decide not to file a report or charges and everything is dropped, THIS DOES NOT MEAN a record has been erased. It might have been erased at the city and state level but EVERY arrest made, regardless or whether it is dropped or not, is sent directly to the FBI. Since the boom of the Internet search engine and skip tracing technology for the every day person, many private businesses can now get their hands on this information (sometimes done illegally)...but one private business that can access any FBI record is any business which issues credit or abides by the FDIC ( and doesn't that include almost all businesses now)? The freedom of information act, which you might have been referring to,does exist (sorry if I got off the subject). But do a search on the Internet and order one of yourself and see how confusing and complicated it is though.

I am hoping that Americans vote for the individual and not the party with which the individual is associated.  We need to get away from a party system and begin to focus on individuals beliefs and convictions.  From my standpoint, to vote for someone simply because they belong to a particular party is quite ignorant.
There were actually 2 marches today. One for the Anti-War in Iraq. That is on Fox 5 news Ny. Then there was another demonstration to get the world to notice the situation that is occuring in uganda.

Is there a city in the U.S. that doesn't get complaints about potholes? I live in a town of about 5000 people; it's the seat of the county of 50,000. Except for bad weather, weekends and holidays there are crews repairing potholes daily.  My street - twelve homes - no outlet so minimal traffic, needs repairs four or five times a year.  I don't think we could afford to build a road that would withstand the daily temp fluctuation experienced in the high desert with its freeze-thaw cycle, so on this one I give the gov't a pass.

This is such a stupid idea, to think that this would have any real impact on removing guns from the street.\n\nI myself have 10 non-working guns.  If I lived there, I guess I could get $1,000.00.\n\nDo you think the bad guys have thought of this and are just turning in their non-working guns and keeping the working ones or do you think that when someone pays $2,000 for an illegal handgun on the street that a $100 is somehow an incentive?

"Welfare is financial assistance paid by the government to certain entities or groups of people who are unable to support themselves alone, or are perceived by the government to be able to function more effectively with financial assistance. Some welfare is general, while some are specific and can only be invoked under certain circumstances, such as a scholarship. Welfare can be given to both individuals, or be given to companies or entities, which take place as corporate welfare.\n\nReasons for individuals being unable to support themselves alone might be unemployment, disability, lack of education or some other reason. Assistance may also take form of other relief, such as tax credits for working mothers. Welfare is known by a variety of names in different countries, all with the fundamental purpose of providing an economic or social safety net for disadvantaged members of society. Almost all developed nations provide some kind of safety net of this kind; the governments of those nations where this is especially prominent are known as welfare states.\n\nThe desired outcome and purpose of welfare varies. For individual welfare for the non-disabled, the purpose of welfare often is to provide those who require financial assistance in order to attain a higher income in the first place, especially for those who are perceived to be stuck in the cycle of poverty. The justification for financial assistance to such individuals often cites the requirement for existing financial resources in order to attain tertiary education that would allow individuals to gain more income, and thereby get out of welfare eventually. Welfare for the disabled, in contrast, does not eventually expect non-dependency, and the justification is more philosophical. Welfare may be given to entities as corporate welfare in order to provide capita to industry are perceived by the government to need financial assistance in order to survive or to expand but are thought by the government to be valuable industries eventually and will eventually become non-dependent.\n\nSome of these ideal outcomes and purposes, as well as welfare's effectiveness have been challenged by political lobbies such as those who oppose big government, such as minarchists or libertarians.\n\nPersonal Welfare:\nThe amounts paid to individuals are typically very low, and may fall below the poverty line. Recipients must usually demonstrate a low level of income such as by way of ""means testing"", or financial hardship, or that they satisfy some other requirement such as childcare responsibilities or disability. Those receiving unemployment benefits may also have to regularly demonstrate that they are periodically searching for employment. Some countries assign specific jobs to recipients who must work in these roles in order for welfare payments to continue. In the United States and Canada, such programs are known as workfare."

Yes, they're doing their part and perhaps getting ready to go, or resting from coming back from that hell-hole. They certainly do deserve our respect, regardless of their own personal agendas. Whether this is a worthy war or not, not all of them volunteered for this particular one.

"Here ya go.\n\n""In the first place we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else, for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birthplace, or origin. But this is predicated upon the man's becoming in very fact an American, and nothing but an American...There can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn't an American at all.

the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The 1993 Constitution declares Russia to be a democratic, federal, law-based, and secular state with a republican form of government. The state is based on the separation of powers between the executive, legislature, and judiciary, and on federal principles that define the powers of and relationships between the organs of the Russian Federation and its constituent territorial units. Ideological pluralism and a multi-party political system are recognized, and individuals have the right to freedom of movement, expression, conscience, and religion, and the right to peaceful assembly, to own land, to engage in legal entrepreneurial activity, and to housing. Censorship is prohibited. The constitution also commits the federation to the protection of motherhood and childhood, and to providing free education and health services within the state system.\nHowever very unstable in reality, as its a war btw the super rich and the super poor!

As far as practicing law in the US, you would need to pass the bar exam in the jurisdiction where you wanted to practice.  The qualifications to sit the bar vary from state to state so you'd need to contact the State Bar where you wanted to practice.\n\nThere's another alternative that might be of interest, especially if your are of expertise is in business law.  Many American corporations have subsidiaries or production facilities in foreign countries.  They need to ensure that they don't violate local laws and their American staff attorneys are pretty useless for this.  You could be valuable to them if they have facilities in your native country, particularly if you have strong English skills.
well, i don't the details but basically anyone who is under a feu or had a feu superior has about 5 years to discuss a comprimise to the feu.
Not sure exactly what you mean but I suspect you want to know how to fix the legal system. Here are some approaches you might want to take: 1) Increase small claims court awards to up $100,000 without a lawyer; 2) To decrease the need for expensive prisons (about $50,000 a year per prisoner in some states) increase alternative dispute resolution to solve problems at a fraction of the cost; 3) Allow paralegals to represent clients in some cases; and train high school students how to research and represent themselves in civil courts.

You think that your vote means something..  The elections are very subtly fixed by popularity votes and dumping money into programs that affect the popularity of one candidate over another.  It is a fantasy to think that you have very much control over who governs you.  The political system knows its limits and is very controlled.  They want the people half way peaceful and working.  You either vote democrat or republican, anything else is throwing away your vote.  What if you don't like either??  There are no options.\nMany said because people are lazy, but I believe that folks in general have completely lost faith that they have any say in the Govt.  Their votes don't matter any more.

President Bush himself has not officially proposed an immigration act.  The House of Representatives passed an immigration act, which they may have discussed with President Bush, and the act is now being debated by the senate.  The senate must pass the house act in order for it to become a law.\nPresident Bush, of course, has official positions on immigration, which he has discussed in several speeches.  Bush's proposal has three basic aspects: (1) securing the border, (2) strengthening enforcement inside the country, and (3) creating a temporary worker program.  \nThe details of Bush's proposal can be found on this fact sheet from the White House:  http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/03/20060327-1.html

I didn't take the time to read what the other people have written, so excuse me if I repeat anything that has already been said...\n\nYou have touched on the essential points.  There are so many children out there born to parents who can't or won't take care of them.  Is it fair to force that on a child?  If the mother is wise enough to recognize that she cannot properly care for a child, then kudos to her.\n\nAlso, many a mother has had to drop out of school, work two low paying part-time jobs, and basically give in to a crappy life for her and a life in daycare for her child because she is struggling to care for her child and make ends meet.  Let women choose to finish school and get a decent job before trying to bring a child into this world that they must support.\n\nAnd to all the people who disagree, how many unwanted children have they adopted?  how many hours do they spend mentoring children in foster care or in children's homes abandoned by their parents?  I would bet none of them has ever seen a child in foster care, not to mention helping any of them.  \n\nThe only demand in adoption is for healthy, white, newborn babies that come from healthy, educated parents.  There are thousands on wonderful children in foster care hoping for a home of their own.  Let's get all them adopted before we force more children to be brought into this world destined for the same fate!\n\nI will stop rambling now, but yes, it should be a choice that all women have a right to. \n\nOh yeah, and don't get me started on the fathers...how many dead beat dads are out there?  Just because the father decided today that he wants a baby doesn't mean he will be there emotionally or financially in the future.  It should be the mother's choice because the child will be her life long responsibility...

I know the federal law Combined OmniBus R Act (COBRA) look this up on google which they have to offer you insurance, it is super expensive because you have to pay ALL of the costs, so for a family of four it is like 1200 a month, but the thing is it is a continuation of your old policy, they have to send that to you soon after leaving.  If they paid the 100% of the policy then they have the 'master' policy and you may be well right where you are now.  They are supposed to give 30 days, but that is NC law.  If you paid but it was a policy under the master they may only be liable to reimburse your premium for the month.
Go on the website.

(Appointments to Translator or Interpreter posts require passing a qualifying examination.) \n\nThere are rarely suitable openings for students, recent college graduates, or persons who lack pertinent experience or language skills. \n\nTRANSLATOR AND INTERPRETER POSITIONS \n\nThe UN agencies recruit for these positions by competitive examination. A university degree, relevant experience, and a thorough knowledge of at least three official United Nations languages are required. The Department of State does not recruit for Translator or Interpreter positions. Persons interested in these positions should contact the UN Recruitment Office in New York, or write directly to the organizations that interest them.
Freedom of assembly has been terribly reduced to mean nothing at all.  In fact, it's easier to assemble when you are part of the KKK then when you have anything good to say.  You have to apply for permits, and you have to stick to the places they let you go.  Permits also include sound levels...  Tsk tsk tsk.\nYour right to bear arms will also be taken away if the heads of industry find it unfavorable.  All it takes is one guy with a gun shooting a tycoon to get that right reduced to nothing.

"The problem of an I.Q. test for voter-registration (aside from the obvious ones of expense, data-storage and retrieval, and the possibility of false results) is that of ""I.Q."" to begin with; the entire concept of a standardized test for ""intelligence"" has been in question, since the late , great Professor Stephen Jay Gould of Harvard, addressed some of the abuses I.Q. tests had been put to in his, ""The Measurement of Man."" Further more even if we accept the idea that intelligence is a measurable quality, which test should we use? The old Stanford-Binet test?  The slightly more contemporary (1976) WISC-III test? or the newer, informal on-line test-yourself variety? And who would determine which test and the cut-off point for eligible voters?\nFinally, why should we suppose that intelligence whether culturally-constructed or genetically derived would necessarily make a person choose the best candidate?  Many ""intelligent"" people voter for Hitler, others (such as Jean Paul Sarte) supported Stalin, long after his crimes had been revealed.  (Not to mention the 60,000,000 Americans who voted for George Bush in the last election, despite all the evidence about Iraq, the clear indications of his inability to handle the economy, and the fact that he can barely speak his native language - are all 60,000,000 of them idiots? although it might be nice to think so, it simply is not so.) Why should we think that intellectual ability equals what Plato called right opinion?\nRather than waste time and money trying to restrict the franchise (only about 50% of eligible voters exercise their franchise anyway,) why not use your own clear intelligence to help educate the electorate - not just on issues of the day, but on how to approach and analyze any issue.  I will only add that I write the above as an individual who has voted carefully in every election since I was 18, a holder of a professor's chair at a major international university, and as someone who tests out at 139 on the Stanford-Binet tests (shows you how old I am.)"
Because all humans are mentally ill until the age of 21 or 22. We pick 18 because you'll need to know a little about it to be able to drive a Humvee through Baghdad for 12 to 18 months at a stretch.
That's because the mob had pics of him in women's underwear, bra, etc....true story
No.
Someone said that what is illegal today may be legal tomorrow. He wants to compare African American and Women's rights with illegal immigration. The difference is that  these are citizens of the U.S.A. and have all the right to protest for equal rights in the country they were born in.  Another says that illegals can't go through all the bother to become legal immigrants. Excuse me! if laws are bothersome. Some answers huh?
"woo-hoo, it was scary there for awhile, until it turned about to just be another idiotic liberal moment:\n\nHow to take exit polls as a liberal, lesson 1.\n\n1.  only ask those who voted democratic\n2.  only ask those who live in democratic areas\n3.  report your findings with a straight face\n\nThe funniest, was Dan Rather, though.  Every other news channel, and even those who are not news channels, had given the election to Bush.  It was all about Ohio, remember.  According to the results that were in, even if the rest of the people in Ohio who were eligible to still vote, voted for Kerry, it would still not be enough to take the lead.  Flash to Dan Rather, who just would not post Ohio's results as a Bush State.  hoooooo, I thought he was going to explode, man did he try to stall that.  \n\nTheir giddiness made me sick to my stomach, not necessarily b/c I felt like I lost, but I was sick about the thought of Kerry as Pres.  \n\nThe next best thing was going to school the next day....My college classes (completely liberal profs) some students had been ragging on Bush all semester saying how Kerry was going to crush him......wow, I made sure I showed up Nov. 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n\nWhy is it that people say the election is rigged when it didn't go their way?  Accept it, and lets move on, as a country.  \n\nAnd, furthermore, why is it, that liberals accept the decisions of the Supreme Court on an ""as they like it"" basis.  Roe v. Wade: they love that one, but Bush v. Gore---oh my goodness, he has the justices in his pocket.....or wait, it was a more liberal court then, if anyone had them in their pocket, wouldn't it have been Gore...maybe, just maybe, Bush won fair and square......\n\nAnd if one more person blames him for hurrican katrina, I am going to scream!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I didn't know he could make wind like that.  How about local government in New Orleans?  What in the world were they doing?  Oh wait, they are democrats, the media won't ask that question."

Your personal injury settlement can affect your SSI benefit (and medicaid liens) in very significant ways.  Before the settlement is finalized, you and your personal injury attorney must speak to an elder law attorney to learn how to protect the money from the government.\n\nThere are many options open to you but the moment you receive a cash settlement made directly to you, those options will shrink drastically.  Get an elderlaw attorney as soon as possible.

"The USA, along with England, France and some other nations  helped ""create"" modern day Israel which was carved out of Palestinian land.\nThe USA is very weak on intelligence on the people of the Middle east so it depends heavily on Israel.\nIsrael on the other hand is the country that practices apartheid in the Middle East but the USA and other countries are turning a blind eye to it.\nThe reason : the other countries are all Arabs or Muslims.\nThe USA needs Israel as the buffer to control the Arab oil rich lands and when things get out of hand , it has to use a heavy hand like it is presently doing in Iraq, but with a heavy price.\nBoth the USA and Israel care very little for the UN.\nThe UN is just a tool of convenience for both nations.\nSad but true."

It's regarding ILLEGAL immigrants, hispanic or not...although most other immigrants tend to be legal...since they don't have borders to jump.\nThey are upset, because they don't want to have to go back to their home countries...even though they are here ILLEGALLY.  They want amnesty....like 'well, since you've been here working w/out paying taxes, putting your kids in our school systems but not teaching them english, and using our free healthcare programs...might as well stick aroung'.

"i don't think they should be fired and here is why:\nif the protest was against the war overseas or for women's rights. then people would be jumping at the opportunity to say ""I'm a patriot, take the day off, no problems here"". but this being a non-white benefiting cause, now people are up in arms about how there should be dire consequences. i just think the same standards should be applied across the board"

Go to court and tell them you had a good driving record for about ten years. Maybe they will charge you with unsafe operation of a vehicle which is a higher fine but no points on your license.

"The Internal Revenue Service is a Branch of the Government ... part of the Treasury Department.  It's employees are referred to as Civil Servants and their pay grades are GS## (such as GS7, GS13, etc.) ... the GS stands for General Service ... they do not hold military rank, but are employees of the Federal Government.  The IRS is funded by the Treasury Department (a cabinet-level arm of the Executive Branch).\n\nThe IRS is about as government as you can get outside of the Supreme Court, Congress and the Military.\n\nUPDATE:  At the expense of a couple of points here (who really cares anyway) ... I happened to think ... ""Maybe she's referring to the Federal Reserve?""\n\nThe Federal Reserve is NOT part of the US Government.  Look at a dollar bill or any US paper currency ... they are ""Federal Reserve Notes"" ... \n\nThe Federal Reserve is actually privately owned ... Banks, to meet their Federally mandated laws regarding reserve requirements, must hold a certain amount (based on the bank's assets) of Federal Reserve stock ... The Federal Reserve (the root of the US Banking Industry) is wholely and completely a private organization ... obviously endorsed by the government, but technically, it's privately owned.\n\nThe details and history of this are far to complicated to mention here ...

The difference is that the catechism of the catholic church teaches love and respect for all people. You have to remember that extremists make all people look bad. Think of Islam. Anyway, you have to take things in context. Look at the fundamental teachings of christ. Read the New Testament, it will be good for you. All religions follow those fundamental teachings, and the only reason for the crusades, and all of those other things you mentioned, was that some extremist's power went to his head and he decided to start making rules. Also bear in mind that if Hitler had died in 1938, he would have been hailed as a hero. (He was Time Magazine's man of hte year in 1938.)

I think that would be a good idea.  American citizens need to show a counter opinion to the recent protests of the illegal immigrants.  The squeakiest wheel gets the grease!  If legal American citizens do not voice their opinions, government will believe that the majority of Americans are okay with illegal immigration in the USA.
god knows.
You can get it from any of the units that are currently deployed there.  Just search out whose there right now (I think 82nd airborne is there and some companies out of Fort Drum).  Normally they sell them to families during and after deployment but you can probably buy them that route if you want them to be authentic.
It is called a quit claim for one thing, and if they were going to sieze it they would have already. You should have a lawyer if you were in jail so ask them. They can't say anything to anyone about it and they will have to bring you the papers anyway if you are still in jail.
Just what in the hell are you talking about?
If I'm reading the site of the Election Commission of India correctly, it looks like the vote/poll happens on May 8th.

Under the current law, the answer depends on your circumstances.  If you entered with a visa and have no prior deportations, you should be able to get a green card in about 1 year.  Get a good lawyer! Dont get scammed.\nIf you entered illegally, you will not qualify for  a green card inside the US unless you were the beneficiary of a family or employment petition filed before 04/30/2001.  If you have been here illegally for more than 6 months and you leave the country, you will be barred from returning for 3 years (unless you are granted a waiver).  If you have been here illegally for more than 1 year and you leave the country, you will be barred from returning for 10 years (unless you are granted a waiver).  GET A GOOD LAWYER.  Good luck!.

IN GENERAL - if the person is at a public event or location and the picture is published for non-commercial purposes such as in a newspaper or magazine then you do not have to have a release. If the picture is to make money or to be on a TV show or any other purpose then you need a model release. The key is the public location and public event. If stakes are high check with a copyright lawyer before you do anything though.
I would say give at least three weeks notice to your job. If you're that important, they will need to schedule around you. Try to pick a time where you think the job will be the least busy. Some jobs are busier in the summer. In that case, try to vacation in the winter.

A LRRP in Vietnam was basically a group of Army Rangers who volunteered to go into deep patrols in a certain area. Their primary mission was to gather intelligence on the NVA and VC. Organized in six man teams, they were often used for other special operations tasks like guerrilla warfare (laying ambushes, terrifying enemies, etc), forward observation, etc. These men were high trained and very brave for doing this... after all, there was only six of them in middle of Indian Country, always outnumbered... the slightest mistake would kill them all.
"If you have a full ROTC scholarship, it can be a good deal.  A free ride through college, and a guaranteed job afterwards.  However, keep in mind that you have only a little input into what you end up doing and where you end up going.  On the other hand, you will be an officer, which has a lot of privileges.\n\nI did Air Force ROTC.  I ended up stationed just outside Boston, so it was a great place to be just out of college - a fun city.  I also ended up with a nice job.  After serving my commitment, I got out and moved on with my life.  \n\nBut, not everyone's story is so rosy.  You may end up stationed at a remote location, or worse, deployed.  Ask yourself if you are prepared for those for strong possibilities.  \n\nIf you are considering a military career anyway, then ROTC is great - puts you into the officer ranks without having to go through the very tough military academies.  ROTC does add some amount of workload to your already full college schedule, but it is not overly demanding.\n\nDuring ROTC, you will have to go through some training and instruction, including boot camp.  When you graduate from ROTC, you will join the military as an officer.  If you had a scholarship, you will be required to serve for a period of time (usually 4 years).  In your senior year, you fill out a form stating your preferences for your ""specialty code"" (i.e., what job you want) and your first assignment location.  Usually you will get one of your top 3, but not always.  They will pay to move you from your home of record to your first base/post.\n\nI cannot go into detail about what life is like in the military here - it would take too long.  Going through the ROTC program will give you some idea of that, or you can (and should) research it elsewhere.  Keep in mind that: 1) in the military, you won't get rich, but there are many benefits, and 2) you will be in the military, so you may end up going to war."
It doesn't work that way.\n\nYou see a doctor when you're sick or injured.  You go whenever you feel bad enough to need a doctor.\n\nNow, as a matter of proof, it makes sense that the longer after an auto accident you go, the harder it is to prove your injury was caused by the accident.\n\nBut:  1)  If you're hurt, go to a doctor and don't worry about any of that.  Let the lawyers and insurance agents deal with it.  2)  There are whole books of injuries that take time to appear.  A bruise that slowly gets bigger until it's pressing on your spinal cord, for instance.  Or a blood disease you got from an infection at the scene of the accident.  \n\nSo get treated, tell your lawyer as soon as you get treated and drive safe.

Most definitely not.  Our government was founded on sound Christian principles.  America believes strongly that anyone can come here and practice any religion freely without government involvement.  Recently though, this has been true for every religion except Christianity.  There is nothing wrong with having the ten commandments posted outside of government buildings and such, especially since most of us do believe that there is one God, and the ten commandments are a great moral compass (thy shalt not kill is an excellent commandment, don't you think?).

"Who was behind it? All the power hungry psychopaths that liked Hitler´s ideas of course. \n\nThere also was a secret part to the Hitler-Stalin-pact that came into place after the german invasion from the west - the red army came from the east and forced the polish government into fleeing to Rumania. Shortly after that Poland was divided between the two forces. \n\nWhat was behind it was simple - Hitler wrote in his book ""Mein Kampf"" that either Germany would be worldleaders or would not be at all.... so world domination was the foremost reason behind it. \nClever enough, german SS forces dressed up as polish freedomfighters and attacked the german radiostation in Gleiwitz near the polish border and declared war with Germany while posing as polish forces. With this one and a couple of other attacks they tried to justify attacking Poland shortly after. \n\nBTW, it is not true that Germany had no colonies, actually St. Thomas was a German colony (now US) just like Crab Island in the caribbean and Ghana used to be Groß Friedrichsburg. Those days were gone in the 1930s but yes, Germany had colonies."

While you are too old to enlist for active duty service in the US army (maximum cut-off age WITH a waiver is 38), there are a number of contract and civil service roles you can fulfill in and around military bases directly for the military.\n\nThe language school (Defense Language Institute) in Monterey, California is always on the look-out for ex-foreign military to teach students foreign language in military environment so long as you have any kind of teaching credentials at all (6 years of university).
No.  We should have no non-citizens.
No, but people have assumed that because I have big breasts that I am easy. Or could that be because I sleep around? Hmmm.
"Neither...and both.  He was a man of his time.  Many believe he saved the Union, at the expense of the Republic and started what is known as the ""imperial presidency"".\n\nOh, and for the record, the Emancipation Proclamation didn't ""free the slaves""...if you read the text, it only freed the slaves that were in the states in rebellion.  Slavery was still legal in Maryland and other jurisdictions in the Union where it wasn't prohibited. It took an ammendment passed in Grant's administration to fully abolish slavery in the US.  By today's standards, Lincoln and most of his generals and cabinet would be considered racists.  Again...he was a man of his time."

"Right and Left are convenient shorthand for ideological tendencies.  \n\nIn different countries, the actual policy positions of that country's Right and Left wings will vary.  But in general, the Left is more progressive (what critics call ""liberal"") and the Right is more conservative (what critics call ""reactionary"").  What does that mean? Progessives generally favor social policies that promote social equality (more even distribution of wealth & power among citizens), broader social freedoms but more limited economic freedoms (in the US, for the rights of minorities and women, but against ""corporate power""), and foreign policy based on diplomacy.  Conservatives generally favor social policies that promote social inequality (greater disparities between wealthy and poor), more limited social freedoms but broader economic freedoms (in the US, against same-sex marriage & women's reproductive rights, but for strong property rights for those with property), and foreign policy based on military supremacy.  In most countries, the Left is closely tied to the labor unions, to minority advocacy groups, to the women's movements, and to students; the Right is closely tied to majority religious organizations, to the dominant racial group, and to big business.  \n\nLeft and Right are relative terms, and they change over time.  In the 1990s, US President Bill Clinton was criticized as an ultra-leftist for attempting to create single-payer health coverage for all Americans.  Yet just two decades before, ultra-Rightist US President Richard M. Nixon had suggested the exact same policy reforms.  The USA had moved so significantly to the Right as a country in those two decades that what had been politically viable for a right-wing Republican was now too leftist for a centrist Democrat.  \n\nIn the USA, the Right today is dominated by the dual interests of social conservatives (Christian extremist groups) and fiscal conservatives (Big Business).  The Left is not dominated by any one group, but is a loose and often ineffectual coalition of many diverse interests including feminists, environmentalists, what remains of the US labor movement, and ethnic and sexual minority action groups.  In the 21st century the Left has failed utterly to take power in America, and the Right has failed utterly, having taken power, to govern effectively.  \n\nHope this helps."
The federal govenment made 17 billion in gasoline taxes last quarter. how about they roll back that 18.9 cent tax.\nbtw, that 17 billion is just from Exxonmobil who recorded a 8 billion profit. who's doing the gouging?\n\nTo Chad: Our gas is cheapest because our outrageous taxes on it aren't as outrageous as the rest of the world. And referring to americans as though you werent one doesn't make you smarter or enlightened. in fact you come off like a whiner.

That's a very touchy subject for me.\n\nI am currently in the armed forces (Army), i have have seen what you've said to be true, you're a hero until your done then the government turns its back on you and sticks you in a sub rate VA hospital with sub-par care.\n\nIf you want to know the best way to support your neighbor i will give you some hints. \n\n1. Always give him the proper respect and courtesy you would expect, believe me he expects it more (it may sound selfish but he deserves it)\n\n2. Ask him about his war stories, most vets who aren't to torn up or have PTSD will bore you for hours with their war stories. Please just listen, nothing makes a vet feel better than telling old war stories. I promise if you take the time to listen he'll be grateful and you'll be amazed.\n\n3. And if you feel the need above all of that..... volunteer, i work at Walter reed, that's where i drill, as a matter of fact i have a drill this coming weekend.

"The LEGAL reason is because it is against the law.   The question of why it is against the law cannot be answered if you do not let the answerer cite moral or religious reasons -- most criminal statutes and many civil statutes are ultikately based or moral reasons, and morality for many has ties to religion.\n\nThere are policy reasons which go beyond simple moral reasons -- the laws of our society (laws of property ownership, inheritance, parental rights, marital property, etc.) are structured on the assumption that only two people are involved in a marriage.  Allowing plural marriage creates situations which the law cannot handle.  \n\nThere are also more sociological reasons -- in practice, much plural marriage occurs when the women are very young, and it might reasonably be determined that exploitation and coercion are involved more often than free choice.  \n\nBut morality is behind all questions of ""Should"" or ""Should Not."""

He attacked our financial center and has involved us in a ""war without end"" against terrorism, bleeding the Federal Reserve dry."

"Police work under the clause of ""good faith"". They make a good faith effort to record the events as they are reported and what the officer observes.\n\nEveryone makes mistakes and everyone perceives things differently, including police officers. Officers are not exempt from having a bad day or missing things.\n\nPeople sue departments all the time, officers get paid time and 1/2 for court time. The officer doesn't usually have to pay out any fines because they are covered through (usually) a statewide insurance program as an individual (Like CLEAT in Texas) and municipalities have the same sort of insurance. Since the one you were dealing with was Highway Patrol.. they get a LOT more latitude in what they can do because they are presumed to have more training and experience than your regular city officer. You'd be fighting an uphill battle and the State won't settle a case such as this out of court. In my opinion. Good luck!"

Huh?
Of course the Patriot act, but look who is behind that act and you will find none other than America's biggest threat; George W. Bush.\n\nAny die hard Bush fans out there doesn't have to bother calling me a liberal, I am a true Independent and can't stand either extreme side in politics.  I walk with my eyes wide open, I do my own thinking and I don't worry about having to tote a party line and argue for a certain platform.
"It's a good thing you don't want just a one or two line response; it's never quite that easy.\n\nFirst, it comes from a sense on the part of al-Qaeda that the U.S. is the ""Great Satan.""  What initially set these guys off was when the U.S. deployed to Saudi Arabia to fight Iraq in 1991.  The mudjaheddin believed they should be the ones fighting the Iraqis -forgetting that most of their weapons & support came from the U.S. anyway.  Being passed over in favor of the U.S. was a big irritant.\n\nSo, because of what amounts to a huge inferiority complex, they felt (and still feel) the need to hurt the U.S.  After the 1993 World Trade Center bombings, the disaster in Mogadishu, the 1998 embassy attacks in Africa, and the USS Cole attack, they figured the U.S. didn't have the guts to use force against them, beyond firing a couple of cruise missiles which may or may not have done anything serious besides blow up an aspirin factory in Sudan.\n\nThe Clinton administration didn't do anything to disabuse them of this notion; to their credit, mustering the kind of support needed would have been difficult in general, and impossible under his key supporters.  After several years of planning, 19 terrorists hijacked four airliners, and we all know the rest.\n\nPart of this was hoping that the U.S. would invade Afghanistan and then al-Qaeda could somehow cause the country's collapse.  Why did they think this?  Because, less than two years after the end of the Soviet occupation, the Soviet Union collapsed.  Any serious student of international relations knows, of course, that such thinking is, to say the least, deeply flawed, but that's what they thought.  Al-Qaeda also believed that we would deploy tanks & infantry and do what the Soviets did, assuming, of course, we would even have the will to fight, which he didn't believe we had.  So, what did happen came as a major surprise.\n\nHonestly, if anyone thinks that someone else caused 9/11, they're crazy.  Al-Qaeda did it after failing to blow it up in 1993."
"This is a simple equation. Bush wants oil. Iraq has oil. Bush wants Iraq. Bush attacks Iraq with a stupid excuse. I mean not only he didn't pay attention to what the UN told him but also he lied to the US and the world. I mean at least he should have had the ""decency"" to plant those bombs he said he was looking for, instead he took us all for retarded. ""Oh, nevermind the rest of the world, they still think I'm actually looking for bombs, poor bastards"""

"In adition to your project on the Rwandan genocide you may want to research the genocide in Burundi.  In Rwandi it was the Hutu's killing the Tutsi's and in Burundi (twenty years earlier) it was the Tutsi's killing the Hutu's.  Interesting tie in for your paper.  A great book to read is Century of Genocide second edition.  Also there is another book, I forget the exact title, but it's something like ""We regret to inform you that tomorrow we will be killed along with our families:  stories from rwanda"" or something like that.  Both excellent books.  Also look on the UN website and do a search for Rwanda."

Clinton was just a very likable guy. I liked the guy and even defended him when he cheated. But people who defend him now are just sheep that are defending him only because he is a Dem, nothing more. It is very hippocritical because these same people accuse Bush supporters of the same thing. I also believe that it was Clinton's corruption and lack of integrity that ruined Gore's run for the White House. But overall, I agree, these supporters are very dumb.

It's because they were all free Americans in New York. It was the South and the plantation owners that wouldn't let go of the Slaves. This what lead to the Civil War, and it was the African American input to the vote. Republicans would say this is false and a lie, but it is, they that tell lies.
"What will happen is he will sit in jail until he can see a judge....

Depending on his record if he has been in and out of jail in the past... The judge may keep him in custody until his hearing... If they feel he is not a ""flight risk"" they will set bail at a high amount...\n\nGood Luck"
The flag must be burned when it becomes unusable or in contact with the ground. There are guidelines for it and it is acceptable to burn under these guidelines. \nI disagree that it acceptable to burn as a form of protest. It is a symbol of your right to protest among a host of other things and as such should be treated with the respect that it deserves. \nYou may not agree with the government, but don't take it out on your constitutional rights as an American and take it out on the flag. That is misplaced aggression. \n\nIf you burn the flag because you hate the country, then hopefully you are burning it in another country that you have adopted as your new home.
"There are certainly no international laws.  The syllabus is set by the awarding body for the qualification you are studying for.

I heard something on a TV show the other day from one of the organizers of the rallies in favor of immigration reforms (to favor the immigrants). This guy said something very smart: He said that just because something is considered to be illegal, it doesn't mean that that it should be considered a crime. Let me explain.  He gave as an example the segregation laws we used to have.  It was illegal for Whites and Blacks to go to the same schools or use the same facilities... but was it right? Eventually, our government understood that the segregation laws weren't good, and the laws were changed. Perhaps we need to make a similar change to immigration laws.
Yes first gentleman is proper, in the case of Hillary it could be former president Clinton, or if she appoints him to a cabinet post it could be sec. of state Clinton or another post perhaps ambassador Clinton. I personally hope that there is a place in government for him, he would be a great Sec. of State. People around the world respect him.

Because these people on here have no idea what they are talking about.  they dont see or care that the mexicans are NOT taking jobs but doing jobs lazy proudful Americans dont want.  Illegals are here because Immigration laws are ridiculous.  People who are poor and desprete to feed their kids cant afford the high cost, or the time it takes to come here to legal way, is this their fault?  NOOO Its the systems fault.  If your kid was starving you had no money, would you not steal to feed them?  Same thing for the illegals people.  YES to immigration reform, make a way to HELP these people get what they need to work here, But you fools need to get INFORMED.  Mexicans ADD to this country weather you like it or not we NEED them.\n\nAll of you who complain and open your big mouths about stuff you know nothing about are the fist to be signed up for cotton duty when the illegals leave.  18 cents a bushal, 16 hour days, 7 days a week.  you want them gone?  Ok then you take their jobs!!  Any takers....I bet not so shut up.\n\nIllegals are NOT eligabile for welfare so stop all the lying.  Without a social security card they are denighed, fack papers took, and they are charged with fraud.\n\n**Illegals DO pay taxes UNLESS they are paid in cash.  You forget some Americans too avoid taxes by being paid in cash, but I see no complaints to that...Illegals who are paid by check pay taxes they just dont get a return....GET INFORMED your comments are false.\n\nP.S.  It is obvious by the lack of intelligance here, that most posters are just wanting something to argue about and not really intrested in the facts.
Yes. It offends me. In my house, we speak English, because my best friend and myself are American. Italian, because my wife is Italian. Or Russian(at least we TRY to), because my friend's wife is from Russia. However, in public, we ALL speak English, and ONLY English. Though my wife has been known to use Italian to curse Spanish speaking Mexicans (or anyone else, for that matter) who have offended her in some way.

The police were initially used to protect those in affluent neigborhoods from disadvantaged folks. My experience has been no different. When I drove a beat up CRX through nice neigborhoods I'd get pulled over for ridiculous reasons. Now that I drive a nice vehicle I've only been pulled over for greatly exceeding the speed limit. In my opinion police officers are rarely around when you need them and ever present when you would like to avoid them.
I don't think it's racist to be against illegal immigration.  Who said that?  Let me at 'em!  I'm against any sort of illegal immigration, and I don't care if the person in question looks like Howdy Doody and talks like Mister Rogers.  We've got too many people clogging up welfare rolls and on fake disability to accept others into this nation, taking  jobs that should be forced on folks leeching up taxpayer money.  Amen.
It would depend on your state.\n\nIn GA for example, only the driver of a car has to give proff of his ID ( hopefully a drivers licence)\n\nAnyone else can merely say they don't have one on them, or merely say no. There is no law in GA anyway that anyone has to provide ID to the police.  They are required to give them their name and birthdate if asked.\n\nOf course being black in a all white area is most likely it.\n\nalso the time of day or night, for example at 3 am, it is alot different than at 3 pm.
I go further back than that (UK). In the late 50's when the British Government were building their first Nuclear Power Stations they boasted that electricity would be so cheap in the 1980's that it would be uneconomical to read meters and send out bills.  But would you ever have believed even 25 years ago that people would be paying prime prices for water now.  In fact it is dearer than petrol over here.

"Illegal immigration cuts into the wages of American workers. \nAccording to Rep. Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.), who is head of the \nCongressional Immigration Reform Caucus,\n \n""Massive immigration of low-skilled, low-wage workers ... \ndepresses wage rates for people who are at the low economic end of the scale. ... \nThe overall effect will be the decline of the living standard of every American, \nor most Americans.""\n\nAccording to TNRIP, the financial cost of this foreign invasion to U.S. taxpayers \nis staggering!

We don't take a comprehensive, humane approach with drug dealers because they are breaking our laws and causing great damage to this country by poisoning our children.

They are taken to a holding cell in the Immigration building, then taken off site to a detention center where they are put in with criminals of all crimes. Then when enough have been gathered together, they send them to the border (of their respected countries) and left there. They are not sent to their individual homes. They wear orange jumpsuits in the detention center and are given their clothes, belongings, and money back when they get to the border. You ARE allowed to take them belongings when they are being detained (such as money and clothing) but you will NOT be able to see them (at least not in the immigration building) If you call and inquire they will give you a time and date that you can talk to them behind glass. They can be bailed out for $5000.00 and given a trial with a judge, but there is no guarantee that the judge will be on their side, they can still be deported. You will get the money back if they attend the court date.

About the only lesson learned from the use of nuclear weapons is they saved about a half million American lives and probably about that many Japanese lives also as the number of casualties would have been tremendously higher if Japan had been invaded. That's the only time they have ever been used.
I doubt Oswald got off a single shot, but I don't really care.\n\nThere are too many people that are still alive that will stop at nothing to stop the real truth from surfacing, so until a few more of them die off, there can be no proper investigation.
I don't think that it will start as a declared war, but as a large act of terrorism, like a chemical attack on the US.  Chemicals are far easier to get and maintain than anthrax or nukes.  Iran will probably attack Israel, Israel will retaliate and the US will be forced into a war because of our alliance with Israel.  If Russia allies herself with Iran and comes to their aid we will have a major problem.

You probably heard that D.C. has a lower rate of death due to firearms. It's a moronic comparison because of all the troops killed by IED, etc. but here you go:\n\n\nIf you consider that there have been an average of 160,000 troops in the Iraq theater of operations during the last 22 months, that gives a firearm death rate of 60 per 100,000. \n\nThe rate in Washington D.C. is 80.6 per 100,000. That means that you are 25% more likely to be shot and killed in our Nation's Capitol, which has some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation, than you are in Iraq.

No, it wasn't. Had the election that produced the PC majority gone another way, we wouldn't have had it then. Had we not have had it then, we might still not have it now.\n\nThe '88 election wasn't so single-minded. Maybe that's what Ontario focused on, but Constitutional matters were important in much of the rest of the country. Also the NDP's amazing success that time 'split the vote' a bit in favour of the PCs. 43.02% of the country voted PC that year - thus 56.98% (a majority) voted against them and thus against Free Trade.

Yes and no.  Yes they can use your name in a story without your permission.  For instance if they got your name from a viable source like court records or public information roles.  \n\nNo if they are citing you as the source of data or information and you did not give them permission.  However a law suit against them is going to cost you more then you would get back.  And you have to show you we're damaged in some way by the use of your name.  Very hard to do; but not impossible.

"We have the right to say whatever we wish to, as long as it does not endanger, slander, or libel others. We cannot allow certain groups to have more ""free speech"" than others. The rules must apply to all equally. We also do not have the right to ""free speech"" when it comes down to national security. Quite frankly, certain things are not to be put out for the public ears to hear.\n\nHowever, this freedom is situational. When we voluntarily choose to work for a company that has rules about ""colorful"" language, we cannot claim our right to free speech if we are fired for violating that rule. We have the ability to give up our right to free speech, but it must be remembered that this is a choice. We cannot make the choice of sacrificing it, and then double back trying to claim the violation of our ""rights"" when we are punnished under the rules we agreed to when we gave up our right."

honestly i think that you aren't going to be able to find an exact # or even a estimate. theta is the hardest thing to do. but if you are looking for a specific case then that shouldn't be hard, but fining a tally of cases is hard especially if you are not working in a law office and have the database they have.a case is easier to find and it will only take five minutes as opposed to a whole life time.

There are plenty of people willing to do that stuff in this country.  Get the people off of welfare and get them to start picking the veggies.  Another problem is that the immigrants do those jobs and get paid little for thier hard work.  Personally I think they should allow who is already here to stay but make the law that anyone else will be deported.  People that are already here and have lives here should not be made to leave.\n\nP. S. I am available to pick veggies but I will not accept less than 8 dollars an hour.  That is hard work.

The whole text of the bill is at the site below. Additions are underlined, while erasures are indicated with a strikethrough. They will go into effect on January 1st, 2007, and changes that had been made previously, including the provision to allow noncustodial parents to deduct time spent with their children from their child support, which were to go into effect in July have been taken out. Aside from that, the bill mainly provides that calculation of child support will involve the income of both parents, not just a percentage of the non-custodial parents' income. Also, the bill that was to come into effect in July said that noncustodial parents could go back to court basically whenever they wanted to try and reduce their payments, but now they must show that there is a substantial change in income or in the needs of the child to have the payments changed.

*Ahem* anyone who tells you that impeachment is removing the Prez from office is resoundingly wrong. \n\nImpeachment is only a sort of review of the president's actions. It is sort of akin to putting the president on trial. He can obviously still retain the position, as Prez Clinton did. Or, he can be thrown out of office, as Nixon almost was. \n\nIf he remains in office, of course he still receives his benefits.

When growing up, did anybody like it when their parents said ""b/c i said so."" Nope!\n\nPeople, I have found, are reluctant to invite controversy, to debate and to use their minds openly and freely.  It's absolutely fine to agree w/ the establishment, but it's also ok to disagree; the people who make the laws are working for us, don't forget that.  These laws are meant for our benefit, to protect us and maintain a stable society - not to keep us opressed and under their submission (yeah, I know it's hard to believe that sometimes).\n\nSo to whom ever reads this and the person who posted this question, I hope that Americans start realizing that 1) the media have their own money/power-making agendas, and delivering truth is a biproduct 2) there are two sides to every story 3) criticizing the status quo is not the equivalent of becoming a rebel anarchist...it's simply using the brain that you were born with."

No.  Think about it for a minute, not from the view of the person killing themselves but from the view of the doctor.  Over 50% of people who see death outside of war have suicidal thoughts.  So if you put a doctor, especially an ER doctor or nurse, who see death already on a day to day basis, in the position of having to kill you or someone else, how would they feel.  The physician's job is to preserve life not end it.  If you start having physicians kill people, it will demoralize them when the one thing they stand (preserving life) is the one thing that they are stabbing in the back.  If physician assisted suicide is legalized, physicians will be influenced by the deaths that they see but also the deaths that they cause.  This will tip them over the edge towards suicide.  Eventually, doctors will be killing doctors who killed doctors who helped people kill themselves.  Had those people not gotten the doctor to help them commit suicide, said doctors would not be going to see other doctors to commit suicide in the first place.  Additionally, the suicidal tendencies typically do not emerge for up to 10-15 years.  The states like oregon that have allowed PAS will not see this result for up to 10 years from now and by the time that they see the result, it will be too late to stop it.
Why do people make these idiot comparisons. Just because you disagree with an American President that has sent troops to a war you disagree with cannot make even the closest comparison to what a tyrannical dictator someone like Saddam Husein is.

Rights do not change for uniformed personnel--all citizens of the United States have equal rights before the law.  Burden of proof lies with prosecution, as always.

"A pure democracy is where every person gets a say in how every part of the government is run.  Like for instance everyone would come together in a town to vote and decide on what would be best for everybody.  It's quite idealistic and can be prone to abuse in this way:\n\nIn a democracy, the ones who are largest and loudest have the most power.  Therefore a whole people could be wiped out if the majority said ""everyone with brown hair must die.""  Also as times goes on, the democracy deteriorates into a dictatorship as the most power pursuing persons gain more and more power over the others.  A classic example is the deterioration from Lenin's Communism to Stalin's dictatorship later on.  It's the closest thing to a pure democracy that has existed as of late.\n\nAs for a Democratic Republic well that's what we have.  It's democratic because we vote for whose in office.  It's a Republic because it has the legislative, judicial, and executive branch."
one day would not do it. and just postponing the day you fill up wont do it either.  it won't affect the bottom line.\n\nit's possible if a noticable segment of Americans stopped driving their cars for a week (not using gas would affect the bottom line) and used feet, bikes, public trans (it will be running anyway), then, just maybe the big oil CEO's and OPEC would notice.\n\nAs for who is to blame, this is a two parter.\nFirst it's the tight clique that exists between big oil, politicians and 'friendly' Arab nations.\nBut perhaps the biggest to blame are the American people for being so apathetic that they allowed this to happen by not voting or even paying attention to the corruption going on in Washington,DC and being to lazy to walk down to the corner market. Maybe this is also tied to the obesity problem, but that's another ball of wax!

"answer, finance.\n\nThe USA isn't a factual democracy. Its a corporate oligarchy, meaning rule by the few and in this case, by those who have the money.\n\nIf you doubt this, why is it only rich white men get to even run? Why can't ralph nader get a fair shake? There isn o real democracy. Considering that the elections are rigged,\neven the appearance of democracy is fraudulent.

In the last election, that means that we got to vote for skull and bones satanic human sacrifice death cult member A or B. Both Bush and Kerry are members of a satanic\nsacrificial Cult, ""the Skull and Bones"" secret society.\nThats not a choice, its satanic evil no matter what you pick.\n\nBecause money also owns the media, and in particular republcians own most of the media, the further problem is\nthat money determines what ideas get aired.

"Both parties are prone to overspending because of the nature of our political system. However, the Bush era has certainly made it difficult for a rational person to see the Republicans as fiscally conservative. \nI guess as long as they try to keep taxes low and disregard the impact on the deficit, they think they are conservative.\nThey can still point their fingers at the ""tax and spend"" liberals who want to have a better balance between revenues and expenditures. For my money, I'd rather raise taxes than run up the kind of deficit we now have.\nIt's also the case that Republicans in general do not mind spending on the military and on corporate aid. They just don't like the evil ""social"" programs. Objectively, the rich have gotten richer during Bush's reign, and that seems quite okay with the Republicans."

"I believe you are asking about the legal concept of Eminent Domain:  \n\nEminent domain (US), compulsory purchase (United Kingdom, New Zealand), compulsory acquisition (Australia) or expropriation (Canada, South Africa) in common law legal systems is the lawful power of the state to expropriate private property without the owner's consent, either for its own use or on behalf of a third party. The term eminent domain is used primarily in the United States, where the term was derived in the mid-19th century from a legal treatise written by the Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius in 1625. The term compulsory purchase, also originating in the mid-19th Century, is used primarily in England and Wales, and other jurisdictions that follow the principles of English law. Originally, the power of eminent domain was assumed to arise from natural law as an inherent power of the sovereign.\n\nGovernments most commonly use the power of eminent domain when the acquisition of real property is necessary for the completion of a public project such as a road, and the owner of the required property is unwilling to negotiate a price for its sale. In many jurisdictions the power of eminent domain is tempered with a right that just compensation be made for the appropriation.\n\nSome coined the term expropriation to refer to ""appropriation"" under eminent domain law, and may especially be used with regard to cases where no compensation is made for the confiscated property. Examples include the 1960 Cuban expropriation of property held by U.S. citizens, following a breakdown in economic and diplomatic relations between the Eisenhower Administration and the Cuban government under Fidel Castro. U.S. nationals and corporations held vast amounts of Cuba's prime real-estate. Cuban authorities offered just compensation for US properties, as they had successfully done for Spanish, British and French properties when they nationalized private property in Cuba, for the common good. However, U.S. authorities refused, adhering to the notion that those properties are still privately owned by U.S. interests forty five years later. This is in direct contrast with recent rulings by the US Supreme Court which allows a corporation to displace a private citizen from his/her realty, if the corporate development is considered to be in the best interest of the municipality.\n\nThe term ""condemnation"" is used to describe the act of a government exercising its authority of eminent domain. It is not to be confused with the term of the same name that describes the legal process whereby real property, generally a building, is deemed legally unfit for habitation due to its physical defects. Condemnation via eminent domain indicates the government is taking the property; usually, the only thing that remains to be decided is the amount of just compensation. Condemnation of buildings on grounds of health and safety hazards or gross zoning violation usually does not deprive the owner of the property condemned but requires the owner to rectify the offending situation.\n\nThe exercise of eminent domain is not limited merely to real property. Governments may also condemn the value in a contract such as a franchise agreement (which is why many franchise agreements will stipulate that in condemnation proceedings, the franchise itself has no value)."
Depends on where you live. In Washington state, if you are 3 years behind on your taxes the state forecloses on the property and you lose it. Why don't you check with your state and find out? That way you'll KNOW.
I'd recommend joining the military (marines?) serve thre for a while to build up skills and credibility and then apply.
"LOL. Yep, they probably would! I am a democrat, I live in Texas so I have to deal with a helluva lot of dumba$$ repubs at work. I can tell you from experience that most if not all republicans would in fact vote for anyone who fed them the kind of crap they need to hear about ""smokin out terrr'st's"" and all that ridiculous stuff. They have no morals and no minds of their own. And uh... as far as I am concerned they already voted for satan when they voted for Dick!"
Great news. America and Britain can sort it out but we wont because every one accuses of war mongering.
If you want to fight for Iraqi freedom, become a citizen of Iraq and fight for it.  We don't need to save the whole world, it's a task with no end, except our own.  We're a great country, but we're not invincible.  I care about the troops.  I'm glad we have people out there willing to put their lives on the line.  But they shouldn't have to put their lives on the line for any other country.  \n\nNot to mention, Iraqi freedom is not why we went to war if you recall.
I have to agree with Blue Sky. I just finished a 30 year sentence for armed robbery, and during that period of time I studied alot of criminal law and prisoners rights literature. There are alot of innocent people serving time in prison for crimes they didn't commit. A number of them were freed right off of death row. I think it was the governor of Illinois who not too long ago put a moratorium on executions after he was forced to pardon a fairly large number of obviously innocent prisoners on death row.
why pandas are endangered?\n\n1.Low reproductive rate— Pandas like to be by themselves most of the year, and they have a very short breeding season when a male will look for a female to mate with. Females give birth to one or two cubs, which are very dependent on their mothers during the first few years of life. In the wild, mother pandas will care for only one of the young. In panda facilities in China, keepers help to hand raise any twin cubs. One baby is left with the mother and the keepers switch the twins every few days so each one gets care and milk directly from the mother.\n\n\n2.Bamboo shortages— When bamboo plants reach maturity, they flower and produce seeds, and then the mature plant dies. The seeds grow slowly into plants large enough for pandas to eat. Giant pandas can eat 25 different types of bamboo, but they usually eat only the 4 or 5 kinds that grow in their home range. The unusual thing about bamboo is that all of the plants of one species growing in an area will bloom and die at the same time. When those plants die, pandas move to another area. But now, with humans taking up much of the panda’s habitat, pandas are often unable to move to another area and may face starvation. \n\n3.Habitat destruction— China has more than one billion people. As people build more cities and farms and use more natural resources, giant pandas lose their homes.\n\n4.Hunting— When hunters set snares for other animals, like musk deer, the traps often kill pandas instead

To answer you question against, but I do not believe that the government has any right to legislate morality. They should stay the hell out of it. It is something that should be handled through education and church. I see no reason to pass any laws against it at all.

I went to prison for ten years.  You can get a job in the kitchen washing dishes if you like.  You'll earn about 30 cents an hour and get out quicker for good behavior.
as an american, i think the secret behind america being a super power is that this status is an illusion.  the foundation underneath america's status as a super power is fragile and crumbling.  it's an image, nothing more.  an image that unfortunately likes to throw its weight around and hurt others who they don't like.  at my school we called that a bully and bully's ended up getting put on their butts and shown for what they really were.  america is having its time to bask in the glory, but i think that's fading fast.\n\nkinda like a person who parades themselves around as being rich and powerful but in reality are dirt poor, in serious debt and one slip up away from having the entire illusion yanked from underneath them.

the house of cards that this country has become is ready to tumble and the continued loss of manufacturing and production of food is putting us in the same position that destroyed Rome.  The disrespect shown to us by Europe, Russia and even China reflects our weakness.  Today the media controls too much and steers us down the path of destruction.  The old buy American position should be given more attention and the big conglomerate multinational companies need to be controlled instead of controlling us.\nI'm not a socialist but the people need to get the congress to think of us instead of themselves and do something positive like tariff the Chinese goods that are bleeding us dry and also make the auto companies produce more fuel efficient cars and also the multi fuel models at a price the little guy can afford.  Government tax credits for automotive energy cars could put some drive in the move from oil dependency.

"President Bush siding up with a Dictator and parading the man around America alone is a travesty. Dr. Wang seems to be the only one at that press conference that had any sense. Why wasn't President Bush asking this man to stop the killings is my question? Bush is so wishy-washy about his Republican agendas, about freedom and Spirituality. The genocide of Communist China makes Saddam and Bin Laden look like Gandhi and Martin Luther King. This constant flip-flopping in front of Americas face is getting real old. I don't think her comment was out of line according to the Evangelist Republican Gestapo tactics on Americans. One killer is good, and other killers are our friends. The Lord Jesus says killing is a sin, and I am going with that theory all the way. ""Freedom of Speech"" is being destroyed with this administration, and all Americans should stand up and take notice."

I think a lot of it being legal depends on the tobacco companies. It's simply competition for them if weed is sold legally. And since they have so much lobbying power it would be hard.\n\nBut I somewhat agree with you on this one. People will smoke weed regardless if it's legal or not, so why not take control of it and legalize it and make them pay for it and tax it?

Relatively speaking, India has very few natural resources with which they can trade. For example, they have no oil or valuable minerals. They have way too many people in a very concentrated spot. Fortunately, the internet came along and is beginning to harvest their greatest resource - the intelligence of their people. India has simply had very little infastructure and never had the capital it needs to build it. Ironically, this lack of infstrutcure may now be an advantage because they can build everythiing from the ground up while learning from the mistakes of others. I think that in the end, India will be the new super power. But, in the meantime, know that it's one thing to turn around the economy of 250 million people who have plenty of resources... it's another to turn around the economy of 1.3 billion with no natural resources.
I hope so because it is wrong to come to America and take jobs away from us...even if they are making less than we are
You can go into a pub and when the barman says 'Would you like a drink?' you can reply 'It's OK, I've got one ear.'
"No, no. I'm a lawyer and remember this from my Wills & Trusts class :)  Here you go: It means that the person who is DECEASED (the dead peerson) directs YOU to pay his/her ""just debts""- that is, the debts that they owe out of THEIR money- NOT yours. If anything, an executrix gets a small percentage of the total estate! My friend got 3% of a $500,000 estate when her mother died last year- about $13,000. So, again, this means you pay the dead person's debts with THEIR money before the gifts in the will are passed to the heirs. This prevents a dead person from forgetting about their financial responsibilities- right? :) Hope that helps!"

Both Chief of nothing and navyav8r are correct. The review board is one of the hardest parts of the qualification process. the questions can be as simple as drawing a diagram to telling the members hpw to take a molecule of water from the ocean and breath it in as air. The board usually lasts several hours but I have seen a few that lasted days. If he fails than he will be allowed to reboard after studying things that he really messed up on. Something that navyav8r was not correct about is that on this board the members do not review the comments made by the boardees supervisors. Once he passes the board he will be qualified submarines which is a great honor and should instill a large amount of pride in his accomplishment.\nSTS2/SS Kris

LMFAO at MAZUNGODEMISIPI's Answer\n\n\nDear Mr.President \n  \nPosted by The Watchdog - April 6th, 2006 \nDavid M. Bresnahan \nApril 1, 2006 \nNewsWithViews.com \n\nDear President Bush: \n\nI’m about to plan a little trip with my family and extended family, and I would like to ask you to assist me. I’m going to walk across the border from the U.S. into Mexico, and I need to make a few arrangements. I know you can help with this. \n\nI plan to skip all the legal stuff like visas, passports, immigration quotas and laws.I’m sure they handle those things the same way you do here. \n\nSo, would you mind telling your buddy, President Vicente Fox, that I’m on my way over? Please let him know that I will be expecting the following: \n\n1. Free medical care for my entire family. \n2. English-speaking government bureaucrats for all services I might need, whether I use them or not. \n3. All government forms need to be printed in English. \n4. I want my kids to be taught by English-speaking teachers. \n5. Schools need to include classes on American culture and history. \n6. I want my kids to see the American flag flying on the top of the flag pole at their school with the Mexican flag flying lower down. \n7. Please plan to feed my kids at school for both breakfast and lunch. \n8. I will need a local Mexican driver’s license so I can get easy access to government services. \n9. I do not plan to have any car insurance, and I won’t make any effort to learn local traffic laws. \n10. In case one of the Mexican police officers does not get the memo from Pres. Fox to leave me alone, please be sure that all police officers speak English. \n11. I plan to fly the U.S. flag from my house top, put flag decals on my car, and have a gigantic celebration on July 4th. I do not want any complaints or negative comments from the locals. \n12. I would also like to have a nice job without paying any taxes, and don’t enforce any labor laws or tax laws. \n13. Please tell all the people in the country to be extremely nice and never say a critical word about me, or about the strain I might place on the economy. \n\nI know this is an easy request because you already do all these things for all the people who come to the U.S. from Mexico. I am sure that Pres. Fox won’t mind returning the favor if you ask him nicely. \n\nThank you so much for your kind help. \n\nSincerely, \n\nDavid M.

The United States was never willing to do what was necessary to end North Vietnamese and world communism help to the Viet Cong insurrection, if we can use World War II as an example. President Johnson was always presented with options that could have truly devastated North Vietnam, but it would have amounted to the amount of civilian casualties that he simply was not willing to take responsibility for. He could have flooded much of North Vietnam like the USAF flooded the Rhine valley. He was never willing to strike the most important targets because they were very likely to have Russian advisors present, and he was not willing to start World War III.\n\nNo American administration was willing to really confront the problem of the corruption in the South Vietnamese leadership. While the USAF was obliterating the Ho Chi Minh trail, the ARVN leadership was selling war material to the Viet Cong. The ARVN leadership was fleecing their own people and putting them into relocation camps not to protect them but to take their land.\n\nPresident Nixon was often using action in the Vietnam war as cover for his domestic problems, as stated in an interview with Pat Buchanan. He was willing to make an uneven peace in 1973 to get peoples' minds off of other problems.\n\nThe war was not lost by the soldiers, it was lost by the politicians in Washington and in Saigon.

It usually depends on you.  The fastest way to get your child back is to do what they ask of you.  Goals of most CPS is permanancy which means they want the most permanent place and usually with family.  If you do whatever they ask you (drug tests, treatment, classes) you should get the child back.  Do whatever you have to do to prove yourself to them.  If it has been a while and they still have custody somewhere else and have closed the case, you can petition the court on your own.  Just be ready to show the judge you changed.  If you have not done anything to try before now and it has been a while, it could be too late.  Just remember it is your child.  DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO.

Like many parts of the American political system, the idea of a cabinet was borrowed from Great Britain. Hundreds of years ago, the word cabinet referred to a small room, no bigger than a cabinet, that was located near the private rooms of the king or queen. The monarch's advisors would be brought to the cabinet for confidential discussions about the empire. The most trusted advisors visited the cabinet most often. They came to be called the cabinet counsel, or simply, the cabinet

Republicans are most often associated with conservative morals and values.\n\nThis means that:\nAbortion is bad\nGay Marriage is wrong\nSocial Security & Medicare should be privatized etc...\n\n\nOne outstanding difference between the mind-set and political ideals of the Republican Party and that of the Democratic Party is that the Republican Party tends to more heavily emphasize the idea that societal health is rooted in personal responsibility and actions. This emphasis is reflected in an inclination to trust markets to optimize outcomes, rather than government mandates.

"That's a pretty heavy statement...""the Peruvian government is flooding our streets with cocaine"". By the way, Colombia produces more cocaine than Peru, so maybe their government is doing it too?  Most of the cocaine produced in Peru is financed by the major Colombian cartels, that doesn't mean the Colombian government endorses drug trafficking.\n\nAnyway, Peru's national products are copper, silver, gold, petroleum, timber, fish, iron ore, coal, phosphate, potash, hydro power, natural gas, coffee, cotton, sugarcane, rice, potatoes, corn, plantains, grapes, oranges, coca; poultry, beef, dairy products; fish.  As you can see, cocaine is not part of the list.\n\nAs someone already said, the problem is more complex than that. Yes, there are some Peruvian government officials involved in drug trafficking, as well as there are American officials involved too.  But to say that the government of Peru is directly involved in the production and trafficking of cocaine is completely erroneous."

I dont believe that the video represents the illegal immigrant population in the US, but I do think that the people SPEAKING on the video are supremicists and are spreading hate, which I do not approve of. No illegal immigrants that I know say that this is THEIR land, they just want to be able to work here without being treated badly or being sent home.
Yes, monkeys have law.\n\nThe alpha monkey (usually male) sets the rules. The group goes where he says and he get's to eat first and has first pick of the females. His law stands until a different male usurps him. \n\nJust like Saddams law ruled Iraq until the George W. (a smarter monkey?) came along.\n\n'nuff said.
Well you need money for a plane ticket, if you head to Canada, they don't turn anyone away at their borders...\n\nOther than that, to move without money, you would have to have  obtain another job in another country that will sponsor you and pay for your moving cost...\n\nHmm.. maybe find a sugar daddy overseas...??

Answer #1 shows why the U.S. is sooooooo screwed up.  Most people couldn't tell you 10 things that are in the Constitution.\n\nAnswer #2 is correct.
There are many individuals, legal and illegal, who are out for whatever they can get.  They want to sit home and watch their cable TV (paid for by the taxpayers) drinking beer and eating chips.  They are lazy and have learned how to work the system.
"Because the phrases, ""Israel is nearing annihilation"" and ""We will cut off the hand of the aggressor"" or even ""Was there really a Nazi Holocaust at all?"" don't qualify as peaceful on these shores."
"No he won't be impeached.  You spend too much time on the internet or listening to talk radio.  Why don't you just look up what is really going on and stop paying attention to the rhetoric?\n\nThe person above is wrong.  If Bush is impeached (and he won't be), Cheney will not become president.  Bush will stay president, because he will be found ""not guilty."""

"The issue is not the Mexicans, it's the illegal immigrants comining into the USA via the Mexican BORDER.Illegally crossing the border is a FEDERAL offense, a felony. - The issue is ILLEGAL immigrants, not LEGAL immigrants -They are hired by businesses in our country, the businesses should be prosecuted for hiring illegals \n-They pay lower wages to the illegal immigrants than they once paid the American worker, thus American worker wages fall -Americans would do the jobs at the fair wage the businesses formerly paid them. -There is no job they do that Americans won't do. When they say they work harder than Americans, that is a racist remark. Plus, Americans worked to build and keep this land, we didn't run to another country crying with our hand held out. We have stamina and PRIDE. -Illegal immigrants abuse our govrnment assistance programs that were meant for the citizens of the USA when they fall on hard times, not illegal immigrants\n-They can't afford doctors so they glut the ER of hospitals to seek medical care -Our forefathers built this country. Some were illegal, that was then, this is now. We now have immigration laws that are to be abided by, we didn't then\n-Our country fought the Mexican-American war and WON, then paid $15 million dollars for that land and for the privilege of whooping the Mexicans a$$e$ -The illegal immigrant worker is only a tip of the iceberg of problems to come, brought by the illegals coming across the border. They want ""conquista"" (reconquor), they'll tell you that. They want that land we whooped their butts for, they can't accept defeat. -They flew their flags in protest of the USA, the very country that has been putting food on their table -they bring in their drugs and gangs.\n-They disrespect the people of the USA and our leaders. They should be deported and the sooner the better. Our borders should be tightened up and patrolled with armed guards. America needs to wake up. You may or may not agree with me, but be sure you know ALL the reasons for wanting the illegals OUT."
"If you think it's ""so horrible"" then leave this country. Obviously you are benefiting in some way from being here, otherwise, you would have been gone a long time ago."
"The regional progressive primary is definitely a better idea than ONE national primary.  The purely national approach would make it impossible for anyone to compete but those who could spend the big bucks immediately in the major population centers (big states like California, New York), and would very much cut against the historic concern --still seen in the much misunderstood and unfarily maligned Electoral College-- of allowing various states and regions to have a say in the selection of the President, not just big population centers.\n\nAnother note -- the criticism of our 'founding fathers' for the part and primary system is rather offbase.  The Constitution had NOTHING about parties, and most of our leaders initially railed AGAINST the formation of specific parties... but it still happened in the 1790s, and proved a more constuctive way to resolve issues than the focus on personalities that happened when there was not a functioning two-pary system (which could get quite personal and bitter, as both John Adams and his son found out).  \n\nAs for the whole primary system, that is later still, after the convention system was in place. (The first 'party convention' --with delegates from the various states-- was held by the newly organized ""Democratic"" party that made Andrew Jackson their, ultimately successful, candidate for President in 1828.)"
Yes. Currently it is the only one. Russia is no more a superpower. Japan is not one either. India and China hope to be the superpowers someday, but currently they are not.\n\nAmerica has money, it has power and it attracts most resourceful people too...the most intelligent people from all over the world migrate to America every year.\n\nAmerica is certianly a superpower and as of now, the only one.

Because most Democrats are very eager to play the 'race card' if you will.  It's been my observation that's it's much easier for people to blame prejudice instead of taking responsibility for their own failings.  This applies to more than one race, religion or sex.  Nobody wants to take responsibility for themselves anymore.\n\nPS: The NAACP is one of the most racist organizations in the country.
it would certainly be interesting to see how old Dubya would sort that one out, except it wouldnt be him of course it would the hand up his back that is controlling him, that would make all the decisions.
English has always been the official language in the USA. Up until 10 or 15 years ago all immigrants were required to learn some English and attend free high school night courses in order to get citizenship. And were very happy to do so, cause they were proud and committed to become an American. Most Legal immigrants who went threw the proper channels to get here still are.\n\nIf you were over the age of 20 you would know that because every single paper and product sold here was written in nothing but English. Spanish language classes were a high school elective.\n\nAs for petty spelling and grammer remarks, it is usually a sign that the person doesn't have a leg to stand on. Apparently your post was clear enough for them to reply to. Showing you have a firm grasp and command of the language, with no claims to being a English proffesor to it.
The price probably won't get that high.\n\n1) Eventually Iraq's oil infrastructure will be up and running, which will cushion the market.\n\n2) Demand has to level off eventually. There just isn't enough capital to sustain prices even where they are now. People will have to find ways to conserve/alternate energy. That will mean prices level off.\n\n3) The big dogs like US, PRC, and Russia have enough soft power to lean on OPEC nations to increase production. They don't have to invade, they just have to threaten them with embargos and the like.\n\nEven if those three things don't do the trick, invasion won't actually help much. It's cheaper to pay the Saudi royal family a cut off the top than to subdue a bunch of very irritated Arabs wish kalashnikovs and plastic explosive.

I don't know if it is a drunkenness about them, but they sure have a lot of hatred for Democrats, and I think that forgetting that we are all Americans, is blinding them seriously. There cruelty wont be forgotten anytime soon that is for sure.
"If it is just an artists interpretation, they have the freedom to do it.  If it is an ""official"" version, then it is completely wrong.\n\nThis is the United States.  WE ARE AMERICANS.

We are not 'Mexican Americans', 'African Americans', 'European Americans', Antartic Americans', etc. So stop dividing this country with your labels."
"From my recollection, people who fail the vision part of the driving exam get told to see an eye doctor.  It is up to the doctor to determine whether the problem is vision-related or cognitive, and whether it ought to keep the person from driving.\n\nIn the case of people who are legally blind or otherwise can't drive, the government does issue non-driver identification cards that can be used like a driver's licence for ID, but not for driving.\n\nIf the eye doctor feels a person failed the vision part of the driving exam because of a temporary problem (an eye infection that affected vision temporarily, for instance), they can write out a pass that basically says ""This person passed the exam at my office"" for them to bring back to the DMV.  Most of the time, though, it's left up to the doctor to explain to the 70-year-old why their eyesight is too bad for them to drive anymore."
"IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BIN LADEN!!  With every poll showing majorities of Americans both fed up with Bush's war against Iraq and convinced that Bush's invasion of Iraq has made Americans less safe, the White House moron proposes to start another war by attacking Iran. VP Cheney has already ordered the U.S. Strategic Command come up with plans to strike Iran with tactical nuclear weapons.The Bush administration is insane. If the American people do not decapitate it by demanding Bush's impeachment, the Bush administration will bring about Armageddon. This may please some Christian evangelicals conned by Rapture predictions, but World War III will please no one else.What few people today actually discuss is this; just how bad would it be if Iran manages in a few years to create a primitive nuclear weapon or two? Iran has nuclear powers Pakistan and India to its east, and a hostile nuclear Israel to its west. Israel has more nuclear weapons per capita than any nation in the world, and any reading of her history suggests she would not be loath to use them if she felt threatened. Iran's leaders are mean screwballs these days, but not insane; any leader of Iran would know that Israel would destroy their nation and their people should they ever attempt to lob a creaky rivet-popping missile with a warhead of any kind towards Tel Aviv. As to any presumed danger that those nutty Persians will hand over little nukes to ""terrorists""--there are a whole bunch of nations right now who are perfectly capable of doing so anyway. Oh, and by the way, how does the nation with the largest nuclear force of all time, who is the only one in history who has used these weapons, whose current mean and somewhat screwball leaders talk of using ""tactical"" nuclear weapons in their already illegal wars--how does that nation become the one to decide who else gets to join their dandy little club? I say, to our  both parties, lighten up. Iran isn't going to nuke Miami anytime soon."
"Ok,I HAVE said in previous posts that there should be better border security.More agents,camaera's,whatever DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.\nThe only way I can see to solve the current problem with the illegal immigrants is to give them amnesty.And I agree,it is unfair to ppl who have been waiting to come in legally.And I was called all kinds of names when I suggested they be able to come too.And as far as ""resisting the notion that they come in legally"" I know some come legally.And another thing I get alot is that I am only for the Mexicans.That's not true.I want ALL to get amnesty."

Why English so hard for many?  Capitalism is a driver.
After he is gone, if there is damage, you can take him to small claims court for a very small fee.  You don't need a lawyer in small claims court.  All you need is your lease and proof of damage.  In small claims court, the judge will consider the fact that he is on the lease and may likely award you money for the damage he caused.
You friend's mother should really have legal representation to do this correctly. She should try to get one today, or tomorrow morning and see if that person can get a continuance of the proceedings to give the lawyer time to figure out exactly what needs to be done.

"I copied this from the ""best of"" craigslist page, but the message was too important *not* to share.\n \n \n \nProud of your country? Your leader? \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nDate: 2006-03-21, 4:38PM PST\n\n\nI am ashamed. I am ashamed of this President. Aren't you? After watching his press conference today, a sense of shame overtook me. I'm ashamed that he took to the podium today as if he emptied out a container of laughing gas. I'm ashamed of a President who has the temerity to laugh when asked a question about war. I'm ashamed of the whores of the fourth estate who care more about having the honor of being the butt of one of the President's jokes than about exposing the truth to the American people. I'm ashamed that millions of my fellow Americans are so scared and so desperate for leadership that they believe the President's bullshit. \n\nI am ashamed. I'm ashamed of this President, this megalomaniac hellbent on leaving his assprint on the map of the Middle East, no matter how much destruction is wrought and no matter how much blood flows in the streets of lands that never threatened us. I'm ashamed that when I see the American flag waiving, images of flag-draped coffins flash in my mind. I'm ashamed of Freedom's March. Ashamed when I see villages reduced to rubble. Ashamed when I see the tiny little corpses. God, they're so painfully tiny--lined up in a row, little angels wrapped in colorful blankets that starkly contrast against their gray-tinged faces. Ashamed when I see wailing Iraqis slam their hands against plain, unvarnished coffins, over and over, asking ""Why? Is this democracy? Why?"" When I see those image of funerals, of broken families, I want to crawl into my TV, I want to go to them and grab their slumped shoulders and scream ""I'm sorry, good god, I'm so sorry. I want to leave, I want us to leave, believe me. But they won't listen...No one listens anymore."" \n\nI'm ashamed that the word ""massacre"" is even uttered in connection with our actions in Iraq. I'm ashamed it's not just one massacre that is alleged, but two. I'm ashamed it's gotten to the point that I can't even tell this little voice inside of me to shut up, that little voice that says maybe, just maybe it could be true. That the impossible may be plausible. Before this war, I would have rejected such claims outright. But that voice of plausibility is the consequence of those black hoods. It's the consequence of those leashes, those snarling dogs. It's the consequence of those detainees chained to bedframes. Of naked pyramids. Of forced sex acts. Of beatings and blood-streaked floors. \n\nI am ashamed. Ashamed that Justice is no longer blindfolded, but gagged. Ashamed that in America, in AMERICA, I can only protest in ""free speech zones"" the size of postage stamps. Ashamed that by the time I'll take my oath as an officer of the court to support the Constitution, I'll be swearing to uphold a tattered document that has managed to survive over 200 years only to be shredded by this President in less than eight. \n\nI am ashamed. Ashamed that in America, I see bearded men panhandling in the street, holding cardboard signs that read ""U.S. Vet, can't work, need food. God bless."" Ashamed that somewhere, in our America, a grandmother is sitting alone at her kitchen table, crumpled bills clutched in her thin hands, agonizing over the choice before her: medicine for her pain, or food to keep on living. Ashamed that there is a child who will go to sleep tonight on a cot in an orphanage, with no one to read him a story, no one to stroke his hair and kiss him goodnight, because the American Taliban thinks gay Americans can't love, can't parent, can't provide. \n\nI am ashamed of my fellow Americans. Ashamed that they haven't fl"
This is a BIG question.  About 50% of all AIDS patients in North America are homosexuals or bisexuals.  \n\nNaturally, you can do the math to see that a gay person has much higher odds.  However, this disease first moved through the gay community and later to the straight.  So, the number of AIDS patients is not the same data as the number currently getting infected.\n\nTo further complicate things, these stats are drastically different from country to country.\n\n\nBottom line:  \n\n1.  Anal sex if physically more vulnerable to HIV contraction than vaginal.\n\n2.  Permiscuity is a major factor, obviously.  Gay or striaght, be careful who you sleep with.\n\n3.  Straights are catching up, especially in other parts of the world.
The non custodial biological parent of a child has a legal obligation to provide support for that child, regardless of marital status.\nThe only way that niether parent pays support to the other is if they share custody and expenses equally or if the custodial parent is financially well off AND formally declines support.\nYou are correct.\nShe is mistaken.
The Americans with Disability Act is a place to look. Also look at the school's rules about who can participate, and the state rules about what's not allowed as a basis for discrimination.
Yes he is, and he should take his punishment like a man. Matter of fact the whole party is always spouting that off about Liberals whining like baby's, look at Bush himself. Impeach the traitor, and convict him for treason to America.
I highly doubt it.  And if they do, we can always sue them.
I knew they were considering giving him a coin, but I didn't know that it had been approved. I know that when they were talking about it that I suggested putting him on a quarter because he was the best two bit president we ever had.( No that isn't a compliment)
No, no war will start between Iran and Us.
he has screwed up
yeah its a discrace
None unless the will states that you get a percent.
As a congressional candidate, I give you my answer:\n\nYes they are. The Fourth Amendment (and part of our Bill of Rights) states that there shall be no unreasonable search and seizure and that searches must have warrants. US Code also prohibits such wiretapping without a warrant issued by the court. It is ALL illegal that Bush is now doing. Just because he had his attorney general Gonzalez say it is legal--it is not. It would be as if his lawyer said it is now legal to rob banks with a gun. It is still illegal. \nThe FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) authorizes wiretaps and has oversight and accountability. What Bush is doing has no oversight and can easily be abused and is abused and used against innocent Americans. If there is not enough protest, you can be sure that Bush will move on to bigger things.

You're right, the death penalty is not a deterrant.  It is a purely moral issue and an understandable one.  It's not wrong to think people who do horrible things shouldn't get to live out their days, even if it is in prison and I doubt many death penalty abolitionists would be protesting to save Hitler from execution.  However, the problem is in the application.  Some people who do the most horrible things don't get the death penalty, and some who do things that don't rise to the level of horrible do.\n\nI say leave it up to the victim's family.  If the criminal is eligible for the death penalty, let the family decide and let them pull the switch because they are the ones that will have to live with the pain the rest of their lives.\n\nAlso, it is just as expensive to society for someone who is sentenced to death because the State pays for the appeals process, which is automatic and lasts for many years.

This one is a slam dunk.\n\nThe only possible correct answer for most of us is...\nRep. Rick Boucher's 1992 amendment (passed in 1993) to the National Science Foundation charter that allowed business to be conducted on the Internet.\n\nBefore that legislation passed, the internet was like a interstate highway system that did not allow commercial vehicles. Oh, you could drive your car on the highway as long as you were not going to the store, or to work at a private company (unless that company was a government, education, or non-profit contractor), or to purchase or provide a service.\n\nBefore Boucher's legislation passed there was no such thing as Amazon.com, eBay, Google, PayPal, or, for that matter, YAHOO. There was no legal way for these business to exist at all. It was actually ILLEGAL to conduct any for-profit activities on the Internet, including (but not limited to):\n  - buying\n  - selling\n  - advertizing\n  - banking\n  - product support\nIt was of course an unenforceable system. People who flaunted the rules pretty much got away with it. The no-commerce rule really served only to inhibit the development of HONEST commerce.\n\nRick Boucher is pretty much responsible for the Internet community as we know it today. So what political party would an innovative thinker like Rick Boucher belong to? Why, he is a Democrat, of course.
Who would you have to pick on if not a politician?\n\nOh, yeah, that's right...illegal immigrants, gays, Tom Cruise and all the left-wing bleeding heart liberals out there.\n\nI have to agree with you about them lining their pockets and starting crap just to start crap.

"I am sure they are aware but a lot of the immigrants or illegals as some refer to them don't really feel they are breaking the law since they only come here to work to send money to their families and are in no way committing crimes..I think they see it as ""I'm here illegally I'm working a demeaning job with no ladder going up, how can I be hurting the US when it's citizens who are paying me less then minimum wage are benefiting, I am not a criminal here to steal or murder anyone"".\n\nAbove DORK, they run from cops because of the brutality in which they are arrested and treated..Not to mention the money they worked hard for to pay to get over here, they have to somehow manage to stay here long enough to make that up..I am sure the US government would love it if they had alaw against illegal runners so that they the Gov. could get that money to let the undocumented come in but of course that would in turn make them runners..They are just trying to find a way to manage to get to that point legally, and it seems with partcially informed citizens it might happen..I gues you're all for building that mockery of the great wall of china.There was a time in America when everyone was welcomed and never turned away.Remember most of us here in the US are not natives from here we all came from different countries and regions it is how AMERICA was made.."

A Democrat?
No, from what I understand every so often they vote on statehood and usually they are divided in thirds with one third wanting statehood, one third wanting independence and one third preferring to remain a territory.
It depends on which state they both live in. Different states have different ages of consent which usually vary from 16-18. You can find that info on the state's website. It might be legal, but I really don't find it moral. There's a 16 year age gap between the two. The male could be old enough to be her father.
I believe our country is so divided that it will once again be another close race. Republicans are disenfranchised with the Bush administration and Democrats are trying to cater to the conservative voter because of it's powerful force. The smarter of the two political candidates should tout themselves as a moderate rather than a conservative or liberal. Politically, I believe a moderate will win the White House in 2008. Realistically, I belive a Democrat will win the White House in 2008, UNFORTUNATELY.
If there is a real question of whether a law was broken, then the person who broke the law should undergo a trial to determine guilt or innocence. Impeachment is the way the President can be put on trial.\n\nWas the information declassified? Was the declassification proper? Assuming both of the above, did the president (or other executive officer) have the legal authority to declassify the information in the manner it was?\n\nI don't know. But if there is a legitimate question of whether one or more laws were broken, the the trial (impeachment) is appropriate. Otherwise, we're basically saying the people in power can break the laws with impunity, and we're back to a monarchy.

George W. Bush is a multifaceted man.  He is definitely a social conservative--and in that, he and I have absolutely nothing in common--, but he is also not a raging nationalist (and I celebrate the latter, especially with regards to immigration).  He is pro big business, but he is not an economic conservative (his administration's spending is extraordinarily high).  It also is the case that there have been spectacular changes between the two administrations he's lead.  The first four years were dominated by dismal decision-making, war-mongering, deception, terrible self-inflicted damage to the image of the US internationally, foolish foreign policy, etc.  The second Bush administration has been orders of magnitude better on the foreign policy front, with Condoleeza Rice at the helm (now the US is finally learning to talk to leftist governments in Latin America, for example, rather than to shun and isolate them, creating the sort of resentment that doesn't help the US in the long run).\n\nI have cringed at the Supreme Court nominations of Mr. Bush, particularly that of Samuel Alito.  And I am appalled by the reluctance of this administration to set free Gitmo prisoners who have already been tried and found innocent of any wrong-doing.  I think there's much more we will learn (hopefully) about domestic spying, and when all is said and done, History will remember Mr. Bush rather unkindly as a President, given his penchant for secrecy, for engaging in serious violations of the law of the land, and for hypocritical political maneuvers like unclassifying classified documents by issuing orders to *leak* the information to the press.\n\nBut Bush the man seems rather affable, and I cannot bring myself to blame him for everything that has gone wrong with his administration.  He gives me the impression of being somewhat incompetent for the position he holds, of being stubborn to the point of stupidity--like Stephen Colbert said yesterday nigh, the Presiden is a man who believes on Wednesday what he believed on Monday, despite what happened on Tuesday--, and of having selective episodes of compassion--as in the case of illegal immigrants--and responsibility--as was the case when Mr. Bush, to my astonishment and profound delight--came out in support of the Muslim American community, calling on citizens not to make our plight into a religious conflict.

I think the hope is that Iran will implode and the tyrannical, hate mongering government of today will fall to either a coup, forcible revolution or economic disaster before military intervention is necessary.\n\nThe parallels to the doctrine of appeasement of Hitler's regime are indeed frightening. As is the total disregard for the genocide in Sudan. It is sad the developed world has not yet found its moral compass when it comes to human rights.

Politicians always get lots of great benifits, even if they are removed from office for bad bahaviour. It is like all the top CEO's.. they do a crap job and get a multi million dollar payoff.
Democrats, so they can vote, presumably for Democrats.  Why else do you think NY is going to allow illegals to vote in local elections?
Your local newspaper has an community calender listing with lots of non profit groups and organizations listed. (they probably have a website too.)  Also, local radio stations are constantly talking about opportunities to volunteer for a variety of civic activitities.

Not sure how old you are, but I know that there are organizations for every age that can keep you busy doing great things for your community.

I say we keep the illegals who work and send their kids to school. At least they are productive and trying to give their kids a leg up. Deport the scumbag Americans who are capable of working yet stand on street corners with their hand out. And let them take the dirtbags who raise their kids to disrespect their teachers, commit crimes, and soak up welfare rather than get a job.

Pakistan is probably the only country in the world right now with so much at stake in the War Against Terrorism. Please let’s not forget that it is our soldiers who are battling the terrorists in the front lines of Waziristan and Afghan border and dying in the process. The numbers of arrests made by Pakistan has been incredible, well over a thousand so far since 2002. The citizens of this country have had to sacrifice more innocent lives to terrorists over the last five years than were lost in the 9/11 bombing. Despite all these problems, Pakistani people have shown resilience and fortitude and have made a sincere and passionate effort to improve their lives. No matter what the negatives of our country are, as there are with every nation, these facts should not be overlooked and should be appreciated.\n\nOur biggest problem is that the less than 1% of the Pakistanis involved in terrorist activities are giving a totally negative image to the 99.5% remaining population which wants to live in peace and be a part of the global community. \n\nIf you want to analyze Pakistan properly, just think back to all the news stories that have ever been printed or aired on Pakistan and try to cite only one story which mentions this country in a positive light. I can promise you that you will not find any such news article. Now, a logical mind can easily comprehend that a country can't be all bad! Yet, none of the positive aspects ever get portrayed. No one will cite the strong arrest record of this Country. No one will mention the number of Pakistani dead while effectively fighting terrorists in the no-man's land area between Pakistan and Afghanistan. No one will remember that it was Pakistan who fought and won the war against Soviet occupation in Afghanistan. True, the USA supplied weapons and finance but it was Pakistani strategy that won that war as has been recognized by the US Government. \n\nI hope you will look at Pakistan with an open mind and see that Pakistanis are people trying to improve their lot in life as well. We have problems common to third world countries and unfortunately our democratic institutions are not as strong as the majority of us would like them to be. Yet, we are a great country and, God willing, will one day prove our worth to the entire world.
this is more common place than everyone realizes. in custody cases it is almost always brought up at some point. It is one of the most dificult things for a man to defend himself against. the danger here is not that your child be taken away from you but that the child may be taken away from both mother and father. get a lawyer and keep the best interests of your child your first priority. and if you by chance are guilty, admit it and get help, remember your daughter's well being is the most important thing here.
"Yeah, there'd be war.  I think most ""religious"" wars have non-religious causes like ethnic hatred, land disputes, power, and politics.  I mean take a look at the world's major religions; they all preach peace and harmony.  It's the people themselves who distort the religion to fit their own needs.  If it weren't religion, it'd just be some other unifying factor such as race, nationality or ethnicity.  War is caused by something in human nature, not in religion."

"I would check with your local goverment, code enforcement offices and/or officers.  An individual can ""report"" property as abandon.

I think your 100% right on this one.  We all know that this country was founded on immigrants that came over looking for a better life.  But the difference back then was no one gave them a hand out, they worked hard to get things.  They didn't have forms in their language, they didn't get assistance with anything.  They had to adapt, learn the language and make something of themselves.  Now a days they all want it easy.  The government has to make forms in 10 different languages for them, their kids have to be taught in their foreign language, and about the history of the country they left.  If your so interested in teaching them that then why did you leave your country?  We make it too easy for them.  They don't struggle like other cultures that came over in the 1900's and so on.
"I could go on for hours about this one, but my short answer will be ""no as long as you do not hurt others"". Defining ""hurt"" is even more of a task if you ask me."
well yeah men get everything dont they nice lie they tell you. i would almost say just talk to your daughter and tell her the whole story but thats not real fair to her. i would take her to civil court for defimation of character personally and try and get back some of that. and then i would prepare a statement for the court about what has been going on. something like your honor in the past few years (insert the story) all i want is a chance to be a dad again and not a pawn in this womans game the marriage didnt work out but i am still a father and would like the chance to do that. \nthen you can sick your lawyer on her. hire a private eye and all that hold nothing back tear her a new one if you can. i am positive that you can drag her around for a little while just like she did to you. but i understand that you most likly want it to be over with.
Well the first known code of law was created by Hammurabi in a year 1780 BC in Babylon. These law were presumably enforced, because the code talks about crimes and punishments for them.\n\nHowever we can go further and presume that even the cave man enforced laws taboos and traditions, in that case the exact date will be hard to find out.

I live in the USA and I wish there was a quick way to stop Bush. He is insane and very self serving. But there are many, MANY ignorant people in this country that truely beleive the bullshi! that he dishes out. They don't think for themselves and let Bush think for them. That is the biggest problem here.
Hillary is probably right on the mark, Bush's tax cuts to the rich have hurt this country and ruined the economy. He is paying for them by cutting programs for the poor and that is just plain wrong.

He was the brains behind the murder of the Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics. An old time PLO/Fatah gang leader, Abbas (aka Abu Mazen) seeks to destroy Israel through the so-called Staged Plan, i.e. the first stage being to set up a PLO terror state within Israel and use this state as a base to conquer the rest of Israel. \n\nA little known fact about Abbas is that he wrote a book-length doctoral thesis denying the Holocaust, for which he received his Ph.D. from a Russian university. Yes, he actually holds a Ph.D. in denying the Holocaust. The president of Iran can't even match that!
No, I'm afraid not!

Illegal is the opposite of Legal, which I have no problem with. CherokeeRose, and JD, keep up the good work, as we all know, knowledge is power. I'm mad as hell over the whole thing, and know that this is a battle we cannot afford to loose to ILLEGAL ALIENS. Now, Jose, and Chulapanama, one more time...IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH RACE, IT HAS TO DO WITH BEING LEGAL!!! Build a bridge and get over it. We know there is a difference between LEGAL, and ILLEGAL workers. I am educated, a successful business owner, and I am sympathetic to those in need. I have no patience with law breakers, AKA undocumented, illegal aliens, no matter what country they come from. I will not kowtow, to criminals. I will fight to the bloody end for what I believe in.

It was a very direct and deliberate stand against the treaty of Versailles which was made after the of the first world war by the allies to control Germany. It was however, too strict and Germany saw most of it as a slap in the face. But the most significant thing they disliked was the lose of land... a major cause Hitler used to gain German support of World War two. It was also historically important because the rest of the world, particularly the US. chose to nothing about it. Hitler was ignored and allowed to break the treaty in many other ways too, including creating a powerful military nation state.

"One thing to keep in mind is that the ""mainstream media"" whether FOX, MSNBC, CNN, and the TV networks ABC, NBC, CBS, etc., are all owned by about 6 mega-corporations...\n\nand all these corporations are ""for profit"" - which means that their main goal is to keep you watching - watching and hopefully buying what they are selling via commercials. Trust me, their main goal is NOT to inform you about what you need to know WHEN you need to know it...\n\nSo my point here is that there is no real ""liberal"" or ""conservative"" media per se.  Yes, the reporters may tend to be more liberal, but the EDITING decisions are made by the ""suits"", and there are way more conservatives in control at this level.  \n\nWhat you may not realize are the ties the media has to government - and how they work hand in hand to censor the important news you really need to know.\n\nSo the short answer is:  Check out the internet but pay close attention to the source - after a while you will be able to tell when you have reached a credible source or not.  European media has some of the same problems (propagana via corporate control) but they are way ahead of the U.S. when it comes to telling more of the truth - especially about us!  \n\nAn admittedly liberal site http://www.buzzflash.com will give you links to stories all over the world.  But, while they *are* liberal, they are actually linking to the original story in whatever media it was originally reported - so you can read the original story and decide for yourself.  http://www.truthout.org is another similar type site without all the added commentary (editoralizing)...\n\nDo some searches on the web for WHO OWNS THE MEDIA and you'll see for yourself why the media censors your news.\n\nThink about this:  GE makes bombs for the military.  GE also owns NBC.  Now, if you PROFIT from making bombs, what is your motivation to tell the American public the WHOLE truth in advance of a ""war""?  Better to let some of the truth out about fake wars AFTER they have begun.  They aren't going to admit to being war profiteers, but the fact of the matter is that they DO profit from war.  Do the math."

"The general American consensus seems to be negative towards immigrants. I've heard a lot of send them back, keep them out, deny them rights, sort of plans that are not logical, and can't be accomplished, and frankly, seem rather inhumane . I'm not exactly sure what goals we are looking to accomplish with the proposed legislation that the goverment is debating, however I think it won't pass anyway. We seem to be targeting immigrants with the legislation. I'm pretty sure that we should be targeting ""Legal"" Americans who do not seem to be complying with the laws regarding employment of illegal immigrants. Perhaps if there wasn't an established precedent among immigrants, that they could easily enter the country and obtain employment without obtaining all of the proper documantation, and permission, then maybe they wouldn't be so quick to skip the legal process.\nI don't know what the answers are. All I know is that most Americans are of immigrant heritage. The country was built on the premise that all oppressed persons could live freely in America. The melting pot. The world police. We are the folks who want to make a quick buck, and don't seem to have a problem paying illegal immigrants under the table to do do jobs that we Americans, (special breed of priveleged humans that we are) will not do. A large portion of our population would sooner take doantaions from church groups, or take welfare, and food stamps from the goverment than lower themselves by digging ditches, or cleaning toilettes, because we didn't bother to take the free education that we are entitled to, or take the extra time and effort to earn the degrees that would land us a profitable position doing an ""honorable job"". A large portion of folks coming from other countries do not have the same opportunities to turn down jobs and opt to not have a work ethic. A lot of people from other countries come here under horrid conditions for the opportunity to work under horrid conditions for pay that we Americans would not accept even if we were instead working in an air conditioned department store sipping $3 cups of coffee. It seems to me that immigrants desire to provide a better life for their families, while we would like to secure an X-Box 360 or an Ipod for ours. We desire the bling bling of a cool new car, and designer clothes. \nI could be wrong, but it seems to me that we need willing immigrants in order to have all of the things that we want with as little effort as we seem to be able to exert. If that's the case then I don't suppose that we ought to continue the hypocritical banter about sending them back to where they came from, etc. If we ever do actually get to a point where we want to do all of our own work then I guess we'd better crack down on the folks who employ people illegally, rather than deny children of immigrants an education, or arrest church groups for providing help to immigrants. \nI'm afraid that I don't agree with ""the immigration law"" as it does not address the real issues.\nI think that ""the immigration law"" is receiving a lot of media hype at the moment because we're nearing an election year."
Had Gore won the election you would be asking the same question but more desperately.  And a good many of your friends would be out of work, and none would have bought a new home this past year.  We'd all be a lot greater risk to terrorism, crime, unemployment and control of public opinion by the media.\n   Bush has been very badly advised on several issues, he has made mistakes.  But the intentions of the man, decent man I believe, who I insist for all his failings is probably more intelligent than 95-99% of Democratic voters, are good.\n   I would vote for a better man if I could, but none have appeared as candidates for about 30 years now.\n   In any case, what is wrong with the world has little to do with President Bush, all he can do is react to it. Basically the people of the world are too irresponsible, dishonest, partisan, selfish and lazy.  The change that might save us has to start in you.

"Israel gets about $3 billion a year from Washington. The $20 million for the Palestinian Authority will come from a $75 million package of indirect support approved by Congress.Reason #2: Strengthen Israel, Weaken Arabs\nThe Bush administration has a complex relationship with Israel. The president owes his election in large part to Christian conservatives. Christian Zionists, led by Tom DeLay in the House, want to see the State of Israel control all the biblical lands. President Bush is also indebted to AIPAC, the powerful Jewish lobby. AIPAC is staunchly backing the right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who rejects the longstanding policy of ""land-for-peace."" In addition, the neoconservatives who dominate Bush's foreign policy architecture view negotiations with Arafat and the PLO to be morally equivalent to Chamberlain negotiating with Hitler in Munich!"

Well........... it began with the fall of Constatinople to the Turks in the 15th C.  Didn't Greece have to rebel against the Ottoman Empire in the 19th C to regain their independant sovereignty ?

I won't hide it from you, being a cop is one of the most stressful jobs there is. Everybody seems to dislike you and resent you, even the law abiding people. (People always want to be the exception to the rule when they are in a hurry.) \n\nIt is a dangerous job at times, obviously. In addition to the risk of being injured on the job by a criminal, the sad part is that there have been cases where cops have shot other cops, even their partners, by accident. So the suicide rate for cops is very high as well. It is an unfortunate but unavoidable fact that when a cop gets depresssed and the pressure gets to him, he has his sidearm right there. \n\nHaving said that, it can be a very fulfilling career. You must be prepared to make sacrifices, sometimes very personal ones, giving up time and privacy and not being with your family at times when you would most wish to be. \n\nYet you can also receive rewards, not financial ones, the likes of which you will find nowhere else. Saving lives, preventing crimes when possible, stopping crimes when necessary, helping people-- these are the rewards. It is not for everybody, and there is no shame for those who try and find they are not cut out for it. (That is what the police academy is for.) But for some, there is nothing better than being a police officer. Good luck! We need more people like you.

That is truly a great letter and I enjoyed reading the portion that you posted!  I am of asian decent and my mother brought her family her legally.  Everyone has gone through all the paper work, hearings, etc.  All have worked for a living paying into the government taxes, etc. and I have one cousin who just recently retired from the United States Army after 29 years of service!\n\nMy father was a U.S. citizen and served a total of 21 years in 2 branches of the military, my mother has gone through all the legal stuff and has been a United States citizen for about 30 years or so.  And I for one have no problems with various ethnic groups coming to the U.S. and working.....BUT only if it is done the LEGAL WAY, non of this illegal, sneaking across the boarder B.S.\n\nI'm not a racists or prejudice person but illegals are breaking the law plan and simple.  And if you are breaking the law you should not be rewarded by given a visa, permanent residence or citizenship.  I just don't understand why some people don't think that illegal aliens, whether they be from Mexico, China, or wherever, are breaking the law.  Boggles my  mind.

it is NOT legal to ask for immigration status, it IS legal for an employer to ask if you have the proper legal documentation to work in the US and it is legal for them to ask for you to provide it.  They may not however ask if you are a US citizen or for any other immigration status.\n\nContrary to what many idiots who answered your question would have you believe this is how it is, and I don't care if employers have asked you these things in the past, it doesn't make it legal.
I think this is the act that created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Requiring all banks to have the government insure their depositors money up to $100,000 per account. It also regulated what banks could do with money deposited. This was to stop them from making bad investments/loans with depositors money.

The only requirement is that some sort of ultimatum be issued prior to the declaration of war.\n\nOpening of Hostilities (Hague III); October 18, 1907\nCONVENTION RELATIVE TO THE OPENING OF HOSTILITIES \nArticle 1\nThe Contracting Powers recognize that hostilities between themselves must not commence without previous and explicit warning, in the form either of a reasoned declaration of war or of an ultimatum with conditional declaration of war.

"One reason it should not be banned is that banning something only makes people want it more, which would increase the ""crime"" rate.  \nAnother reason is that there are many, many responsible drinkers that should not have to give up their beer, wine, whatever because of a few idiots."
It depends on where you are from.  In Massachusettes it is $30 and if you are underage you need a parent to consent.  If one of your parents are not in the picture you have to put an ad in a newspaper for one week to see if it will be disputed by your other parent.  If you are over the age of 18 you can call your local town hall or the town hall of the city you were born in and they can give you more information.
They all sure did jump on the band-wagon really fast didn't they. I am figuring High School or junior high most likely. They never bring anything to the table, but maybe some copy or paste. No original thoughts of their own, usually a quote from Rush Limbaugh that has no validity. Well it wont be to long and the Congress will change a lot quicker than they will be wanting it to. All I can say is vote them out.
"*EDIT: So ANSWER, Code Pink and their Stormfront allies, Move-ON, Indymedia (where I took the article on attacking US troops), Not In Our Name, QUIT, WWP, ACT, Sparticus League, and others are NOT the maintstream ""anti-war"" movement?  That's odd, they say they are, and the media and leftist leaders say they are and even speak at their events!  And if you don't like the SwiftBoat Vets, who I trust A LOT more than I ever will Kerry, I can add several dozen different links to his actions, his perjury before congress, and his going to Paris to ""negotiate"" with the North Vietnamese WHILE STILL COMMISSIONED AS A USN OFFICER.  How many would you like?\n\nAnd yes, I do take the threats from Indymedia seriously.  Unfortunatly, I am away from home and fear for my wife and infant son's safety while I am away.  I know the base security will do all they can to protect them, but with quotes taken IN CONTEXT from the protests and Indymedia's OWN website, I am concerned.\n*Edit Complete*\n\nWe cannot, by regulation, officially speak at any political event while identified as a military Service Member.  If I go to, say a rally to counter the lies of Sheehan and her Code Pink/Stormfront allies, I cannot do so in uniform, or identify myself as a US Service Member (Soldier).  I can write letters to the Editor, post on forums like this, and even have a webpage if I want.  I cannot represent my views as those of the Government or the US Armed Forces.  So every military Service Member here speaks their views, not the military’s (Though the two may be very similar).\n\nI can also point to open source information concerning the ""anti-war"" activists and confront their lies and daily ""two minutes hate"".  While they can, and have, threatened Soldiers and our families, we cannot respond in kind and must try to keep discussions peaceful.\n\nBelow are just some open sourced links on everything from the failed WMD terror attack in Jordan to Iraq's WMDs to links researching the ""anti-war"" movement and their allies."
I have watched this video and although it is very well put together, I do not believe any of it. Honestly people! Think about how much planning and people would have to be involved in what happened. Do you really think that in the year that Bush had been president his administration could have coordinated something like that? Considering the amount of people that would have had to have been involved, why wouldn't anyone be speaking up? Find some of these people and then maybe I'll start to consider some of these crazy ideas!
First off, dispute the credit bureau for the entries made.  Under the fair debt collection act it is against the law to report false entries on your credit.\n\nOnce you have written and disputed the entries the creditor will have 30 days to respond.  If they do not respond entry will be removed.  Provide the credit bureaus your information.\n\nYou will also need to provide your lending instituion copies of all letters sent to AOL.  (by the way---AOL is worse company in the history of man kind!)  Your banking institute also has to follow rules set forth by the Fair Debt Collection act.\n\nARE you sure the NSF charges are not your fault?  Closing the account before all your checks cleared?  Maybe AOL...is just your scape goat.  Make sure you have all your ducks in a row and your facts are 100% factually correct.\n\nAlso....send things certified return receipt so there is NO question as to your communications!
"It actually depends if you are talking about a specific doctor which would then potentially be medical malpractice.  However, if this is not happening directly to you then you would contact the AMA and report them.  If it is regarding a hospital and it is general then you would need to have very specific details and proof prior to contacting someone at the State's Attorneys Office.  I actually do medical malpractice and in order to file suit against a doctor in New Jersey you would actually have to send the medical records to a physician who specializes in this and that doctor would have to write an affidavit saying that they believe it be malpractice.  This would have to be done after you seek legal counsel and prior to your attorney filing suit.  I will tell you that if you are very concerned you could get a copy of the specific ""Standard of Care/Policies and Procedures"" find where they faulted in their care and then perhaps you would have better luck at the States Attorneys Office.  It is very very difficult to file suit or to have charges brought against a hospital or doctor.  If you have a story that you think is news worthy you could call your local news and they might do a story on this matter."

In most jurisdictions a magistrate is a paid position, however in small rural jurisdictions it may not be possible to pay them based upon how much tax they are taking in.
As far as know our state law has not changed in this matter and it would be 18 years old.
We do because we use their services and labor. It helps to keep many of our offices clean, fruits and vegetable affordable, lawns mowed, new houses built, Mexican food cheap at the drive-thru after closing hours at the bars, hotel rooms clean, dishes cleared after a nice meal at the fine restaurant, dry our cars after the car wash and many more.\n\nIf these jobs were paying more, Americans would work those jobs. Except that if Americans worked those jobs, our laws would cost more to mow, our office rent would increase, hotel rates would increase, washing your car would be $30, our strawberries would be $8 instead of $4.\n\nThey are helping to keep things affordable.
Blind nationalism?
China's success can be attributed, to an extent, on education (in addition to their low standard of living).  Large emphasis was placed on math/science education for retooling their once stagnated, Maoist country into a invigorated, reforming country.  The opening of China's markets and workforce is like opening Dutch dikes onto the plains below.    The shear capacity for growth was just overwhelming, you're trying to take a country from nothing under Mao to modernity.\n\nYou also have to remember that Mexico is a republic like the US, so any moves the government decides to make are going to be limited in both scope and depth.  China, conversely, is authoritarian, so they can ignore what they choose and implement what they want with impunity and overwhelming resources.\n\nI don't think we'll ever see economic growth like China underwent again.  Their growth will level off soon enough also.
"Well why would they become legal and have to pay taxes?  Why embrace our culture, hell why appreciate anything our country has to offer?  We only pay their medical, school lunches, rent, food, bills, we give them more rights and opportunities than we have ourselves.  What incentive do we give them to become legal?  I guess besides being the right thing to do there's just not much appeal.  Why make something of yourself when you can sit on your couch and eat other people tax dollars all day?  Why have a career and follow laws when you can have 8 babies, with all-expenses-paid vacations in our hospitals, and have our government pay to raise them too?  And once they're all grown, you can teach them to wave the Mexican flag and spit on the American culture that paid for everything they've ever eaten or owned, and if you've had the decency to learn English then you can insult every American you run across and make sure that they know that ""L.A."" is now Mexico.  Oh yeah, make sure you and your 8 kids burn and tear down lots of America's flags and put your up, and be as ungrateful as you can.\n\nIt makes me sick.\n\nPlease go here http://www.getmycountryback.com and help me do something about it."

The fire combined with major structural damage caused the collapse.  The fire was obviously initiated by the jet fuel, but was further sustained by combustible objects in the building.\n\nWhile it is not frequently discussed, the Twin Towers were rare in that their outer walls were structural (load-bearing).  Typically, buildings have widely spaced columns.  This type of design was heavily dependent of on the steel floor truss systems to distribute the load.  As the fire weakened (important note - not melted) the floor trusses, the vertical members gave way to excessive loading caused by a failure to distribute the loads.\n\nThe excessive weight above the points of weakening caused a rapid, catastrophic failure - observed as pancaking of the floors below the initial point of failure.  \n\nIt has been argued that because the building fell at free-fall speeds, which is largely accurate, it could not have possibly been failure of members due to vertical loading.  However, consider the sheer weight and momentum applied to each floor as the one above it fails.  These are extreme values that no building could withstand.

You would need to eliminate all living things. These exist in the animal and plant kingdoms. Without life none of these traits could exist. Without these traits the world would be a much calmer place to live...or would it? Aggressive (and passive aggressive) traits serve many purposes, one of the most important being survival, but also to help keep natural balance. Without these traits the population of the world would have been unbearable a long time ago. Instead of trying to eliminate these traits, we should probably be looking for ways to cope with them and use them to our own advantage.
"This question has been asked before, in many different forms.  The answer is simple, and the reasons are many.  Here are a few:\n1) The US is the strongest country in the world.  Therefore, it is our responsibility to keep the peace...even if it means preparing for war.\n2) Even though the US is the only country to have ever USED a nuclear weapon, we didn't do it just because we didn't like the Japanese.  We could have dropped a nuke on Russia during the Cold War if that were true.\n3) The US doesn't go around threatening other countries because they ""don't have a right to exist.""  We also aren't known for strapping bombs to our children and sending them to the mall.\n4) We would ONLY ever use a nuke again if it was a deterrent, or if someone nuked us first.  Most countries wouldn't be stupid enough to do this, because we could bomb them right off the face of the Earth.\n5) The countries that we are trying to stop from pursuing nuclear technology would USE a bomb.  As I said, we wouldn't, and haven't, except sixty years ago when our government felt we had no choice."
It depends on the state. Most statutes of limitation refer to the potential sentence of the offense. There is misdemeanor theft and there is felony theft, depending upon the value of the stolen item. The statute of limitations for a misdemeanor is usually shorter than that for a felony.

"I hear this alot and it is more confusing to me than ""matter of fact"" like it is to some. No American is going to agree with every issue that comes before a President, so I don't really share your grand dilusion that I am going to get everything I want, or am deservent of it. \n\nYou talk like GW disrupted an illusionary ""World Peace"", which I think is very short sighted. These protester that scream for world peace don't understand the world we live in. There are people that hate us for no reason, in fact they come up with reasons to justify killing us, just like some of the stretches I have heard about GW. World peace today is not realistic, it would be nice, but its not going to happen. So, what do you want? A president that goes on the offencive to make sure you are still breathing tommorow, or one that will lay down and become introverted and selfish?\n\nBoth sides of the political arena have their talking points that are mostly crap to get you on their side and hate the other side. If you want to buy into this, thats your choice, but I have to believe you have a brain in your head somewhere...  you should use it."

Finally, a good post.  It's time we stand up and take back our country.  If they want to be here, the do it legal, like the millions of people who come here legally every year.  God Bless America!\n\nLeicammarcial, it's not that legals citizens won't do it, it's that they won't do it for nothing just to live on welfare like the illegals do.  Maybe we have some self-pride.  Oh yeah, I do do the work that the illegals are coming over here and doing for nothing.  When I lose my job because they undercut me, I'll just come over and let you support me.  Idiot.

It is impossible to achieve moral ends through immoral means. Don't forget, those workers wouldn't have worked at the steel mill if they thought they could have gotten a better job someplace else, so Carnegie et. al. did those men a favor. Ditto for sneaker-making kids in Singapore. Before you go thinking I'm crazy, consider this: from 1750 to 1800(the advent of industrialism in England), the child mortality rate in London dropped 70%. I don't expect you to believe that, I expect you to check the facts yourself. In other words, John Bull saved the lives of many poor people. Isn't it better to work in a loud, dangerous machine shop, than to die of starvation? Also, if it weren't for the factories, there'd be no Labor party. Factory jobs lifted generations of people out of poverty and into the law-making middle class. In this case, the end is a better standard of living, and the means are hard work. Nothing wrong there.

Technically it means rule by the few. \n\nRule by the wealthy has a separate name, plutocracy. \n\nIn an oligarchy the ruling elite are called oligarchs; in a plutocracy the ruling elite are called plutocrats.\n\nEarly modern Venice was more of an oligarchy than a plutocracy. \n\nSome would say the modern-day United States is more of a plutocracy. (Almost all Senators and Presidents have had net worths well over $1,000,000) Becoming an elected representative at the national level does require a relatively large fortune, even with campaign donations.
Do you mean Swaziland and Somalia ?
Not in this life.
The present administration has made a point of campaigning against poverty. President Lula has recieved international applause for his 'Fome Zero' ('Zero Hunger') program.\n\nResearch shows that poverty has decreased 8%, but Brazil still is one of the leaders in the social disparity ranking. We have some of the richest people in the world and quite a lot of the poorest (25,08% of the population lives under the poverty line, which means that their families make under 60 dollars a month).\n\nThe current administration spent over US$13.5 billion in the Fome Zero program this year alone, and that number is growing. There's also Bolsa Familia - a program directed at people whose families make under US$50 a month -, which was classified by The Economist as the largest income transfer program in Latin America, with investments that total over US$3 billion. \n\nAs far as children go, specifically, there's not a lot being done. Our social services have taken care of 1.69 million children, but they only cover about 80% of all counties. \n\nThe problem in the big cities is that most of the poor children that circulate on the streets are not actually homeless. Most of them are sent to beg by their own parents, and some are blatantly used by them to attract sympathy. The mayor of Rio de Janeiro has made attempts at gathering 'homeless' kids in special shelters, but they either escape or their parents take them out and let them go to the streets again.\n\nStreet kids are victim of a number of social problems. It is impossible to solve the situation with one specific government program. \n\nPS: to the answer before mine: dude, when you say it's a corrupt society, it sounds like everyone is corrupt. That's not a nice thing to say now, is it?

"The government of Morocco (north Africa) is indeed quite like that of the United States. It has an Executive, Legislative, and Judicial system just as in the US. The major difference is the head of the executive branch of the US is voted by the people through a process called an electoral college whereas in Morocco it is a monarchy (lineage through birth).\n\nThere are other changes of course (there is no government in the WORLD exactly like the US) and it would be a good idea to read up on it at the following web site\n\nhttp://www.bestmorocco.com\n\nEritrea (east Africa) was awarded to Ethiopia in 1952. It's government is ""transitional"".\n\nAfter much bloodshed Lesotho (in South Africa) has a government setup with the three branches of government the US employs. There are no elections and the executive branch is a monarchy.\n\nChad (central Africa) is in warfare right now but the three forms of government are in place with elections (over 50% and for 5 years for the President).\n\nNiger (western Africa) I know less about. I know they employ the three branches of government and have a president. How he is elected I do not know.\n\nThe majority difference in these countries is some portion of the countries leaders are APPOINTED (as the President of the US appoints his Cabinet) where leaders in the US are elected and those who are not have to be approved by the Legislative Branch (Congress)."

"""Greater Avenues for Independence""\nGAIN aims to increase employment and foster self-sufficiency among people receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). GAIN was originally mandatory for all welfare recipients except single parents with children under the age of six (and was later reduced to three under JOBS). Welfare recipients are exempt from remaining registered in the program if they obtain a full-time job or are chronically ill. GAIN’s regulations permit temporary deferral from the participation requirement for those who have a part-time job, temporary illness, family emergency, or another situation that precludes attending an activity."
All of this free legal advise isn't worth what you paid for it.\n\nCall a lawyer in your local area. If you can't afford a lawyer, there may be free legal aid programs that could help.

Lets face it the only people who are gaining from mass immigration are the minority rich, the majority working class will have to put up without wage increases for a long time.

"bnp is the most corrupt & racist of all...theyre not even a real party.\nthe bnp ""is wholly opposed to any form of racial integration between British and non-European peoples"" and is therefore committed to ""restoring, by legal changes, negotiation and consent the overwhelmingly white makeup of the British population that existed in Britain prior to 1948"". To achieve this aim, the BNP advocates the use of ""firm but voluntary incentives"" to remove ethnic minorities from the UK. Membership of the party is restricted to ""Indigenous Caucasians"". A British National Party European election candidate in the Eastern region had close links in the 1980s with a convicted criminal and two notorious paedophiles. \nSid Chaney, an elderly former Londoner and Islington National Front officer who now lives in Essex, is sixth on the BNP's list for Eastern England and a council election candidate in Basildon. In the 1980s his circle of friends included Desmond Fenwick, who was involved in a number of police investigations into horrific murders of gay men, and George Wilson, who had a liking for very young boys. \nChaney was around when a gang of teenage armed robbers, who were politically involved with both the NF and the extreme nazi British Movement, were frequent visitors to Wilson's flat, which doubled as the local NF headquarters. \nPaedophilia is one of the most dreadful crimes against children. The BNP has made paedophilia a major plank of its 2004 election campaign and has tried to barge in on local campaigns on the issue. Now Searchlight reveals the BNP's own dirty secrets as a service to voters to warn them of the type of people who are campaigning for their votes. \nSearchlight published the full story of Chaney and his disgusting circle of friends and fellow fascists in Islington in September 1985 in conjunction with the Daily Mirror. Space precluded us from reproducing it in this month's Searchlight but you can read it here on our website and make up your own mind about the BNP's criminal hypocrisy. The British National Party will be fielding a total of 21 candidates in London on 10 June although some of them are doubling up. As Searchlight went to press the party had named candidates for all 11 London-wide seats in the London Assembly, a mayoral candidate who is also standing for the Assembly and a full list of nine for the London constituency in the European election. The BNP website includes photographs and short biographies of the party's candidates around the country except that, with four weeks to go until polling day, some photos and several biographies for the London candidates were still missing. This may be because many of the candidates' past activities are rather embarrassing for Nick Griffin's new ""clean"" BNP. The many candidates with criminal convictions and a penchant for the policies of Hitler's Third Reich reflect how poorly organised the BNP is in London. In pole position on the London European list is Chris Roberts. Not a serious choice, this former alleged City high flyer has been described as a man from some village that is missing its idiot - and this was by a fellow BNP member. He is the brother of the notorious Barry Roberts, who is number 2 on the London Assembly list. Whereas Chris lives in leafy Essex and has long abandoned London, his brother still resides in southeast London where he grew up in the company of the openly nazi and violent British Movement and the National Front. After belatedly turning to the BNP, Barry Roberts was among those who guarded a meeting addressed by the arch liar and Holocaust denier David Irving, alongside leading violent members of the nazi terror group Combat 18, such as Charlie Sargent, who is now serving a life sentence for murder. \nChris Roberts is very coy about his early politics but a rumoured early link with US extremists may account for his love of the USA and his abandoning of the "
NO....stiff fines first...then jail time.
To be honest, it is just a political opinion that can answer this question. I believe that President Bush acted prompt and brought resolve to the American people with the war in Afghanistan. We brought the war to their land, and they paid dearly for over 3,000 Americans lost. 9/11? Who really knows what happened? With all that has happened, do you really think a President is going to hold back after being in the job for over 6 years? With the 9/11 committee and other organizations investigating 9/11, you should have some comfort with what happened. \n  The wiretaps have actually prevented more than 1,000 illegal and potentially dangerous persons from entering our country. Whether you believe they gutted the Bill of Rights or not is your call, but for me, it protected my well-being and over 300 million more Americans.\n  Iraq war? Hmm. Now this is interesting. Was it because of former Pres. Bush that his son initiated a full scale offensive? Or maybe because he wanted more attention? Or better yet, maybe because the British gave us complete wrong intelligence? Answers?? Maybe watching CNN will give you the answer. I will not offer a an answer to this question because it is entirely political and won't offer any resolve to this question....It's up to you. What do you think?
Last night after the President's speech about allocating $1.9 Billion to secure the Mexican border, Lou Dobbs, Wolf Blitzer, and a couple other news guys said that's about two weeks in Iraq.
I would just be asking about his experience of being the us pesident, You cant hate him, im pretty sure none of us have what it takes to be president.
Because he believes god has put him on Earth to be his personal messenger and soldier.  And once you believe something as dangerous as that, nothing anybody can say to you can change it.
yeah it was easier and besides, some states belonged to mexico, ans a guy sold them to the US so most of the mexicans citizens that stayed in those states had to be legalized since thhose were part of the US
Police & government confidential.\n\nYou may have to go to the police station, to see them.
You can say that.  If the truth were to come out, women, for the most part, are a pain the the as*s for the military establishment. In administrative rolls, they do fine and are extremely efficient.  As combatants they are high maintenance and unreliable.  Oh, there are exceptions to that rule, but watch the eyes glaze over on any platoon sergeant when you announce to him that he will have women in his platoon.\nUnfortunately for the military, it has become the dumping ground for every politically correct or set aside program adopted by the government.  It has no choice but to do as the dumb as*s politicians want because the spineless generals still don't know how to stand up to as*sholes like Donald Rumsfeld.\nI often wonder what the outcome would have been if Rumsfeld tried to push his meely mouthed agenda on someone like George Patton.  It's my guess that they would both have to go to the hospital, to get Patton's boot out of Rumsfeld's as*s.

"Illegals draw welfare by stealing people's social security numbers and identities. That means there are a lot of people being directly hurt by these people as well. Innocent people are having their credit ratings ruined, having IRS problems, and social security problems. If someone who has had their social security number stolen gets married, if either spouse dies or become disabled then they can be denied their benefits. \n\nMy family moved to the US before WWII. Those of my family that didn't make it over got killed by the death camps. Our family assimilated to the American culture. We didn't expect the Americans to change to suit us. The illegal immigrants from Mexico are not civilized like that.\n\nThey not only changed the National Anthem to Spanish, they changed the words. They already burn our flag and hang our flag upside down. They waved the Mexican flag during a lot of their protests. Some schools have stopped hanging the American flag and forbidden students from wearing clothes with any part of the American flag on their clothing all to keep from offending the Mexicans. It's nothing short of an attack of our country, not only by the illegal aliens, but those who seek to appease them. \n\nI am tired of the stereotype that Americans wouldn't do the work that illegals do. Illegals do all kinds of jobs for less than minimum wage which drives the wages down for U.S. citizens. Construction jobs are an example. There are lots of illegals doing construction jobs that Americans used to do because the companies can keep more of the profits if they pay less for the workers. All that does is make companies wealthier and Americans poorer. Illegals are stealing jobs that Americans have done for years. \n\nIf you go to a country and refuse to assimilate, continuing to speak your own language then you are really not an immigrant -- you're a colonist ... and that's what the Mexicans are doing, they're colonizing the American Southwest as part of their ""reconquista"" Read about mecha in the link I provided and you'll see what the Mexicans real agenda is.\n\nhttp://www.americanpatrol.com/MECHA/MEChAindex.html"

One of Jackson's major campaign promises that he made good on, was the dissolution of the Bank of the United States, which was created by Alexander Hamilton. From then until the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank, our economy operated essentially without government supervision of national capital. It seemed to work fine, but who can imagine life without some grand poobah setting interest rates by fiat? No disrespect intended to Paul Volker, Alan Greenspan, or Ben Bernake. If we're stuck with a monetary tyrant, let's cross our fingers and hope they're a competent tyrant.

I would never be critical of the military or police!\n\nI always advise people never to give advice.

"It is very commendable that you have nothing to hide. But that is not even close to being the point.\n\nFor centuries we have been protected by the Constitution against ""illegal search and seizure"". It is one of the most sacred rights that Americans have been able to enjoy since our Independence. Law enforcement or Government agencies are only allowed such measures if probable cause can be shown and a judge allows them.\n\nBut now the Government has began collecting information, tapping phone lines and using other investigative methods WITHOUT a court order. This is the worst kind of invasion of privacy and a 100% violation of our constitutional rights. \n\nWhat I also find nearly as disturbing is the fact they the terrorists are getting EXACTLY want they wanted. Whether it be illegal detention and torture of SUSPECTED terrorists or tapping and spying on US citizens without due cause, the US Government is becoming just like the regimes it is trying to change. \n\nHow are we to convince foreign governments to adopt our system of government when our own officials disregard our Constitution?"
Yes they do. It is your right that you earned that vacation and any sick leave you did not use. They owe all of that to you and have to give to you within a reasonible a mount of time. Contact the employer in writing...send the letter to your immediate supervisor, his/her supervisor and the head administrator. That way they have to give a response to resolve the issue.
Asset verification means checking to make sure someone has something valuable that they said they had. \n\nFor instance, if you go to the bank and ask to borrow money, and tell them that you have a nice boat and a nice car, the ban will verify that you have those assets before lending you money. The reason they want to verify is that if you don't pay the money back, they'll want to take those assets from you to pay off the loan.
Moron Alert \n\nMore Democracy's are formed after the American Constitution than any other form of Democracy.  \n\nAs a matter of fact (which of course means nothing to liberals) virtually all democracys have used the US Consitution in designing THEIR OWN  form of democracy.\n\nMust be a crappy system, huh.

"Good answers so far.  You have to be able to decide who you want to be.  \n\nThe ""Good Guys"" are those that have your best interests at heart, and prove it.  They are those that will help you when you need it, and they are those that you look up to the most.\n\nThe ""Bad Guys"" are those that do the opposite.  They only want what is best for themselves, and will do anything to achieve that goal.\n\nAs the other poster said, we all have ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" inside of us.  It's up to us to figure out who we want to be.  We will never always be the ""good guy"", because there will always be something we want to badly.  We can only try to soften the blow.\n\nLiving in a world where you don't know anything, however, does NOTHING but leave you open as a target for the bad guys."
"I think you very well hit upon your answer with ""Conflict of interest.""\n\nEvery President owes his campaign backers and must see to it they're repaid, and in Bush Jr.'s case, he owes many in the Big Oil Brotherhood--due largely in part for Bush Jr. himself is an ""oilman"".\n\nHow insulting it'd be for Junior Bush to benefit and promote alternative fuel options that would deeply cut into global and AMERICAN Big Oil profits...when the latter's money put him in the White House. Simply put: you don't bite the hand that helped you.\n\nAlso presented is another tip and lesson each politician learned from the actions of a young President and his empowered brother--who went against the Mafia hand that put them both in high office. The end result of their actions led to November 22, 1963: Dallas.  Junior Bush I'm sure is also very aware of this as well--given he's probably made enough enemies already."

thank you, arizona!!!\n\nwhat people need to stop focusing on is the word 'immigrant' and pay more attention to the word 'ILLEGAL'.  i dont care if someone came over 100 years ago, when immigration was allowed, sanctioned, and supported.  its makes me angry to no end that im supposed to feel sorry for the plight of these poor ILLEGALS.  once again, THANK YOU, ARIZONA, for doing something that NEEDS to be done.

well they used to only be 25 years from the date copywritten, but disney changed that in 1992 with the extension of copyrights to 100 years instead. I found that odd since disney inc. made most of they movies based on works that had expired copyrights. Ever noticed that. But the copyrights are actually usually owned by the publishers who commissioned the writers. Only a few writers actually own there own works. I know that since I tried to be a writer, and when the first checks came I thought they were a bit short, but the publishers lawyers explained it all to me. But the persentage is about 30%-45% who still have there works controlled by them.
I would suspect that the number approaches 100%.  Once an intictment has been handed down, it must be handled somehow.  Usually that's at trial.  Even if the case is plead out, there will be a hearing where the guilty plea is accepted and sentence passed.\n\nThe state could dismiss the charges but that would be unusual.  Some states invoke double jeopardy protections at that point if the case dismisses the charges.

You know, im fine with them being here, but to say they came here for a better life maybe they should stay off our welfare programs and work for it instead, ive seen too many immigrants get welfare under one name work under another and seek medical under yet another, they need to use their real names and quit abusing our system. i shouldnt have to pay for them to make it here while they are getting a well paid paycheck also.
Gosh, you mean people like Oli North aren't the only ones doing that money making thang for the benefit of covert, government operations?\nDidn't I see him on TV a while ago ...doing a show on weapons or war or something?

"Most mexicans are of native indian population. There is nothing spanish about them , except the language. It's funny how the ""latin"" people forget that real spanish people from Spain are white!"
No it is not.  Segregation was outlawed.\n\nAnd when you think about organizations such as the Black Panthers, where certain races are not allowed, those are private groups.  Being a private group, they can make rules like that.  However, the government cannot.
How long it takes? Years and years...just getting the application approved to start the process! There is a 5 year period, citizenship tests must be passed.\nThe swearing in process is a mass deal...thousands at once, recite the pledge, etc. Then, papers are mailed and you are a citizen...a long, long path that is very complicated, depending upon what nation you are coming in from. It is also an unfair system. Cubans are all but automatically granted citizenship, while others can't get it no matter what they do. We have serious limits which vary from country to country.

No, Clinton is not smarter than Bush because he became president first.  He is smarter than Bush because he actually made use of his brain and have an intellectual curiosity that Bush does not have or care for.

It would not be the same as it is today, I think the black community would be stronger side by side, less drug use & sales and the self destruction of neighborhoods by gangs. I don't think the Rights that black citizens now have after the civil rights era would be in effect now.  The unity and bond of the blackman would be strong as they would still be fighting together for the freedoms and rights deserved by any man today.\n\nIt is the assination of these two supreme human beings and freedom fiughters that  gained Americas sympathy and pushed the civil rghts movement forward...and hastened the Black Community to forget what they are fighting for in our present day.  Black youth would have a purpose and not just to get the best shoes or be all up in your face and loud and disrespectful.  They would be fighting for a cause-where is that cause now, why the downward spiral in the community?...and not just the black community but all communities...because there is not a vocal leader such as Malcom or Martin, but ones such as Rev Al Sharpton, who choose to fuel the fire instead of fighting it.

If the loan was a Deed of Trust, it is stunningly rare for there to be a deficiency judgement. It is only likely if there is fraud involved or if the lien holder thinks that you have a lot of other money hidden away. Instead of the simple 120 day foreclosure, he has to go to a judge and file suit based on the note. It doesn't happen unless the lender thinks it will be really worth their time. \n\nLeigh M\nPortland\nhttp://www.LeighMaynard.com\nI am a realtor in Oregon and Washington\n\nPS -- If you are behind on your loan and may lose the house, please email me off list.

If you think you are correct call the IG.\n\nHowever (speaking as a former IG myself) I advise you _not_ to get your congressional representative involved.  An IG can fix something like this with a phone call - calling a congressman starts a three-ring circus that takes months to resolve.  For example - if you call your congressman, nobody can now tell you anything.  All information has to go up the chain of command (and get reviewed by every person as it goes up) until it gets to the congressman.  Then the congressman's office may or may not actually tell the soldier.

Because it applies to that countries citizens. \n\nIf a constitution of one country applied to all the citizen of the world, the rest of the countries would not need a constitution.\n \nWe can not go to Mexico and demonstrate because it is against the Mexican constitution. You are subject to jail time of between 3-5 years. Even if you become a naturalize citizen of Mexico you still may not demonstrate against the government of Mexico. Under Mexico's constitution the only citizens that may demonstrate against the Mexican government are born citizens.\n\nYou know I have nothing against people that want to become citizens of our country, but to come into the country without the proper documentation is not right.\n\nWhy are people coming to America? Because they can't do in their country what they can do in America and they know that.  People think it is all about the jobs and in most cases it is, but therea re other things also.\n\nMost people from other countries don't have the freedoms we have here. The country they come from have a corrupt government with the people in power getting rich and richer, taking bribes and not helping the people of their country. They can not own cars, houses, stay out late at night  nor attend the school of their choice.\n\nThis might seem trivial to most of you, but it is a big thing when you are not allowed to do them in your country.\n\nWhen you are reading the constitution at least make sure that it makes logical sense. \n\nYou do not write a constitution for other countries and their citizens nor do other countries write a constitution about our country and the citizens here in the United.

There is a lot wrong with the education system in the US.  I am an inner-city teacher.  I think that parents should come to school with their kids for the first two weeks of school, this would help curtail the behavior problems that we have to deal with.  Get rid of NCLB, kids do not learn to think, teaching to the test makes students only learn information that they can spit back.\n\nIf it's more money you're looking for, then tax corporations and businesses.  The schools are producing the product they need for their success.  Why shouldn't they pay for this product?  They are getting their product for free.

I do, they are the ones that are busting their butt for us and our country.  They have to have huge amounts of intelligence and bust their way through military camp and pretty much any other job they have to do.  They should get paid a ton of money because they are doing the hardest job for the government, they are not working for the FBI or sitting in Bush's cronies offices pushing around paperwork; they are out there doing real life physical work and should get properly paid for it, not to mention putting their life on the line, where is their hazard pay?  Can't get much more hazardous than that kind of job when they are getting sent off to war.
I think we should put the national guard there as we obviously need to to pervent the inflow of drugs, illegals, and terrorists.
the only rights they have is to be protected, they do not have constitutional rights because that would mean that a 14 year old would have a right to bear arms and that just wont happen,, so they have a right to be protected under law and that is it,, the parents have to be notified about any arrest,, and the police cant question them unless the parents say ok and are there,,also there are city codes,, but they uaually do not supercede laws,, dont get confused about rights by the law and city codes,, example the law may say,, curfew is 11pm, but the city code says  1030.. if a minor was out at 1040..no law was broken,, only a city code,, and there is no criminal action only a city code violation,
War has come our way. Remember 9/11/2001. If that wasn't a declaration of war by Al-Queda, nothing was. For we Australians, the Bali bombings are serving the same purpose.\n\nHowever, it seems that many in the west have forgotten about Osama Bin Laden and his acolytes and don't understand the importance of the war on terror. Homeland security is not enough. We need to pursue a strong position against terrorism.
I would certainly suspect so, as you're talking about two separate countries.

Tribes which would traditionally adopt members are not allowed to do so.  \n\nWhat that boils down to is that legally, unless you're a quarter whatever, you can't claim to be any tribe.  But I would say you could point out that you have part of that bloodline, and be proud that you can trace your heritage.\n\nOh, and a lot of us ""Irish"" in the states say that because we've only been here three or four generations and tend to marry other Irish families. I let my family down and married some Mayflower material, they're a little sad but at least they like the guy. :)"

Public schools are subjected to state and local laws, so they may be different from state to state, local to local...\n\nIn the case of a student being displined by being placed in a locked room, that would depnd on a number of things I suppose.\n\n- Was the student supervised or alone?\n- What precautions were taking in the case of an emergency (medical, fire, etc.)\n- Was the environemnt hospitible (not hot, poorly ventilated or dark)\n\nDepending on your answers, the school may or may not be subject to punititive sanctions if they put children at risk, irrespective of the reasons. But in and of itself, a locked door doesn't necessarily mean the school's administration did anything illegal.\n\nIf you're still concerened, you should ask the district to provide a copy of a written policy for disciplining student. This then would allow you to see if they're following their own rules.
As soon as we let them.\n\nWinston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.\n\nInside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.\n\nOutside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered everywhere. The blackmoustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding corner. There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston's own. Down at streetlevel another poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight. It was the police patrol, snooping into people's windows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only the Thought Police mattered.
Not good, made us understand how hard it is to fight that kind of war.
Capital punishment is used against people that are guilty of horrific crimes; abortion is used to kill an innocent child. The only thing the same is the end of human life, but they are very different issues.
The HMS Ark Royal was a young aircraft carrier...just three years old.  She participated in the hunt for the Admiral Graf Spee and was involved in a number of attacks against French ports.  She pursued the Scharnhorst and the Gneisseau.  In May 1941 one of her torpedo planes hit the Bismarck and disabled her allowing other ships to close in and see the fabled battleship.  \n\nThe Ark Royal operated in the Med a lot in 1941 and on one of these occasions was torpedoed by German submarine U-81.  \n\nProgressive flooding choked the boiler uptakes; since she had no diesel backups, all power was lost, including power to the pumps. HMS Legion was ordered to take aboard 1487 officers and crew to transport to Gibraltar. After several hours, already listing heavily while under tow towards Gibraltar, the carrier capsized to starboard and sank on 14 November 1941. Only one crewman was lost during the evacuation of the ship.\n\nThe carrier capsized and sank on November 14, 1941.
never.  There are many people (and the media like to keep pushing this too) that basically do not want to do anything for themselves.  They want a life of ease and comfort.  They also want a country that denies its roots (especially its religious roots)\n\nHow can we stop it.  Vote the right people in office.  I will not say which party, because I have seen the right person from both parties.  A voter MUST be informed.  The hard part is getting the information and making sure it is actually trustworthy (and not just some hype so the politician can get elected)
Oh man I used to see some of those clips online until I saw this clip of a russian soldier being decapitated it was so sick I stopped watching them :-S
No.  That would mean abolishing the 1st Amendment of the Constitution, as it would remove the ability of assembly and petition.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with lobbying.  Some people are better at it than others, that is all.  Every nation has the government it deserves, and so long as the average American voter cannot even name their state and national representatives, as well as the mayor of their town, the city council members, members of the school board, and members of the utility and water boards, then they have ceded their right to bitch to those who bother to petition the government.\n\nAmericans are to blame for the disconnect of our government from out people, and until America eats that spiniach, we will continue to become more estranged everyday.

How can they be bolstering Social Security?\n if They have fake SS#?\n\n\nThis story is highly misleading because it does not itemize the fact that a family of four paying SS taxes and other related taxes like sales tax actually consume $55,000 of Social Services(immigrationreform.org) over and beyond the tax they do pay.\n\nLet's see 12 million illegals times 55,000 equals 600 billion in the red.\n\nThis does not include maternity and health care that they steal by using emergency rooms as their family doctor.\n\nMy heart bleeds\n not to mention its illegal ,justify more law breaking

Uh.. .who's going to pay for your plan that will cost billions of dollars?
Eisenhower developed the concept of the Interstate Highway. How does this relate to the war? Part of the plan was to enable quicker positioning of heavy combat units anywhere in America. Also, part of the highway plan involved making sure that there was a stretch of highway in any given distance that would be built straight enough to land our largest aircraft of that era.

Nope. The country is pretty unified together. There would have to be a separate government in some of the states that gone rogue. Then there will be an American Revolution.\nBut I predict America will take over Mexico and make all Mexicans citizens of the United States. Though, Mexico will be a territory for awhile.
The war is not against Muslims, it's against terrorists and many of them just happen to claim to be muslim, though their actions are against the dictates of the Quran so I don't know how they can claim to be muslim in the first place.\n\nWhether or not the war will ever end and a clear winner determined remains to be seen.  Personally, I feel we, the American people, were dragged into this war under false pretenses and now the ones responsible for starting it are just trying to figure out how to get themselves out of the quagmire they've created.
Because President Amin wanted to be seen as a world leader working for peace, the job of the Israelis was made much easier. Every day, Amin would hold a televised press conference at the airport surrounded by the hostages, so Israeli Intelligence could know where the hostages were being held and in what general physical condition they were in (ie-could they walk onto the cargo plane or would they be so weak that they would have to be carried, etc).\n\nBecause of his efforts on behalf of the PLO terrorists who had staged the crisis, Amin after his exile was offered sanctuary in Saudi Arabia. I believe he is actually still alive, though he has suffered severe mental deterioration from this STD.

I know that he is a Democrat and gave money to both Howard Dean and Dick Gephardt campaigns.  He is tooooo good looking to be a President.  You ever notice what they look like when their term is over....ugh!
79 Iran overthrows their government for a religious rule and took the US Government Civilian employees as hostages, shortly after they attacked Iraq. US sided with IRAQ gave them weapons and Intel. The war ended in 88 Saddam invades  Kuwait in 90 and US counters and sends Iraqi troops out of Kuwait but doesn't go to Baghdad, after 911 Iraq was seen as very unstable and full of natural resources so US attacks again. \n\nAlso they tried to kill our 41st president.
I'm against illegal immigrants getting amnesty.  I want HR4437 to pass. I want employe s to stop hiring illegals.  I want better border control.  I want places like Mexico to treat their own citizens better and to be responsible for them.  I want an amendment to not allow babies born in the U.S. to have citizenship in the U.S.
Typically, just lots of hot air, and even getting that means little.  Sometimes they are economic sanctions, but as we have seen with Iraq under Saddam, those are toothless and prone to corruption (even by UN officials themselves).
Yes it can. If you are intoxicated in a public place or under the influence of alcohol or narcotics you can be arrested for DUI, DWI, or Public intoxication. If you are a danger to yourself or others or are considered a mental risk you can be taken into custody also for your protection. If a friend is at your home and sees Narcotics in plain view and they are a credible witness a search warrant can be obtained and your house searched and you subsequently can be arrested for what they find if it is in the warrant or not. An example would be your friend saw you smoking marijuana and you have a bag of it on your table. If your friend has given credible information before to the Police then they are proven up to be credible and a warrant is very easy to get. If a police officer is responding to a call at an apartment complex and your window is open and he/she smells you smoking a joint and looks in the window and sees you he no longer needs a warrant because in his/her training they have been trained to recognize the smell of burning marijuana and that is probable cause enough to snatch you up and hold you until a warrant can be obtained and if they can see the dope in plain view they don't even need the warrant.

Too early for president - the parties have not chosen their candidates yet.
im guessing it would be close to every other state---automatic jail time, adn 5,000 to 10,000 dollar fine, and if they find it in a vehicle, it gets confiscated.
dear friend...........\nemotions and legal procedings are different. If i need to answer this question emotionaly the yes he deserves the death penalty.............. but legally it is not possible because in rearest of the rare cses death penalty is given so i could not find anything in the case which will help to get him death penalty....
There are way to many variables there to give you any real figures.  It would depend on how big of a school, what departments, where it is to be located and what support the local community and state plan on giving it.  Taxpayers can pay anything from 0% to 80%.
Will The Democratic Party Regain Control of Congress?\nOr Will They Only Win 1 Chamber?\n\nIt's my opinion unless a miracle happens the best they can hope for would be the House. I don't think they will pull off a sweep like the Republicans did in 1994. I'm still amazed that happened.\n\nOr Will The Republican Party Still Retain Control?\n\nThis would be my guess. Republicans don't lose either House of Senate. Off year elections are about state races. Do you like your person or not. President's popularity has little effect.\n\nIf, you think the Democrats will win control of 1 chamber, which 1 is it going to be? The Senate or The House? \n\nIF the Democrats win one house it will be The House. There all 435 seats are up for re-election. In the Senate there are only 33 maybe 34 seats up for re-election. Democrats would have to win a greater percentage of the races in order to retake the Senate.\n\nNancy Pelosi Speaker of the House..\nHarry Reid Senate Majority Leader..\nDoes it have a nice ring to it?\n\nI'm a moderate. I'm not rabid for either side. Harry whould be OK if he goes a little less combative. Nancy? The thought of her really being in charge of anything of importance makes me nauseous.\n\nRemember I'm one of those people who really determine who's running this country. I'm not a Republican or a Democrat. In 1994 the Democrats got kicked out because the swing voters were tired of what the liberals were pushing AND what the Republicans were advocating seemed like a good alternative.\n\nUs swingers may be tired of what the Republicans are pushing, but Democrats aren't offering anything as an alternative but 'We aren't Republicans'. That doesn't resonate with me. Talk to me. Tell me what you really want to do and how you plan to pay for it. \n\nThat how you plan to pay for it is the most important part of what I want to know. Especialy since Democrats have gotten on the 'We're spending too much' bandwagon lately.\n\nCongress IS there for the taking. But if you want my vote I'm going to have to like what I'm hearing. And if all I'm hearing is the Republicans are wrong. That may be true but if Democrats don't tell me how they are going to do differently, how do I know they won't be worse?
i dont smoke the herb but used to. of course it should be legal. the herb has not been responsible for the amount of senseless deaths that alcohol, cigarettes, or even guns have caused. ive never gotten high, gone for a drive and didnt remember how i got somewhere the next day, have you?
Can't remember. Do you know?
They don't, are you kidding, they would rather blame it on the democrats and Bill Clinton and environmentalist, but they themselves have enough money to buy a country and build anything that they want. But huge profits benefit the repuglicans so now who's to blame.
i would prefer to live in stalins russia, only because at least if you went along with the flow you could a have fair bet of being ok but in germany you were in trouble from the start depending on who you were of course. if i was a pure arian person then i would choose germany.
I think so...\n...but wouldn't he need to have balls?
"He is a ""good ole boy""."
Parole is getting out of prison early.  During the time out early, strick rules governing where one lives, works, interacts with others and such must be followed or it's back to prison again.  \n\nEarly release on parole is based on good behavior.  (Although some people are sentenced to prison with no chance of parole regardless of how good the behavior.)  But even if someone has the chance of parole and has good behavior, they might not get out if their crime was horrendous or if the victim or the victim's family actively object to parole.  \n\nThat's pretty much what I understand of it from watching TV.
Bush is a stubborn mule, \nhe won't replace Cheney...\nWhich works out for the Democrats cuz Cheney's \npoll rating is like 18% and Bush is now only 31%\nLets see how LOW they can go!

Very good question, in fact the smartest one I heard in a while. I have to agree to a certain degree, by definition a real think-tank can not afford to be limited in its intellectual scope, so conservatism and a think-tank can not really go together (just like a communist think-tank, or an Islamic fundamentalist think-tank). You may limit your thought process within the realm of what ever ideology you want to but that would not be a think-tank but a project group at its best
Different time, different culture.  Leonardo had patrons.  They would tell him what they wanted done, and he would do it for them.  On the side, he did his other stuff, but most of it was done for money, as he wouldn't have survived otherwise.

u r still lucky the illegals don't cause any terrorist activities, here in India they illegaly come into this country from bangladesh and cause terrorist activities. The maoist from the nepal side. The bodo's from Burma side . The LTTE from the Sri Lankan side and yes finally our friendly neighbourhood country pakistan the less said is better.
I loved it - a very peaceful day.Can you do that again?
The idea of a child being 'illegitimate' is very out of date. All children have the same rights whether they were born in or out of wedlock. Mind you, i'm only talking about most western jurisdictions; i don't know about ALL the jurisdictions.

No you do not need a warrant to be shown to you.  Most law enforcement can arrest if there is an outstanding warrant for your arrest on file.
In late-April 1993, the United States learned that terrorists had attempted to assassinate Bush during his visit to Kuwait. The Kuwaiti authorities arrested 17 persons suspected in the plot to kill Bush using explosives hidden in a Toyota Landcruiser. The Kuwaitis recovered the Landcruiser, which contained between 80 and 90 kilograms of plastic explosives connected to a detonator ( the Bush device or Bush explosive device ). The Kuwaitis also recovered ten cube-shaped plastic explosive devices with detonators (the cube-bombs ) from the Landcruiser. Some of the suspects reportedly confessed that the Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS ) was behind the assassination attempt.

"He will need to pay that No Proof of Insurance/Driver Responsibility fee to Michigan, plus pay for a ""Clearance"", which is about 35 bucks and proves the fine has been paid, (and a ""Reinstatment"" fee to Sec. of State in Michigan in order to get his Michigan License back, or get that Birth Certificate he needs in order to get the Florida License).  I'm sure if he explains his situation to the judge, he'll get off with court costs at the most, and possibly have to show that he has taken care of it all by such and such date.  He'll be fine.  The good news is that his license was only suspended because of an unpaid fee, not points."

Actually, Lybia has been working for many years to get off of the list. The list of State Supporters of Terrorism is compiled by the US State Department, and it is based on many different things, one of which includes attempts at acquisition of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nIn addition to reaching a financial understanding with the families of the Lockerbee tragedy, in the last few years Lybia has renounced their stockpile of various weapons and has invited international inspection. The Lybian government has also stated that it will no longer give monetary and protective aid to international terrorists. \n\nTo answer your other question, the Venezuelan government continues to offer monetary and protective support to leftist guerillas and terrorists in Columbia, which does a great deal to extending the tragedy in that part of the world. Yes, part of the problem between the USA and Venezuela is economic, part is personal, but part is also about the legitimate danger of terrorism to the region.

By all means necessary. Curfews will keep crime down and deaths lowered.  Teens under 18yrs should have their bodies at home when the sun goes down. Teens today, have no idea what it means to be an adult nor do they understand how dangerously it is out there.  Home study will keep them out of trouble and from harms way. Yes, a curfew should be nationwide and until the teen, is 21years old. When they reach 21, I might let them go out, but with supervision.  I was not allowed to go to after school functions without a chaperon.   As a teen, I'd slip out the window to go with my friends, when I returned home... the window was locked tight, so I had to enter through the front door - Boy did I get spanked and placed on punishment.  Today, my values are high and I can appreciate my parents efforts. I therefore, would not allow my child to be out pass sundown for no reason, unless the child was with me.
republicans want 12 millions new votes for them. no one else would be dumb to do that here
"The way they are rating the ""no child left behind"" system is that schools that are failing will lose funding.  Schools that excel will get funding.  So to me, sounds logical that a child that does not graduate will not get funding (bank loans).  On the military issue, they have already dropped the strict requirements on entry due to the many now out of commission, either through death or through disability.  They will take whatever they can get, including many immigrants who've not received American citizenship.  Those who are less educated only need to know one thing in the military . . how to shoot a gun.  They can teach them that and send them to the frontline as expendables."
If a person has a warrant on them, but it is in another state or another county in that state, the officer who stops them tells them and details them up to 30 minutes while they check with that department that has the warrant.\n\nDepending on what it is for and where it is at, the supervisor in charge at the time it is checked will decide if they want to pay to have them bought in.\n\nFor example if it is a bench warrant for not appearing on a traffic ticket in California and you are in Ga, they aren't going to pay to have your bought to California\n\nNow they can but normally  don't.\n\nThis does not do away with the warrant, it is still active and the next time another supervisor may decide to bring them in, or if they are caught closer they may be taken in.
WHEN THE OIL OF IRAQ IS COMPLETELY STOLEN BY THE TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS, I GUESS IT WILL BE IRAN NEXT. VENESUELLA CAN BE THE THIRD IN ORDER OF \n\n\n\nNow that we live in the age of disinformation, maybe it won't make any difference to you. The ages are getting darker and darker. And I wanted to share with you the following facts: If you agree with me please send them to as many friends of you as possible... \n\nThe transnational companies which are using American government and ARMY to sip oil from Iraq are paying back with some of the money they have earned by selling the oil they have been continuously stealing from Iraq. They will do the same in Iran and Venezuella.\n\nYou won't believe it but some transnational companies are there to force the Yahoo Corp. to delete my questions here. But I am continuously changing my name to hide it from them. Until they find me, thousands of people will have learned that America is no more controlled by its national companies. Transnational companies are a great threat both for America and the world. A transnational company is one that feels no loyalty to any nation. They don’t pay any taxes to any government and they are strong enough to overthrow governments all over the world. For the time being they are using Americans. They threat America by the fact that if they draw their capital and investments from America 25 % of its population will be jobless. \n\nThe fight and the tension between the members of the Senate is in fact a fight between the American and non-American capital owners. Right after the 9/11 the nationalistic or loyal American capital owners became a little bit stronger and passed a decree from the senate to the effect that the central government and the states are to buy their weapons from NATIONAL war industries... But at present non-American capital owners have become stronger enough to sip petroleum out of Iraq by using American ARMY. This is the horrible fact about American Politics and Bush is not loyal to America.\n\nSorry for the terrible English. Wish you prosperity and happiness. I am a mere warrior to enlighten people about facts.… Yes, they are my facts. But believe me they aren’t groundless.

This is where you calculate how big the building will be. An example would be: if your building a house thats going to be 60 feet long and 30 feet wide, then the sqaure feet would be to multiply them together. So for this building it would be 1800 square feet.
I had more than enough five years ago.
I would say so... they know politicians depend on their contributions (people vote for whomever advertises the most it seems).\nCorporations want to make more money and spend less regardless of laws or ethics... so illegal immigrants are a great money saver...
"Central Intelligence Agency\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is an intelligence agency of the United States Government, responsible for obtaining and analyzing information about foreign governments, corporations, and individuals, and reporting such information to the various branches of the Government. A third function of the CIA is to act as the ""hidden hand"" of the government by engaging in covert operations, some of questionable legality, at the direction of the President. [1] It is this last function that has caused most of the controversies regarding the CIA over the years."
"I agree with you and most of the comments thus far.  Immigration is wonderful.  \n\nThere are laws, policies and procedures that govern Legal immigration.  Please, everyone who wants to come to this great land, come join the fun.  Just do it legally.\n\nThe laws may not be working perfectly.  The good news is that we have a way to change the laws legally.  As voters, we need to get to the pools and elect legislatures that will vote the way we want them to regardless of the subject.  The U.S. has one of the largest apathetic voter pools in the world, yet most will sit back and blame the government when they as a voter have done nothing to shape the government.\n\nWe all also need to return to 9th grade Civics class.  The president is ONE man.  The laws are written and approved by Congress before they reach his desk.  Congress also provides all the money and support for the presidents plans, yet the congressional candidiates receive the least amount of publicity.  They just get re-elected over and over until their term limit hits.  We need to clean house, and I mean clean ""House"", and ""Senate"" when I say that.\n\nOther than that I don't feel too strongly about the subject, maybe you are a racist, I don't know."
it will send a clear message to immigrant freeloaders everywhere that if they can't get by where they're at- to not bother immigrating to a right windg country where their freeloading won't be tolerated.
Static means staying as is, not changing.  What's the context in which the word is used?
"I think it was a powerful message - symbolic more than anything.\n\nI would hope they do something productive. If you take into account the amount of people that demonstrated, your dealing with alot of clout. It would be politically wise to do something.\n\n1) It does help the economy. If legalized they will pay taxes and contribute to this society.\n2) It will show that America is a ""land of opportunity"", as stated by the founders of this country.\n\n... I'm sure many racist might disagree, but I believe it makes sense to do something smart."
"Yes they can do a surprise inspection with no notice, but the second part of your question (without reason) is another matter.  OSHA inspections result from worker or public complaints, safety violations you have reported, direct observation by an OSHA employee from nearby property, you are doing work that requires a safety plan that you have submitted, or it is just your turn on the list that they keep.  Many industries such as asbestos workers get inspected routinely as part of OSHA programs.  So they always have a reason, even if it is ""just your turn"".  You should also document the reason.  They should at least tell you in general.  If not, call the local office."
The only way you can do that is if the employee signs a form for the old employer to tell your new employer what you've made .I am a business owner and that's the only way I can verify that...
"The wave of patriotism that swept the nation after 9/11 was a double-edged sword.  If someone who was already leaning toward military service decided to enlist, that may have been the reason.  But the ads for the services tend to focus on the ""glamour"" and not all the truly grunt work that most enlistees endure.  For every pilot, there are countless, faceless others.  I believe if a more realistic picture were painted, only the truly devoted would sign up, therefore reducing desertion."
Not one honest answer and there isn't likely to be one as they have no defense for stupid.\n\nOh and carry, not Kerry would have been worse. LOL good example of the repug national mentality.
"Because the neocons are victim to what I call the ""pied piper syndrome"". They blindly and unconditionally follow the current criminal administration, Rumsfeld lied and not about BJ he recieved in the Oval office but with regard to something far more detrimental to our country. Thousands of troops have been killed and others have been mamed. I'm with you, I just can't fathom how this criminal administration is supported by some."

No.  Hillary Clinton is a man.
In 2005 the target was 220,000 - 245,000 permanent residents. This comprised of 132,500 - 148,000 in the economic (skilled) class, 51,500 - 56,800 in the family class and 30,800 - 33,800 in the protected persons class.
No, but not because of why you might think. When you profile something, you tend to miss those that don't fit the profile. Example - Terrorist - If I were to profile a terrorist as a foreign born person, perhaps of african or arab decent, probably muslim, I would miss people like McVey, Unibomber, the Columbine boys, or the DC sniper. Just like any other problem that you are trying to solve, you must approach it with an open mind or you will make mistakes. I want law enforcement to catch ALL terrorists, not just the ones that fit the profile. All law enforcement should be done with an open and fair mind to protect us all.\n\nAs far as Terrorism - why is it that white people aren't looked at (profiled) as terrorists when they have done more terrorism than any of the middle eastern people in america?
With all the racism that we are having right now ...maybe like a year or less, but if she is light skinned (not brown) maybe like 2 weeks...you know how's the thing with this guys....

"The government sold pieces of paper called ""war bonds"" for $10, for example. They promised it would be worth $15 in two years. \n\nThe theory was if you gave them money, they could afford to hire companies to build things like tanks and whatnot. That company would then hire local workers and help boost the economy.\n\nWar is good for business. Kind of ironic that the economic growth kills the very same people it benefits."
i feel like were getting bent over by the politicians...\n\nthe lower the politicians and big companies can make wages, the less citizens will want those jobs and thats when they can say we wont take them...\n\nif illegal aliens were deported those jobs would have to pay higher or go away to mechanization...\n\nthe way it is now, illegals are stopping our kids and low income people from taking those entry level jobs...\n\nin construction, illegals working under the table make it cheaper for a company to build something and therefore more competitive and profitable than a company that plays by the rules...
By all means. I would see no problem with that. In fact I already have a friend in mind, and she happens to be a political science major. Just our luck.
Because he is their man.
Last I knew, it was allowed or prohibited on a county by county basis.  The more populated counties prohibit, so that prostitution is illegal in the counties that have Las Vegas, Tahoe, Carson City, Reno in them.\n\nHowever, in each of those cities, the brothels in the next legal county advertise and run shuttle services.

No real reasons to back it up?"
You should specify which state or province you are from, because it varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\n\nHere in Ontario, it also depends on which county or regional municipality you live in.  In some cities, you go to the unified family court.  In other cities or towns, you either go to the Ontario Court of Justice, or the Superior Court of Justice, depending on what the issues are.  If it is a divorce, or if there are property issues, you must go to the Superior Court.  If it is simply custody and access, child support, or a child protection matter, you go to the Ontario Court.
Why SHOULDN'T it?\n\nYou do the crime, you serve the time and pay the price. These are the reprocussions for the individual's CHOICE to do criminal activity. We are the only ones responsible for our actions, and we have to live with the consequences. I will not lose sleep if a criminal cannot get a job as a manager of a bank.
There are several, some of them are:\nAssaults, burglary, criminal damage to property, using a motor vehicle without the ownes permission, issuing bad checks, bribery, robbery, bigamy, incest, harassment, etc
If kept in a clean and dry place and the original seal is in tact, it should last a long time.\n\nThat being said, it's still a good idea to have it inspected anually by a extinguisher service company.  CO2 units DO NOT typically have a pressure guage and can leak.  Halongenated Agents, Pressurized Water, and Dry Chemical types do have a pressure guage or indicator button so at least you know the unit is up to pressure. \n\nIn the United States, CO2 and Pressurized water units must be hydrotested every 5 years.  Dry Chemical and Halogenated Agent units must be instpected internally every 6 years and recharged and come due for a hydrotest every 12 years.  If a unit fails this test, then it must be replaced.  Sometimes, depending on the size of the unit, it may just be less expensive to consider replacing the unit instead of paying for the test and possibly having it fail.  \n\nSomething of note: NFPA 10 (the national standard on portable fire extinguishers) is coming out with a new edition that will mandate the replacement of any stored-pressure dry chemical older than 1984.

Sure,\nIf you are a desperate president who is loosing popularity and lives in the bubble world and has an air head as your wife and adviser, and your brain is going to be indicted and you are loosing on everything you have ever touched, from your daddies money to your own company, to your own started war, then yes, the immigrant issue is important.\n\nAnd if you are an American who do not buy any cheap products, willing to let your kids clean up hotels and wash public bathrooms for 3$/hour and do a lot of low paid low appreciated job, yes, you can do better not having the immigrants.\n\nBut as I can say, you are one of those low lives who can not even wipe you own ass and believe in the BS you are saying, forgetting the fact that your grand parents probably came to America so you little retard can act as if you are the owner of the world and live you pathetic life.

Tell your credit card company, that is being charged not to pay.  Give them the documentation that you have cancelled.  The credit company will stop paying the charge.\n\nIf you are asking about the money already paid, you should ask your credit card company, and see if they will help.  You should write to the company and demand a refund  --  send a letter with details of the cancellation --  but don't expect much out of that.  You could then sue in small claims court, but even if you win it might cost more than it would be worth to collect the award.\n\nIn writing to the company, you should let them know that you will be reproting them to the better business bureau, the state consumer fraud division, and other such places unless you can work things out satisfactorily.

Yes...I have seen those posts, and plenty of them and again Yes i do think it is very funny. I think the posts are mostly from supporters of illegals already established in America. There is a difference between supporting immigrants and supporting illegal immigrants. The vast majority of people who claim they are supporting immigrants are really supporting ONLY illegals. If they were actually supporting immigrants they would be just as offended as Americans and Legal immigrants by the way these illegals show no respect for those who actually entered this country by the legal process.
god is in America, and if you actually believe in him....HE WOULD NOT BE SPREADING HATE!  saying we accept homosexuality? god forgives all and you are saying that god forgives a man the cheats on his wife, but god will not forgive someone who is gay?  well what about all the priests touching little kids? are they going to hell? hmmmmm???????  the priests should be allowed to marry women, then they can focus on god and not their penis or a child......gross!!!!!!!!!!\n\nhow godly is touching a kid? that is nasty and i would take my chances being gay before being a child molester!\n(this from an American strait woman!)\nGOD FORGIVES EVERYONE, NOT JUST THE SELECT FEW....READ THE BOOK AGAIN! you are only reading what you want to read!\n\nsorry just my thoughts!

Don't know what it said.  Been looking for it on the internet, but no one seems to know what it says at all.
Look at politicians today. The new thing is to apologize but not apologize. Be remorseful, but not guilty. Time will only tell what the future holds, but it is rampant. Nixon was faced with impeachment and was embarrassed to resignation. Clinton was impeached and was hardly embarrassed. The difference? Time. Today people say impeach Bush, go ahead, who cares? This could truly affect our future.
"I am very concerned!!.....the question is not ""when"" are they going to contact the vets effected.......its more like ""HOW"" are they going to contact every vet effected....HOW will they  know ...how convienient for the government, with all the to do about so many illegals in this country what a simple way to get them in...identity theft...and then the can take their stolen paperwork..send to the archives and get a fresh copy of the DD214 and have vets bennies as well as their pensions and social security...and when it all comes out in the wash the government can say OOPS...26.5 million is an awful lot of illegals..."
There's been enough talk already.  World forums tend to be big bloated finger-pointing sessions. Instead of getting together and trying to point fingers at each other we all need to look at our own lives and decide how we can reduce our impact on the Earth.  \n\nTalk is cheap.  Action is necessary.  Actually inaction is necessary.  Its more important what you don't do than what you do do.  \n\nDon't drive your car so much.  Don't use a gas-powered leaf blower.  Don't burn so much oil.  Don't heat your house so much.  Don't use so much air conditioning.\n\nWe know what to do.  We just have to find the courage to start doing it.
If you read this you will find that the Supreme Court held it was a violation of the 4th and 14th amendment to even stop a car and check their registrations without cause. It's illegal!.\n\nOn certiorari, the United States Supreme Court affirmed. In an opinion by White, J., joined by Burger, Ch. J., and Brennan, Stewart, Marshall, Blackmun, Powell, and Stevens, JJ., it was held that, (1) as a preliminary matter, the court had jurisdiction in the case at bar even though the Delaware Supreme Court had held that the stop at issue not only violated the Federal Constitution but also a provision of the state constitution substantially similar to the Fourth Amendment, since the Delaware Supreme Court had not rested its decision independently on the state constitution but had based its decision on the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, having followed the approach, consistent with previous opinions of the Delaware Supreme Court, of interpreting the state constitutional provision in terms of the breadth and scope of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, and (2) a policeman's stopping an automobile and detaining the driver in order to check the driver's license and the registration of the automobile constitute an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, except in those situations in which there is at least an articulable and reasonable suspicion that a motorist is unlicensed, or that an automobile is not registered, or that either the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise subject to seizure for violation of law, such rule against random stops and detentions, however, not precluding a state from developing methods for spot checks that involve less intrusion or that do not involve the unconstrained exercise of discretion, such as, for example, the questioning of all oncoming traffic at roadblock-type stops.\n\nBlackmun, J., joined by Powell, J., concurred, with the understanding that (1) the court's allowing spot checks that do not involve the unconstrained exercise of discretion would include, in addition to a roadblock stop for all traffic, other stops that were not purely random and that equate with, but are less intrusive than, a 100% roadblock stop, and (2) the court's decision was distinguishable, for purposes of constitutionality, from individualized random examinations by game wardens in the performance of their duties.
Yes, this is a major problem, considering it's the same M249 that our own military uses.  They're cool machine guns.  The problem is that they are made and manufactured by US.  It'd be interesting to know how the hell some terrorist buttplugger got it.
All permanent residents are required to have a permanent resident card to gain entry back into Canada.

Still true today, as it was yesterday.  In the past, it was diseases that inflicted greater losses on a field army. Proper field sanitation and proper food handling is an imperative for the maintaining of a viable, combat ready field army.
Your question doesn't have any meaning and i will tell you why.\n\n1) They are already drowning the country down (Yours, mine and all the countries where they go)\n2) You're not considering the LEGALS who don't share the views of your guesting country and that, should ever a party of immigrates (muslims, spanish etc), be created they would vote massively for those, in order to gain more power.\n3) Legals and illegals make kids like rabbits, so sooner or later they will outnumber anyone. The poorest they are, the more the kids (I'll let you think about the consequences).\n4) All the western civilized countries are under an invasion they are not ready to afford (In the sense that whatever policy they adopt is not right simply because the sole strategy to adopt, i.e. kicking them all off, would be considered inhuman by other countries).\n5) When countries will begin to react to this massive invasion, in many cases it will be too late, as the amount of immigrates of a certain religion or racial group would be such that kicking them away will be impossible.\n6) Sooner or later they will begin to organize themselves into political or pressure groups, which with money or media will affect all decisions of your government.
I agree. Reagon more or less won the cold war for the US and Clinton presided over one of the greatest periods of economic boom in US history
"I like some of your ideas. Enlisting foreigners in the military won't work because the military could easily get spies or traitors in it. I'm not sure because I'm not sure of the precautions the military takes. But if an illegal immigrant if forced to enter the army and is offered money to be a traitor, you see the temptation. They could hurt us alot that way. It is also possible that that use may help the us also. I'm not sure.\n\nI definetly like the idea of cutting off welfare. I have several members of my extended family on welfare, they could work, they just don't want do and want to eternally go to school to increase their eductation until they can get a easy, high paying job.\nBorder security must always be a main issue, a country is stupid to say ""welcome anyone without any security"" your welcoming invasion and crime. Criminal illegal aliens should definetly be deported."

"They thought it was save thousands of US soldiers and Japanese people if we had to carpet bomb japan and invade it. I don't know why they dropped two though. Truman rationalized it's dropping by saying they were dropped on ""purely military targets"" which is not the truth, nor is that it would save innocent Japanese lives.\n\nI am not sure it saved that many innocent people as almost half a million people died in the attacks and there were no significant military in either city where the bombs were dropped, contrary to what Truman thought.\n\nIn Nagasaki alone almost 1/4 million people were wiped from the face of the earth, so Truman's innocent people theory was bogus.\n\nIt did bring to end the war within a few days. The United Nations  was born within 4 months of the Bombing.\n\nAnd Atom bombs ARE nuclear. If they weren't why did thousands die of exposure to radiation? They certainly are NOT conventional weapons. The bombs were dropped within 3 days of each other and people couldn't watch 230.000 innocent men, women and children die from their living room television as they could watch the ""war"" Iraq from media moles planted with combat units.\n\nIt also began the nuclear age which is exactly what the government was warned about and petitionrd by the scientist that developed it. They wanted to use it for peaceful purposes, not to kill a half million people and begin an arms race."
Actually, Hamdi wasn't released. He was forcibly deported.\n\nAnd the Bush administration ignored the Hamdi ruling in the matter of Jose Padilla, who was held without charges for years until being charged with unrelated crimes a few months ago.\n\nThe Real ID Act in July 2005 changed the Habeas procedure in certain cases, including most immigration deportation cases, to eliminate Habeas review at the Federal District Court level, though Circuit Court of Appeals review is still available.\n\nFinally in December 2005, the Senate passed a bill [S. 1042] removing the rights of 'enemy combatants' to challenge their status in any federal courts, thus eliminating Habeas review. This is the infamous Graham amendment, and was publicly supported by the White House. \n\nIt was later merged into the appropriations bill, along with  Senator McCain's Anti-Torture provisions, which this bill largely bypasses. Bush signed the bill into law, along with the infamous signing statement where he claims presidential authority to ignore the laws prohibiting torture and fair treatment or prisoners whenever he sees fit.

I'm guessing that he is just a young anti war protester, pretending to be a vet, who is just getting his kicks winding people up by making more and more outrageous statements.\n\nI absolutley respect his right to free speech but I have two problems with his postings.\n\n1) They are not questions, they are statements, and this is a site where people want to get answers to questions, not propaganda.\n2) Some of what he says is offensive and upsetting to people who are either out there or who have loved ones out there (military and civilian). For example describing the beheaders and bombers as brave. \n\nIf he is a vet, he has almost certainly never been in an active war zone in any capacity which you can tell from the naivety of his observations.\n\nIts all a bit sad really.

Australia they will put you jail and nothing you can. canada i don't know but someone will help you,\nThysaint
The Soviet Army left!  Then Austria was able to become a neutral country, but also democratic, free and with a capitalist system (with a strong welfare state).  The Soviet Union was a catastrophe for Austria.  They killed thousands (including my grandfather's younger brother, who was shot in the head in front of his parents on his 16th birthday), raped thousands of women, burned and destroyed many building and shipped scientists, experts and even factories down to the bricks to the USSR.  Political expression was restricted and people were mostly poor.  The signing of the State Treaty that declared Austria’s neutrality (and the withdrawal of the USSR Forces) was an event without which Austria could never have become what it is today.\n\nThis is also the period of shared power between the Austrian people's Party (OVP) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP).  They ruled in a coalition almost the entire time (the exception was when one controlled the executive alone, but only for a few years).  They used to be enemies and even fought a low-level civil war in the 1920s, but the Nazis treated them both equally terribly, so party leaders realized that the other party wasn't nearly as bad as they thought, and that things could get a lot worse, and were able to cooperate a bit better once they had a chance to regain power.\n\nThis power share ended in 1999 when the Freedom Party of Austria (FPO) won 27% of the vote, which put them in second place after the SDP.  This obligated the SDP to form a coalition with the FPO and the chain of continuous power sharing between the OVP and SPO was ended.  The next elections yielded an OVP-FPO coalition, although since then the FPO has lost a lot of popularity and did poorly in regional local elections getting a fraction over 10% of the vote), followed by a defection of many FPO leaders to form a new party, the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), so it is likely that the SDP and OVP coalition could be back on during the next national elections. \n\nPeople made a big fuss over the FPO making it into the coalition, but I always thought that they were a bit stupid, as the FPO had won 22% of the vote during the previous parliamentary elections, which was not enough to get them in the coalition but still pretty close, so the fact that they managed to pick up five more points wasn’t exactly the political shock many outside of Austria liked to pretend it was. I really don’t like the FPO and I’ll be glad to see them go, but they aren’t Nazis.  They are just a very conservative European party, and the other countries lead by other European parties threatened by similar parties in their own countries took the opportunity to denounce the FPO in an effort to similarly denounce their own rivals.
The U.S.S.R. was involved because they were the main enemy to the U.S. in the Cold War (1945- 1990). Understand that the U.S.S.R. helped the Allies out in WWII, and at the Yalta conference with Winston Churchill, and FDR, they all decided that the smaller countries such as Poland (invaded by Nazi Germany) and Czechoslovakia would decide how they wanted their government to be. The U.S.S.R didn't keep this promise, and these countries became communist.
Hopefully to scare the ignorant away. People should read more and try to educate themselves, to more effectively understand the English language. Its sad that a child who likes to read has a higher intellect than most of the populace in the US. Pathetic, really. Normal folks are literate and therefore should read. Period. There are countries that cannot afford to give their children an effective education like we can and we abuse it too much!
There's always at least one dumb nut that's gonna call you racist for wanting to protect our borders. Like we're all one race in this country. Not a bad idea, though. It would at least make them take notice of what the people want.
I, for one am proud of our American troops that are stationed in Iraq, and I also know that it is not easy being in a foreign country in the middle of nowhere. But some people do not or would not understand the situation if it were standing before them. Our soldiers understood the perils that they would be facing in going to war, they did not go with their eyes closed. All the armed forces that are stationed there need our full support, and that we are behind them twenty four seven for them. Some of us U.S. citizens won't be able to pay you for what you are doing for all the Americans. MAY GOD BLESS EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU FOR A JOB WELL DONE. and we'll be praying for your safe return.
if kerry had been elected,the economy would be in the can,and we just might of gotten hit again.
Crap.  I believe that it has gotten easier, but not that easy.  \n\nA cell phone????  Perhaps during AIT, and then only on weekends or during the evenings when you have down time.\n\nSmoking???? The Army is death on smoking anyhow, so I don't see that happening.\n\nPush ups and running are part of the physical training program and endurance training.  You will do these things.
I am guessing that you are attempting to report the killing of an elk within the Park boundaries.  Park Rangers are in charge of law enforcement within the National Park System. I would recommend contacting  Jim Capps, Supervisory Park Ranger for Rocky Mountains NP. His phone number is 970 586-1518 and his e-mail is Jim_Capps@partner.nps.gov.
It is sick and sad. And while I do not condone what was done... we are in a time of war. And if these civilians posed a threat (or if the Marines thought that they posed a threat) then they did their duty. However- if it was a callous act of murder--- then they must be punished according to international laws. It is a shame. But is DOES NOT diminish my faith in our military forces. God Bless the Troops... and bring them home again.
Mexico doesn't want to fix their problems. The US is run by big business that want the cheap labor. Mexico even gives these people pamplets telling them how to sneak across the border, get fake id and social security numbers, and get welfare. \n\nThe illegal Mexican immigrants are invading this country trying to take it over. It's encouraged by Mexico and the American businesses who use them for cheap labor. Their loyalty is to Mexico. They proved that during one of the first rallies when they took down the American flag, hung up the Mexican flag, and then hung the American flag upside down underneath it. THAT is how they feel about America. \n\nhttp://michellemalkin.com/archives/004869.htm\n\nThen the people who want to appease them pull out the excuses about how people who are not even alive now, and haven't been for hundreds of years, 'stole' the land from the American Indians. Even American politicians are carrying out this traitorous attack on our sovereignty! If this keeps up, the United States of America will become a 3rd world country, just like Mexico! Mexico's problems are not the fault of Americans, but they are becoming our problems because the Mexicans are invading us and bringing their problems with them.\n\nThe illegals make up about 5 % of the work force. The unemployment rate is about 4.5%. Keep in mind that the unemployment rate does NOT represent everyone who is unemployed. It only counts those who are collecting unemployment. Everyone else's plight is ignored. The unemployment rate if everyone was counted would be tremendous. We do NOT have a shortage of labor, we have a large surplus. The more illegals that come in and take our jobs at minimum wage or less (often less) puts more and more Americans out of a job. Most of these Americans are never counted in the unemployment rate if they do not manage to get unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits are hard to receive.\n\nIllegals draw welfare by stealing people's social security numbers and identities. That means there are a lot of people being directly hurt by these people as well. Innocent people are having their credit ratings ruined, having IRS problems, and social security problems. If someone who has had their social security number stolen gets married, if either spouse dies or become disabled then they can be denied their benefits. \n\nMy family moved to the US before WWII. Those of my family that didn't make it over got killed by the death camps. Our family assimilated to the American culture. We didn't expect the Americans to change to suit us. The illegal immigrants from Mexico are not civilized like that.\n\nThey not only changed the National Anthem to Spanish, they changed the words. They already burn our flag and hang our flag upside down. They waved the Mexican flag during a lot of their protests. Some schools have stopped hanging the American flag and forbidden students from wearing clothes with any part of the American flag on their clothing all to keep from offending the Mexicans. It's nothing short of an attack of our country, not only by the illegal aliens, but those who seek to appease them. \n\nI am tired of the stereotype that Americans wouldn't do the work that illegals do. Illegals do all kinds of jobs for less than minimum wage which drives the wages down for U.S. citizens. Construction jobs are an example. There are lots of illegals doing construction jobs that Americans used to do because the companies can keep more of the profits if they pay less for the workers. All that does is make companies wealthier and Americans poorer. Illegals are stealing jobs that Americans have done for years.
I will say, its not the time yet we abolish reservations in all sectors.Also i will say it's completely illogical on behalf of Arjun Singh.I am not against reservations in India but i am completely against the criteria on basis of which reservations are encouraged.\nReservations,if implemeted in right spirit, are made for weaker people to bring them at par with middle class.However the irony is, reservations in India are provided on the basis of Caste and class which in itself is targeted to attract vote bank by politicians.Now weaker people mean Economically backward people,the person might be a SC,ST or a Hindu or Brahmin.\nFor a huge country like India,limited reservations(not as larger at 49.5 %),can work wonders as it will help more than 26% of people suffering under poverty line to be among consuming middle class.But alas our LEADERS are more concerned about staying LEADERS capitalizaing on short-term vision of the masses.

Dumb question, SAVING LIVES! Kept guys from falling off the skid of the helo (Bell-47) and itt is still used LIGHTWEIGHT and usedlow angle evacustions
"Illegal immigration describes migration across national borders without complying with the legal requirements. Some people call those they suspect of illegally immigrating, ""illegal immigrants"" or ""undocumented immigrants"". \n\nPeople who arrive in a legal manner but then outstay their visas (that is the authorized time in the host country), may also have illegal status. The term illegal immigrant is highly contested because some consider it unnecessarily pejorative"
"Why is any group of people blind, that they don't realize that the government is feeding them lies.....?\n\nHonestly, it is probably because most people don't care - they are more concerned with the small picture instead of the large one. Ignorance is bliss....so do you really blame them for wanting a happier life?\n\nP.S. Your question was about the American people being blind. You also state the government. Then you attack ""HIM"" in your second statement. Why do you ask questions that you already know your own answer too? Is it to trigger a debate? Is it to state your own biased opinion? Are you superior because you are the only one that can truely see the lies ""he"" (the government) feeds us? What makes you immune to the lies?\n\nNo one is better in this world. Everyone lies, everyone believes lies. Are you blind for stereotyping the whole of America?"
Well then you really have not solved the energy problem have you???\n\nYou cannot pick on piece of the puzzle, lay it on the board and claim to have solved it.
Not only Texans.  I don't think Sam Walton was a Texan, was he?  Walmart has been in trades with countries known for sweat shop activities (remember Kathy Lee?  Sorry if you were trying to forget ;) ), and by buying all that merchandise at insanely low prices with 100% to 1000% markups, they are one of the worst examples of how big industry draws away form the American consumers and American workers.  I say we should embargo everybody.  Let's get somebody in office with enough balls to take the free trade agreement and wipe their ass with it.
Since you've waited a long time for the answer, I would try looking it up on Google, or a site that helps you find colleges in America.  They would help you a lot more than most people on Yahoo Answers.
I agree with each of the first three statements.\n\nThe biggest problem I see today is the uncontrolled cronyism. The bushies time in office has been spent in making money for his butt buddies or silencing those that are critical of his ways.   \nLook at Abramahof!!!\nThe solution is for people to get out and VOTE in their local, state, and federal elections.
Family tree that my mother has and photos. Why?
Rich people getting away with stuff is the Republican way.  Rush is a racist, sexist, hypocritical moron and I hate him.
Wills can be hadwritten, or typed and signed without needing an attorney.  If he did soemthing like that, and then buried the will in a shoebox in the backyard, well, it woudl be a legal and binding will, if only it could be found.  Unfortunately that is a problem with wills, they are somewhat easy to create, but you do need to make sure that someone knows where it is.  As another poster suggested, speaking with a local attorney and checking all records for safety deposit boxes, or even a handwritten note that is actually a will could do it for you.
"The UN is a nice idea - you know, a friendly little angel that watches over and makes sure everyone plays nice with each other - but in all the years the UN has been in existence it has failed to intervene because conflicts have either been deemed ""domestic issues"" (like civil wars/genocides) that they can't get involved with or they have failed to follow through on their own resolutions. It doesn't work because the system is bad and because different countries can block actions that don't suit their interests - for example the UN did nothing to stop the Cold War because both the US and Russia were a part of the decision-making team and couldn't pass resolutions over the other. The UN would work well in a perfect world - but if it were a perfect world we wouldn't need the UN. :)"
If the Republicans are still in charge, it will be like a third world country.  A tiny number of people will be very rich, everyone else will work for them and have nothing.
"It wasn't just the jews, hun.  \n\nThe nazis weren't acting out of hate, like Stalin.  They were doing what they deemed right.  ""The Path to Hell Is Paved with Good Intentions"".  \n\nThey wanted a master race, and sorry to say, but jews, and miscellaneous others did not fit that category.\n\nThey did whatever they could to accomplish the master race.  They weren't exactly hating the people.  They were just using the same cruelty we use when we experiment on animals, or give them horribly adverse living conditions.  We view ourselves better, and them as inferior and having no feelings, and no right to live happily.  That's what the nazis did to various people groups.\n\nStalin just treated anyone badly that he could treat badly, and enforced a ""Harvest of Despair"".  You should watch the documentary below:"
hey distinguished professor of economics....i think you forgot the tax guy that the 10th guy would be able to hire to find enough loop holes so that he wouldn't have to pay anything.  Your theory looks good on paper, but it doesn't come anywhere close to reality.  In real life the guys in the middle are paying the lions share, while the poorest and richest are paying virtually nothing.  The only fair tax plan would be a % of gross wages across the board, including incentives, bonuses and stock options.\n\nI'm not sure Communism would be so bad, but i'm sure if it ever came about, we'd be wishing for capitalism and democracy again!
The answer is four. \nBetter yet, can Republicans do this: \n4 years of an idiot in office + electing the idiot AGAIN = ?\nAnswer : A party full of morons!!!
Sounds like you are the HATER!
The single largest factor which effects gas prices is the cost of refining.  If you notice the countries with the highest gas prices, none of them have the capability to refine.\n\nEven back when gas was .30, .40, .50 cent a gallon in the US it was $2-$3 a gallon in Europe.\n\nIn Brazil, Petrobas is their source of gas and it is state owned company.  Gas sells for over $3.50 US a gallon.  You must be referring to natural gas used for heating which sells for less but I can't imagine $0.16 a gallon is acorrect figure even for natural gas.

"We should care what other countries think about us because we use other countries resources.This isn't to say we wouldn't be fine without those resources however we don't want everyone to ebargo us... that would be detramental to our nation...Furthermore, there are some countries we just really don't need on our backs or bad side. Have you ever heard of a little thing called Pearl Harbor? Or how about this lil saying??? ""It's not the size of the dog in the fight,but the size of the fight in the dog."" if we upset too many countries and they team up against us then what might happen? We might not seem so powerful then in comparison..."
"Since this question asked for the political problem DURING WWII, and the rest of the group mainly spoke of AFTER WWII let me take a crack at it.  \n\nCharles de Gaulle as the leader of the ""FREE FRENCH"" sought influence in the decisions and plans regarding the future of France.  While the scared and Nazi sympathetic Vichy government practiced appeasement (boy doesn't that sound familiar)the Free French led by the self-appointed De Gaulle meddled in military plans while living in exile in England.  The political problem arises from the idea that England is trying to stave off attack and total domination of Europe by Hitler and the Nazis, and Roosevelt is trying to conquer an evil force trying to take over the world. Both do not consider France and other conquered countries to be more than Nazi strongholds now.  Counter to the production of the anti-Nazi forces, De Gaulle insists that France will reign again, outside forces will have to go through him to do any planning regarding French soil, and the allies must deliver a regained France to him as leader of the Free French who never were defeated (except that the approx 10k troups had to be lifted by boat to their new home in England.\n\nThe allies should have ignored and thrown de Gaulle out on his ear.  He was nothing then, he was nothing as a prime minister, and he died being considered a loser by most.\n\nThis is what happens when you allow an unimportant leader to have say.  Too many parallels to today's France."
you know what there are rules for a reason the government isn't gonna change that , it would show weakness . so yeah it was stupid for them to lose money that they could have earned that day working. personally if i was a employer  I would treat them like they wanted to be treated I would tell them like i would tell a legal American , you skip work your fired!
"Oh most definitely - I mean they couldn't print it without it being true right?\n\n(I really wish that computers has a setting for ""extreme sarcasm"")"
Actually yes and no; they are open in their pursuit of nuclear technology but yes in that they are hiding their intention to build nuclear weapons behind rhetoric that says they only want energy.\n\nIf they only wanted energy it would be given to them through nuclear power plants they could own in Russia (it was offered to them by Russia) but they said no.  Obviously they don't want just nuclear power, but the bombs that can be made with nuclear materials.
Not a chance. She's now doing Bush bidding. She follows the lead of the worst president in the history of the United States. By being in Bush's team shes stained her name. Just like Collin Powell did. He could have been the first African American President but threw it all away lying to the U.N about the W.M.D's in Iraq. So...no, she's not going to the be the first female president. Hillary has the best chances of being the first female president.

It's not meant to be taken literally.  When you have a brother or sister country then you share a bond and have compassion for one another.\n\nIf I'm adopted and my  biological parents had kids, does that not make me their sister?
More new immigrants, hopefully legally trough a comprehensive Guest Worker Program, or if that doesn't materialize, illegal immigrants.\n\nPS: Your assumption is incorrect, they will never raise the pay, they are used to those levels of pay.

YOUR INSANE GET HELP BUDDY
"allright, where to begin, wiretapping american citizens has been going on for as long as it has been technologically possible, every president that could use it did to some degree, Nixon made it his favorite pastime and Bush seems to be obsessed with it, any legal resrictions against wiretaps have never been a problem to get around. Interesting note, Rumsfeld and Cheney also served in the Nixon white house, the same two men serving in the two worst administrations yet, maybe Bush isn't the problem?,..also, you're wrong about only foriegners commiting terrorist acts(remember Oklahoma City, Columbine), truth is, almost all terrorist acts committed on American soil have been committed by American citizens. As an American citizen living on US soil, you are far, far, far, more likly to be killed by someone you know rather than a terrorist, your chances of being killed by a terrorist are about the same as your chances of winning the lottery and being struck by lighting on the same day, gang bangers and carjackers are a much bigger threat to your daily life...Did Bush know about 911 beforehand? Evidence says yes, but not in a malicious, premeditated, way, more like when ""you knew about the test last week but still didn't study"" kinda way, negligence mainly. My personal opinion of Bush is not favorable, he has no idea what life is like for the average American, he's never had to worry about paying the bills,losing a job,paying for health care, the price of gas, none of the things people have to deal with everyday, he has spent his entire life being George Bush Jr.,If he had been anyone else he would be stuck in some obscure mid level management job, he barely graduated high school or college, he barely passed the pilots exam, spent his so called military career being AWOL from the national guard. He ruined every company he ran , basically, he's a rich little frat boy with no grip on reality and no desire to get it."
I have to be crazy, since I'm answering a stupid q like this.
No. Not at all.Iran is different than Iraq.Iranians are a potent military power, possibally possessing conventional, chemical and nuclear WMDs alongwith delivery means. People are more resolute,  determined and motivated. Iranian Shia sect influence covers a number of countries which will engage attackers every where. Such engagement is likely to ruin American economy. Only extremely foolish and idiotic approach can trigger adoption of such option. If Iran is attacked, USA will be ousted for good with all her interests from Middle East including Iraq. Regimes in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq will also get changed.Risks do not favour such stupidity.
yes. the law only looks at the age of the parties at the time of the crime, not when people found out about it.
Right on So Fine this question is way over due. These lying warmongers aren't going to be getting into heaven that is for certain. Jesus has no testaments that say war mongering and profiteering is of God and for the elite class of nutcase Republicans. Those things are from KKK Pat Robinson and KKKarl Rove the Fascist. Democrats will rule the Congress and this will come to and end soon.
Because the USA is greedy and uses more fuel, especially gasoline, that it extracts at present. The cost of extracting US oil is much higher than oil obtained from the Middle East as most countries there literally float on the stuff. Therefore, most US oil companies get their oil from the Middle East as US consumer always tend to kick up hell whenever the price goes up so the oil companies buy the cheapest crude oil they can find, which is in the Middle East.

"I am a liberal, but not a Democrat. I don't hate anyone. What I feel for Bush is more accurately described as distrust and disappointment. I would expect more compassion and tolerence from someone who claims to be a Christian. You and I have disagreed on this before and, while I respect your views, I'm afraid we will continue to disagree. \n\nBut the Spirit produces love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, humility, and self-control. There is no law against such things as these. Galatians 5:22,23\n\nYes, I am a Christian.\n\nEdit: Just as an aside, I have hit the ""report abuse"" button on 2 of the respondants here for ""insulting other participants"".\n\nMycroft - if you paint with a broad brush, you get paint where it doesn't belong."
Can't help you there.
I think it was about 20,ooo,ooo dollars.
Pick up this weeks Rolling Stone. Bush is the WORST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. Great article. I agree he is a moron and as one of my friends put it, he would be better off as a football coach, but even then his team would have the worst record in the league!
As far as I know, you can't sue the federal government or its agencies.
"FEDERAL - The government of the United States, established by the U.S. Constitution, is a federal republic of individual states. The laws of the United States are contained in Acts of Congress; administrative regulations, and judicial cases interpreting the statutes and regulations. The federal government has three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. Through a system of ""checks and balances"", each of these branches has some authority to act on its own, some authority to regulate the other two branches, and has some of its authority, in turn, regulated by one or two other branches.\n\nSTATE - In general, matters that lie entirely within state borders are the exclusive concern of state governments. These include internal communications; regulations relating to property, industry, business, and public utilities; the state criminal code; and working conditions within the state. Within this context, the federal government requires that state governments must be republican in form and that they adopt no laws that contradict or violate the federal Constitution or the laws and treaties of the United States.\n\nLOCAL - Local governments are administrative offices of an area smaller than a state.

"I don't think the world is scared of Israel.  They feel a need to protect it because of the history behind the creation of Israel after the holocaust of WWII. What I don't understand is why Israel is condoned for pushing the border to extend its land at the expense of Palestine.  Anyway from what I understand, the land that is now Israel was not viewed as the ""promised land"" by Jews, it was a place to live and heal after the holocaust. Most Christians in my part of the world believe that if Israel falls it will signify the end of the world as is written in the book of revelations."
Well yes, if your doctor has prescribed a medication to you it doesn't matter if you are in jail or not, its part of your rights, no matter what you have done you have the rights to medical attention, that applies on most countries where human rights are obeyed, even if you are getting executed the next day.

The 1949 Armistice Agreements that Israel signed with its neighbours left 78% of Palestine (17.5% of the 1921-1946 territory of the Mandate which included Transjordan) in its hands. The remaining territories, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank were occupied by Egypt and annexed by Transjordan, respectively.\nAdditionally, the war created about 750,000 Palestinian refugees who had lived inside Israel's borders. It also brought about the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Jews from Arab lands to Israel.\nIn 1949, Israel offered to allow families that had been separated during the war to return, to release refugee accounts frozen in Israeli banks (these were eventually released in 1953), to pay compensation for abandoned lands, and to repatriate 100,000 refugees (about 15% of those who had fled). This number would have included some 35,000 refugees whose return had already been negotiated and was underway. The Arabs rejected this compromise, at least in part because they were unwilling to take any action that might be construed as recognition of Israel. They made repatriation a precondition for negotiations, which Israel rejected. [Palestine Conciliation Commission, September 1949; Prittie, 1975].\nIn the face of this impasse, Israel didn't allow any of the Arabs who fled to return and, with the exception of Transjordan, the host countries where they ended up did not grant them — or their descendants — citizenship. As of today, most of them, and their offspring, still live in refugee camps. The question of how their situation should be resolved remains one of the main issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nAbout 900,000 Jews either were expelled from or voluntarily left their Arab homelands in the Middle East and North Africa. Roughly two thirds of these settled in Israel.
You are talking about is a Continental government.  Not going to happen.  Capitalism demands fences and borders.
Hopefully you mean 'will a woman ever be Prime Minister in the UK AGAIN.....'\n\nIt seems unlikely for the next 10 to 15 years.  Two out of 3 main parties have chosen new leaders recently & the next candidates for the top job for Labour & the Liberals are male.  \n\nHowever there are many excellent candidates further down the greasy pole and it seems likely that some of them will be challenging for the leadership role when Cameron & whoever succeeds Brown/Blair resigns.  You could then see 2 out of 3 major parties led by women.
It is also Christian to be organized, obey the laws and keep a certain order. A society just can't live in chaos just because it would be unchristian to want other people to comply to the rules of a country.
"The purpose of our educational system is to have a better educated citizenry, not to turn a profit.

To those that are cutting down on the minute men,so far they have broken no laws,they carry no arms,they don't arrest anyone,do not compare them to the illegals that are coming across the border every day,all they are doing is pointing out to our border patrol agents where illegals are or where they are coming across,they are doing what a US citizen would do when someone breaks the law no more no less,personally I think people in this country should be thankful someone is looking out for them,that's more than what those yo yo's in Washington are doing.It's funny how bleeding hearts in here want the minutemen out but want the illegals in,first the minutemen are in their own country trying to keep invaders out,it's the illegals that are the ones tresspassing bringing in drugs,diseses and criminals
thats so stupid he wont be there for long dont worry. Bank of America did that to me but i got off they suck .

"There are 3 cases where I feel getting an abortion would be ok. Rape, as the pregnancy is due to an act of violence, severe deformity of the fetus, (not down syndrome or FAS, I mean deformities where it would be unlikely for the child to live for more than a few days after birth), and where giving birth would kill the mother. Abortion is not birth control, though.\n\nThe problem I have with the Pro-Life movement is that, to them, there are no exceptions. They base there stand on strictly religious views and not on the concept of ""greater good"". Is the life of a living, breathing person any less important than that of one who hasn't been born yet? Is it right to bring a child into this world if they will, without a doubt, be dead in a matter of hours? Where's the compassion in that? I know a couple who went through that a few years ago and would not wish it on anyone."

"You were being assessed by a Public Health Nurse.  They did this to me when I was 25, married, & we had no insurance, yet we planned to pay the hospital bill ourselves (& DID)!  They explained to me that they just wanted to ""make sure"" that I had the necessary skills to care for my baby.  They even went so far as to show up at our home & when I refused to let them in, they threatened to take our baby away from us!  This happened in 1979 & we referred to it as the local ""witch hunt"", because the County where we lived was taking children away at an alarming rate for the strangest things, like breast feeding & allowing your baby to sleep in the parents bed!  You have a right to refuse any & all questions until you have a representative in the room with you (anyone will qualify).  Talk to your Doctor & have them make a notation on your chart that you are not to be bothered when you are actually IN the hospital.  Many times, they do this to make sure you are the same person, if there is an identity problem or question once your baby is born & someone tries to remove it from the premises.  They are definately a wierd bunch & the questions they ask should be done in a different manner with a lot more info for the parent/s.  Always ask everyone who has contact with you for their photo ID & it is a good idea to jot their name down in a notebook with the date, time, place,& general description of that person in case anything does happen to your baby & the authorities can track down people who may be there to commit a crime.  There are a LOT of Predators in Hospitals who pose as staff members & go un-noticed due to the high volume of people & traffic in the Hospitals.  You should talk to the HEAD NURSE about this ."
I always wanted to join.  Just to see if I was up to the challenge.  It took me until I was 25 to get the courage and I've got no regrets about it.  It's been an experience I would never have gotten anywhere else.

I live just over 100 miles from the border and I have been thinking about that for a few years now. Ever since the NAFTA agreement opened the border to truck traffic from Mexico.\nThey do not inspect the incoming containers like we do. So a terrorist group could load a container with anything and ship it to Mexico to be transferred to a truck that is going to somewhere in the states and just drive it across the border in San Diego or Texas. Then in just a few days it could be sitting right in-front of the Washington monument and pull the trigger on some big bomb Boom Boom Washington DC.
Politics is compromise.  Unfortunately, the compromise often doesn't work out that well and it can get pretty violent.

And any thoughts that come to mind, that's gonna be your answer to that particular question.\n\nI would agree to the U.S leaving Afganistan solely because I think it's best to fight wars in your own country and stay out of other country's affairs. However, through joint coalitions etc. coutries help each other in time of need.\n\nWhat may happen to the citizens if we leave? I don't know. Terrorists are citizens there too, there is a lot that can happen there. And most of the lot is bad.\nYou're right about one thing there. Life is precious. It's priceless.

"I am about to be 16 right now and this story happened to me when I was almost 15 so a year ago to be more exact a year and 2 months ago. I didn't catch the people breaking into my home but I let them in. I was a naive kid thinking that a doorbell ringing at 10:30 pm was no reason to be cautious. I opened the door to a man who was asking me questions about a party and if ""Kelly"" was home. I should have known right away that his sudden change in stories meant something was up, but I didn't notice a thing. The man pulled a gun at me and I froze my dad who was nearby tried pushing the guy out of the door. I was afraid my dad was going to get shot so I told my dad to stop. We backed off another guy who was hiding around the corner ran in and threw me to the ground and told my dad to get down and kicked him a few times. The guys tied me up threatened to kidnap me and shoot me and all this stuff. They later found my mom in the other room she had no idea what ws going on and the guy cocked the gun pointed at me and told my mom if she didnt tell them where ""the money"" was I was dead. It was a very scary night and those two guys three counting the driver are still out there because of my naiveness or whatever its called."

Who else would not have committed the 5th corps to destroy lee's army there...It was in the perfect position to launch an attack straight up the middle supported by the cav corps too, which for some unexpalined reason Mac kept in the center of his line and not out on the flanks.

Hoover had files on practically everybody.  He considered everybody to be a potential communist.
A lot of people in Mexico have no homes.  They live in garbage dumps(usually in American trash).  Most citizens of Mexico cannot afford medical care, so the infant mortality rate is rather high.  There isn't a civil war going on or anything, but yeah...pretty much refugees!!
The Senate just passed the bill and added a provision that the United States has to consult with Mexican government and get permission before doing anything involving border control such as building a fence. I just saw it reported on Lou Dobbs on CNN.

"I don't think US laws favor the ""criminals"". It's just that one can never know with 100% certainty who is really guilty and who is really innocent, and that introduces a lot of human error into the process. Here are some problems with the American legal system:\n\n-Many states have different types of jail sentences, ranging from very short jail sentences for pretty serious crimes to very long sentences for relatively ""minor"" ones (such as the ""three strikes"" laws in states like Texas and California). These discrepancies mean that you might go to jail for life in Texas because you were caught a third time with a small quantity of an illicit drug but might only spend ten years for murder in one of the more liberal New England states.\n-Often, your legal counsel is nowhere near as important as jury selection. In the OJ case, for example, had the jury been majority white (as opposed to majority black) it is highly likely that OJ would have been convicted. Jury demographics matter a lot. Juries also are relatively poorly educated and have short attention spans. Studies have shown that juries are often more moved by courtroom theatrics and good-looking lawyers and defendants than they are by facts. Good-looking people tend to get more ""fair"" trials than bad looking people.  And race is also involved (white juries will be more inclined to convict a black man than a white one).\n-The Supreme Court has shifted from a more liberal stance to a more conservative one. For example, while the liberal Court of the 1960s and 1970s gave us ""Miranda"" rights, the more conservative Rehnquist Court has tended to side with police and law enforcement. Whereas a defendant might once have gotten off the hook if evidence was obtained without a warrant or if a legal ""technicality"" was breached, nowadays the courts give a lot more leeway to law enforcement (for example, police might come to a person's house with a warrant to search for illegal firearms and arrest a person on the possession of illicit drugs- even if drugs were not specified in the warrant). With the Patriot Act and now wire tapping, the Federal givernment has immensely expanded its ability to search individuals without court warrants.  It remains to be seen if the Supreme Court will weigh in on these measures and whether or not it will deem them un-Constitutional."
Wow, where were you people when Saddam gassed 5,000 of his own people?How about the night of the long knives?What about the mass graves? Kuwait?

Syria?Iran?We know he had some pretty bad chemical weapons because he used them against Iran. But we didn't find anything. Go figure.
Hi Houseman.  It is advisable that both you and your new employer notify the USCIS of your change in employment.  If everything goes smoothly and you can prove that you have a similar job under the new employer, it shouldn't be required.  However there are cases where it helps.\n\neg.\n\nThe USCIS stated in an August 4, 2003 memo that, if a sponsoring employer revokes an approved I-140 petition after the I-485 application has been pending for 180 days or longer, and there is no notification on file that the foreign national is using AC21 portability, the USCIS must then issue a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) the I-485. In order to prevent the USCIS from issuing a NOID, it is generally advisable for the applicant to notify the USCIS of the job change under AC21 as soon as possible. \n\nYou want to make sure you report everything to the USCIS to make sure there is no confusion over your application.
Factual errors: \nAt the end of the movie when the 54th is marching onto the beach to prepare to assault Fort Wagner there are about a dozen cannon present with caissons directly behind them. In reality, caissons, containing large amounts of ammunition, would never be that close together or to the actual artillery piece. By rule of thumb caissons were usually kept approximately 50 yards behind the gun, sometimes more, sometimes less. This was done as a precaution so that if a caisson was struck by an enemy shell it wouldn't explode killing and destroying nearby artillerymen, cannons, and other caissons. Never, ever would caissons be less then 10 feet (as they appear in the movie) in distance to an artillery piece(s).\n\nErrors in geography: \nDuring the assault on Fort Wagner, the regiment is charging the wrong way (the Atlantic Ocean should be on their right since they are moving north).\n\nFactual errors: \nIn the scene the night before the big attack on Fort Wagner you are able to see the men's breath. Highly unlikely weather for the summer (July 1863) in South Carolina.\n\nProbably strayed a little of your question, Just did not want to dissapoint with a short answer.

KBK or MBK are honorable discharges but their are about 75-100 different codes signifying one seperated from the military ie: family hardship is different from the code for someone who got thrown out in basic.

While a large, smelly, rotting carcass is probably not a good thing to have on the beach, I don't understand why someone decided dynamite was the way to go.\n\nApparently, getting rid of dead whales is one of the perrenial dangers of living by the seashore.

This is an interesting question- it is always claimed that sanctions harm the wrong people, yet it is often the optimum way if expressing distaste for what a government is doing to its people. Why is it racist?

Do you know all of that is a waist of tax payers money, since the illegals aren't going to turn themselves in. This is true! If you were an illegal would you turn yourself in when the worst is to get deported? The employers are the problem, and the key to reduction of the illegal workers. The employers wont turn them in either, so all this Hoo-Ha is meaningless, and a smoke screen. They are going to have round them up if they want them out of America.
Certainly seems that way.\n\nThe problem is that the liberals see them as a potential new victim class.  So if the illegals get citizenship, the liberals will gain 12 million voters.\n\nIt is in the liberals self interest to encourage these people to protest.

Even conservative estimates put the amount we have at 100% of our need for hundreds of years.  Shale oil is NOT a poor source of oil.  Indeed, we get about 20% of our oil from canadian shale oil, and they have FAR less than we do.  Our shale oil reserves are FAR greater than all the oil in the middle east combined.  It would take less than a year to convert to 100% shale oil and cost far less for that oil than we are currently paying, even considering in the development costs of the first year (after that, it's far cheaper to maintain it).\n\nThe only thing standing in the way is Congress.\n\nAlso, understand this.  We do not have to convert over to 100% domestic supply (although it would be a good idea to have the capability to rapidly do so by vastly increasing our refinery capabilities).  All we would need to do is maybe supply an extra 25% of our own needs.  That would crash the oil market and break the back of the terrorist funding middle east.  The ability to slide our oil import consumption up and down would give us an incredibly potent weapon to use against these jackasses and force them to behave.

You need to contact the US Embassy and fill out the proper papers.  My understanding is it is not always an easy process.  If you have a certain skill that is needed in the US and a company can show that there are not enough US citizens to fill those positions you could speed the process up.  A good example is importing of nursing.  Good luck.

"I truely believe that there should not be any laws dictating mandatory sentences and all sentenceing should be left to a judge because no 2 crimes are really alike. \n\nBut...\n\nI do not think someone being short is valid reason for a lesser sentence.  What bothers me most is not the probation but the only 4 months of wearing an ankle bracelet and no mention of if Sex Offender Therapy is required. A Judge should have descretion to sentence to probation, house arrest, a half way house, intensive therapy or whatever IF and ONLY IF after a thorough evaluation including a a psycological exam it is determined to be the most effective in rehabilitating the offender. The article did not mention if any of this was done. \n\nPrison is supposed to be about rehabilitation and not just punishment. In every state it is called the ""Dept. of Corrections"" not Dept. of Punishment."" Yes punishment is part of it but if the criminals are not rehabilitated then they are more destined to repeat their crime.\n\nSo if the only reason is because he is short he could have spent a few years in solitary confinement."

It is a compassionate gesture for people who have little respect for our sovereignty.
Here are some thoughts as to why.  People listen to the media, which is liberal, and anti-bush.  People don't like to learn from history, and remember how hard it was to get what we have in America, and that it is mostly due to the wars we fought, died, and bled for.  Soldiers have always died in war, and this is no different.  It is no surprise to them, or their families.  They KNOW it can happen, and still happily go.  They LOVE their country, and lots of Americans cannot understand, or appreciate it.  I agree completely with you.  It is NOT a failure, and I hope that you realize not as many say that as you are hearing.   The media just WANTS you to think it is all bad.  Keep speaking truth, and sharing what you know.
Call your local authorities (sheriff, police, etc). Contributing to the delinquency of a minor is a pretty serious offense. You need to make sure you have your facts straight first, though. You don't want to make false accusations. I would be very angry if my child had been serve alcohol too, but you need to know if it was just a sip or possible a drunken party. Then, make a decision whether to start a legal ruckus or simply have a stern talk with your child.  Best of luck to you.

"the hypocrisy of some people is huge most choose to be ignorants and are happy being so .\n\n1. not everyone is starving in Mexico,  but yes they do still get paid 10 times less . is everything 10 cheaper??? not it isn't , things cost the same and having a salary 10 times smaller makes almost impossible to acquire most things this includes food .\nhere something extra about the real poverty on mexico and many countries of latino america http://www.worldfoodprize.org/Youthinstitute/03Institute/03proceedings/Cascade.htm\ni must add that yes the poors in mexico are between the poorest of the world and this a fact not just pure biosy and lies . sickness can also bring most families to extreme poverty in just a matter of days leaving them whit only one single option , to emmigrate ilegaly to the united states hopping to comeback one day to their families .\n\n2. saying u shouldn't have children when u have not money to feed them is ""unwise"" . lets not forget that most of this people do not have the money to get birth control . \n\n3. anyone in the same situation which a lot of Mexicans find themselves would do the same thing . i question any ones humanity if they wouldn't dare to cross a country border's just  because of they are proud of their country .\n\n4.the immigration service in the USA is a huge mess unlike the Mexican which knows that it needs tourist and gives visas to them . if 11 million are here illegally is because someone hired them . otherwise they wouldn't be here , would they ?.\n\n5. saying USA would be ok if they didn't had the one's who work the land is unpractical . even if all americans provided the work which im sure wouldn't they wouldn't do it for the money which this people get paid , but they would ask to get paid :fairly"" raising the price of every product to the sky , and making imposible to sell them to anyone producing a huge loss because nobody would buy it .\n\n6. the grow of every huge economical potency on the world can only be sustained whit the work of all immigrants of the world . this is the secret of the chinesse economy which is about to create a lot of problems to the USA economy if it doesn't star to make alies . if USA doesn't make those agrements u can be sure china will make them this pointing their arsenal from mexico to u .\n\n7. where is my copy everyone has one ??? make sure to get someone whit a brain plz .\n\njust a little note : i do not think ilegal immigration is ok . however i am smart enought to recognize that the sistem which allowed 11 million to come here does not work and need to be reformed . susgesting losing millions of workers does not work on any economy . legality should be promoted and this is why not only there should be a legalization but the number of visas that should be given should be given today and not tomorow ."
I agree with you whole-heartedly.  The actions of terrorists in the name of Allah and Islam brings shame on good Muslims everywhere.  \n\nHowever, I do see one issue that people of faith need to address.  Very few Imams have publicly condemned the actions of terror groups and set the record straight on Islam.  This is a serious error on their part.  By their silence, they appear to give endorsement to these actions.  Even American Imams have failed to do this on a large scale.  Why this is, I cannot say as I am neither Imam nor Muslim.  \n\nI can say that good people of faith -- all faiths -- need to speak out loudly and clearly in condemnation of terror in the name of any religion.  Anything less deprecates the faith and gives aid and comfort to those who have neither love nor faith in their hearts.
Absolutely not.  As a teacher, I think we, as Americans, need to set a better example for our citizens and for the rest of the world.  English was not my first language, but since my parents decided this is where we would live, I learned it.  Now I teach it.  Anything worth having is worth working for.  This protest is ridiculous.  They should be protesting conditions in their countries that sent them here in the first place.
"December 9, 1961\n\nTanganyika was an East African republic within the Commonwealth of Nations, named after Lake Tanganyika, which formed its western border. In 1964, it united with the island of Zanzibar to form Tanzania.\n\nThe name first appeared as the Mandated Territory of Tanganyika, which was formed from the colony of German East Africa, awarded to the British following World War I by mandate in 1922 by the League of Nations. In 1946 it became a trust territory of the United Nations, still ruled by the British, and finally gaining independence on December 9, 1961. The ""Republic of Tanganyika"" was established a year later, June 9, 1962."

That's probably not regarded as part of the civil rights era in the US.  You may want to try using different terminology.  Maybe a law library visit would help.  You could try to find what would be some of the earliest lawsuits aimed at enforcing federal civil rights legislation that was put in place during the civil rights era.  Human Rights Watch may also have some information although I don't know if they are concerned with anything that far in the past.  Good luck.

"The problem with the embryonic stem cell research debate is that too many people equate it with abortion. For years, researchers have been trying to use embryos from fertility clinics. The way the current law is, the ones that are not implanted in a woman are discarded - thrown in the trash. I see this as unethical. Why discard them when they can be used on possibly life-saving research? Who supports stem-cell research? People as diverse as Michael J Fox, Nancy Reagan, Curt Shilling, and my father, who passed 4 years ago from Lou Gherigs disease.\n\nI feel it is unethical to discard something that could potentially save lives simply because of misinformation.\n\nPluripotent stem cells, those from embryos, are able to develop into all the different types of cells in the body and multiply rapidly. \n\nAdult stem cells, or multipotent stem cells, that could give rise to all cell and tissue types have not yet been found. Adult stem cells are often present in only minute quantities and can therefore be difficult to isolate and purify. There is also evidence that they may not have the same capacity to multiply as embryonic stem cells do. Also, adult stem cells may contain more DNA abnormalities—caused by sunlight, toxins, and errors in making more DNA copies during the course of a lifetime. These potential weaknesses limit the usefulness of adult stem cells.\n\nThere is a really good paper on this at The Michael J Fox Foundation website called ""Q&A Embryonic Stem Cells; Exploding the Myth"" (see link)"

They congregate in specific areas, rather than spreading through the nation.  California has the most in one place.

However, I want the future expansion of legal immigration through an extended guest worker program to wait until border security measures are in place.

"Ok, this question is so short-sighted it drives me to near insanity.  I was in the first Iraq war in the northern part of the country. My brother has done two tours in the second conflict that is occuring now.  The fact that the initial invasion of Iraq was termed ""Shock and Awe"" in no way reflects the theory of war you just presented.  One of the reasons both wars were so damned expensive was due to our determination NOT to hit civilian targets.  Overall, it would be much easier to carpet bomb a country into capitulation than to send in an invasion force.  Just as WWII Germans.  Dresden was firebombed to the ground.  We have not done even a slight portion of the damage done in previous wars.  When we target power installations in the first war, it was specifically to deny the Iraqi millitary electricity.  We don't bomb hospitals, sewage treatment centers, public water works, schools or other civilian infrastructure.  War is hell.  At least when we Americans commit to a war we don't rape, murder or pillage like U.N. troops."
"The Enola Gay is at the Smithsonian Institute.  It is the most photographed airplane ever.  Do some YAHOO! searches to discover the value of your ""hidden camera"" photos.  Be prepared to document proof that your grandfather served at the base where the photos were taken (DD214 duty assignments, pay slips, etc.).  Sworn testimonials, documentations and so forth.  You cannot determine the value of anything without doing research, then the value is determined by what someone is willing to pay and what someone is willing to accept.  Another source of internet research is AUCTION HOUSES.  Otherwise, anyone who blindly gives you an ""educated guess"" as a quick answer for 2 points needs educating himself.  Good research is your answer."
Yes, I did know that.
No, people, especially the media, only wanted to talk about the economy when it was still on it's way back from the Clinton neglect and 9/11 - now that's it's healthy because of the tax cuts and good stewardship... nah, people just want to blather on about Haliburton and high gas prices and irrelevant things beyond anyone's control. You can't stir up hate mongers by talking positively about this administration and all the good that President Bush has done. He is a good president and history will judge him to be far better than the blockheads writing today's headlines.

Assuming you are refering to the US, jsut turn on your TV and watch the marchers today.
Yes, due to the phone or transmission lines being impacted in the area of the blast.  Due to the nature of the grid system, however, the lines will be 're-routed' around the blast and should have you up in running in no time, that is, of course, if there are no other detonations elsewhere.  \n\nIt is also theoretically speculated that high enough kiloton yields at very high altitudes can have effects on the entire continent.  Since airborne tests were stopped in 1963, only computer simulations and theoretical projections have been made regarding the impact of the EMP.
It also reminds me of another Vietnam. Back then America didnt realise a huge part of the population supported the communist regime. Now America dosent realise that many people, for some reason, liked hussain. Trying to force democracy on them to be honest is quite insulting in a way because their is a conspiracy that bush didnt even win your own election. But here America and Britain our forcing our ways on people who are totally opposed. How can you fight against a people who condone suicide bombing?? Its impossible. My only hope is that the troops who eventually return defeated are not treated in the same way the returning soldiers were after Vietnam.

There is a lot of confusion over what is left and right.  I prefer to compare parties based on if they are authoritarian or freedom-loving.  Communists are among the most authoritarian, as are socialists and fascists, and many of the parties based on enforcing dogma.  Typically, the left has been composed of those groups that want to redistribute income, and to do this one must be authoritarian, such as the communists, so it is not surprising that they are called leftist.  \n\nI much prefer to see freedom and liberty.  Communists have oppressed too many people in the history of the world, and it is time to move away from their wishful, utopian ideologies, once and for all.

usually the child is removed from the home due to circumstances surrounding the case. they go into foster care and if they cannot make it there then they go into a childrens home where they normally grow up in. if you are a foster parent or wish guardianship... if you and your household is approved then said child might be able to stay with you. it is a process with alot of  red tape. i would talk to the cse worker who is handling the childs case and i would do it quickly.
This is a time for those who are looking for leadership other than the kind we currently have to be working towards electing a government that works for all people.

Atty General in my state is such a powerful position that things can literally change overnight if the right person is elected.  That reason among many others is why I have chosen to be a part of that campaign.  I know what you mean about the way things are for the middle and lower class.  I was making over 60k plus benefits and bonus in 2000 and now make less than 20k with no medical benefits. My lifestyle has had to change drastically and my quality of life has taken a nosedive literally.  I hate living this way so I am committed to making a change in 2006 and 2008.  Keep in mind that 2006 is just as important as 2008.  If we dont change the Congress and the Senate we are sunk still.

Serbian government surely has power to send General Mladic to the Hague - there is no doubt about it. Hey, even my some of my father's friends from Serbia know where he is (or at least knew, since they have last seen him a year or two ago). When they know where he is - government must know that too. \nAs for Mladic's surrender - I confidentially know he is guarded by small paramilitary organization, and that he would rather commit suicide, that go to the Hague. He won't surrender (at least he thought so few years ago).\nI don't understand why the government won't arrest him, since they are risking making few more problems (and they already have too many - like Kosovo). \nThe main reason they don't want to send him to the Hague is because they are either afraid of provoking new civil war and massive protests against such move (because he is still regarded as hero by many people) or because some small number of powerful politicians and/or mafia bosses are afraid he will give away some information, vital to them, which would cause their fall from power.\nI personally think that whole government is afraid to send him to the Hague because it would cause unrest in already unstable country, and the current government would, without doubt, loose power, and Radical party would take over the country (which I find the greatest fear of local democrats.\n\nRadovan Karadzic is another matter - I confidentially know he is not in Serbia and Montenegro - as he probably fled to one Sveta Gora's monasteries in Greece. It is also not vital to Serbia to send hem to the Hague, as he had absolutely nothing to do with Serbia.\n\nUNPROFOR cannot arrest Mladic and Karadzic in foreign territory (Serbia and Montenegro) as they have no authorization (they could only, perhaps, arrest them in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but they are not in Bosnia). \n\nAs for repercussions - European Union has already suspended entrance talks, and now it is Serbian politicians' move - either to send Mladic and Karadzic to the Hague or to let Serbian people suffer because of them.\n\nAt least Montenegro might soon get independence and will enter EU soon....

Everyone else's plight is ignored. The unemployment rate if everyone was counted would be tremendous. We do NOT have a shortage of labor, we have a large surplus. The more illegals that come in and take our jobs at minimum wage or less (often less) puts more and more Americans out of a job. Most of these Americans are never counted in the unemployment rate if they do not manage to get unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits are hard to receive.\n\nIllegals draw welfare by stealing people's social security numbers and identities. That means there are a lot of people being directly hurt by these people as well. Innocent people are having their credit ratings ruined, having IRS problems, and social security problems. If someone who has had their social security number stolen gets married, if either spouse dies or become disabled then they can be denied their benefits. \n\nMy family moved to the US before WWII. Those of my family that didn't make it over got killed by the death camps. Our family assimilated to the American culture. We didn't expect the Americans to change to suit us. The illegal immigrants from Mexico are not civilized like that.\n\nThey not only changed the National Anthem to Spanish, they changed the words. They already burn our flag and hang our flag upside down. They waved the Mexican flag during a lot of their protests. Some schools have stopped hanging the American flag and forbidden students from wearing clothes with any part of the American flag on their clothing all to keep from offending the Mexicans. It's nothing short of an attack of our country, not only by the illegal aliens, but those who seek to appease them. \n\nI am tired of the stereotype that Americans wouldn't do the work that illegals do. Illegals do all kinds of jobs for less than minimum wage which drives the wages down for U.S. citizens. Construction jobs are an example. There are lots of illegals doing construction jobs that Americans used to do because the companies can keep more of the profits if they pay less for the workers. All that does is make companies wealthier and Americans poorer. Illegals are stealing jobs that Americans have done for years. \n\n""Mexico is waging war on the U.S. through mass immigration illegal and legal, through the assertion of Mexican national claims over the U.S., and through the subversion of its laws and sovereignty, all having the common end of bringing the southwestern part of the U.S. under the control of the expanding Mexican nation, and of increasing Mexico’s political and cultural influence over the U.S. as a whole. \n\n \nCultural imperialism\n\n \n\nWe experience Mexico’s assault on our country incrementally—as a series of mini-crises, ea"

I don't think the mayority of the immigrants would like the US to be like the country they immigrated from, it is not logical.\n\nI believe that you have to take the best of the place you live in, no matter what was the reason for you to move. I have asked some question about better ways to make the USA people to accept the immigrants -at least those who are already living there, and i believe this are some of the things they all can do. \n\nI have thougth about making efforts to make their comunities better, cleaner, more safe. To help the authorities to figth againts criminality in their comunities. They can help each other in learning english, etc. \n\nI understand their love to the origins, and the respect to their inheritance, that's something they can preserv, and even be proud of. \n\nBut they have to make something in favor of the country and the population who has accepted, given the oportunities, and offered a better life style that they would have had in their countries.\n\nI am proud of my Mexico, i am aware of a lot of our faults, but i love our great country, our history, and i am aware as well of many of our good characteristics, and our abilities.
Last estimation that I could find was by Unicef back in 1998 at about 750,000 permanent homless.
It depends on what they sue your for.  Presumably, they are claiming your appraisal was no good and they suffered loss as a result.  If they say you breached a representation in a contract, it arguably could fall under the rules for contracts, which vary.  If it is fraud, it is 6 years from the alleged fraud.  For negligence, it is 2 years from the discovery of the negligence.  Personally, my money is on the negligence, since they'll likely claim you failed to perform your appraisal consistently with your professional duty. Your insurance should cover it, and you should read your policy about your duty to notify them of possible claims.
no the alcohol is out of your system from a week ago.  but surprisingly it can be in your system from 2 days ago so be careful.

First, the girl's lawyer will serve you with a copy of the summons and complaint.  The complaint will spell out exactly what you are accused of doing, and the relief being sought (most likely money).  The summons will explain who you need to  send a response to the complaint to (the girl's lawyer), and will tell you how many days (usually 20-30), you have to respond to the complaint.\n\nIf you fail to respond, the court can find you in default, and rule in the favor of the other girl without you being there.\n\nIf you're about to be sued, your best bet is to find an attorney of your own FAST.  Then, if the girl's attorney calls you, you just give the name and number of yours, and let them handle it from there.

I needed to find my girlfriend a lawyer for her divorce. We do not have alot of money so I started calling around and found lawyers that would sit down and talk with me. When I did that I told them of our financial situation  and just asked for help. It took a couple of weeks but I did finally find a lawyer who didn't represent me but found someone who would.(i also traded some of my lab or out for the retainer.)\nLawyers will very often work with you. \nHope this helps.\n\nAlso I apologize for the stupid remark You are obviously not that.

Everything! It is so wrong! If you are old enough to give your life for your country, and you can't do the above, then something is definetly WRONG! The USA needs to make updates to the drinking age or the military serving age. They should be hand in hand with each other anyway. Only in this country would they do something so senseless and dumb. Even Canada's drinking age is appropriate! Canada! That is SOOOO wrong!!!!!!!
Yeah, back when most of our territory was a British Colony, we had to pay tax and support British soldiers in our homes but were not allowed to vote.  We wanted to run our own lives.  They taxed our tea, which really pissed us off, so we dumped a boatload in Boston Harbor.  (I think they were afraid the common people would want the tea more than the boycott the rebels wanted on the tea, personally.)  \n\nThe British came to fight us and Paul Revere rode a horse up the coastline warning the people that they were on their way.  The British wore bright red uniforms which was not the best forest camouflage.  Our people fought from behind trees. Their people at home weren't sure they really wanted to kill us as much as we were willing to fight to be free.  Ultimately, we won.
They get in any way they want to, just like they force their way into the country.

You will have to get an eviction notice from the county you live in, then can have someone deliver the eviction notice if there is danger to yourself.  I just need more details.
You would need to get a visa, and while you are doing that, ask how long it is good for.  There are different types of visas, so go to immigration, and find which one is good for you!
The Senate has already passed the bill for amnesty. They also attached a provision that the United States has to consult and get permission from Mexico before doing border control. We have been sold out to Mexico.\n\nThe illegal Mexican immigrants are invading this country trying to take it over. It's encouraged by Mexico and the American businesses who use them for cheap labor. Their loyalty is to Mexico. They proved that during one of the first rallies when they took down the American flag, hung up the Mexican flag, and then hung the American flag upside down underneath it. THAT is how they feel about America. \n\nhttp://michellemalkin.com/archives/004869.htm

"Why do people start using drugs? Certainly not to feel better; they're challenged by schoolmates and friends, as a rite of passage (pure tribal behaviour). And in seeking acceptance they try them. Over time they develop dependency and a strong attachment to them, the same way they do to liquor or tobacco. For some obscure reason the latter are still legal and the former is not. This in turn creates a logical sociogenic outcome: Druglords, and the ensuing trail of bloodshed, crime and lack of welfare in drug producing nations. Legalizing drugs would at least turn druglords into businesspersons and it would raise a profitable industry....in the early stages. Drugs would eventually become so ""mainstream"" that many kids would not find it a challenge to use them. But I woke up from that dream long a go; governments thrive on druglords, either in Colombia, Mexico or the US."

Republican: low taxes, 2nd amendment, illegals out (well actually, the republicans are split on the issue), win the war\n\nDemocrat: high taxes, cancel 2nd amendment, allow all illegal immigrants in and give them access to unlimited social services (this opposed to legal residents who will be scrutinized before you get accest to social services), lose the war (this would help the democrats)

No - the oil industry doesn't spend a large percentage of it's money on employees - I am one. \n\nThe money is spent in technology, and processes of actually drilling the well. It costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to drill a single well, and the well spends the better majority of it's life simply paying itself off. \n\nThe only reason the oil companies make alot of money is because the industry is huge. We only make about a 7% profit, when costs are taken into consideration, where bottled water companies make a 75 - 200 % profit margin.

Vincent Fox (Mexican president) doesn't want to do anything to discourage the human smuggling into the US because he depends on his citizens making it into the US to work and send money home to their relatives in Mexico, so the Mexican government doesn't have to look after their own citizens.

Domestic Violence charges do not just go away like they use to. Even though they can be dropped later by the state the arrested person still will have a criminal history that will show one charge and no conviction. The DA may decide to drop the charges when you go in front of a judge if there is a bad witness or no witness willing to testify. A wife can not be compelled to testify against her husband just because the state decides to prosecute. The spouse needs to contact the agency that is handling the case and the DA or prosecutor that is handling it for the state and I am sure something can be worked out mutually. Domestic violence is frowned upon now and carries stiff sentences so try and avoid domestic violence at all costs.
I can vote, but I never will- all politicians are an embarrasment in my opinion, although I don't force this upon anyone.\n\nAs for the BNP, I think they are liars- trying to display a modern face to a nationalist party that is still run by no-brain racist skinheads.
"The only forum is to contact your state legislator and complain, or alternatively, in state jurisdictions where the initiative process is permitted to enact laws, to attempt to obtain enough votes from the public to change the law to adequately protect the interest of litigants.\n\nThe common understanding of the American principle of ""Due Process"" of law, contemplates that a person have reasonable notice of a legal action against him/her, and a meaningful opportunity to appear and present evidence and argument to defend his/her interests, before a neutral decision maker who will make findings and conclusions of law and a decision based on the record of evidence adduced at the hearing(s).\n\nUnfortunately, judges are human and they make mistakes. However, the alternative is to shove all the evidence into some sort of expert computer system and the results produced might be even more mistake prone than a decision from a human arbiter. \n\nThe system we have is the only system found to work with any accuracy, so until someone can actually define a better system, I would be extremely reluctant to mess with what we currently have."
This is my opinion as the facts stand\n\nFirstly:\nwhether there is a breach of contract and in which case is the clause stated a limitation clause.  It appears that company wanted to protect itself  for damage caused to unoccupied properties. However i doubt whether this covers defective chattels (which they are contractually obligating to maintain) causing damage to property. I'm assuming you didn't make the cistern yourself and assumed it was installed.\n\nI think the real question is whether you owe a duty of care for a defective chattel causing damage to another property. Well my first thought is the snail bottle case (Donghue v Stevenson)that is good English law if the cistern was manufactured faulty. \nIf installation is faulty I think the plumber would owe a duty of care for reasonably foreseeable damage\nIf the pipes are warn out I would suggest that the damage is covered by the insurance/ or if you have a landlord reasonable wear and tear would be expressed in your tenancy agreement\n\nAgain if the damage was caused by leaky pipes within occupied premises then damage to other parts of the building are foreseeable, this is my feeling towards your issue.

There are several requirments for emancipation, one is that you stay in school, and apparently you need to do just that as evidenced by you poor spelling. Then you must be working and can prove that you can pay your rent (no roommates), pay for transportation to and from school and work, can afford to uy your own groceries and be able to produce health insurance and proof that you can pay for your medical bills. \n\nrarely is emancipation the answer to parental problems, many adults cant afford to live on their own much less a 16 year old, uneducated child.
I agree! I could not have said it better myself. It is our tax dollars that are paying for their housing and healthcare. This is not what we mean by being a FREE country.

Courts determine the scope of an enacted law but the words in the law don't always give a clear picture of what the law makers were trying to do so lawyers use the legislative history to argue the limits of the law.
Entry of the United States\n \nPresident Wilson before Congress, announcing the break in official relations with Germany on February 3, 1917.America's policy of insisting on neutral rights while also trying to broker a peace resulted in tensions with both Berlin and London. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson repeatedly warned that he would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare, and the Germans repeatedly promised to stop. A proposal to Mexico to join the war against the Allies was exposed in February, bringing war closer. (See Zimmermann telegram). After further U-boat (German submarines) attacks on American merchant ships, Wilson requested that Congress declare war on Germany, which it did on April 6, 1917 (see: Woodrow Wilson declares war on Germany on Wikisource). The U.S. House of Representatives approved the war resolution 373-50, the U.S. Senate 82-6, with opposition coming mostly from German American districts. Wilson hoped war could be avoided with Austria-Hungary; however, when it kept its loyalty to Germany, the U.S. declared war on Austria-Hungary in December 1917.\n\nhope that helps ~A~
"Probably fame and money. I would say many actors have an internal need to be in the spotlight. They crave the attention. Politics allow them to continue doing this. \n\nYou are right, and it is messed up. There are many more knowledgable people that could do a much better job representing the needs of the people.

I think that it is not a law against that unless there is sound on the tape.  Not because it is okay but because it is one of those laws that is behind the technology available to us now.

nothing is definite until the judge gives his orders...there would be arguments first, I imagine.  The only reason you would not be able to leave the state is if you are a convicted criminal on parole, or someone involved in a custody case...as for criminals, it would depend on the severity of your crime, but if you are on parole, then no.  If you are involved in a custody case, and are the custodial parent, then you will be able to move out of state only if you can convince the judge it forwards the child's best interests, and is not in anyway to thwart the parenting time of the other party.  Without any information,it's hard to say any specifics....
I am an American and I don't give a fnck what the rest of the world thinks. Enough Said
Many great American statesmen have made the mistake of referring to our form of government as a Democracy. It was never intended to be a Democracy, but a democratic Republic. There are major differences. Still, ask any 100 people you meet on the street or any 100 students in America’s schools what form of government we have and you will likely get 100 responses of, “a Democracy.” \n\nJames Madison’s Federalist Paper #10 discusses the issue of Democracies. In it he states: “Democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives, as they have been violent in their deaths. Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species of Government, have erroneously supposed, that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same time, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their opinions and their passions.” We can see from this that Mr. Madison would never have advocated a pure Democracy for his new nation. \n\nIn Federalist Paper #14 Madison wrote: “The true distinction between these forms...is, that in a Democracy, the people meet and exercise the government in person; in a Republic they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents. A Democracy consequently will be confined to a small spot. A Republic may be extended over a large region.” \n\nMadison continues in Federalist Paper #14 to describe a Republic thusly: “The effect [of having a Republic over a Democracy] (is to) enlarge the public views, by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country, and whose patriotism and love of justice, will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations. Under such a regulation, it may well happen that the public voice pronounced by the representatives of the people, will be more consonant to the public good, than if pronounced by the people themselves convened for the purpose.” \n\nEssentially, a Democratic Republic is a limited government with enumerated powers (as specified in a Constitution) which is administered by persons elected by the people. These officials hold office at the pleasure of the electorate and must therefore strive to govern in a manner that is acceptable to the majority of voters. \n\nThe system breaks down when the electorate is misled by a biased news media or when special interests are able to manipulate the electoral process or, perhaps most significant, when the electorate no longer understands the working of the government and fails to exercise its proper oversight. For the system to function as our Founding Fathers envisioned it is necessary that the people understand the proper role of government as spelled out in our Constitution. It is not the function of government to ensure equality of outcomes. Any attempt to do so will eventually devolve into tyranny. \n\nConcerning this tendency, in 1792, James Madison wrote in regards to property rights: “Government is instituted to protect property of every sort....This being the end of government....That is NOT a just government...nor is property secure under it, where the property which a man has...is violated by arbitrary seizures of one class of citizens for the service of the rest.” \n\nThe socialistic nature of our present-day government would have been abhorrent to Madison and the other Founding Fathers. Government’s function should not be to level the people to an equal mediocrity, but to ensure a level playing field upon which added effort or superior talent results in increased reward. That is the philosophy that built America and made it great.

He may be a head of big oil or metal exporting venture.\nAnd so-called oligarchs, most probably, bought their ventures due to extremely low pricing on auctions during 1990-s. For instance, Mikhail Khodorkovsky is believed to have bought Yukos oil conglomerate for approximately 200 mln $, while its original price was about 2 billion.\nRussians themselves consider ALL rich people got rich at expense of somebody's life. It is some component of Russian mentality.

My personal definition of a liberal is someone who wants everyone else to live like they say they should, but shouldn't be held to that same standard.  For example; Robert Kennedy wants you and me to stop driving our SUV's and conserve fuel...but what does he drive to his numerous appointments?  A nice shiny black SUV.  He also enjoys flying around in his personal jet...shouldn't he be flying commercial airliners like the rest of us peasants?  Same thing with Arianna Huffington...Babs Streisand...Noam Chomsky...they're all a bunch of hypocrites, which gets me back to my definition...in order to be a good liberal, you have to be an accomplished hypocrite.

"The problem is that this (Fourteenth Amendment)has been misinterpreted in recent years to mean simply that anyone born in the U.S, under any circumstances, is an American citizen.\nThis is neither the original intent of the law nor the way it was interpreted by the courts in subsequent decades. Some Americans speak of birthright citizenship as if it were an immutable law of nature. \nIt is not, and most other nations do not, in fact, recognize it. It is only a BAD HABIT that could be broken with a simple Executive Order. \n\nAccording to estimates, some 200,000 so-called anchor babies are born in the United States every year. \nOnce a mother has birthed a child on American soil, she can then seek to obtain citizenship for herself on the strength of the family-reunification laws. \nEven before this happens, she is very hard to deport, as the mother of an American, and the full panoply of welfare benefits is available to her, as is affirmative action if she is a member of a racial minority.\n\nA group of attorneys and immigration experts that is trying to do something about the problem RIGHT NOW. \n\nCraig Nelsen, director of Friends of Immigration Law Enforcement Stated :\n""The situation we have today is absurd,There is a huge and growing industry in Asia that arranges tourist visas for pregnant women so they can fly to the United States and give birth to an American. This was not the intent of the Fourteenth Amendment; it makes a mockery of citizenship.""\n(Sound Familiar??)\n\nThe key to undoing the current misinterpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment is this odd phrase\n\n""AND SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION THEREOF.""\n\nThe whole problem is caused by the fact that the meaning of this phrase, which was clear to anyone versed in legal language in 1868, has slipped with changes in usage. Fortunately, there is a large group of court precedents that make clear what the phrase actually means: \n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment EXCLUDES the children of aliens. (The Slaughterhouse Cases (83 U.S. 36 (1873)) \n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment draws a distinction between the children of aliens and children of citizens. (Minor v. Happersett (88 U.S. 162 (1874))\n\nThe phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction"" REQUIRES ""Direct And Immediate ALLEGIENCE"" to the United States, NOT just physical presence. \n(Elk v. Wilkins 112 U.S. 94 (1884)) \n\nThere is NO automatic birthright citizenship in a particular case. (Wong Kim Ark Case, 169 U.S. 649 (1898)) \n\nThe Supreme Court has NEVER confirmed birthright citizenship for the children of illegal aliens, temporary workers, and tourists. \n(Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 211 n.10 (1982)) \n\nThere are other cases referring to minor details of the question.\n\nThe so-called 14th amendment was never properly ratified either. \nIn the case of Dyett v. Turner, 439 P.2d 266, 270 (1968), the Utah Supreme Court recited numerous historical facts proving, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that the so-called 14th amendment was likewise a major fraud upon the American People.\n\nThose facts, in many cases, were Acts of the several State Legislatures voting for or against that proposal to amend the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Law Library has a collection of references detailing this major fraud.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution requires that constitutional amendments be ratified by three-fourths of the several States. As such, their Acts are governed by the Full Faith and Credit Clause in the U.S. Constitution. See Article IV, Section 1.\n\nJudging by the sheer amount of litigation its various sections have generated, particularly Section 1, the so-called 14th amendment is one of the worst pieces of legislation ever written in American history. \nThe phrase “subject to the jurisdiction of the United States” is properly understood to mean “subject to the municipal jurisdiction of Congress.” \n\nFor this one reason alone, the Congressional Resolution proposing the so-called 14th amendment is "

That would vary from state to state. Generally, you'll be put on probation for a period of time, required to attend substance abuse education classes and Narcotics Anonymous meetings, submit to random drug testing, attend school full-time or be employed full-time, report to your probation officer on a regular basis, and obey any other directives by the court or your probation officer. Successful completion of this probation will usually result in your record being cleared of the charges brought against you. Failure will probably get you sent to prison.

i think the house bill is better because the illegal immigrants shouldn't have the same rights as all of us citizens. i think that they should have to do it the right way or no way at all. it's not really fair for them to come into the country and expect all the things that citizens have if they're illegal. so the house bill would probably prevent alot of them from coming in. but i also think that the house bill might backfire. because there are some crazy people out there that like to break the law just to piss the government officials off.

I believe that Collin Powell was the first African American to hold any power.
I am furious with Bush on this one.  I typically support him as at least being sincere, but this is not only insincere, it insults our intelligence.  As an article I read pointed out, the only way additional border patrols would substantially slow illegal immigration by itself is if there were sufficient patrols to do 'Hands Across America' along our southern border.  The Senate had already put the $1.9 billion for border security into an appropriations bill, and Bush is saying it should be spent on something we all know will be a band-aid.  Initially, when I thought he was going to get additional funding above that already voted for, I was OK with this as a stop gap measure while more permanent solutions are put in place.  I am not OK with it as a stop-gap measure that will be expensive to implement, drain our border security budget, and leave nothing to show for it when the troops are ultimately removed. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/18/AR2006051801774.html
"I know we're being sold out. The Senate even added a provision to the bill they passed which requires the United States to consult and get permission from the Mexican government to build a fence or do anything to stop the flow of these illegal Mexican invaders.\n\nThe illegal Mexican immigrants are invading this country trying to take it over. It's encouraged by Mexico and the American businesses who use them for cheap labor. Their loyalty is to Mexico. They proved that during one of the first rallies when they took down the American flag, hung up the Mexican flag, and then hung the American flag upside down underneath it. THAT is how they feel about America. \n\nhttp://michellemalkin.com/archives/004869.htm\n\nThen the people who want to appease them pull out the excuses about how people who are not even alive now, and haven't been for hundreds of years, 'stole' the land from the American Indians. Even American politicians are carrying out this traitorous attack on our sovereignty! If this keeps up, the United States of America will become a 3rd world country, just like Mexico! Mexico's problems are not the fault of Americans, but they are becoming our problems because the Mexicans are invading us and bringing their problems with them.\n\nThe illegals make up about 5 % of the work force. The unemployment rate is about 4.5%. Keep in mind that the unemployment rate does NOT represent everyone who is unemployed. It only counts those who are collecting unemployment. Everyone else's plight is ignored. The unemployment rate if everyone was counted would be tremendous. We do NOT have a shortage of labor, we have a large surplus. The more illegals that come in and take our jobs at minimum wage or less (often less) puts more and more Americans out of a job. Most of these Americans are never counted in the unemployment rate if they do not manage to get unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits are hard to receive.\n\nIllegals draw welfare by stealing people's social security numbers and identities. That means there are a lot of people being directly hurt by these people as well. Innocent people are having their credit ratings ruined, having IRS problems, and social security problems. If someone who has had their social security number stolen gets married, if either spouse dies or become disabled then they can be denied their benefits. \n\nMy family moved to the US before WWII. Those of my family that didn't make it over got killed by the death camps. Our family assimilated to the American culture. We didn't expect the Americans to change to suit us. The illegal immigrants from Mexico are not civilized like that.\n\nThey not only changed the National Anthem to Spanish, they changed the words. They already burn our flag and hang our flag upside down. They waved the Mexican flag during a lot of their protests. Some schools have stopped hanging the American flag and forbidden students from wearing clothes with any part of the American flag on their clothing all to keep from offending the Mexicans. It's nothing short of an attack of our country, not only by the illegal aliens, but those who seek to appease them. \n\nI am tired of the stereotype that Americans wouldn't do the work that illegals do. Illegals do all kinds of jobs for less than minimum wage which drives the wages down for U.S. citizens. Construction jobs are an example. There are lots of illegals doing construction jobs that Americans used to do because the companies can keep more of the profits if they pay less for the workers. All that does is make companies wealthier and Americans poorer. Illegals are stealing jobs that Americans have done for years. \n\n""Mexico is waging war on the U.S. through mass immigration illegal and legal, through the assertion of Mexican national claims over the U.S., and through the subversion of its laws and sovereignty, all having the common end of bringing the southwestern part of the U.S. "
The LTT killed him because he send the Indian Military troop to Srilanka for fight against tigers. This action made LTT angry.\n\nIt was on July 29, 1987 that the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement was signed. Hostilities broke out between the LTTE and the Indian Peace-Keeping Force in October 1987. The DMK came to power in Tamil Nadu in January 1989, that is, a year and a half after the Agreement was concluded and fifteen months after the fighting began. Actually this agreement was a trick of Srilankan President Jayawardhana.
Clean up the corrupt Mexican government 100% and stop lining their own pockets with aide money that is meant for their citizens.  Build up their own economy so their citizens can have a decent life in their own country.  Beef up their education system so their people can compete with the rest of the world.  Maybe then the citizens of Mexico would not feel a need or desire to head to the USA for that better life.\n\nPancha, Mexico has elections for their government so I would say that makes the country a democracy.

The real issue at hand is: should there be immigration? The answer is a resounding yes. America is a nation of immigrants, and unless you're the great grandson of Sitting Bull, you are of immigrant origin. Immigration is what gives strength to this country: where do you think George Washington and Lincoln came from, spontaneous combustion? What about Einstein? Furthermore, while many sit around and complain about immigrants, the US is the country with the most transnational corporations in the world, which means we derive a great portion of our wealth from doing business abroad--so I think we can take a few immigants from those countries in which we do business. Mexico happens to be our fourth largest trading partner which means a lot of Americans have jobs because Mexicans are buying our products. \n\nAlso note that a lot of Americans are staffing the branches of US transnational corporations in other countries. For instance, Japan is the country with the second largest population of Americans (after the US, evidently, and excluding Iraq and Afghanistan were American populations are in theory temporary) and Mexico is the country with the third largest population of Americans.\n\nIt's true that it would be good if Mexico could provide enough work for its own citizens, but the fact is that it cannot do that yet; as neighbors the US and Mexico need to sit down and work together to find a solution. Building a fence will not even help; we'll probably have to hire immigrants to help us build it!\n\nSeparately, someone claimed that immigrants come here to take advantage of Social Security and our welfarte state. In fact, statistically speaking, it has been proved again and again that immigrants work hard enough to earn their Social Security, just like any other worker in America. In addition, it's also a statistical fact that there are more Americans on welfare than immigrants; illegal immigrants do not really have access to it, since they are not US citizens and cannot receive it.\n\nIn sum, everyone has gotta cool down and think rationally. Blaming the immigrants for whatever is ailing you today, is nonsense. George Washington would surely not sympathize with you, nor do I.

Hmmm... Because you cannot just apply for a citizenship. If you live in another country nobody is going to simply tell you can come here and get a citizenship! You're lucky if you can get a visa, and that is usually for tourism only. If you don't have property or a stead well-paying job you won't even get that, because the embassy will assume that you're coming here to work. You're chances are somewhat increased if you can say you have relatives here and you're coming to to visit. The only way to get an assured citizenship in US is through a lottery after an extensive application process, after which, if you win that is you get your green card and then have to live here for at least 5 yrs until you can apply for a citizenship. Until then you can't vote or have a government job, etc. As for those who decide to stay after their visa expires... well it's not smart to go ahead and try to get into any trouble with the government, or even let them know you're here, or yes, you will get deported. So, you don't have much of a choice, but live here illegally and then maybe one day go back to your country when you made enough money and if that is your goal.

I think it may help you, some. Apparently, government policy has limited green card or permanent status for foreign citizens who wish to work full-time in the United States. Hopefully, the issue of Mexican illegals will provide some relaxation in these restrictions. If you are here on a student visa, you'll have to apply first for permanent status and meet those requirements, which include an offer for a job that is one needed in the U.S. But I think your chances will be better now than before, as the issue of immigration in general has been raised in the arena of politics, not just as bureaucratic governing.
yes it can, believe it or not. many public parks apply only to residents of community. so much for public huh

"That is a relative question.  You could say the US, but then the problem is the widening gap between rich and middle class.

You could say Britian, but the govenment funds pubilc enterpirse that directly competes with private enterprise.  You could say China, but there is likely large scale corruption.  You could say Cuba, but the lack of private property means that government could intervene when they feel threatening.  You could also go with Japan, but there is fear in thinking ""outside the box.""\n\nPersonally, I would go with Germany, despite the high labor costs.

Yes there are people stupid enough. Americans get brainwashed in school, so they think war is good and necessary to overthrow other countries that think different then the USA. I think they just attack countries that have things that they want (e.g. Oil) or strategical need. They place people there that work in their interest. And then declare it as war on terrorism while I think they are the biggest Terrorists themselves. Between I really think that the US, Britain and all their other partners are being controlled by the same group anyway.

I think that whatever happens in the host's house should be the host's responsibility, but whatever happens after the guests leave the host's driveway, is the sole responsibility of the persons involved- not the host of the house they just left. If everything becomes the host's responsibility, then a whole new can of worms will be opened and then to what extent, how much, when, and what happened has to be defined and it becomes too complicated for anyone to resolve whose responsibility it is. When it comes to drinking, the same applies for in house rules (especially under-age drinking) but after the guests leave, drunk or sober, it is their responsibility. EXAMPLE: If I leave a bar or restaurant and I had a few drinks and drive home drunk and crash into another car, is the bartender/waiter responsible for what happened because I drank at their place? No. People need to learn to become more responsible for their actions. Too many loop-holes and laws are being made that allow for people to do as they please b/c it is not their fault. Accountablity is a major factor the success of any society.

McClellan, a rising military star in Ohio, proposed an overall strategy for the war directly to President Abraham Lincoln, one that emphasized the part his army could play. Scott, the general-in-chief of the U.S. Army, wrote a letter to McClellan on May 3, 1861, stating in part:\n\nIt is the design of the Government to raise 25,000 additional regular troops, and 60,000 volunteers, for three years. ... We rely greatly on the sure operation of a complete blockade of the Atlantic and Gulf ports soon to commence. In connection with such blockade, we propose a powerful movement down the Mississippi to the ocean, with a cordon of posts at proper points ... the object being to clear out and keep open this great line of communication in connection with the strict blockade of the seaboard, so as to envelop the insurgent States and bring them to terms with less bloodshed than by any other plan.[1]\n\nScott went on to warn against hot-headed demands for a march on the Confederate capital, Richmond.\n\nScott's plan involved two main parts.\n\nBlockade the coast of the South to prevent the export of cotton, tobacco, and other cash crops from the South and to keep them from importing much-needed war supplies. \nDivide the South by controlling the Mississippi River to cut off the southeastern states from the western. Scott considered this an ""envelopment"" rather than an ""invasion"", although it would require armies and fleets of river gunboats to accomplish it. \nHis proposal received considerable public criticism at the time. A famous newspaper cartoon depicted a huge snake squeezing the Confederacy, thus giving the plan its popular name. The United States government never formally adopted it, but President Lincoln did implement the two parts. However, he ignored Scott's warning against direct invasion, and used far more troops (nearly two million), trying repeatedly to capture Richmond.\n\nLincoln called for a blockade of the South on April 19, 1861, six days after the fall of Fort Sumter (and a few weeks before Scott's letter). The blockade itself, thought to be an impossible task against 3,000 miles of highly irregular coastline, was an unparalleled success within the first six months, and nearly impregnable within the first two years. The blockade accounted for the vast increase in the price of cotton abroad and the extreme scarcity of manufactured goods in the South by the end of the war, contributing to the South's defeat. It was the most successful naval blockade to date, and the first"

yes india definitely has what it takes to be the next superpower.  but it would be wrong to say that the us would fall(at least not sometime very soon).\n\nindian military has a long way to go before it can be as strong as that of the US as they have got a headstart.\n\nlook at the fact that most of their military hardware is produced in their own country while india has to import majority of it.\n\nbut yes the growing economy will oneday result in india becoming a military superpower as well.\n\nas for pakistan would grow to become a strong power in the region but nothing in the league of india and that too would happen only when pakistan enjoys good relations with india otherwise they will end up spending everything on their military.\n\nthe rupee is definitely going to rise but nothing dramatic is gonna happen it will be a long time process.\n\nas any sudden change(whether it is rise or fall) is bad news for the economy
To say that I'm jealous of you would imply that you have something that I want, but can't have. That isn't the case at all. I have something YOU want, and can't have. So you try to TAKE it. My defense of what I have is not jealousy. It's not even in the same dictionary as jealousy. Maybe you should learn the language before you try to use big words you don't understand. Now, if you want to be an American, and have a better life, good for you. Try starting by NOT breaking our laws. And then try being an AMERICAN. Not a MEXICAN in America. Assimilate yourself. Become one of us. Bring us your heritage, but leave Mexico in Mexico. That goes for your language, and your flag. But trust me, I'm NOT jealous of you. I'm simply ANNOYED by you.
As I understand it the fence will have trenching on each side.  This is primarily to prevent cars from ramming the fence, however, it will also make tunneling more difficult.  In addition there will be sensors and unmanned drone aircraft and thousands more border patrol officers. This may not catch every drug lord tunnel, since they spend a ton of money on those, but it will make it a lot more expensive for illegal immigrants to effectively tunnel.\n\nAlso, to the extent illegal immigrants have to go through a tunnel, we have won.  That would mean they were slowed to bottlenecks.  In that case the flow would be nothing like the levels we have seen over the last two decades.

"Same rights as anyone, including \n""The right of a person to return to his home in his native country traditionally has been included among an individual's fundamental rights. Only in the case of criminals was its denial regarded as a justifiable punishment, exile or banishment being regarded as one of the more severe penalties. Jurists were more concerned with securing the right of a person to leave his country freely, without unjustified interference from his ruler or government.

"Lying Comes Naturally to Republicans\nWhenever Republican politicians find themselves in trouble, their automatic knee-jerk reaction is to blame Democrats. If there is nothing to blame Democrats for, they merely make something up - they lie. This is exactly what the Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman, following the lead of his boss George W. Bush, has done and is doing. He is placing the blame of the mean and punitive House immigration bill on the Democrats, when he knows that it is an outrageous lie.\n""To be anti- George Bush is to be pro-American,"" \n\n I think he's dangerous, and he has to be stopped."" \n\nU.S. Troops Killed in Iraq Tops 2,400 <words/latestnews/index.php?id=6682> \n\nArticles of Impeachment\n\nof\n\nPresident George W.

Ultimately it was the hurricane of course. But a closer look does show that the poor construction and upkeep of the Levey's contributed to the disaster. There was so much political infighting in the region prior to Katrina that the little folks in NO had no chance. There were postponement of inspections of the Leveys due to complacency, and poor planing by the city, state, and federal governments all contributed to the tragedy. NO is a study in governmental idiocy on all levels.

You mean ghetto right?\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghetto
my opinion is that someone that drinks & drives & takes a life deserves the death penalty. Sorry to sound so harsh but my bro in law's cousin got hit by a drunk driver while she was driveing her taxi. She gave birth 2 months early & the baby died 2 weeks later & the guy killed the passenger in her car. So two lives i have no pitty for drunk drivers i dont care how damn good of a person you are. They can rott in hell.
First of all I am a legal citizen here in the US, but I support this cause because I feel it is very noble. \n\nSome people don't support this cause because they have never seen their children begging for food around the table and you don't have a penny to feed them. Why do you think they dare to cross the scorching dessert to come into this country? Some people don't support it because they have not seen their children die of hunger or a disease that can easily be cured because of lack of money!!\n\nYes they work out on the fields picking fruit all day long, raining, snowing, out in the blazing sun for less than minimun pay, or clean urinals, wash the dishes at the restaurants. I understand as someone here on yahoo answers said, that the children have to start somewhere and that they would be doing these types of jobs because they have to start somewhere. Maybe the person is right, but would you like you children to perform these kinds of jobs? I know I would not like my daughter to do this. \n\nNow have you ever wondered why is it that the price of the veggies out in the stores are cheap? Yes, it is because these people come into the US to do these jobs for very little money. If the US starts paying what they are supposed to pay (minimum wage) prices will sure go up. Many people don't understand this because they live off of welfare. \n\nUndocumented Immigrants do not qualify for welfare because of their status in this country. Some people may say that their children do qualify if born here in the US. Yes, they do, but don't forget they are US citizens. Now a days it is not easy to come and have children here in the US if you are not a legal resident. Here where I live, pregnant women that don't have proof of legal residency have to pay all doctor visits adding up to $3000.00 the least. \n\nI am not for the undocumented people who come here and harm others. But the ones who come here to look for a better life for their families, I support. Don't you think that if all they wanted to do is harm, they would cross the river through the night and rob the people near it? Why do they walk miles to cross check points and get norther? Yes, they risk themselves to bring food to their family's table. \n\nI work, go to college and am a mom, and feel very disappointed at those people who live off of welfare, but lets not forget that all US citizens can qualify for it depending on their income, not only the children of these people.\n\nAnd please understant that it is not onlye the HISPANICS who come here illegally. It is everybody around the world who has seen poverty to the lowest of its levels. One thing some people here in the US will never get to see.

If the decision had consequences for another person (fetus, dependent, relative, etc.) and the benefit to that person outweighed any risk to the person making the decision.

What they are talking about doing is not right. There are current laws on our books that would allow our govt to fine that illegal alien $250,000, plus incarceration, then deportation. Also, there are laws on our books that prohibit employers from hiring undocumented workers. They all need to follow the current laws.  \n\nYou are right. If you or I were to disobey the laws like these people are (employers as well as illegal aliens), we would be locked up for years.  It's just not right.

"Obvious child is right. The reason we don't do that is because Congress has SS money put in the general fund, so it isn't safeguarded from all thier porkbarrel projects.  Convenient apathy.  While I am not a fan of his, Al Gore's famous general idea of a ""Social Security Lock Box"" points out that problem.  First, we should have 401k's available through a third party, and not controlled by Congress.  This shouldn't be forced, either: If people want to be dumb with thier money and not invest, fine.  But if they did, when they tapped into it at retirement, the economy would boom.  Not only that, but it would be helped out while the 401ks were matureing because how they work is the money is invested in companies, and they grow and pay the investments back with intrest.  Of course this will never work because Congress has been spending way too much for decades, and the general fund has virtually been living off SS money.  So right now not only is YOUR SS money that could be GROWING AND helping the economy (Thats a long term and short term investment all in one) just sitting there, its being spent on other things as well by a congressman you don't like and who someone else elected in a different state.  Oh, by the way, Congressmen don't pay into SS, they have thier own special retirement plans. Show's how much they trust it, doesn't it?"
Wow...not much understanding here. Unofficially drugs are Mexico's largest export producing nearly 150 billion dollars. One of the benefits from securing the border will be to put a dent in the drug trade. The war on drugs will finally get one of the elements required to succeed, border security. Ironic that illegal immigration issues will be the catalyst. Ironic!
"Economic history of Nicaragua \n\nPre-Columbian and Colonial Era\nThe first Spanish explorers of Nicaragua found a welldeveloped agrarian society in the central highlands and Pacific lowlands. The rich volcanic soils produced a wide array of products, including beans, peppers, corn, cocoa, and cassava (manioc). Agricultural land was held communally, and each community had a central marketplace for trading and distributing food.\n\nThe arrival of the Spanish in the early 1500s destroyed, for all intents and purposes, the indigenous agricultural system. The early conquistadors were interested primarily in gold; European diseases and forced work in the gold mines decimated the native population. Some small areas continued to be cultivated at the end of the 1500s, but most previously tilled land reverted to jungle. By the early 1600s, cattle raising, along with small areas of corn and cocoa cultivation and forestry, had become the primary function of Nicaragua's land. Beef, hides, and tallow were the colony's principal exports for the next two and a half centuries.\n\n\nThe Coffee Boom, 1840s-1940s\nCoffee was the product that would change Nicaragua's economy. Coffee was first grown domestically as a curiosity in the early 1800s. In the late 1840s, however, as coffee's popularity grew in North America and Europe, commercial coffee growing began in the area around Managua. By the early 1850s, passengers crossing Nicaragua en route to California were served large quantities of Nicaraguan coffee. The Central American coffee boom was in full swing in Nicaragua by the 1870s, and large areas in western Nicaragua were cleared and planted with coffee trees.\n\nUnlike traditional cattle raising or subsistence farming, coffee production required significant capital and large pools of labor. Laws were therefore passed to encourage foreign investment and allow easy acquisition of land. The Subsidy Laws of 1879 and 1889 gave planters with large holdings a subsidy of US$0.05 per tree.\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, the entire economy came to resemble what is often referred to as a ""banana republic"" economy--one controlled by foreign interests and a small domestic elite oriented toward the production of a single agriculture export. Profits from coffee production flowed abroad or to the small number of landowners. Taxes on coffee were virtually nonexistent. The economy was also hostage to fluctuations in the price of coffee on the world markets--wide swings in coffee prices meant boom or bust years in Nicaragua.\n\n\nDiversification and Growth, 1945-77\nThe period after World War II was a time of economic diversification. The government brought in foreign technocrats to give advice on increasing production of new crops; hectarage in bananas and sugarcane increased, livestock herds grew, and cotton became a new export crop. The demand for cotton during the Korean War (1950-53) caused a rapid increase in cotton production, and by the mid-1950s, cotton was the nation's second largest export earner, after coffee.\n\nEconomic growth continued in the 1960s, largely as a result of industrialization. Under the stimulus of the newly formed Central American Common Market, Nicaragua achieved a certain degree of specialization in processed foods, chemicals, and metal manufacturing. By the end of the 1960s, however, import-substitution industrialization as a stimulus for economic growth had been exhausted. The 1969 Soccer War between Honduras and El Salvador, two members of the CACM, effectively suspended attempts at regional integration until 1987, when the Esquipulas II agreement was signed. By 1970 the industrial sector was undergoing little additional import substitution, and the collapse of the CACM meant that Nicaragua's economic growth, which had come from the expanding manufacturing sector, halted. Furthermore, the manufacturing firms that had developed under the tariff protection of the CACM were generally "

The CIA organised, armed and funded extreme Islamic Groups to fight the Soviets in Athganistan in the 80's.  That is fact, which nobody (including the US Government) denies.  \n\nMany of the same groups wanted to join the fight against Sadaam when he invaded Kuwait in 1990.  They considered that Sadaam (who ran a secualar dictatorship) was an enemy of Muslims because he refused to implement elements of Sharia law.  This is ironic when you consider that the US government later tried to justify the invasion of Iraq by claiming that Al Quaeda was working with Sadaam.\n\nThe US government refused their help and moved large quantities of US troops to Saudi Arabia for the first time.  Since that point one of the stated aims of Al Quaeda has been to remove US troops from  Saudi Arabia.  It was the reason they gave for the first attack on the WTC in the mid 90's.\n\nSo yes, the US government did help create some of the terrorists we face today.  They also funded and armed Sadaam through most of the 80's.  Naughty, naughty Uncle Sam!
No, the poor and middle class are not organized enough, if the unions get strong in this country there might be an uprising.

But we can change that with organization and votes.

Internal.  The external terrorism we can control, to an extent, with border checks, visas, etc.  Internal terrorism, on the other hand, is our own people attacking us.

If you mean the South African flag, there officially is no significance attached to the colours. Informally, the consensus seems to be :\n\nRed - the blood shed in the country's history. \nBlue - the sky and the oceans surrounding South Africa. \nGreen - the land and natural environment of the country. \nYellow - South Africa's natural resources, represented by gold. \nBlack - black South Africans and Africa in general\nWhite - white South Africans as well as peace\n\nBlack, Green and Yellow also happen to be the ANC's colours.\n\nRed, White and Blue are found on the flags of the UK and the Netherlands, as well as on the old South African flag (Orange instead of Red). Thus the new flag also symbolizes a coming together of the past and the present.

"That question is not as straight-forward as you might imagine. Some states (like California where I practice) have ""presumed father' and ""putative father"" statutes. Basically, any child born of a marriage is PRESUMED to be that of the husband. You can defeat that presumption in a number of ways. HOWEVER, the time limit for rebutting that presumption is short. In California, I believe it's two years. After that time, the presumed father becomes the legal father forever. After that two years has passed, you could have proof positive that you're not the father and it wouldn't do a d#mn bit of good."
"No, Bush did not deceive the American people. Please consider the following information as reference:\n\nIraqis can participate in three historic elections, pass the most liberal constitution in the Arab world, and form a unity government despite terrorist attacks and provocations. Yet for some critics of the president, these are minor matters. Like swallows to Capistrano, they keep returning to the same allegations--the president misled the\ncountry in order to justify the Iraq war; his administration\npressured intelligence agencies to bias their judgments; Saddam Hussein turned out to be no threat since he didn't possess weapons of mass destruction; and helping democracy take root in the Middle East was a postwar rationalization. The problem with these charges is that they are false and can be shown to be so--and yet people continue to believe, and spread, them. Let me examine each in turn:\n\nThe president misled Americans to convince them to go to war. ""There is no question [the Bush administration] misled the nation and led us into a quagmire in Iraq,"" according to Ted Kennedy. Jimmy Carter charged that on Iraq, ""President Bush has not been honest with the\nAmerican people."" And Al Gore has said that an ""abuse of the truth"" characterized the administration's ""march to war."" These charges are themselves misleading, which explains why no independent body has found them credible. Most of the world was operating from essentially\nthe same set of assumptions regarding Iraq's WMD capabilities. Important assumptions turned out wrong; but mistakenly relying on faulty intelligence is a world apart from lying about it.\n\nLet's review what we know. The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) is the intelligence community's authoritative written judgment on specific national-security issues. The 2002 NIE provided a key\njudgment: ""Iraq has continued its [WMD] programs in defiance of U.N. resolutions and restrictions. Baghdad has chemical and biological weapons as well as missiles with ranges in excess of U.N. restrictions; if left unchecked, it probably will have a nuclear weapon during this decade.""\n\nThanks to the bipartisan Silberman-Robb Commission, which\ninvestigated the causes of intelligence failures in the run-up to the war, we now know that the President's Daily Brief (PDB) and the Senior Executive Intelligence Brief ""were, if anything, more alarmist and less nuanced than the NIE"" (my emphasis). We also know that the intelligence in the PDB was not ""markedly different"" from that given to Congress. This helps explains why John Kerry, in voting to give\nthe president the authority to use force, said, ""I believe\nthat a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a threat, and a grave threat, to our security."" It's why Sen. Kennedy said, ""We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction."" And it's why Hillary Clinton said in 2002, ""In the four years since the inspectors, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild\nhis chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability and his nuclear program.""\n\nBeyond that, intelligence agencies from around the globe believed Saddam had WMD. Even foreign governments that opposed his removal from power believed Iraq had WMD: Just a few weeks before Operation Iraqi Freedom, Wolfgang Ischinger, German ambassador to the U.S., said, ""I think all of our governments believe that Iraq has produced\nweapons of mass destruction and that we have to assume that they continue to have weapons of mass destruction.""\n\nIn addition, no serious person would justify a war based on\ninformation he knows to be false and which would be shown to be false within months after the war concluded. It is not as if the WMD stockpile question was one that wasn't g"

Not only should your husband SAY something.  He should DO something about it.  The first step being to refuse to allow his father to be anywhere near you, him and any of children.  If you're husband can't even take this small step, then you and he need to have a serious talk about your future, or at the very least, your location.\n\nThat said, I seriously doubt that you did not see any indications of this kind of behavior prior to your marriage.  Did you attempt to take any action then?

"""But the practical effect of idealism is to rob the academic of his intellectual freedom: in familiar terms, research must be “politically correct” else it is taboo. Obviously, the term “politically correct” prejudges the epistemological supremacy of a particular ideology (usually socialism), and is thus, in itself, an abomination to Enlightenment naturalism. This is what Richard Feynman called “cargo cult science”; it is tremendously unhealthy for the academy, and hence for civilization at large. In those sectors of academia that are capital-intensive — most notably, the sciences — research is almost entirely funded by government grants, and is shaped to appeal to the grant evaluators."""

I agree with you 100%. The USA needs to wake up and start taking care of their selves, stop sending our food and giving our money to other nations, who wish we all would just kill over and die, who hates our guts and wants to watch as our Country disappears, sure they like our money and food and medical, heck its free who wouldn't want it free. But come on wake up here USA; take care of your own people first, help all those who are starving and cannot even afford to feed/cloth their own families. We/USA preach about our freedom, but yet we are constantly giving it up to other Countries, illegal immigrants seem to have more rights than we do, now tell me whats wrong with this picture, if we were to go to their Countries and demand our political rights, etc. we would be kicked out or thrown in jail. So come on USA lets wake up and stop giving our Country away to everyone else, Lets take it back and keep it the home of the free and the brave.

"Guantánamo Bay (Spanish: Bahía de Guantánamo) is a bay located in Guantánamo Province at the south-eastern end of Cuba (19°54′N 75°9′W).\n\nThe southern portion of the bay is surrounded by the United States Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, a naval base established in 1898. Recently, the base has begun to host a detainment camp for militant combatants collected from both Afghanistan and Iraq. The Guantanamo Bay detainment camp—in fact, even the U.S. presence in Guantánamo—is against the will of the Cuban government and considered to be an illegal occupation of the area. The Cuban government strongly denounces the treaty on grounds that it violates article 52 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. However, this article declares a treaty void only if its conclusion has been procured by the threat or use of force in violation of international law (see below). While the United States may have applied political pressure to Cuba in 1903, there was no use of force or the threat of its use.\n\nThe bay was originally named Guantánamo by the Taino. Christopher Columbus landed at the location known as Fisherman's Point in 1494. The bay was briefly renamed Cumberland when the British took it in the first part of the 18th century during the War of Jenkins' Ear. In 1790 the British garrison at Cumberland died of fever as had a previous British force, before they could attack Santiago by land.\n\nDuring the Spanish-American War the U.S. fleet attacking Santiago needed shelter from the summer hurricane season. Thus Guantánamo with its excellent harbor was chosen for this purpose. The Marines landed successfully with naval support; however, as they went inland Spanish resistance increased to the point at which Cuban scouts were needed to save the United States Marines.\n\nThe US Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, sometimes called ""GTMO"" or ""Gitmo"", covers 116 km² (about 45 square miles) on the western and eastern banks of the bay. It was established in 1898, when the United States obtained control of Cuba from Spain at the end of the Spanish-American War, following the 1898 invasion of Guantánamo Bay. The U.S. government obtained a perpetual lease that began on February 23, 1903, from Tomás Estrada Palma, an American citizen, who became the first President of Cuba. The newly formed American protectorate incorporated the Platt Amendment in the Cuban Constitution. The Cuban-American Treaty held, among other things, that the United States, for the purposes of operating coaling and naval stations, has ""complete jurisdiction and control"" of the Guantánamo Bay, while the Republic of Cuba is recognized to retain ultimate sovereignty"

"Good luck with your work. In the U.S.A. it took us 40 years to get laws passed to stop Corporations from Poisoning Americans. Now the Republicans in Congress have un did all that work and returned to Pollution as usual. We have kids in my City that have Cancer from waste dumps, the EPA does nothing, the Government does nothing. Corporations love to pollute and let tax payers pay the bill to clean up the mess they make. Please Read ""silent spring"" by Rachel Carson. I got it at the library. One of the reasons US manufacturing went to Mexico is no pollution laws there.\nIf I can help let me know, leave comments at the link below."
That is the dynamics of power. Whether you like it or not, we have to toe the line.

I don't even know anymore the true reason why America, or more specifically Georgie Porgie, decided that invading Iraq was in good reason... and as far as the reason for other probable invasions : I see it as a spoiled rotten little bastard child doing whatever the F*ck he wants to do, just because he can! But thats just my opinion. I could tell you right now, that he would be the kid in high school who's shoelaces I tied together to the seat on the bus, on the field trip to Washington, DC. lol  And laughed as he fell over trying to get out! lol Oh boy, ok I'm done!

The ultimate question for you to ask before taking the LSAT (I am not sure about the LNAT) is if you do well on a standard exam.  If you are good at it, you will very much likely succeed in getting high scores and in law school and the bar exam later on. My mentor who sat on the bar review commission told me there's a strikingly high correlation between the LSAT score, and the law school performance and the bar exam.  \n\nHaving said that, if you are not good at it, the best you can do is to learn how to approach the standard exams. And I want to remind you that being a poor standard exam taker is not insurmountable to overcome this.  However, you have to know how and follow exactly what I tell you here.  Here is how: The most important thing is when you practice by solving the problems, make sure you always time them.  The next important thing is once again, time them.  Next thing you have to worry about is .... you got the idea by now -- time them!!!!\n\nRemember also it is a game that most of us have the ability to do well.  But I have seen way too many people caught up with notion that you have to get all the questions right.  You should have no problem solving about a half of the problems correctly before you begin practicing them.

Generally speaking, speeding tickets will give you points, regardless of whether you have a permit or a license. Some states, however (I believe), will take into consideration that you had a permit, and you won't get as many points.

Yes....INS should be watching where these illegals go and they should go fine the business owners.
"Most people want to believe them. As someone famous(I think it was Winston Churchill)once said ""You can fool all of the people some of the time,you can fool some of the people all of the time,but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time"""
"i think there is a wave of xenophobia sweeping through right now and that is causing alot of it.  as for facts that back up the quotes...many of them are not compiled correctly, or promoted heavily from skinhead and other racist sources, but passed around until they aren't really connected with those sources anymore.  and much like any ""facts"" from those areas are very very distorted, or even just made up.\n\ni also find it interesting that many of the people that are attacking the illegal immigrants would also probably not hesitate to say they would do anything at all for their families...and many illegals have said this was a driving force behind their decision to cross the border.\n\nas for the groups that say they should do it legally or what not...laws change, thats just the way it is and thank god we live in a country where the laws are flexible, despite how slow and red tape filled this process can be sometimes.  so yeah during this time of the law changing some people are going to get it easier than those previous to the change, but there always seems to be people resistant to this.\nlook at the equal rights movements, the start of unions, women's rights to vote, etc etc...there was an alarming number of people that heavily tried to resist these movements as well....and sadly some still do.\n\nas for hurting this country, i don't really see it, illegal immigrants are not going to make or break any of the programs that are starting to buckle right now, but do make a convenient scapegoat i think as something people can point to and blame.  on the other hand, they do spend a good bit, and many local businesses depend on the money they spend(which they are charged sales tax on) so these companies would really get hit hard if they lost those customers.  apartment landlords would also really take a hit it seems, and despite the fact we have homeless people, there isn't really a shortage of housing available."

"The issue you present is sometimes referred to as a ""constructive taking."" It raises the question of whether government action which does not actually appropriate land creates such barriers to its use that it amounts to a ""taking"" within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment (""nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation"").\n\nGenerally speaking the courts have answered no to such claims and, on the facts you present, my opinion is that you have little chance of succeeding in any lawsuit. \n\nThere is simply no right to demand that city planning authorities act in such a way as to ensure that your land will be attractive to developers."
"I agree.  There was a time when people in rural areas where they had more children than wanted to stay on the farm could 'seek their fortune' in the city.  Now jobs they used to take until they found their niche are taken at lower wages by illegal immigrants.  \n\nI am particularly irritated when I hear that ""illegal immigrants only take jobs Americans don't want"".  Americans do those jobs still in states that have few illegal immigrants.  If the illegal immigrants quit coming, poor Americans would have more options.  That is why poor Americans are the ones who most adamantly oppose illegal immigration."
"I truly believe that George Bush is standing up for what he believes in: freedom for all people.  There is nothing worse than living under the tyranny of a dictator.\n\nBoth of my parents lived through that in WWII and fled their countries.

And I totally respect President Bush for what he is doing to free those people who have no voice of their own. \n\nBy the way, have you seen these pictures of those thanking President Bush?

It will depend on what taxes you owe and how far behind you are. The IRS does not stop the renewal of drivers licenses to enforce tax debts. You state or city might.

I think he is a nice old man ---- I laugh when I think about the US policy towards him - as if Cuba represented any threat to us.  The Cuban people live free from crime and poverty and fear while millions of people die in Africa and we say and do nothing.   It is time to normalize relations with Cuba open the borders and let there be free travel and trade  That alone will surely turn that country into a democracy quicker than the policy we have had for decades
I agree with that totally and if everything I write was not being monitored by our government I would just let my feelings & ideas go. I can't stand that dumbo looking man who is going to lead us in to starvation more poverty and civil war. Way to go Mr. AWOL Bush
The IRS will garnish up too 75% of your gross, so I think that is the max.
It's a Boatswain's Mate. Below you'll find a link to the Navy's description. It's an enlisted rating, not an officer program. Usually as Seaman Apprentice. \n\nYou know in a movie when you hear a whistle (pipe)? That would be a Boatswain's Mate piping the officer aboard. And the other answer was correct, it's usually pronounced Bosun's Mate. \n\nThe second link I posted below sesm to have a lot of information from a former Boatswain's Mate.
"The neocons within the Republican party have put Alito and Roberts into the Supreme Court. They are strict constructionists, people who believe in the strict interpretation of the original Constitution without amendments. They believe that the President has powers beyond what he is embued with, because of the words ""Unless the president thinks otherwise"" in the original constitution. Neocon far far right wingers believe that if Steven dies or retires from the high court, Bush will appoint and have ratified another strict constructionist, thereby giving the neacons a virtual dictatorship with no legal way to have checks and balances within the government. it is already happening. \n\nThe Republicans are banking on the supremest court rubber stamping all unconstitutional acts committed by the Bush and future administrations, and also plan to dismantle all the amendments including the Bill of Rights. They also plan to declare by majority congressional vote the USA a Christian nation, and then systematically, remove other at will who are not Cristians.\n\nItg is all spelled out the Project for Americans for a New Centruy, a think tank from the far right conceived of by Dick Chaney, and whose members include papa Bush, Rumsfeld, etc...\n\nThey do not think they are committing political suicide. The omeny and world domination they hope to grasp for good is worth their efforts, so they see to feel. They have the military ion their side and huge stock piles of money. \n\nThe illuniati have a warchest of 65 billion dillars, or is that trillion?\n\nIt is the most dangerous time in world history, far surpassing the Nazi regime. The Republicans, especially in red states where elections are totally dishonest due to rigged electronic voting machines, are not worried at all."
"If you want to be a union member you have to first get a job at a union shop.  There is a probationary period of probably three months.  It varies from company to company.  After that period, if the company thinks you will be an asset to them, they will keep you and you will join the union at that time.  This is how it is done.\n\nBe a good union member and make damn sure your company MAKES MONEY!!  If your company folds, you will be out of a job.  Union or no union.  \n\nAlways remember that you and your co-workers are the union, not the union representative or other union officers.  People who say that ""the union doesn't do anything for me"" do not have their head on right.  Stick together as one and do for yourselves.  If you are united, no company can defeat you.  A united workforce is what the companies fear most.  Always remember that your bosses go to seminars to learn how to break unions and divide the work force.  They spend big bucks on breaking unions.  Be smart and do your homework too."

"From what I remember as a Southerner, the Democratic Party voted OVERWHELMINGLY against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, yet still retain 90% of the voters from the affected minority communities. The Republican Party, the party of Abraham Lincoln voted overwhelmingly FOR Civil Rights. How these minorities can ever trust a Democrat to help them is beyond me. The same racist Democrats who voted against Civil Rights then gave the minorities a body blow and bussed them into unfamiliar neighborhoods while their own schools were let to fall into ruin. Then came the young men's meat-grinder of Viet Nam......created exclusively by President John Kennedy and extended/escalated by the Anti-Christ President Lyndon Johnson......and finally ended by the Republican President Richard Nixon, thankfully, while the minorities still had young men left alive.\n\nLearning a good lesson from the building of minority ""Projects"" in our inner-cities, Democrats in power unleashed an Urban Renewal plan to totally destroy historic buildings and old minority neighborhoods all through the South in the name of progress and revitalization. The further gentrification of these neighborhoods could totally wipe out any identifiable minority landmarks and send the minorities streaming into the countryside trying to find affordable housing........or in a worse-case scenario the minorities will be offered another ""helping hand"" by the Democratic Party and be housed in planned neighborhoods of typically poor construction and suspect security.\n\nMore white Republicans have moved to the South but cannot seem to convert any minorities into their ranks, except the Hispanic minority. As Democrats push to create State Lotteries across the South the white and Asian students begin to get unequal availability to university scholarships while the other minorities lose BILLIONS of dollars a year on gambling in those same lotteries......meanwhile the students in these gambling households do not get a fair percentage of the scholarship money. That's because the Democrats that voted for the lotteries also voted for the exclusion of C and D students from the lottery money pools. There should have been trade schools built and special remedial colleges built with that money to help the unfortunate children of the gambling parents.\n\nThe migration of Hispanics to the South and the region's reliance on their workforce will force the Democrats to wonder how they can convert Catholic populations to accept the voluntary genocide that many other minorities have willingly accepted in the abortion of their youngest generation.\n\nFinally, in a last-gasp effort of true integration the Democratic Party will surely support the total 50-50 integration of all historically minority universities in the United States.\n\nThe Republicans and the Democrats cannot be trusted to protect our Civil Rights or our Civil Liberties. Nobody in the East, South, North or West can fix these two parties.\n\nThey both prey upon us and we smile and take it. We deserve them...........until we create a party of dissent and common sense........a party of dignity, heart, hard work and fairness."
People who believe there is always a peaceful solution to everything are just naive. War is definitely a last resort, but it sometimes comes down to that. The sooner people accept that, the more INNER peace they will have.
I don't know if it can ever be established. Because of religious beliefs and grudges that date back thousands of years, the fighting will never stop. It is sad to see that because of ones beliefs, they are willing to kill themselves in order to kill many others in the process. Unfortunately that is just the nature of mankind.

"It isn't that conservatives believe liberals are less intelligent, just illogical.  You can't argue with a liberal and use logic because they will always say, ""well I feel"".  You can't argue with an emotional person.  Liberalism is about guilt.  They feel guilty about being more fortunate than the poor so instead of trying to find an answer logically they want to throw money (usually somebody elses') at it and depend on the government to solve the problem.  \nAs I recall the left likes to call Bush stupid when he has a MBA from Harvard so that door does swing both ways.  Everyone has the right to express themselves, but they don't have the right to not be offended."

"The Story of Mother's Day\n\nThe earliest Mother's Day celebrations can be traced back to the spring celebrations of ancient Greece in honor of Rhea, the Mother of the Gods. During the 1600's, England celebrated a day called ""Mothering Sunday"". Celebrated on the 4th Sunday of Lent (the 40 day period leading up to Easter*), ""Mothering Sunday"" honored the mothers of England. \n*(For more information on Lent/Easter check out - Easter on the Net)\nDuring this time many of the England's poor worked as servants for the wealthy. As most jobs were located far from their homes, the servants would live at the houses of their employers. On Mothering Sunday the servants would have the day off and were encouraged to return home and spend the day with their mothers. A special cake, called the mothering cake, was often brought along to provide a festive touch. \n\n\nAs Christianity spread throughout Europe the celebration changed to honor the ""Mother Church"" - the spiritual power that gave them life and protected them from harm. Over time the church festival blended with the Mothering Sunday celebration . People began honoring their mothers as well as the church.\n\nIn the United States Mother's Day was first suggested in 1872 by Julia Ward Howe (who wrote the words to the Battle hymn of the Republic) as a day dedicated to peace. Ms. Howe would hold organized Mother's Day meetings in Boston, Mass ever year. \n\nIn 1907 Ana Jarvis, from Philadelphia, began a campaign to establish a national Mother's Day. Ms. Jarvis persuaded her mother's church in Grafton, West Virginia to celebrate Mother's Day on the second anniversary of her mother's death, the 2nd Sunday of May. By the next year Mother's Day was also celebrated in Philadelphia.\n\nMs. Jarvis and her supporters began to write to ministers, businessman, and politicians in their quest to establish a national Mother's Day. It was successful as by 1911 Mother's Day was celebrated in almost every state. President Woodrow Wilson, in 1914, made the official announcement proclaiming Mother's Day as a national holiday that was to be held each year on the 2nd Sunday of May. \n\nWhile many countries of the world celebrate their own Mother's Day at different times throughout the year, there are some countries such as Denmark, Finland, Italy, Turkey, Australia, and Belgium which also celebrate Mother's Day on the second Sunday of May.\n\n\nI hope this helps....\n\nDon"

HE HAS NO FOLLOWERS HE IS THE LEADER BEC. HE BOUGHT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY\n\n\nNow that we live in the age of disinformation, maybe it won't make any difference to you. The ages are getting darker and darker. And I wanted to share with you the following facts: If you agree with me please send them to as many friends of you as possible... \n\nThe transnational companies which are using American government and ARMY to sip oil from Iraq are paying back with some of the money they have earned by selling the oil they have been continuously stealing from Iraq. They will do the same in Iran and Venezuella.\n\nYou won't believe it but some transnational companies are there to force the Yahoo Corp. to delete my questions here. But I am continuously changing my name to hide it from them. Until they find me, thousands of people will have learned that America is no more controlled by its national companies. Transnational companies are a great threat both for America and the world. A transnational company is one that feels no loyalty to any nation. They don’t pay any taxes to any government and they are strong enough to overthrow governments all over the world. For the time being they are using Americans. They threat America by the fact that if they draw their capital and investments from America 25 % of its population will be jobless. \n\nThe fight and the tension between the members of the Senate is in fact a fight between the American and non-American capital owners. Right after the 9/11 the nationalistic or loyal American capital owners became a little bit stronger and passed a decree from the senate to the effect that the central government and the states are to buy their weapons from NATIONAL war industries... But at present non-American capital owners have become stronger enough to sip petroleum out of Iraq by using American ARMY. This is the horrible fact about American Politics and Bush is not loyal to America.\n\nSorry for the terrible English. Wish you prosperity and happiness. I am a mere warrior to enlighten people about facts.… Yes, they are my facts. But believe me they aren’t groundless.
Yes i have had that happen to me and I was much better qualified to do the job and had many more years of experience at it the only reason I was turned down was because I was not Bi=lingual and 98% of my co-worker were Hispanic I filed a complaint with EEOC. which I won after I was illegally fired for filing the complaint
I love the enlightened intellect of the 20 and under crowd on this site.  Haven't been anywhere, haven't seen anything, haven't done anything, but they sure have all the answers.\n\nReminds me of the hippies during the 60's who were all for saving the planet while they drove around in VW's, the single most polluting car ever built. Huh!!!!!\n\nMore liberal logic I guess.
The only person you could consider as worshipping Americans is perhaps Tony Blair, like every other race there is good and bad Americans and the English know that\n\nI'm guessing you're American and thats a good example of why Americans are not worshipped in any way
Yes,many people noticed! There is a movie out against Walmart.
As long as men are in control of the governments there will never be peace and harmony. Think about it .

"Mr Harvey is a theatrical old man.  He used the term ""crusade"" to incite his listeners to feel a certain predetermined way.\nFrom a historical stand point the Crusades were not about religion, they were about the fears of European rulers.  The expansion of the Ottoman Empire threatened my rulers, the only way one could get an army to fight thousands of miles away was to create an agenda and a cause. At that time in our history religion served that purpose...today it is the ""fight for democracy""."
What is supposed to happen is the senate is to come up with a competing bill.  The attempt to use the border enforcement issue to slip in such an extreme amnesty and throw open our borders was so insane and caused such a huge backlash that the whole issue is waaaaay too hot for the senate to touch.  Senators know that to not support a strong enforcement only approach is political suicide but they have a strong financial interest in not supporting such a bill (ie they will lose tons of slush money if they come up with a strong bill like 4437).  They will kill all attempts to even debate the issue.\n\nLikely, 4437 will become law by default.

Harpers Ferry has a population of 400 people.\n* $2,500,000 for the Goddard Space Flight Center for radiance process dry-cleaning capability\n* $500,000 for construction of the Sparta Teapot Museum\nand the list goes on and on...\n\nYup!  I think we could find a few places to make cuts to pay for securing our borders.
You obviously missed the point of the protest. I would suggest you switch from Fox to another newcast.\n\nIt is to symbolize the affect that illegal immigrants and their supporters have on the economy.\n\nIt's so you can ask yourself what do you have to lose by kicking them out? The issue is not to open the border, because I know how much your racist rhetoric would hate to have spanish people sharing the same public fountain as you. It's about granting rights to those who are already contributing to the economy.\n\nBut I'm sure you'll chose as a best answer whoever eggs on your racism.
Why not? And for the same reason as China.  The population will soon exceed that of China, and the rate of economic growth in India has far outpaced that of the 1st world nations lately.\n\nIt hasn't happened yet, but I think it is just a matter of time.

OK, (taking a long breath) it really does not get more complex than this. In fact, to break it down, one first has to look at what are these 'ideas'behind the creation of terror. Who are the real terrorists, and according to whose point of view are we defining these ideas of terror? This situations is something of a 'clash of civilizations' Huntington warned us about. Obviously Fukuyama's end of history is still not clear in sight. It is also similar to the Cold War, just that this time it got a bit hotter! In the C.War we saw 2 ideologies that simply could not live together in the same planet. the world lived in terror until one prevailed. Here, too we have two very diverging ideologies, and sooner or later one will have to prevail. the globe is becoming too small for too much variety, and in fact we all will need to move, more or less, together, bc when one is left behind, the civilization's clash will only grow deeper. \n\nIn order to prevent this from becoming limitless.... \nCan the man George W.Bush (Jr) end terrorism? probably not, but perhaps the UN and various other international forums where states can diplomatically speak their minds, are our only hopes. Education is also key.. as most of these ppl do not know the cause they're fighting for but simply believe in their leaders that the enemy is the 'devil'. One ideology has to prevail, as we cant live with more than one superpower (there will be endless wars) its like 2 huge asteroids taht are about to crash.. hopefully the one that survives shares its self interests with ours, and so far this was the US. Good thing that throughout history innately it was so: nation that shares its own interests ends up in power. so far, democracy has proven to be the best system, allowing (more or less) everyone's self interests to be in practice. Till then, Fukuyama will have to wait.\n\n(little note: this is not coming from an American, not one bit American)\n\nLord, I write, I write and in the end I doubt I make sense.
There are PLENTY of us that do stuff such as that.  If you go look at the blog entry I did today (http://sinthyia.blogspot.com/) you will see that many of us DO care about what is going on and do our best to help and bring awareness.  Despite how the media and others portray us we are not party animal slackers, we know the issues and pay attention and get involved with causes.  The media never shows that though.  We know we are the ones that, in a few years, will be the leaders and make decisions that count and decide how things are run.  We take that seriously!  We know the issues today and what is wrong and what needs to be changed.  We are involving ourselves with them and trying to get the changes made that need to happen.  We pay attention to the issues and follow politics. So don't be so hard on us, we are doing things just not the way things were done in the 60's, but in our own way and fashion.

the first president i can remember was Gerald Ford and i was 7 or 8 yrs old. we went to see him in a nearby town where he was supposed to be, he didn't go through in a car, but flew over in a helicopter- we waved at all the helicopters as we didnt know which one he was in. this was near Rifle, Colorado- he was touring a mine near there.
Yes, I've seen it, and your right, it is eye opening. I also wasnt real impressed at first, but if you just look at the facts, you will see the government did play a part.

I would rather have my money taken than be raped or murdered.  Yes i would be ticked off if my money was taken but i wouldn't have the mental scars left by rape.  I don't think having your money taken is destroying your life like Perfect Gent implied.
Like the question. very funny.
Well, critique is important for any country. Say your make-up's fucked up and your worst enemy tells you, you get pissed because its her...but you fix the problem and then she can't say anything. So I think if it's good criticism, not like USA sucks, but a real problem...we aren't better than anyone else, we just have more luxuries. We're not perfect and knowing what our weaknesses are, allow us to better this country. So if it's ignorant, ignore it, but if this country can eventually better from it, then it wasn't just a waste of breath. If they choose to better our country instead of theirs its their loss and our gain.
okay, listen...the other folks who answered don't know what they're talking about.  u can easily get this expunged from your record...regardless of your age.  it's not a sex crime, and it's not DUI related.  u have let enough time lapse...expungement is DEFINITELY a-ok, and I'm sure it'll be easily done w/o a hearing or anything.  u just need to get a lawyer, and he/she can do it for a few hundred bucks...maybe $200-$300.  well worth it to start fresh on a clean slate.  go for it!

Rumsfeld, and\nAttorney General Alberto Gonzales\n\nThe President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. - - ARTICLE II, SECTION 4 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n\nPresident George W. Bush, Vice President Richard B. Cheney, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales have committed violations and subversions of the Constitution of the United States of America in an attempt to carry out with impunity crimes against peace and humanity and war crimes and deprivations of the civil rights of the people of the United States and other nations, by assuming powers of an imperial executive unaccountable to law and usurping powers of the Congress, the Judiciary and those reserved to the people of the United States, by the following acts:\n\n1) Seizing power to wage wars of aggression in defiance of the U.S. Constitution, the U.N. Charter and the  rule of law; carrying out a massive assault on and occupation of Iraq, a country that was not threatening the United States, resulting in the death and maiming of over one hundred thousand Iraqis, and thousands of U.S. G.I.s.\n\n2) Lying to the people of the U.S., to Congress, and to the U.N., providing false and deceptive rationales for war.\n\n3) Authorizing, ordering and condoning direct attacks on civilians, civilian facilities and locations where civilian casualties were unavoidable. \n\n4) Instituting a secret and illegal wiretapping and spying operation against the people of the United States through the National Security Agency.\n\n5) Threatening the independence and sovereignty of Iraq by belligerently changing its government by force and assaulting Iraq in a war of aggression.\n\n6) Authorizing, ordering and condoning assassinations, summary executions, kidnappings, secret and other illegal detentions of individuals, torture and physical and psychological coercion of prisoners to obtain false statements concerning acts and intentions of governments and individuals and violating within the United States, and by authorizing U.S. forces and agents elsewhere, the rights of individuals under the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Eighth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n7) Making, ordering and condoning false statements and propaganda about the conduct of foreign governments and individuals and acts by U.S. government personnel; manipulating the media and foreign governments with false information; concealing information vital to public discussion and informed judgment concerning acts, intentions and possession, or efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction in order to falsely create a climate of fear and destroy opposition to U.S. wars of aggression and first strike attacks.\n\n8) Violations and subversions of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, both a part of the ""Supreme Law of the land"" under Article VI, paragraph 2, of the Constitution, in an attempt to commit with impunity crimes against peace and humanity and war crimes in wars and threats of aggression against Afghanistan, Iraq and others and usurping powers of the United Nations and the peoples of its nations by bribery, coercion and other corrupt acts and by rejecting treaties, committing treaty violations, and frustrating compliance with treaties in order to destroy any means by which international law and institutions can prevent, affect, or adjudicate the exercise of U.S. military and economic power against the international community.\n\n9) Acting to strip United Sta"

Its an accusation founded on Iraqi eyewitness's and given the level of feeling in Iraq towards the US then it might have been made up but we cannot discount the evidence yet. \n\nIts guerilla warfare of the worst kind in Iraq when you don't know who exactly is your enemy but you can see them and their supporters all around you. It must be extremely frustrating for soldiers serving there and yes like you say fear, stress and frustration could all have been a cause.\n\nThose marines even if they were veterans of combat, would have felt scared and angry especially if their freinds had been blown up in front of them by a roadside bomb. If they did do it then it was a crippling loss of control and disipline on their part that as soldiers trained to deal with it shouldn't have happend. They will be punished according to army law which is there to deal with situations like that. The press shouldn't pass judgement on them before a trial has been properly concluded.\n\nThe insurgents were doing what anyone fighting against a foreign army would so we can hardly accuse them of cowardice. They see the US as occupying their country we wouldn't accuse the French Resistance of Cowardice in WW2 would we when their tactics have been replicated in so many wars since then. \n\nThose US marines will be going through hell even if they did do it. If they did and if then they should be punished but if they didn't the world owes them an apology for an unfounded accusation and judgement. \n\nWe cannot judge someone without all the facts.

No thing is bad or good in its own stead. It is the way it is used, implemented and taken up which makes it bad or good. In India reservation was and is used to please some people and get quick votes, be it SC&ST provisions in constitution which was original for 15 years or implementation of Mandal commission after years of lying in bag. There are many aspects of reservation. It is fact there are some strata of society who need support to rise from their current status of poverty or backwardness.\n\n\nHowever there is opposition for reservation because the benefit of it are not going to actual people rather they are taken up by some people of these society who are already in up class are taking up these benefits whereas actual needy people are still at the same place. No one will object if a really needy get the benefit, You and all are furious since it is someone who is not needy who is reaping benefit.

No because the boy was authorized to care for the bird and cat.  It is not unlawful entry and theft.  He was careless.  You may sue, but you did employ someone underage to do an adult's job.
The Good Samaritan law means that if you stop to help someone who (for example) was in an accident, they can't sue you if what you did caused them further injury. Or they can't sue if you didn't have specialized training and you still tried to help. The law was intended to encourage the average person to help people in distress without worrying that they'd get sued for damages later.
It depends quite a bit on the state. To give you an example though, here's the law in CA: rape is punihsable by 3, 6, or 8 years in prison. Rape of a child under 14 years old who is 10 or more years younger than the accused is punihsable by 15 years to life. Molestation is punishable by not more than one year in jail or 2, 3, or 4 years in prison. There are not separate repeat offender punihsments, aside from the 3 strikes law.

Illegal labor isn't cheap. There are too many costs to society. It's just shifting the costs.\n\nAs a conservative, I do not support illegal immigration, and am justly concerned that our government, which has the duty of maintaining the integrity of our borders, is failing so miserably.\n\nIf we need more immigration, LEGAL immigration, then our policies should have reflected that, with increased allowances for immigrants.\n\nBut this out of control situation is indefensible. If we need itinerant workers, then by all means let's set up a program. Then we could control entry, and eliminate the entry of criminals or people with diseases. And we need to eliminate the absurd concept that a child born here is automatically a citizen.\n\nNo, the government has no authority to disobey the laws of the land, and be negligent towards its duties. Time to stop the flood of illegals.

I am not sure where did you get an idea that you cannot challenge the action under Chevron. \nChevron approach – to resolving by court if the construction is legal is roughly this:\n1. Ask: Did congress directly speak to the issue? if the congress has answered – keep the agencies to that.\n2.If congress did not speak:\n      a. Check if the Agency has reasonably resolved the precise issue? If the agency's interpretation is unreasonable, or impermissible -- based on other congressional intent or on Constitution -- remand it back to the agency so that the agency can change it.\n      b. If the congress has explicitly delegated the policy to the agency,  the agency is allowed any policy as long AS it reasonably serves the purpose of the statute, But it can still be stricken down if it is  arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to the statute.\n\nSo nowhere i the chevron does it say that you CAN'T challenge agency action
Four Score and Seven years ago, our Fathers brought forth on this continent- a new nation - concieved in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\n\nNow we are engaged in a great civil war.  Testing whether that Nation- or any Nation so concieved can long endure.\n\nWe are met on a great battlefield of that war- we have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place of those who gave their lives- that this Nation might live.  It is all together fitting and proper that we should do this.\n\nbut in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not hallow- this ground.  The brave men, living and dead, have consecrated it far above our power to add or detract.  The world will not remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.  It is for us the living, rather, to dedicate ourselves to finishing the work that they so nobly started here.  \n\nIt is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us - that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to the cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion.\n\nThat we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain - that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom - and that the government of the people, by the people and for the people, shall not perish from this earth.

Hugo Chavez really does not care about his people almost all the country is in poverty and he is using the money from oil to buy arms and build up the military instead of helping his people prosper and get out of poverty. I would not be surprise if Chavez makes Venezuela a communist country since he gets along so well with Cuba. In regards to oil if Chavez cuts us off from oil it will definitely make oil prices purge but alter the relations with the US and so we might end up going to war with Venezuela or the US will have to assassinate Chavez and make sure a leader that will cooperate with the US takes his place.
I'm currently in the Air Force stationed at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. You must seriously consider all of your options before you make a decision to enter the military.\n\nFirst off, what are you interested in? I, for example, was interested in computers, so I got into the computer field. I'm actually learning network security which is one of the most interesting things I have ever learned about. My point is, find something that you like doing and see what options the military has for you in that field.\n\nIt's also important to find out what branch of the service you want to go in. The Air Force is known to be a little more relaxed and have jobs that don't require too much stress upon you. We are just as important as any other troop out there, only most of us are safe behind our desks. =P\n\nJust from what you have said, the military sounds like a good option for you, but don't just take my word for it. You say that you want to move around... well, heck... I'm in freakin' Germany right now and I'm having the time of my life! I've traveled to more countries in the past two years than any of my friends have in their entire lives combined. Short on funds? Military pay is known to be pretty weak, but the benefits are endless. They'll pay for college, housing, food, medical, dental... the works. Even if you don't plan on making the military a career, it'll definitely help push you in the right direction.\n\nI hope I helped and good luck to you. If you'd like more information, feel free to contact me via e-mail.

"Your disability does not automatically qualify you as having been mentally incapacitated during the period in question.  Each state has a different definition of ""mental incapacitation,"" but most will define it as something similar to ""the inability to make decisions to which legal consequences may attach.""  This can be due to an actual medical disability (a mentally retarded individual may be found to be mentally incapacitated), or it could be situational (the fit of rage rendered you unable to make rational decisions).  It could even be wholly unrelated to any mental condition whatsoever (a perfectly normal, mentally healthy 5-year old doesn't have the mental capacity to enter into a binding contract).\n\nIf you file your claim, and it is challenged as untimely, you will need medical evidence establishing that your particular disability qualified you as ""mentally incapacitated"" during the period at issue.  \n\nOn a wholly different note, most states have a Tort Claims Act that will require you to jump through various other hoops prior to filing a claim against a government entity.  Be sure to look into those requirements as well."
It's hard to say. It depends what the criteria is for something to be considered a political party. And then there might be instances where two different parties go by the same name. Furthermore, what about divisions in parties? For example, in the United States, there are numerous Socialist parties. Would you group them all together or count them individually?
Hmmm. The way you asked that question I never thought about it before but I dont see how it could do anything but improve our relations with latino countries. I believe it could only show us to be the compassionate country we claim to be.
Well, being a Christian does mean forgiveness; however, you shouldn't suffer do to the poor decisions of others.  If you do plan to sue, sue only for the exact amount in medical bills and lost income.  You are entitled to that amount.  Make sure you have receipts for everything.  It is not unethical to sue if your only in it for exact compensation and not for greed.

"YES!  If you have a open felony warrant and you leave the state you are then considered a ""Fugitive of Justice"".  The more important question is....will the other state extradite you back for prosecution.  \n\n\nIt is variable by state, but generally the state has up to 90 days to pick you up and transport you.  Sometimes they choose not to extradite and you have spent days or weeks for no reason whatsover.\n\nGenerally this will go smoother with the court if you turn yourself in before they get lucky and find you first."

Yes.  With just the towers there will still be many who will or will attempt to cross and there will be a lot of shooting and then I believe we(the USA) will be blamed for a lot of carelessness, etc., and the whole thing will blow up in our faces in the global community.  Best to go ahead and do it right to start with and put up a fence.  The costs?  No much considering the costs of those who died on 9/11 and the money we're spending to rebuild Iraq.  What about stopping the terror right here at home.  It is the least we can do to help show our young people in Iraq we are doing our part here. Janie

This will have to take place in small claims court.  Depending on the state and the jurisdiction the law varies.  If it was a verbal agreement it's going to be hard to prove.

Affirmative action applies to everyone.  You're either a beneficiary of it or a victim of it.  Ultimately, I think it is an insult to those for whom it was meant to benefit.  It basically tells them that they are worthless and could never get anywhere in life if certain special exemptions weren't made for them.

Cloture is a parliamentary procedure by which debate is ended and an immediate vote is taken on the matter under discussion.\n\nIf HIMMA is enacted, it would allow insurers to offer health plans that are exempt from state consumer protection laws, including mental health parity, psychology “freedom of choice,” mental health benefit mandates and mandated offering laws. \n\nWithout these state requirements insurers would be able to offer “barebones plans.” The only condition is that they also offer employers an alternative plan based on the state employee benefits in one of the five most populous states, which could also be “barebones.” As a result, the benefits in the alternative plan may still be inadequate.
I don't think anyone at the top of the leaderboard really seems wiser, though they may seem a bit more knowledgeable on certain topics.\n\nThe thing about arguing politics is that those questions can get tons of responses, making it less likely for one particular user to be chosen as best, no matter how well written it may be.\n\nNot to mention that arguing the same point over and over again gets pretty dull after a while, and most of those users have been around longer than that.\n\n(By the way, check out the Forum linked in the upper right corner of this page to read all the arguments about Yahoo!

To answer your question properly:\n\nIn France after the French Revolution the more politically radical groups in the Estates General (as the parliament was called) sat to the left of the presidential chair.

In Australia there are 'The Young Liberals' and 'Young Labour' etc... that provide an opportunity for young people to gain greater understanding of either parties political stance, or simply a sound understanding of the role our parties play in the Australian democratic process. For other adults who are interested, you can always join a group representing your party and go along and find out what current activity they have been up to, discuss and debate it etc...\nThere are always Q&A nights going on around your city if you look for them, where the member for your area will get together with others in the community and invite the public to debate current hot issues (I went to several Labour ones concerning the war in Iraq). \nPeople in Australia have a democratic right to peacefully protest an issue through marches, picket lines, rallies and petitions.\nThen there is always voting, the most important of all. Not voting leaves you excluded from the process entirely.\nDon't know if any of this helps...

"It can be as bad as the crime you falsly reported. If you reported a felony, you (MAY) be charged with one. If you reported a lesser crime, they can pretty much do with you what they want.

In Mexico, it is a felony to enter the country illegally. They only allow on average 3,000 immigrants a year, and they have numerous restrictions on them.

Contact the bankruptcy court in your area and they should have an automated voicemail service that will tell you if someone has filed using their name, case #, and/or social security #.  It won't tell you a lot of details but it will confirm if they filed or not.
No, absoutely not. The arguement for it will be to keep the middle east stable, and if anything the past few years have shown that to be an impossible goal. The concern is that if things go down in flames over their, it will create a shambles of the US economy and lifestyle, and a major redistribution of wealth with many people loosing, both rich and poor, and a potential destabilization of our own government.\n\nI think that attitude is selling US citizens short. We will recover, just as they did during the depression. If anything we'll get to see a snapshot of the future as gas prices head towards $7/gallon. Life will go on, just differently. If the middle east takes a header, and everything collapses, we wil be fine, but the power brokers obviously won't be.
Revolution is for the dark ages you should endeavour to use a democratic process to get your preferred government into power.
In all sincerety, Bush is a murderer. Not like his father wasnt, but this is gone on far enough. He is prepared to take us to World War III, and Hell at that. He has bombed, raided and all else Iraq and its citizens. And why, oil is the answer. I give congrats to the fact that he got Hussein out of power and that he got elections in Iraq, but the point is, he has no other business in Iraq. More importantlyl, he needs to concern himself with more important matters, such as the war at home, North Korea, and Osama Bin Laden, the real terrorist, the terrorist that took thousands of innocent lives on September Eleventh. The whole idea is screwed up, and hopefully the approximate two years he has left in the Oval Office he doesnt spend turning Iraq into a Nuclear Wasteland. More importantly, risking a global war, let alone war with the middle eastern powers.
I would argue that policy goals were secondary.\n\nThe Nazi party symbolized all that the German people felt they were lacking, or deserved.\n\nHitler's fiery rhetoric played in perfectly to the masses: they were entirely blamed for WW I and made to pay for it. Discontent ruled people's minds and Hitler understood that very well.\n\nHe exploited a country's sense of powerlessness by promising power. He exploited his country's sense of being victims of injustice by promising revenge upon those who were responsible for Germany's suffering.\n\nThe Nazi party made of point of glorifying everthing good about German history, especially its martial past. He made people feel good about themselves and without that, he never would have had the opportunity to rise to power.
This better not be a woman asking this!
I think it's been too long, not that I'm advocating war, but rather the legitimacy of the whole war thing is edified if Congress is asked to do their national duty of committing this country on a path to war.

You pretty much stole this question from someone else...and almost word for word.
Generally the message we get is the message which suits our government. So, for example, the IRA are classified as terrorists by the British Government and as freedom fighters by their supporters.\n\nIt gets really difficult in places like Israel/Palestine. One side sees the Israelis as oppressors and in some cases believe any method is justified to remove them from Palestinian land, the other side sees the consequences of these methods such as suicide bombing and believes any method is justified to prevent such attacks. \n\nThe voices of the moderates who want both sides to coexist are lost beneath the bombing and the bulldozing of homes.

I mean... they could retaliate... but I would rather them retaliate for killing him (which would probably be something minor and small, because I don't think they have the funding without him)... than let him plan a large scale attack (which he is obviously capable of)\n\nIf we do take him out... I think it will help... I think he's the lynchpin that holds it together... he has access to billions of saudi dollars that fund the opperation... I don't think many terrorists have his royal ties...
No, a country would have to be stupid to let that many people cross their borders and drain their resources.
I really don't think its fair unless there is a jury of people who love being on a jury and really want to find out the truth, otherwise they just look at the evidence at hand and automaticly assume that they some one is guilty or innocent with out even considering it because alot of people are lazy that way.
because US thinks their the most powerful country in the whole wide world
No.  Yeah, they proved they are a pain in the butt and that they demand rights that us citizens have and have earned which they have not.  Go back to Mexico, and come in legally.
Your mind is closed. Thank God that we have been tough on terrorists. They would scream with delight if you died a horrible, screaming death. You totally misapprehend the reality of man's basic instincts. You need to study the history of totalitatian regimes and stop being a mindless shill for Teddy Kennedy. I expect you aren't related to Mary Jo Kopeckni.
You my dear friend are off your rocker, thiking of Nazi tactics like the Final Solution. \n\n\nI am not a Greaser, but do sympathize with them if you have neo Nazi nerds and as.sholes with ideas such as yours.\n\nI wonder if the original native Americans (Red Injuns as you called em) had a say in the matter when the whites from across the ocean invaded their country and all but exterminated them.\n\nYou, dear person are also a descendant of immigrants yourself, I'm sure, as are most of the white and black American folks replying to you, unless you are of Native American descent (which I am sure you would not be proud to proclaim, if you were). Even the guys who came over on the Mayfair, they initiated the unjustness by being the harbingers of terror that culminated in the annihilation of native Americans\n\nI wonder when the Caucasian will ever get over the white 'massa' superiority complex?\n\n\nAmerica has been drawing people from all over the world, right from the days of it's discovery as a land with the fabled pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. Give it some more time, you'll end up with an exodus of people, as is happening among the immigrants from India which is gaining from the Brain Gain as opposed to the earlier brain drain.\n\nI remember when my cousin migrated to the US in the seventies, people had similar complaints about the Indians.\n\nTh reverse is happening now, a number of western countries have their top people insisting on an India stint, and the Indians, well they wanna come back to their roots.
Strange question.\n\nThey all do.\n\nJust remember that their job is to get a politician elected. This can mean that they will often suggest the most popular answer to an issue rather than the most effective.

The only deference between the two is that a commissioner is appointed by other judges, where a judge works his way through the ranks. A commissioner is usually higher in the food chain. Both have a law degrees and both make about the same wage.\n\nThese are the basics of course.

Pena there is one GLARING flaw in your argument. There is nothing about Mexico to be proud about. Mexico is a country, not a heritage. People from Mexico are of Spanish(for the most part) Heritage, just like I am of English and Irish heritage. Yet you don't see me waving those flags around, why? You can say it is because I am not proud, or whatever, but the simple fact is I am an American, and proud to be one. I am proud of my roots, but me being an American comes first and foremost.
CORRUPT.  But I guess that makes me a whiny liberal.  Oh well, whine on I say.  Anyone have any cheese?
Personally I think people have more in common than they may think.  It's stupid to attach yourself to a label because of a few hot topic issues.  I think most of America is moderate.  The idiots on the far ends of both sides get the most attention.  I think that neither the very Conservative Republicans, or the very Liberal Democrats represent a majority of America.  I could give a crap about Gay Marriage and Abortion, but people on both sides of the issue put that ahead of health care and education and so on.  The things that truly matter take a back seat to issues that only affect a minority of Americans.
well it's like chirsmas and Easter.Everyone found a new reason to have holidays. We forgot the value of our holidays. We gave up in beleaveing.

This is the slippery slope. How do we demand that other countries do not torture our soldiers, if we have no problem torturing theirs?\nThis was the basis for the Geneva Convention. Everything is fair game during the battle, but, if captured, you were effectively taken out of the war, and as such, would then be treated in a more humane manner.\nA principle, that I think, a lot of countries strived to maintain as best they could. Was every prisoner treated humanely?  Of course not. Any time you throw humans into the mix, you aren't going to have perfection...no matter how noble the idea.\nBut to have a government itself support the concept of torture, invites other countries to do the same. Is this really what we want for our soldiers?\nAnyhow, I don't think torture is a very effective tool. Physical, anyhow. People can only withstand so much pain before saying anything just to make it stop. Including making things up. There are more effective tactics out there.
Im a sorry to hear about your tragedy. It sure sounds like your neighbor's son has a serious problem that requires immediate attention. Depending on the mental status of that nine year old, the courts should be able to do something to compensate you for the damage. If he is evaluated by a professional and the results come back normal, you can charge for simple assoult. If not, you can still charge because ultimately, the parents of an ill child are responsable for any intentional damages caused by him. I suggest you speak with the chief of your police station, explain to him what happened and what you want done. If this doesnt help, go a step further up the ladder until you resolve the problem. Bulling has no excuse. Best wishes.
Since he is Prime  Minister Koizumi, the answer is no. But with that said, it would be because they are next door to China and South Korea. We must remember honoring a nations fallen soldiers has always been done. The important thing is the fact as Prime Minister, he represents the entirety of Japan. For that reason and the fact of the e beliefs about those who have died needing honor, it may be something we must tolerate. After all, what I do in my house is my business.
I don't know what you mean by supporting our nations, but surely capitalism supports the welfare of society better than any of the alternatives.
well hemp was and still is a useful material. leaving aside the drug end of it , it was our rope and is still the step before linen,\nBut the record shows where any natural plant or material \ncan be  out smarted by technical  IE nylon Polypropylene's \netc  and big business takes control , well the only thing they could say bad about hemp was its drug use, but the use of  the same drug was  considered a medical treatment  till a new way of making all the byproducts from same plant was discovered the drug end of it was used to tarnish a very natural  product, and the 1000 uses that where not drug related  where ignored  buts that's big business. and the way of the world for now\nit shall return  as it was said  NATURE FINDS A WAY
hahaha... amyza29... always blaming Clinton... it's too bad Bush can't run his own presidency and has to blame everything that goes wrong on Clinton... you would think in 6 years they would be able to fix some of the screw ups, but apparently not, it's all blamed on Clinton... hahaha\n\nAnd he's done so much to fix those CIA screw-ups... nominate a person who knows nothing about it, about to nominate another... gee he sure is fixing things now...hahahaha\n\nzombiesatemyballs....

Neither could win, especially Condi.  She is damaged goods and so full of crap.  But the right female could win.  She is internationally known, intelligent, connected, well spoken, educated, media friendly, yet not one of the good ole boys like Hillary.  The answer you ask?  Maria Shriver.  She runs as a democrat, keeps Teddy boy out of the picture, but leverages the Kennedy name and Arnold can bail from CA to become the 1st gentleman.  Sounds crazy, but it could work and if it did we'd either be saved from the same old crap or just collapse in the effort.  Either way, we need real change, otherwise we're done.  It's just a matter of when.
you need a simple answer, but I don't have one.
It can happen again. I think the pressure at the airports isn't thorough enough. Having travelled internationlly recently, I saw it was still feasible to get something past the security.\n\nUS Embassies around the world are also prime targets, and those fall under US jurisdiction. Those have significantly less security surrounding them, especially if they're located in countries that do not crack down on terrorism and violent groups.
YEAH, THIS HAS TO STOP. HAVE THEY VIOLATED THE COMMUNITY GUIDELINES? IF SO, THEY NEED TO BE REPORTED.
I would pare down the Government.  Our government in the 60's used to represent 2% of the GDP, now it's 40%.  \n\nThomas Jefferson was very clear about the government staying out of the way of commerce and acting to protect our borders.  Let's move back to that successful strategy.
If you don't like gay marriage don't get one!
He could be arrested, but it wouldn't amount to anything now.  If the girls mother wanted to press charges, he could have been charged with at least statutory rape.  Since the girls mother gave permission for them to marry, she can no longer file charges--therefore, there isn't really a case here for him to be arrested for.  Having a baby is one of the stupidest reasons to get married!  That decision is going to haunt them for the rest of their lives.  Being married is hard enough when you're old enough to realize all that it means--at their age, they barely know how to wipe their own butts!  Adding a child to the mix is just asking for trouble--I don't care how mature you are, or how well you think you're prepared for it--parenthood changes everything!  Having a child first, then getting married because you have a child is, from my own personal experience, a VERY big mistake!  I'd rather see 2 people who love and care for their child never marry than marry and be miserable.  I hope your friends mother is ready to not only raise her own child, but her grandchild and a son in law as well!  Make sure you stick around for your friend--somehow I think she's gonna need as much support as she can get in the very near future--when her life totally falls apart.  I wish her luck and truly hope she won't be another statistic, but I'm being realistic and calling it how I see it--a bad situation that will get much worse.

wow, that's a big question.\nIsraeli culture is part western, part middle east, part eastern european.\nThe economy relies on aid from US, as does the politics.\nIsrael is the only democracy in the middle east (apart from iraq maybe!), and so has the support of the west although it seems to be in a bit of a mess at the moment over its claims to the west bank etc.\nNot sure this helps, but it might!

English is already the national language of the United States.  Learn it if you want to live here.  I'm personally sick of seeing my country forsake its own culture so that every whining immigrant that enters can have a say just because they think they deserve one.  Don't give me that crap about this country being started by immigrants, that was plenty long ago for it to have no bearing these days.  Either live here as an American, speak our language and do as Americans do, or pack your belongings and get the hell out!
"I will take the ""poorly served"" side of the argument.  Congress is a very inefficient institution for doing what it is designed to do: express the will of the people.  Most of the people want capital punishment, legalization of pot, effective control of the borders, freedom to keep and bear arms, low taxes, small government, easy access to abortions, and a simple tax code.  Most of all, people want laws that make sense and that don't constantly change back and forth.\n\nBut with Congress set up on the two party system; and with members facing election every two years in the House and every six in the Senate, each member is constantly in need of electioneering funds and must spend inordinate amounts of time campaigning.  Worse, members are constantly pandering to both their own party's platform issues and to whatever the current fads in public policy are.  Thus, they waste huge amounts of time and money over inconsequential issues like gay marriage, while spending less than sufficient time on serious issues like how to control the Southern border and what to do about the millions of illigals who are already in the country.\n\nBut this is what you get when you have a democracy, ""...of the people, by the people, and for the people..."", as Lincoln said.  And as Churchill said, ""Democracy is the worst form of government known to man...except for all the rest."""

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this.  Instead, change the objective for each job that you're applying for.  Make your objectives fit the job.\n\nOr eliminate it entirely (I've never used an objective on my resume and I've never had a problem finding a job).
NO it can't, because you don't have any record. i wouldn't even put it on the application, but if you already told them about it they can use it as a hiring factor.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, consumer groups alleged that Dow Corning's silicone breast implants caused numerous health problems including breast cancer, auto immune diseases including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, and various neurological problems. This led to numerous lawsuits beginning in 1984 and culminating in a 1998 class action settlement in which tens of thousands of plaintiffs accepted a $3.2 billion award. Dow Corning was in bankruptcy protection for nine years that ended in June 2004.\n\nIn 1999, however, an independent review of all previous research on the issue concluded that the implants, even when ruptured, caused no major health problems beyond local hardening or scarring of the breasts. The issue remains contentious, mostly because the aforementioned review could not address the scope of claims of injury due to ruptured implants, for example, the health impact on an unborn child.
Germany has a unique form of government. They are a Bicannial Pariliment with a chancellor as ooposed to a primeminister. The german voteing system is also diffrent they have a dual vote election, two votes: one for a represenative throught single memebr plarilty, this is similar to here. The Seocnd vote is along party lines, the second vote the vote for a party like Republican then the winning partys, which can be more than one,elect members to seats in the bundistag.

It depends on the jurisdiction. Each legislative body makes its own rules about what needs to be published and how and when. All federal laws are published by the Government Printing Office and are also online at http://thomas.loc.gov Administrative decisions are not as regulated, but are a matter of public record, so if you request them, you can see any information about them. Executive appointments requiring Senate oversight are published by the GPO and online as well as part of the Congressional record. As for state and local publications, there are too many and they are too different to make any generalizations. See the legislature's website.
I'm assuming that this question is being asked from an American perspective as Britain and France declared war on Hitlers regime.\n\nIts actually a great question and very relevant to today.\n\nThe answer is that without Pearl Harbor and Germanys subsequent decision to stand alongside its Japanese allies and declare war on the U.S, it is likely that you would not have got involved in World War Two.\n\nAt that time the American public was very isolationist in its thinking and there was a huge politcal lobby against getting involved in another European war.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Winston Churchill devoted much of the time between 1939 and December 1941 trying to persuade Roosevelt to come to our aid militarily, but Roosvelt knew it would have been political suicide.\n\nMany americans were even against the supply of war materials to Britain when we were standing alone against the Germans who had conquered the rest of Europe.\n\nThese materiels, tanks planes, ships etc were vital to re-equip the British Army. \n\nThis wasnt a new thing either. The USA had kept out of World War 1 also until 1917 (the war started in 1914) for the same reasons. They only got involved then because of the sinking of a US ocean liner full of U.S civilians by a German submarine. \n\nIn both wars however the USA was the only power to emerge stronger economically, militarily and politically. \n\nIt is interesting to read these days however the comments by ordinary Americans again saying that the U.S should become isolationist again and leave the rest of the world to sort its own problems out.\n\nI hope that doesnt happen as the world needs a policeman, and the U.S is the only power big enough to do the job.

they shouldn't hire them first of all. and if they fired them all then nothing would happen! what part of ILLEGAL doesn't America understand. pot is illegal, murder is illegal, under-aged drinking is illegal and so on and so on. first off the employer should pay his/hers employees what there worth. and not take short cuts. i could go on and on about this question. that hummer he/she drives is because of my labor, and the labor of many others. but if your not from AMERICA and you come to this country of ours do it the legal way, like my forefathers did. i live in the second lowest paid county in the U.S. the reason they hire them is for cheaper labor. did you know that 100 us dollars is something like 1,000 in Mexico? no wounder there here. if they earn 10,000 dollars there almost a millionaire in Mexico. you or anyone can e-mail on this subject look at my 360 page. screw it. m.anania@yahoo.com
"The FR-1 ""Fireball"" was designed in early 1943 for the US Navy.  On the 1/2/1943 The Ryan Aeronautical Company was awarded a contract for three prototypes and one static airframe for testing. The first aircraft was ready for it's maiden flight on the 25/6/1944, however it was only powered by it's piston engine for the first two flights with the General Electric I-16 turbojet engine being fitted a few days later.  On the 2/12/1943 the US Navy ordered 100 FR-1"" Fireballs"" and later in 1944 ordered an additional 600 aircraft, but after VJ day after only 66 aircraft had been made the order was canceled."
Well, if we're gonna agree with them on that, how about they give Mexico back to the Aztecs and other tribes that owned it before the Spanish Conquistadores?

When has the UN ever maintained peace? When has the UN ever protected anybody (well, anybody who was not a corrupt and bloody tyrant)?\n\nWhat action is the UN taking with Sudan? Nothing.\nWhat action did the UN take with Rwanda. Nothing.\nWhat is the UN doing about the Chinese annihilation of Tibet? What are they doing about the Chinese brutality against the Fulan Gong? What are they doing about Palestinian terrorism? What did they do about the Serbian / Balkan wars and atrocities?\n\nThey've never done a thing, that's what. It is up to individual states, like the US, or a coalition of states, like those currently in Afghanistan and Iraq, to do something. And the UN resolutions against Iraq implied military force would be used if they failed to comply. How can you say then that the invasion of Iraq was contrary to the UN? In fact, you could actually make the argument that by leading the invasion of Iraq, Bush was actually making the UN relavent, instead of a debate society that issued toothless and meaningless resolutions.\n\nFurthermore, it was the UN that created the Oil-for-Food scandal that bribed many foreign governments, and lined Saddam's pockets with $25 billion, while Iraqis starved and suffered without medicine.\n\nPerhaps you should wonder why the UN Human rights council has some of the worst offenders on it - China, Sudan, etc.\n\nIt's a useless waste of money. It needs to be abandoned.

"China's great power status is 100% dependent on its sustainable economic development. This has been the case everywhere throughout history. That is why China today is so focused on:\n\n- creating jobs for the 10s of millions who migrate from rural areas to cities every year\n\n- securing natural resources internationally, such as (especially) oil and base metals\n\n- establishing and maintaining trading relationships with the other major world powers\n\nWithin a very small number of years, the Chinese economy will overtake that of the US. They are ""a player"" now and will very likely increase in this role in coming years and decades."

I don't think we are able to pin point a specific reason why.  Even though I hate Bush and everything he stands for, I can't blame him for everything that happens, but I will blame him for everything and anything that has to do with the government, like help to Katrina victims, Sept 11th, the war in Iraq, the deficit spending, social security's bankruptcy... things of that nature.  But there some even worst things happening like natural disasters killing hundreds of thousands that you just can't blame on anybody.  I guess these are the times we're living in and we should pick leaders who are apt and know how to handle such conflict and tragedy.

Unless she's willing to allow you to keep your products then I'd find another way to produce them.  Open your own business and find bakeries willing to be sold ""use"" rights for your tort, etc  In this way you don't need to be making them and you clearly own the rights to the recipe.  You could then even offer to ""consult"" with the employees on how to actually cook them, etc."
You could as long as the islands were not part of or 'owned' by a government. You couldn't buy Hawaii for example & make it an independent country as it is part of the U.S.
I believe these definitions still apply today in the terms defined below.  A liberal is one who does not lean towards conservatism, is open to change and a non-traditionalist, such as those who are for gay marriages (example only) and a conservative feels just the opposite, that more traditional values should be maintained.  Sorry a few people did not see the second part of your question and only told you to look it up in the dictionary. :)\n\nlib·er·al    (lbr-l, lbrl) KEY  \n\nADJECTIVE: \n\n\nNot limited to or by established, traditional, orthodox, or authoritarian attitudes, views, or dogmas; free from bigotry. \nFavoring proposals for reform, open to new ideas for progress, and tolerant of the ideas and behavior of others; broad-minded. \nOf, relating to, or characteristic of liberalism. \nLiberal Of, designating, or characteristic of a political party founded on or associated with principles of social and political liberalism, especially in Great Britain, Canada, and the United States. \n\nTending to give freely; generous: a liberal benefactor. \nGenerous in amount; ample: a liberal serving of potatoes. \nNot strict or literal; loose or approximate: a liberal translation. \nOf, relating to, or based on the traditional arts and sciences of a college or university curriculum: a liberal education. \n\nArchaic Permissible or appropriate for a person of free birth; befitting a lady or gentleman. \nObsolete Morally unrestrained; licentious. \n\n\ncon·ser·va·tive    (kn-sûrv-tv) KEY  \n\nADJECTIVE: \n\nFavoring traditional views and values; tending to oppose change. \nTraditional or restrained in style: a conservative dark suit. \nModerate; cautious: a conservative estimate. \n\nOf or relating to the political philosophy of conservatism. \nBelonging to a conservative party, group, or movement. \nConservative Of or belonging to the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom or the Progressive Conservative Party in Canada. \nConservative Of or adhering to Conservative Judaism. \nTending to conserve; preservative: the conservative use of natural resources. \nNOUN: \n\nOne favoring traditional views and values. \nA supporter of political conservatism. \nConservative A member or supporter of the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom or the Progressive Conservative Party in Canada. \nArchaic A preservative agent or principle
The only Qualification for the CIB is that you be an Infantry Soldier in an Infantry Unit At Brigade level or below in a combat zone.  You could earn it with out leaving Kuwait, or Qatar!\n\nOn the other hand the new Combat Action Badge is more like the CIB used to be and requires the soldier to engage or be engaged by the enemy.  This is the one I have.\n\nChange-----------\n\nI was wrong, what I put was the standard that was being used for infantry units when I was in Iraq, here is the real standard it is just like the new CAB except it is Infantry Only:\n\n (4)  On or after 18 September 2001:\n\n                a.  A soldier must be an Army infantry or special forces officer (SSI 11 or 18) in the grade of colonel or below, or an Army enlisted soldier or warrant officer with an infantry or special forces MOS, who has satisfactorily performed duty while assigned or attached as a member of an infantry, ranger or special forces unit of brigade, regimental or smaller size during any period such unit was engaged in active ground combat, to close with and destroy the enemy with direct fires.\n\n                b.  A soldier must be personally present and under fire while serving in an assigned infantry or Special Forces primary duty, in a unit engaged in active ground combat to close with and destroy the enemy with direct fires.\n\n                c.  Soldiers possessing MOS of 18D (Special Forces Medical Sergeant) who satisfactorily perform special forces duties while assigned or attached to a special forces unit of brigade, regimental, or smaller size during any period such unit is engaged in active ground combat may be awarded the CIB.  These soldiers must have been personally present and engaged in active ground combat, to close with and destroy the enemy with direct fires.  Retroactive awards under these criteria are not authorized for service prior to 18 September 2001.\n\n                d.  Those soldiers possessing MOS of 18D who qualify for award of the CMB from 18 September 2001 to the 3 June 2005, will remain qualified for the badge.  Upon request any such soldier may be awarded the CIB instead of the CMB.  In such instances, the soldier must submit a request through the chain of command to the CG, U.S. Army Human Resources Command, ATTN:  AHRC-PDO-PA, 200 Stovall Street, Alexandria, VA 22332-0471 for conversion of the CMB to the CIB.
Yes. It ended WWII with as few additional US casualties as possible. We asked Japan to surrender but they refused and never would have surrendered. The alternative would have been for the Allies to invade...leading to tens of hundreds of thousands of US deaths. \n\nIt was a horrible end to the war, but from our perspective, it was the best of the many horrible alternatives.\n\nAnd after Pearl Harbor, it didn't require that much ethical\ndebate...
I don't agree with Bush on anything he has done, why would I start with this. I will agree when he says goodbye. I hope the white house door don't hit him in the arse as he goes.
ofcourse not..

"Isn't it obvious?  It is because the prison system is actually BIG BUSINESS.  Don't you think someone is getting paid for all those ""amenities"".  How do you think the local cable TV company would feel if thousands upon thousands of Cable TV accounts all of a sudden were turned off?  Go to any town near a large prison, guess what?  Half the town works at the prison...  ;in fact, some towns only exist because of the prison being inthe close vicinity.  Do some in-depth research about the prison systems and you will indeed be shocked at what you uncover."

Yes they are separate countries but under the same state administration (although with, to different degrees, their own assemblies).  Scotland is unique in having its own legal system.  There is free movement between these countries ... all hold UK passports.\n\nIt is no more complicated than me saying I am going to Florida or Texas on holiday rather than just America.\n\nHoe that helps but if you need more drop me a note.

Do adults have as much fund in adultery as infants have in infancy?  Actually, adultery has a very specific meaning, and according to evidence and testimony there may not have ever been such an act for either of them.\n\nWe people have enough problems taking care of ourselves than to ever presume to judge anyone else or think we are better than someone else ever.  Some things are simply private and none of my business anyway.
"The Peace and Freedom Party (PFP) is a United States political party founded in 1967 as a leftist organization opposed to the Vietnam War.\n\nThe PFP gained its highest Presidential vote to date in 1968 when it nominated Black Panther spokesman Eldridge Cleaver for President. Although a convicted felon, Cleaver carried nearly 37,000 votes. Because Cleaver was only 34 years old, the state of California refused to put his name on the ballot, so the presidential line was blank, with only Vice-Presidential candidate Peggy Terry appearing. [citation needed] During this time period, Bob Avakian was a spokesman for the party in the San Francisco Area.\n\nBecause the party attained ballot status in 14 states and had no effective central control, its presidential ticket in 1968 varied from state to state. Although the national convention nominated Eldridge Cleaver for President, more than one state party put Dick Gregory on the ballot instead, as did parties called the ""Freedom and Peace Party"". The vice presidential nominee also varied from state to state. In California it was Chicago political activist Peggy Terry. In other places it was economist Doug Dowd. Cleaver had personally preferred Yippie leader Jerry Rubin as his running mate, but very few activists concurred.\n\nDuring the 1968 election, the New York Peace and Freedom Party consisted of a fractious coalition of competing Marxist groups along with libertarians led by Murray Rothbard.\n\nIn 1972, the PFP nominated democratic socialist and anti-war activist Benjamin Spock. Since then, the PFP has been active largely within the state of California, and it has been targeted by groups seeking its coveted California ballot spot.\n\nIn 1998, the PFP failed to attain more than 2% of the votes, causing them to lose ballot status in the state. Their position on the ballot was restored in 2003 after a voter registration drive, and convicted murderer/political prisoner and Native American activist Leonard Peltier was chosen as the party's 2004 presidential candidate at the August 2004 State Convention.\n\nThe party again fell under the required number of registered voters in February 2006, and was declared disqualified by Secretary of State. However, citing previous instances in which parties not meeting the 'ballot qualification' criteria were still allowed to participate in primary elections, and the fact that there had not yet been a regular gubernatorial election since the party regained its ballot status (and as such, the decision was premature), the decision to bar the party from the June 2006 Primary was reversed after less than a week."
The death penalty is much more expensive than its closest alternative, which is life imprisonment with no parole. Capital trials are longer and more expensive at every step than other murder trials. Pre-trial motions, expert witness investigations, jury selection, and the necessity for two trials--one on guilt and one on sentencing--make capital cases extremely costly, even before the appeals process begins. Guilty pleas are almost unheard of when the punishment is death. In addition, many of these trials result in a life sentence rather than the death penalty, so the state pays the cost of life imprisonment on top of the expensive trial.
"In addition to ""In case of Emergency"", ICE is also:\n\nICE - a slang term for crack cocaine\n\nI.C.E. - Immigration & Customs Enforcement.  They'll hunt YOU down if you bring drugs (or other contraband) into the U.S."
OTS is Air Force, OCS is the other branches.  No, prior military is not a requirement, although it can give you an edge.  what is needed for AF and Navy esp. is a 3.5 or better GPA in a Hard science degree.  There are a set number of slots set aside each year for prior military, as well as Non Prior Service.  \n\nOCS/OTS is NOT a part of college campuses.. that is ROTC, a completely different way to Commission as an officer.
I have seen nothing she has said that can be even closely described as moderate.
the answer is yes, but politicians think they're above the law, so they'll never get in any trouble for anything they do.
Your part of National Socialist German Workers Party. So your a Socialist.\n\nThe National Socialist German Workers Party (German: Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (help·info)), better known as the NSDAP or the Nazi Party was a political party that was led to power in Germany by Adolf Hitler in 1933. The term Nazi is a short form of the German word Nationalsozialist shortened to two syllables, and spelled with -zi, because the ti syllable is pronounced [tsi] in German. After Hitler's appointment as Chancellor and the democratic election of the party to lead the German government in 1933, the NSDAP organized and established the Third Reich.\n\nSocialism is a social and economic system (or the political philosophy advocating such a system) in which the economic means of production are owned and controlled collectively by the people. This control may be either direct, exercised through popular collectives such as workers' councils, or it may be indirect, exercised through a State. In the latter case, the issue of who controls the state is crucial. A primary concern of socialism (and, according to some, its defining feature) is social equality and an equitable distribution of wealth that would serve the interests of society as a whole.\n\n Are you sure of what your asking.

Neither, both are faulty economics addressing a media hype not event. Gas cost 3 times what it did in 1979. People are making 3 times what they did in 1979. Why is this an issue? Because the press says it is.

It's a little bit of everything you've pointed out and then some.  The good points are:  (1) you are now aware, (2) you've made an attempt at discussion, and (3) you have an opportunity to become involved.  Thanks for asking a thoughtful question.  Peace to you, little sister.

A probation violation basicly means they go back to serve the balance of what thier probation was.\n\nIf they had two years probation left, they go into prison for the remainder of the probation if they send them to prison.\n\nWhat happens first is of course they get put into jail, pending a hearing,  they may stay in for several months waiting on a hearing.  At the hearing, the judge may or may not violate the probation.
It depends on the state or local laws, but there usually IS a limit as to how many people can live in one house.  (Although you have certainly not reached it.)\n\nThere are legitimate interests in capping the # of people in a single dwelling, such as # of cars on the street and strain on water/sewage resources, etc.  One notable exception is not limits for any single family, but having too many non-related cohabitants could be a problem.\n\nWith only 4 people though, you are likely not violating any laws, especially b/c it's your house.

It has ruined families, cause pain, loss, it has eroded out moral standing in the world and hasdegraded our self image of being a people concerned with justice and truth.  We now have to watch our people torture and kill all for the elite of this country and the sad part is the benefits for the people of this country are nothing, nothing.  The profits of those who would never serve is great.  So who loses, us and the Iraqis.
In the end because they are fines I would do what you have to do in order to get them paid off or the next time you get pulled over on a traffic stop you'll wind up in jail because you had a warrant. \n I wouldn't mess around with this. From what it sounds like you may already have a warrant.
No I do not.  John Kerry is an idiot and his wife is an even bigger idiot.  Someone has to be the fall guy right now.  Why not let it be Bush, right?  Everyone is running out buying Bill Clinton books and laughing at his jokes.  Bill's the one laughing.  No one seems to remember that he was the guy in office during the 9/11 planning, but he was too busy getting serviced by the interns in the Oval office to care about National Security.  But luckily for Bill, no one remembers that.  People just remember who was in office when it happened - Bush - and he's to blame for the downfall from there.  So, no, let's not pretend another Democrat is in office.
No, Stalin was a paltry excuse for a leader. Politically he failed to unify the minorities of the Soviet Union, instead focusing on persecution and forced Russianization. His foreign policy was horrible, his plans with Finland disasterous, and his look towards Western Europe miserable. Economically, he failed to take advantage of Russia's ever-growing wheat feilds, instead creating a ration system, which immediately led to starvation. He took total advantage of the Soviet satillite states after WWII without realizing their needs and desire for freedom. Militarily, he failed by using choking tactics (cramming as many troops to meet the enemy in hopes of winning through sheer numbers) without any real manuvering. His part in the invasion of Poland was considerably easy, as Poland was still using horses instead of tanks and cars. Although he ballooned the military in the pre- and post-war years, he was weary of insurrection and kept the army underfed, never realizing that a shabby army will eventually rebel. He took to scaring people, often to the point of bullying them, which is really the only way he'd get any work done.

The Avian Flu is not something I am concerned about. Only 15 people have died from it in the past few years. It is hardly an epidemic to talk about anywhere.
to tell you the truth, absolutley not. \n\nMen in the military for the most part have installed in them a chivarly code, and i know if i was fighting alon side of a women, i would be content to protect her life, in which i put my own life on the line more so than neccesary, just because shes a women.\n\nSo no, they don't need to be there, and realistically, women combat medics don't need to be front line either.\n\nHowever in todays common warfare there arn't front lines anymore, just sections ranging from green to red.
Have not noticed anything different today.
iThere is an old saying.  'No man (or woman)  is a prophet in his own land'.  It means that sometmes the people closest to you are your worst enemies.  They are the one's who can pull you down.  So don't make a big issue of it.  Decide what you need to do in order to achieve your goal.  Then do it. Don'talk about it.  If it's any  consolation, I'm with you.
If they didn't export it it would be too expensive to casually hook others on, so demand would drop.  It's circular.  \n\nI understand that at least one country saw such a drop in income when they obliterated opium poppy production that the government is starting to allow it again, however.

Amen.\n\nI don't mind helping some.  We do help more than any other country at times of natural disaster.  We helped Europe when they were letting their elderly die in a heat wave but when we had a hurricane, they called us names.\n\nIf that's right wing, good.  At least it's not the left wing way of donating military or nuclear secrets to China & N Korea.\n\nIt would be humanitarian to help Darfur, but it's time to cut back on giving away millions to people who hate us.

This it what you do when the lights on the unmarked come on step on the gas until you get to 100 and if marked cars start appearing out of no where with lights and siren and they are following you that might indicate the unmarked vehicle is really the police.

Also if you see another cruiser beside the one trying to pull you over then pull over then.

Requests For Military Mailing Addresses\n\nResponsibility for military personnel records falls within the jurisdiction of the military departments, not the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Therefore, requests for military addresses should be sent to the respective service of the individual whose address is being sought. There is no comprehensive source for e-mail addresses. Even if there were, military regulations and the Privacy Act of 1974 do not permit the military departments to provide home addresses or telephone numbers of service personnel. Moreover, regulations do not permit random dissemination of listings of names and addresses of service personnel. These regulations have been established to protect individual service men and women from commercial exploitation and to respect their right of privacy.

Same reason you do not get speeding tickets (just warnings) on military bases ... it is a private piece of land under military jurisdiction.

First off ... .Cool name~!\n\nHere is 25 reasons for ya. \n\n25 REASONS TO FEEL BAD ABOUT BUSH\n\nEconomic Indicators\n\n1. The unemployment rate averaged 4.1 percent in 2000 and reached a 30 year low of 3.9 percent in October 2000. Today, the unemployment rate has increased to 5.7 percent. There are presently 8.1 million unemployed Americans, an increase of 2.5 million compared to 2000\n\n2. The number of Americans experiencing long-term unemployment-over 27 weeks-has almost doubled in the last year.\n\n3. Job creation has reversed. In 2000, the year before President Bush took office, the economy created 1.7 million new jobs. This trend has been reversed, and the economy has lost almost 1.5 million jobs since President Bush took office in January 2001.\n\n4. Poverty is increasing. After decreasing for eight straight years and reaching its lowest level in 25 years, the poverty rate increased from 11.3 percent in 2000 to 11.7 percent in 2001. In the first year of the Bush administration, 1.3 million Americans slipped back into poverty, with a total of 32.9 million Americans living in poverty in 2001.\n\n5. Incomes are falling. After increasing every year since 1991, and reaching an all time high in 2000, median household income in the United States fell 2.2 percent in 2001. Median incomes fell for households in every income group in the country except for those earning over $150,000.\n\n6. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are filing for bankruptcy. Almost 800,000 Americans filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2002. In the second quarter of 2002, over 400,000 bankruptcies were filed in the United States, an all-time record.\n\n7. Mortgage foreclosures are at record highs. In the second quarter of 2002, 1.23 percent of home loans were in the foreclosure process, a record level. Over this same time period, almost 5 percent of mortgage loans were delinquent, up almost 20 percent from the average delinquency rate in 2000.\n\n8. The federal budget deficit is increasing. In 2000, the year before President Bush took office, the federal budget, excluding Social Security, showed a surplus of $86.6 billion. The most recent figures from the Congressional Budget Office indicate that for FY 2002, the federal budget, excluding Social Security, will show a deficit of $314 billion.\n\n9. This represents the largest budget decline in U.S. history, and it is the third-largest on-budget deficit in history, exceeded in size only by the deficits of 1991 and 1992 under the first President Bush. Health Care Indicators\n\n10.The number of Americans without health insurance is increasing. Between 1999 and 2000, the number of uninsured Americans fell by 600,000.\n\n11. But this trend has reversed itself and in 2001 the number of uninsured Americans increased by 1.4 million.\n\n12. Over 41 million Americans — 14.6 percent of the population — had no health insurance coverage in 2001.\n\n13. The percentage of small businesses offering insurance to their employees fell by 10 percent between 2000 and 2002.\n\n14. Insurance costs increased by 12.7 percent in 2002, the second consecutive year of double-digit increases and the largest annual increase in costs since 1990.\n\n15. Prescription drug prices increased by almost twice the rate of inflation in 2001.\n\n16. For seniors, who use the most prescription drugs, cost increases were even higher. The cost of the 50 most popular drugs for seniors increased by 7.8 percent in 2001, over three times the rate of inflation. The price of Prilosec, the most popular drug for seniors, increased at over four times the rate of inflation.\n\nCrime and Drug Use Indicators\n\n17.The crime rate is increasing. In 2000, the year before President Bush took office, the crime rate reached its lowest level since 1972. This represented the culmination of a 22 percent decrease in crime during the 1990s.\n\n18. But in 2001, the crime rate increased by 2.2 percent. The murder rate increased by 3.1 percent, the robbery rate inc

Usually the state legislature establishes any regulations for incarceration of citizens, especially juveniles. The best bet would be to contact the local Sheriffs Office since they are most often mandated to establish correction facilities. They should be able to give you the regulations for such. Or direct you to where you can find them.
"It all depends on which facility they are at.  Usually this is brought up at their trial & sentencing hearing so they can serve out their time at a facility that can meet their needs.  Once you are in, there are a range of various programs to attend after you have ""proven yourself"" by following daily rules & regulations that are required.  Many inmates are required to attend daily meetings inside & outside of jail according to the wishes of the Court, or their parole and probation officers.  You usually do enough time to come out ""clean"".  Most ""offenders"" are released to ""Half Way Houses"", where they get 24/7 counseling, with mandatory participation.  If they fail to comply, they are returned to prison to serve out the remaining time they would have spent in the Half Way House Program."

because we as a people in general have become way too apathetic, we allow these small extremist groups like the ACLU to do whatever they want and nobody gets in an uproar, the biggest problem in this country is the news media, they report stories and make it seem to the large mass of ignorant people in this country that groups like the ACLU are good groups. heres an interesting tidbit, the average reader of a newspaper reads at an 8th grade reading level, i learned this as a broadcasting major, where i also learned that news media is a huge scam, and there isnt much people who realize the problem can do, because most people simply dont care enough to fight these extremist

Why Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb or nuclear reactors? If America is the safest country to have nukes, why did they drop them on Japan when only conventional war was taking place? Why the world did not take CRUCIAL ACTION against America then and why should anyone take crucial action now on Iran when they have not even officially built a nuke bomb? If it is assumed that the Islamic terrorists can buy a nuke from considerate govts, they what is the guarantee that they cannot buy the same from western powers including USA? There are so many channels through which technology can be routed. Cannot some one buy it from PAKISTAN which is the cheek by jowl buddy of the USA? So why no one is complaining about or condemning USA being in touch with Pakistan and giving them all state of the art techy war stuff? THERE IS NO WAY INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CAN TAKE CRUCIAL MEASURES against Iran's nuke program.
Great guy. I like his taste in trucks, and his policy of kicking the crap out of terrorists.
To me it means we have plenty of cheap landscapers and people working at McDonalds.\nTo the country it means more crime, rapes and murders as illegal immigrants commit a larger proportion of crimes as a group.\nIt means more students in schools that are struggling financially. And it means a much greater chance to have another major terrorism event since our borders are so wide open.\n\nIf illegals get the right to vote, they will vote conservative Republican as almost all are anti-abortion and understand nothing more than the dogma the Catholic church spews which has been the major destructive force in all banana republics due to overwhelming population explosions, suffering of women and children (see the homeless children of most south American countries such as Brazil) and starvation and poverty.\n\nIn ten years or less, you will see no difference between America and Mexico in terms of standard of life.
I think they should be accountable for their actions.  If their actions are not professional and , in fact, questionable, they should be judged by their peers in a similar fashion as what is done with doctors.  Many would be found guilty of gross negligence.
I am not familiar with the immigration law you are referring to, but I do know that it is a manuever of the business elite in developed countries around the world to hire immigrants, legal or illegal, because they can pay them lower wages and thereby increase their profits.  That's why the United States has an immigration problem.  Businesses want them here, and the government looks out for the interests of the business elite above all else.  As an American of French origin, I can tell you that I resent the French business elite being allowed to exploit the cheap labor of immigrants.  I see it as an attack on the French people's standard of living  as well as an attack on French culture itself, since these immigrants, mostlly from Arab countries, are so different culturally .
The Gaza Strip and the West Bank were seized by Israel during one of their wars with the Arab states (don't remember which one at the moment). The Palestinians who live there don't particularly like being controlled by the Israelis, and the Israelis don't really know what to do with the Palestinians, since both territories offer potential enemies strategic positions overlooking Israeli territory.\n\nAdd to the pot the fact that Jerusalem is holy ground to both the Israelis and the Muslims (as well as Christians), and you have a situation that will *never* be solved.
Actually it would be more accurate to state that the people who are opposed to granting the people of Iraq and Afghanistan freedom for the first time in their lives are '\ngoing the Hitler way.'\n\nBesides, do you have any better ideas about keeping the nutcases running Iran from getting nukes?

Fearing prosecution he fled the country and settled in France, although never officially being granted asylum. Duvalier had also taken several billions in swindled funds. \n\nIn France, he lived a luxurious life - having a villa in the hills of Cannes, two apartments in Paris, a chateau, along with a Ferrari. Duvalier, however, lost almost $750 million due to a divorce from his wife, Michelle Duvalier, and now allegedly lives in very modest circumstances.\n[aww, what a shame....]\n\nFollowing the ouster of president Jean-Bertrand Aristide in February 2004, Duvalier announced his intention to return to Haiti. In 2004, he announced his intentions to run for president of Haiti in the 2006 elections for the Party of National Unity; however, he did not become a candidate.

You have it right when you talk of your own self, but when you talk of nations and other people, well this is the kind of stuff and attitude that has build a bad reputation for the US of A. I think if one looks at the mass number of humanity on earth and the percentage that hates your country, I wouldn't be surprised if you are one of the most hated countries in the world.\n\nRemember, the US became great only because it had a huge gene pool, people from all walks, nations races came to or were brought to your country, and the genetic exchange resulted in great minds that made your country the greatest in it's time. Also you  were fortunate that WWII and global political shifts resulted in a number of brilliant minds migrating to your country-Einstein, just to name one.\n\nEven today, I think maybe 1 in 2 brains in Silicon valley is Asian, predominantly Indian, their brains have helped your country become what it is.\n\n\nWith greatness comes responsibility.\nI'd suggest - Do unto others as you would want them to do unto you, and an eye for an eye will blind the whole world.\n\nAs a citizen of a country that is numero uno in the world, I think you need change in attitude, as do many of your fellow citizens!\n\nst

After your marriage you would need to file Form I-130 Petition for Alien Relative for your new spouse.

A friend of mine is a merchant marine. He goes out to sea a month and is home a month. But the pay is outstanding--very good. He said it's hard work but he enjoys it. He sees many different countries and it looks good on his resume when he decides to stop. He might want to give it a try. They tend to hire ex cons because the jobs are hard to fill due to the length away from home. Good luck.

I live in Ohio and I'm a smoker.  I believe that in certain cases it is fine to not allow smoking, like in office buildings and court houses and the like.  I also believe that the owner of the property should be able to decide whether or not he wants to allow smoking.  As in privately owned restaurants and bars.  These places may be public in the sense that anyone off the street can go in there and sit down and have a meal/drink.  However, its like listening to bad music, if you don't like it, don't listen.  If you don't like that people are smoking in a certain restaurant, don't go there.  It's called choice and the fact that some people don't smoke or don't want to be around smoke shouldn't limit the number of places smokers can go and enjoy a meal or drink and be able to have a cigarette when finished.  Also, it is ridiculous to make people stay fifty feet or whatever from the entrance to a building.  Outside there are many other carcinogens in the air besides smoke that people breathe in every minute of every day.  Not to mention that being outside in itself takes away the second-hand smoke factor.

In February 1903, the United States leased 45 square miles of land and water at Guantanamo Bay for use as a coaling (fueling) station.  The treaty was finalized and the document  was ratified by both governments and signed in Havana in December of that same year.   \n\nA 1934 treaty reaffirming the lease granted Cuba and her trading partners free access through the bay, modified the lease payment from $2,000 in gold coins per year, to the 1934 equivalent value of $4,085 U.S. Treasury dollars, and added a requirement that termination of the lease requires the consent of both the U.S. and Cuba governments, or the abandonment of the base property by the U.S.

Dear Parvinder,\n\nIn Singapore, there is an Act called the Enlistment Act (Chapter 93 of 2001), within this act is a Section Part III titled National Service which covers various broad details like who is eligible to be called up (those above 18 years of age) and how long they would serve their full-time national service (not exceeding 2 years with some exceptions listed usually a promotion in ranks with a cap of not more than 2 years and 6 months of service).\n\nInterestingly the act does not state that National Service is only for males, but at the moment, the authority authorized to make the decision has only called up males for National Service (this implies that statutorily, if the authority decides to call up females it can do so).\n\nNot everyone will qualify or need to serve, as the statute also require that the persons called up be checked for fitness to perform national service, but everyone called up will still need to report for registration and the check for fitness before they are officially informed of their start of their national service.\n\nNational Service in Singapore is not restricted to the Army only, depending on the needs of the authority, the selected personnels could serve in the Armed Forces, Naval Force, Air Force, Police Force and Civil Defence Force.\n\nIn short, yes National Service is mandatory for those who are called up to perform the service.\n\nBut being a mandatory service, the statutes also provide for some additional coverage in terms of protecting the rights for those called up for service. For more details you might be interested in another Act called the National Servicemen (Employment) Act - Chapter 202 of 1985. This aims to protect those who are asked to serve the country from losing their jobs and ensure that they are able to go back to their work place after performing their national duty.\n\nThere is also more information about National Service for Singapore that can be found in a portal build for national servicemen called the NS portal, this can be found at www.ns.sg\n\nIn general, even after completion of the fullt-tme national service, there is still a need to serve part-time national service (usually on an annual basis), for non-commissioned officers they are not expected to serve beyond 40 years of age, for commissioned officers not expected to serve beyond 45 years of age (but there are some citizens who volunteer their services for longer periods) - the age limit is basically an upper limit you can find more information from the NS portal.\n\nFor more details about the citations please see the link below:

"Its a cliche. Its like why people have to wear like Polo or Nautica or have Coach purses. Its a cliche and its a style they ""want' and they think they ""need"" \n\nWomen think that they feel secure with a man in the military, when in reality, we're just another guy. Yeah we work in bigger ""corporations"" where we have weapons, and special traning blah bah blah, but in reality, hello? we're just men. Men are men no matter what. \n\nAgain, NOt all military guys are a ss holes. And not all of them are jerks. you have to be the judge of that. No way you can just judge them on their uniform. And think, ""wow that guy has a lot of medals, he must be really good."" Sorry it doesn't work that way. \n\nWomen, no offense I think in my own opinion, they just want to be flattered. Have bragging rights, yeah my bf was in the military or is in the military and he's some big guy. Kind of in those ways."

i think that is a very noble idea though unrealistic. war is nbot a noble endeavor.
I agree, I would also like to know why a government that could pull it off would reveal its plans to a bunch of penniless hippies and friendless Internet geeks.
both, one they really need it and deserve it too as UN is about being fair to one and all, but their hugo chavez is a crazy guy , he is anti capitalism/free market , is doing everything from nationlizing oil companies to supporting Iran on nuclear issue, giving them a seat in security council at his rule would in a way convince people that we all agree with his actions, worse still it may embolden him, not giving him a seat would be detrimental to the image of UN as being a stooge of developed countries and even china which has an ulteiror motive is their. Many people just consider UN as a forum where countries let out thier frustation but any action is hardly taken, so not giving a smaller country a chance would only worsen the situation.
Absolutely elated!!!  It was the best night ever!!!  Then to hear today that DR was booted - I could not ask for more!

"You are comparing apples to oranges. first off, Japan never had a formal declaration of war against the US. They just sneaked in and attacked us.

"You don't say what country you are in.  In America, your Grandmother has the legal right to do what she wants with the property.  If she has made a ""Last Will & Testament"", then you will find out who gets what AFTER she dies & the will is read to the family.  You are not entitled to any of it, but your parents are & they could contest the will if they feel it is unfair.  You cannot contest it unless you can prove that she gave you something that is not listed in her will.  Get things in writing from her BEFORE she dies OR ask her to give it to you before the family starts to get into a battle.  You sound like a spoiled person who is only interested in getting things away from other Family members who are probably thinking the same way.  That's where you learned it from.  I hope your Grandmother gives it to a deserving person or Charity Organization.  Just because your Father is older doesn't mean he deserves to get everything & neither do you just because you are his child.  This is ""Old World Traditional"" thinking that is no longer being used in the U.S. because it is DISCRIMINATORY.  It leaves the women out & is illegal & unfair to them.  You should open your eyes, grasshopper."
Since this is a 'money making' enterprise, I don't have a problem with it.  I would be concerned if they were selling at a loss.  Coin collectors would have a gripe if they released old product below the market.  They did this 30 years ago with CC silver coins.

I listen to Conservative and Liberal radio. I can't believe people really think the BS that the Conservatives dish out are facts. I love to listen to Michael Savage. He cracks me up. He is the most extreme and amusing of the conservative hosts. Rush is such a pom pas ass that I can only take him in small doses, no pun intended. Hannity is such a nasally annoyance I can't believe he still has a job. Although I do enjoy his I hate Hannity calls. I wish people could learn to think for themselves and listen to radio programs to be entertained, not get the Republican talking points shoved in their heads.

You really can't do that by yourself.
"The voters will soon learn the liberal Dems cannot be counted on. Remember Pelosi's criticism of Bush and how he ""invaded Iraq without just cause""?

"Let me just say before I answer your question properly that I'm not American. I don't love America but I don't hate it for spurious reasons either.\n\nYou are wrong on several ""facts"".\n\n1) The explanation is that when the term ""World's Championship Series"" was first used in the 1880s, baseball was almost exclusively confined to North America, especially at a highly skilled (and paid) level. Thus it was understood that the winner of the major league championship was the best baseball team in the world. The title of this event was soon shortened to ""World's Series"" and later to ""World Series"".\n\n2) It is highly unlikely that nuclear weapons are made at Area 51. Even if they were (and that would be pure guesswork) it's almost impossible that they're made EXCLUSIVELY at Area 51. That would be stupid. Nukes are made at various secure military bases all over the United States.\n\n3) Most Americans, in my experience, are not arrogant. Many that I've met and spoken to are very nice, cordial and friendly. With a population of 300 million it stands to reason that a large number of Americans will be arrogant, just as in any other country, but I wouldn't agree that MOST Americans are arrogant.\n\nThe US Government, having the resources of the world's only remaining superpower at its fingertips, sure are arrogant bastards, however. They were quite wrong to invade Iraq, in fact, the USA has quite a bad track record at invading countries since WWII (which arguably they would not have entered into if it wasn't for Pearl Harbour - by the time they joined the war, the UK and its allies had done considerable damage to the Germans, although they didn't have many resources left to fight and the US invention of the atom bomb surely put an end to the war before more lives were lost)."
"I do believe you need a balance.. but if we would be smarter about what we do with our military we wouldn't need as large of a standing military... then we could put money back into the nation to fix our schools and help better the social issues we face, as well as advance sciences.. including those that would help protect this nation without the loss of human life (or at least limit it)... but that would be the best thing to do for our nation as opposed to our politicians.. so don't expect it to happen :(\n\n\ncynthiatweedle- Not trying to knock your intentions.. but the no child left behind program is a fraud.. it sounds great but it's not.. the ""numbers"" they used to try and make it look good only focused on the top 50% of the children in the schools it was piloted in and there was some improvement in those children... but in the schools as a whole there was marked worsening.. the drop out rate and test scores were much worse than they were before it was piloted in Texas.   Coordinated School Health is a much better program if you are looking for something for your schools... in the schools that have used it the drop out rates have fallen from in the 20%'s to less than 1% and the teen pregnancy rates and arrest rates have shown the same decline.  It is very similar to the School of the 21st Century program which has also shown some great results."
I do believe that is on Nancy Palosy's agenda, it is about time as it has been stagnate for 10 years and all arguments against it are falsehoods installed as part of the repuglican agenda. It is just another sham that they use to help the rich get richer and the poor, to stay poor so that they can rule them.

"This footage shows the rifle to be a Mannlicher-Carcano.[15] There was some initial confusion regarding if the rifle was a Mauser or a Mannlicher. Weitzman glimpsed the rifle underneath a stack of boxes; he described it as the more common 'Mauser', a German make nearly identical to the Italian Mannlicher-Carcano.[16] The following photo shows a Mauser, a Mannlicher-Carcano, and Oswald's purported rifle.[17] Weitzman testified to the Warren Commission that he never handled the rifle or got a close look at it. [18] The rifle was later identified, by police authorities, as a 6.5 x 52 mm Italian Mannlicher-Carcano M91/38 bolt-action rifle with a six-round magazine serial number C2766.\n\nA 6.5 mm copper-jacketed Mannlicher-Carcano round was found on Connally's stretcher. It was ballistically matched to the rifle found in the book depository building. Some months prior, the rifle was sold by mail-order to an ""A. J. Hidell."" Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested with a forged identity card for ""Alek J. Hidell."" A partial palm print of Oswald was also found on the barrel of the gun."

"I think what you are referring to is oil shale, not the same as crude being pumped out of the ground by the familiar means, and I believe the US has the largest reserves and I just read that total WORLD reserves is ""conservatively estimated at 2.6 trillion barrels"".

"I think you mean a FAE, i.e. Fuel-Air Explosive. \nThey do exist. They are, however, considered ""conventional"" weapons, even if their destructive power is comparable to small nuclear weapons (so FAE are often called ""poor man's nukes""), yet they produce no radioactivity.\n\nHow it works? \nYou take an air-delivery system (usually an air-droppable bomb) and fill it with liquid combustible (specially prepared petrol). Once released, the FAE engages on pre-set altitude, spraying the petrol around it to create a fuel-air mix of greatest efficiency (hence the name), then ignites it. The explosion... as I said, it's comaprable to a nuke.\nAs a side - effect, such an explosion burns out oxygen out of air, what would kill every living organism there (provided it would survive heat and shockwave of the general blast). Of course, after a while the air mixes and becomes breathable again.\n\nNote that it is as destructible to buildings, vehicles and other objects as any explosion of that size would be. So no way of ""killing the people, but leaving stuff untouched"". \n\nHumanitarity... I'm not sure there's any truly humantarian weapon, maybe except a toy watergun (and you're not going to win a war with these). FAE doesn't seem particulary inhumanitarian way of killing human beings to me, since it leaves no residue Nuclear, Biological and Chemical weapons tend to produce. \nOf course, I have no first-hand experience with the problem..."

The adolescent years are often periods of rebellion for many teens. After dwelling under their parents' roofs, adhering to their rules and 'accepting' their values as their own, many resort to unruliness and misbehavior as a means of asserting their own independence. It's important not to take this too seriously since many times it's simply an attempt at 'fitting in' with their fellow peers and doesn't necessarily stem from any core, lastng value or belief.\n\nIt can be extremely difficult to comprehend their behavior, primarily because, at this stage, the values of teens and adults differ considerably. Don't worry :). When they grow up and finally begin to mature mentally and emotionally, their irresponsible behavior will decline significantly. Soon their actions will change and they will begin exuding more 'mature', adult characteristics---hopefully more reflective of their years :).
The UN has turned into the impotent tea-sipping debate society the League of Nations was. In the 1930's, the LoN, in typical European fashion, couldn't even muster the courage to write Moussolini a stern letter for invading Ethiopia.\n\nToday, the UN turns its backs on the 1 million deaths in Darfur, the 750,000 deaths in Rwanda, the Chinese conquest of Tibet and murder of the Fulan Gong, the thousands murdered by Saddam, the terrorism of the cowardly sheep-loving Muslims against Israel, etc. Their peacekeepers can rape the women and children of those they're supposed to protect, but little else.\n\nThe irony about the current coalition war against Iraq, is that it was Bush who did this to make the UN relavent, to demonstrate the force behind its words, behind the dozens of resolutions against Iraq.\n\nIn NATO, now we are supporting the European economies with our military budget. Let those 'superior' 'enlightened' folks take care of themselves, and let us pull our troops and money out of there. There is no longer a Warsaw pact to unite against.

"2006 U.S. immigration reform protests\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to: navigation, search\nThousands gather for illegal immigrant rights rally in Nashville, Tennessee on March 29, 2006.\nEnlarge\nThousands gather for illegal immigrant rights rally in Nashville, Tennessee on March 29, 2006.\n\nIn 2006, millions of people were involved in protests over a proposed reform to existing United States immigration laws. The protests began in response to proposed legislation known as H.R. 4437, which would raise penalties for illegal immigration and classify illegal aliens and anyone who helped them enter or remain in the US as felons. As part of the wider immigration debate, most protests not only seek an overhaul of this bill, but also a path to legalization for those who have entered America illegally and fewer Immigration Services delays.\n\nThe largest national turnout of protests occurred on April 10, 2006, in 102 cities, and were the largest demonstrations in many years in cities such as Dallas, Texas, (estimated crowd 500,000), Chicago, Illinois, (estimated crowd 100,000), Atlanta, Georgia , (estimated 60,000), Salt Lake City, Utah, (estimated 40,000), Seattle, Washington, (estimated 30,000) and Madison, Wisconsin, (estimate 25,000). Almost all of the protests were peaceful and attracted considerable media attention, although there was also controversy over what many people considered anti-American symbolism at some of the protests. Additional protests took place on May Day and many of the protesters carried portraits of Marxist icon Che Guevara and signs mass-produced by communist organizations such as Socialist Worker and Workers World Party.

Eduardo Sotelo, a Spanish-language radio personality from Los Angeles and known by the nickname El Piolin, persuaded eleven of his counterparts from Spanish-language radio stations based in Los Angeles to also rally listeners to attend planned protests. [1] [2] [3]\n[edit]\n\nRole of the Internet\n\nInternet community sites containing personal blogs also played a significant role in helping to ""get the word out"" on the dates and locations for the marches and demonstration protests. Whereas Spanish language radio concentrated on the Spanish speaking audience only, the Internet catered to Mexican-Americans and other Hispanic youths.

In my opinion we are much worse off with him as president. All he wants is oil and those peoples money. If he put as much money into this war as finding a new resource than gas then we would have it by now and gas would be cheeper and more effecint. Bush dose not know what he is doing and i cannot wait until hes out of office.
In general, it means a government that is based on a constitution, rather than a whim of the dictator or whoever the leaders are.  It means that the constitution provides a basis in law that prevents abuse of one group of people (especially a minority) by a majority that is common in pure democracy, or prevents abuse of people by a stronger government.
The media are a bunch of liberal trolls who want to manipulate the ordinary people of this country, who want to ROUND THEM UP AND SEND THEM HOME!!!!!!!!!!
it depends on a lot of factors. laws vary from state to state. were you on FMLA? did you want to work a different schedule when you return or were you available to return to work under the same conditions before you left. for instance - did you work full time and now want to work part time? check with your local unemployment office.
I'm not sure. I am convinced that there needs to be a very comprehensive answer to the problem of illegal immigration and sealing hte borders would be a great start. But is it possible? And are we also sealing the Canadian border? Probably not. I don't see too many illegal Canadian immigrants clamoring to jump the fence south. Posting National Guard troops is sort of scary because they are a military presence although the president says they will be there in a non-military function. Thisis a very different nation than the one I was lead to believe it was in school.
"Lee Harvey Oswald\n\n\n\nConspiracy Worldview\n\nKennedy was a threat to many interests. \nKennedy was going to withdraw from Vietnam. \nAdministration officials knew there was a conspiracy, or were actually part of it. \nThe administration feared the public learning about the conspiracy. \nThe Warren Commission was a coverup. \nWhen bureaucrats keep documents secret, it is to conceal wrongdoing on their part. \nConspiracy thinking results from government lying and scheming. \n Lone Assassin Worldview\n\nKennedy was a rather conventional politician. \nKennedy had not decided to withdraw from Vietnam. \nAdministration officials believed Oswald to be the lone gunman. \nThe administration feared the consequences if the public came to believe that a communist nation had Kennedy killed. \nThe Warren Commission sought the truth — although it was excessively sensitive about matters relating to national security and the Kennedy family. \nBureaucracies have a ""culture of secrecy"" that leads them to conceal records for no good reason, and where good reasons for keeping secrets exist, bureaucrats interpret them too broadly. \nConspiracy thinking results from a psychological process: people are unwilling to accept that the assassination had no broader meaning."

Do u think Indians would support their PM if he chose to attack the US? Or the Chinese if they decided to take Alaska? Bush is absolutely opportunistic. More so Jeb and Cheney. Iran in fact, should be made out as a case for peace. All US is doing is depleting oil reserves of Middle east so that one day the world would be dependent on Texas and Alaska. Then the east would attack US for the same reasons... \n\nSo summary: NO, the US of A should NOT attack Iran.

Laws vary by jurisdiction. Usually shoplifting will be charged as Petit Theft or Petit Larceny, depending on the value of the goods that were stolen. If the event a large value of goods were stolen, then the charge would likely be Grand Theft or Grand Larceny. If an attempt to steal was foiled by arrest, then the charge would likely be attempted petit or grand theft or larceny.

"Illegal immigrants, themselves, brought this issue to the forefront when they marched and protested and demanded rights and waved their flags in our streets last May.  THEY BROUGHT THEMSELVES to the attention of the citizens of the USA!  Suddenly, people started noticing the closure of hospitals due to being inundated with illegal immigrants who do NOT pay for their medical treatment.  Suddenly, people started looking around and seeing the devastation of their towns and neighbourhoods with illegal immigrants over-housing residences and overburdening schools and causing the education of their own children to be degraded and their neighborhoods to become unsafe and squalid due to over-housing - 10 or more people in a residence meant for a family of 4?  This causes safety hazards for purposes of fire and overburdens the sewer systems, garbage removal, parking on the streets, and lowers the property values of the homes in the neighborhoods, etc.  Suddenly, people realized that the reason they weren't able to find work in occupations they used to be able to earn a decent living in, such as construction and manufacturing, etc. was because of illegal immigrants who were willing to work for far less and usually ""under the table"" for cash, which illegal immigrants are willing to do because then they don't pay taxes on their income.  An American cannot work for that cheap, because they DO have to pay income taxes!  \n\nThis is a hot issue right now because of the huge number of illegal immigrants in the country now and the fact that they are pouring in at greater and greater numbers daily.  Previously, mostly only border states and towns were more aware of the illegal immigrants, but now they are starting to move further north and more and more states and towns are finding themselves negatively affected to a level that they can no longer turn a blind eye to it.  Illegal immigration is DEVASTATING our great country and the time has come to put a stop to it, however we have to do it.  The citizens of the USA have had ENOUGH and are no longer able to support the poorest of the poor from all the other countries of the world because we are needing to look after our own poor, first."
Yes we should. As a moderate Democrat, I am hopeful that Dems and Reps will come together. This is the only way our country will ever move forward.

It is quite possible that not everyone is as diligent in their work as you are. Also very possible that the workers in question think they are helping by doing what they do. Alot of the people in question had children who were American citzens, though their parents are not. Because the children themselves are eligible citizens, they can get welfare or food stamps to feed them. In fact, through an article in the L.A times, the county supervisor said that about 100,000 children of illegal immigrants in the county collect $276 million in annual welfare benefits. He also stated that 98,703 children of 57,458 undocumented parents received Cal-WORKS welfare checks in January, or a total of 156,161 recipients. Most of this was because the children were citizens. Though I am not familiar with Cal-Works or what benefit it entails, studies have found that due to 1996 restrictions, it is harder for illegals as well as natives to get welfare. But, the proportion of illegals who get food stamps and medacaid is significantly higher than that of the native population. In fact, it was found post 1996 reform that the percent of illegals who naturalized jumped significantly, all among those who had once received aid. It was also found that one in three families headed by an illegal immigrant is using one type of welfare or another. And because they are not usually educated people and are often low skill workers, the ones that do contribute taxes contribute much less than other families. For this reason, if we legalized them tax payments would increase 77%, but the net deficit would rise to 117%, because they would be legal to receive all the services that they are currently having difficulty accessing now.

"First of all, calm down and stop shouting. Your anger is also affecting your ability to form proper sentences and use spell check. To be able to communicate effectively with ""the powers that be"", make sure all your language skills are up to snuff.\n\nThat being said - you started out by saying that ""I go to"" a vocational school, and somewhere in there, it changed to ""they kicked me out"". Which is it? Have you been expelled?\n\nIf so, you have several options, and the ACLU isn't one of the more useful ones, as it doesn't appear that your expulsion is the by-product of any of your civil rights being violated.\n\nStart by asking the administration of the school to provide you with a detailed record of your history there, including grades on all tests/exams, as well as attendance. Will this record show that you were completing the coursework successfully? Will it show that you were there when you were supposed to be, and that all assignments were submitted on time, and passing grades were given to them?\n\nThe point is, the school has to be able to show that you were expelled because of not meeting the criteria for passing. You cannot be expelled simply because you (and another student, if I am to understand this correctly), brought a potentially unsafe condition to the attention of the appropriate party there.\n\nIf, after reviewing your records, you determine that you did, indeed, meet the criteria for passing, then your next step would be to call and request a meeting with the school's administrator. Ask that person to put in writing their reason(s) for expelling you. Have your records in your hand, and ask the administrator to review them, to give them an opportunity to rescind their decision to expel you. If, after doing this, the administrator still doesn't agree that the expulsion was unwarrented, then your next step would be to contact the governing agency for the school, likely the Michigan Department of Education (at the state level). You can find their phone number in the pink government pages of your phone book. Call them, explain your situation, and ask for a hearing (or whatever process they have in place to appeal the school's decision), and follow through on it.\n\nBe calm, be articulate, be prepared, and be ready to defend your record. If you do all this, it is pretty likely that you will be re-admitted, and given the opportunity to catch up on whatever was missed since the expulsion, in order to pass.\n\nPicketing the school - while giving you the opportunity to vent your outrage - will not further your cause. Rethink that ""strategy""."

Let's get a few things straight.  The dead always vote Democratic, it isn't a coincidence the city of Philthadelphia is strongly Democratic and the leader in dead voters, Chicago, also heavily Democratic is a close second.  But let's be honest, does anyone really believe that their party isn't trying to do things that are illegal or at least immoral to sway the outcome of the election?  If you do, I have beachfront property for sale cheap in Nebraska.  The whole system is corrupt and needs to be taken over by the people who actually give the government the power.  That is us, the citizens.  The governed are the only ones who have the ability to stand up and take back the country.  We are obviously too busy worrying about who is on survivor or if the Knicks won.  Or too busy pointing fingers.  We won't change anything by sitting on our hind quarters.  Get out and vote but don't stop there.  Keep an eye on your leaders, all of them.  When they do somehing wrong, write to them, the papers, anything.  We need to demand that the government does the will of the majority.  That is democracy, not what we are disguising it as today.
They are bound by law to ensure that their property is a safe place in which to reside. However smoke alarms are cheap and easy to install. You could do this and ask your landlord to reimburse you. He may not want to face a county court if you chase him for expenditure which you considered vital for your safety. He can not evict you without a court order so do not be afraid to take action. If your landlord was doing his job, these actions would be unneccessary.
The verdict has nothing to do with the election and could not influence anyone anyway. If there are people out there who are undecided at this point, then there is nothing that could sway them one way or another. When you see a survey that has undecided a week before election then those people should be identified and lose their right to vote. There are probably some of you out there who would like to believe other wise but most people vote straight party line tickets and the only thing that makes a difference is the party who gets out the most voters.

What is really interesting to me is how this is downplayed in our media.

Not a blip. I had to hear about it on BBC. \n\nNot only does our military have no morality, our media has no integrity!

...Agree with a few previous above: ...this government is more dangerous than what it's trying to protect.

It's dangerous.
"Ah, the good ol' myth of the welfare mother.\n\n1.  Women do not have children specifically to get more welfare benefits.  Welfare pays somewhere around $90 a month per child.  Counter that with the cost it takes to feed, clothe, house and provide medical care for that child.  It does not make economic sense to have a child in order to get an extra $90.  You will be spending more on that child than you are making.  \n\n2.  Welfare has not ""destroyed the American family.""  The divorce and single parenthood rate among welfare recipients and non-welfare recipients is comparable.\n\n3.  You are going to stop fathers from abandoning their children by...punishing the child and the mother?  How does making the child and the mother live in overcrowded conditions a la tenements make fathers more responsible for their children?\n\n4.  ""A modern comfortable, private apartment.""  Have you actually set foot into public housing?\n\nWouldn't a smarter thing to do be to have greater access to birth control and safe, legal abortions in poorer areas?  Poor areas usually have a dearth of clinics.  Wouldn't a smarter thing to do be have sex education that teaches folks how to avoid pregnancy and diseases in school?  Wouldn't a smarter thing to be to give incentives to two-parent families on welfare, to fathers who support their children, and penalties to fathers who do not?"

There are really only formal amendments, as defined in Article V.\n\nI guess you can consider US Supreme Court holdings, which interpret provisions of the Constitution, to be informal where they are not reflected in the actual text. But that's not really an amendment.\n\nExample. The Constitution by its text does not require Miranda warnings, nor does it require exclusion of evidence that is illegally obtained. Both of those are the result of Supreme Court holdings,  based on the intent of the requirements and the means by which the explicity provisions of the text can be enforced in real life.\n\nDo you consider those interpretations or informal amendments?

"Your questions and comments indicate a great degree of cluelessness concerning Royal Navy operations in the Pacific Theatre.\n\nI'll try and address your comments in the order that you made them:\n\n\n""gentlemen, gentlemen aren't we forgetting that the british navy steamed with the americans for the entire pacific campaign??\nIn fact the british carriers were the only ones to have steel decks, therefore making them a little more durable during jap kamikarzi attacks????""\n\nFirst off, the RN did NOT steam with the USN during the entire Pacific Campaign.  From the time of Nagumo's carrier raids in the Indian Ocean in April 1942 until operations against targets in the Far East Indies starting in April 1944, the RN didn't operate with the USN at all, with the exception of the loaning of HMS Victorious to the USN towards the end of the Guadalacanal campaign due to the carrier losses suffered by the USN.  She didn't see any action, so that's pretty much 2 whole years where the RN did nothing to support the USN in the Pacific.\n\nThe RN carriers did have armored decks, and they were fairly effective against kamikaze raids.  However, they made a severe trade-off because the armored decks reduced the size of the hangar decks, and RN carriers typically carried an air group only half the size of their USN counterparts, which limited the usefulness of their air groups.\n\n""My grandfather was an officer on the Indfatigable, the largest aircraft carrier this country built, certainly during the war, and the whole company of 5000+ men are forgotten.......""\n\nYour grandfather was a fine man for serving, and has my utmost respect for doing so.\n\nI don't know where you get the 5000+ figure from, the Implacable class carriers had a designed crew of 1,585, but actually had a complement near 2,300 during actual service, which is still not even half your figure.\n\n""austrailia was never a target, the japs had no intention of overstretching them selves they were only after the mineral and oil reserves of the philipeans.... get a grip man. the fact that the british fleets pacific home was austraila says that the country would have been defended...""\n\nYet the British Pacific Fleet wasn't established until 22 November 1944, who was defending Australia up til then?  Not the previous British Far Eastern Fleet, as the were based in the Maldives and were of no use to Australia.   You are correct in saying that the Japanese wouldn't have invaded Australia, they simply didn't have the resources, logistical support, or the troops to do so.\n\n""as for the early british losses the japs took us by surprise too, but that was nothing to the incompetence of pearl habour, where as luck would have it the carriers were out on exercise. The americans knew they were coming and did nothing.""\n\nWhat about the loss of Princes of Wales and Repulse?  No surprises there, it was simply hubris and incompotence which led to them making a sortie with no air support and a miniscule destroyer escort in the face of large numbers of shore-based Japanese bombers.\n\nI think the question you should have asked is:\n\n""Why is there such a paucity of books concerning Royal Navy opeartions in the Pacific and Indian Ocean Theaters during WWII?""\n\nIn my humble opinion that would have been a better question which would have yielded more fruitful answers.\n\nOh, and I would like to know why bearstirringfromcave thinks RN carrier design was superior to USN carrier design?  (And the experiences in the Med didn't have much to do with it, as they changed almost nothing in their carrier designs even after the Med was secure)."
It was bound to happen. I actually thought it would have been sooner, however I believe Bush pushed for him to stay on for appearances.

All Socialist like big Government, high taxes to pay for it, and a bossy/patronising attitude towards the electorate. They dislike individuals who are successful. They have to be taxed to the hilt as a punishment for their success. The taxes are then handed to feckless individuals who will vote for a socialist government in order to repay their masters. The recent scare about global warming is just a ruse to squeeze more tax money out of us. We already pay for refuse collection, so, as you imply, further charges are just a con trick.\n\nIt is ironic, that the more successful a punitive tax is in achieving its objective, the less tax it raises, eg, speeding fines. The more the policy fails, the more tax revenue it raises. Eventually, once the government gets used to the additional income, it will want us to fail.

"""Allimony in the state of Illinois? I'm about to divorce my husband, he dont know this yet. But I know i will get child support but i was wondering about alimony. My PT job brings me about $4,000.00 a year, only 4 thousand, no typo. And because he never wanted me to work more than that, I think I would be entitled to spousal support. His job and income always provided for me, now because of his lying and cheating, I'm walking out on ten years of marriage. Am i elligable for alimony according to IL law?""\n\nThe quick answer to your question is ""Probably.""\n\nThe basic purpose of maintenance is to allow spouses who were supported during the marriage-- but who are unable to support themselves after dissolution of the marriage-- to be able to have time to establish a fair degree of independence.  Consequently, maintenance payments for a year or two-- depending on the particular circumstances of the case-- might be warranted where the previously supported spouse is actively pursuing employment, job training or advanced education, where the other spouse has the financial means to provide such support,  and where the division of assets has not created a financial situation that provides a means of support already.\n\nFor example, if a previously supported spouse gets custody of children and is consequently awarded possession of the marital residence until the children reach the age of majority (when the house will be sold and the proceeds divided between the ex-spouses), then the other spouse's support of the residence might negate the need for maintenance payments.  Also, any large lump sum distributions of funds might do the same.\n\nKeep in mind, however, that Marital Settlement Agreements often include a waiver of maintenance-- and other provisions that severe ties as much as possible.  You do want to get DIVORCED, right?  The attorney fees, court costs and general headaches of trying to get paid maintenance sometimes outweigh the benefits of getting it.\n\n[This is not legal advice. You should consult a licensed attorney-at-law for legal advice or representation before making decisions that may affect your legal rights.]"
"Kids start school at 6, and have cheap/virtually free childcare before that, if required.  Also after school care, in school, with qualified teachers.  They finish lower secondary at 15(ish) after 9th grade, and most continue to upper secondary (gymnasium) for 3 more years.  All schools are free, including tertiary education.  Healthcare is virtually free (you pay a small fee per GP visit.) and yes, nationalised. Dental care is free until you are 18.  \n\nAs for family values, well, we love our kids.  I fear you would be disappointed with swedish attitudes to marriage etc, however, most people here simply don't bother getting married, and are perfectly happy that way (I recall one wee girl at preschool being surprised to find out you _could_ get married before you have children). That doesn't mean families aren't important, they are, very much so, but I rather the Swedish idea of what a family is tends not to revolve around a religious (or even civil) ceremony.\n\nYes there are people who work 40 hour weeks and have trouble making ends meet, but that's true anywhere.  Not everyone is in a position to get a good paying job, either through lack of skill, or unwillingness to move.  Most people are doing ""ok"", and real poverty is pretty uncommon.\n\nFrom a New Zealander's perspective, Sweden is like NZ in another language.  It's really not much like Britain, culturally or politically (and yes, I have lived in the UK too). \n\nAnd the light treatment stuff is probably overdone in the foreign press.

When a person dies having made a will, that will has to be submitted to the Probate Office, a government department, which then holds it permanently as a public record available for anyone to see upon application.  Copies of the will may be obtained for a fee from the Probate Office. A grant of probate is then made to the executors named in the will. Until this vital step has been taken, the executors are powerless to act in dealing with the estate, as all banks, building societies, etc. etc. will want to see a copy of the will and possibly the grant of probate before responding to requests from the executors.\n\nThe fact that the estate is not very large does not mean it doesn't have to go to probate: the main difference between a large and small estate is when it comes to paying inheritance tax.
Absolutely.  I agree with nothing that barbaric agency has to say because they are all money grubbing losers who tear families apart for actions less than criminal.  They will frump up anything they can to get the money guaranteed by the federal government for each child in their so called care and custody so as to insure future job security.  Moonfairy is wrong.  They don't ever get warrants and barge in homes with the cops right there and tell you they don't need a warrant.  They get away with murder and no, you have no rights in juvenile dependency court.  NONE!\n\nOn the other hand, a child does not test positive for adhd.  Sounds like you are referring to an illegal drug.  There are ways to help your child with adhd without giving them speed and once again, like I stated before, better do what they tell you to or your child will be yanked away.  They will charge you with medical neglect if you do nothing about it which stinks too.  You would think it is your right to decide if you want your child becoming dependant on ritalin.  But you have no rights as far as cps is concerned.  Now, if it were a medical emergency and you refused life saving treatment, yes, take your kid away.  But adhd is hardly life threatening and your child is in no imminent danger.  Tread lightly with cps because that is one truly evil agency who could care less about your child or your family.  If they don't frump up tons of abuse/neglect cases, they will be out of jobs.\n\nPower corrupts\nAbsolute power corrupts absolutely

smoking while driving is the same as having a lighted blow torch in the car. It should be banned. I have seen police officers smoking while driving. taxi drivers and bus drivers. They should be fined and banned from driving for 3 months minimum. smoking is a distraction. being distracted while driving can kill. Stand in a field and smoke yourself to death if thats what you really want. Let the rest of us live.

"There is only one reason to reintroduce ""The Draft"" in the USofA.  When the number of volunteers joining the military do not make up for the numbers leaving the military for what ever reasons; and the military are not able to fulfill the missions that the President of the USofA gives them, either in his capacity as Commander in Chief, or to fulfill the obligations required by treaty and law.\n\nSadly even with all the technological advances and advantages that the USofA has over it's enemies, land must be occupied for law and order to prevail on that land, it must be maintained by having people on the ground.\n\nSo, if ""The Draft"" must be reintroduced, it must be because there are not enough people in the military to do the work it needs to do. The National Guard and the Reserves are being heavily relied on to do the work which should be done by Active Military Units.\n\nSince George Bush Sr, the active American Military units have been reduced under successive administrations.  A couple years before 911, a report by the Pentagon and endorsed by the CIA, suggested that there was not enough personnel in the Military to do their current tasks, but this was ignored by ""W"" as many other reports, such as the one that said that Iraq and Iran do not have WM-D's.\n\nIf ""The Draft"" must be reintroduced, it will ultimately be determined by the ""will of the people"", by who they elect and put into Government.\n\nIn other words, you get what you ask for."

"There are several many ways India can become a powerful country:\n\n1) First of all, get rid of all the muslims!!!  As long as this disease is in India, nothing positive is possible\n2) The government needs to be more effective in tackling all types of corruption.  They should promulgate stiffer legislation for corruption, and people who report cases of corruption should be awarded.\n3) Education must be made mandatory until 18 years old.\n4) the size of the armed forces must be increased two fold and there should be a increase in defence expenditure.\n5) The government should make much easier for ordinary people to access education and business loans\n6) Indians should be encouraged to ""save"" more.\n7) The millions of people living in poverty should be trained to produce certain goods.  Not only shall this enable them to work themselves out of poverty, but it shall be good for the level of Indian exports.\n8) India must undertake a much proactive effort to export goods to states, with whom our trade relations remain under developed and under utilised.  These include South American, Eastern European and African states.\n9) Our strength lies in services.  We should balance it out with production and manufacturing.\n10) In terms of foreign policy, we should augment relations with the USA, Israel, the EU states and Japan.\n11) Bodybuilding and Martial Arts (with a Hindu ethos) must be made compulsory in schools and colleges.  This will allow the Hindu man to change the international stereotype of him being a docile weak figure into that of a tough testosterone god.\n12) Our economy must be excelled in every way possible. Services, Manufacturing, exports, savings,.  At the moment India's natural resources remain ridiculously underdeveloped and under utilised.  This includes oil.  Oh and btw, the central forests (which Maoist rebels are occupying) are a rich source of aluminium.\n\nBefore we Indians can proceed to accomplish the aforementioned.  We must examine the encumbrances and obstacles that we face.  These include\n\n1) India's unwanted Muslim population\n2) Corruption\n3) Over population\n4) inefficiency in government and bureaucracy\n5) apathy on the part of Indians\n6) lack of funds, initiative and professionalism\n7) lack of patriotism and nationalism among Indians"
"The Marines - \n\nA marine corps (from French ""corps de marine"") is a branch of a nation's armed forces incorporating Marines, intended to be capable of mounting amphibious assaults using infantry, armour, aircraft, and watercraft. The role of a Marine Corps can differ between nations. Many countries, including Spain, Germany, France and Russia describe these combatant groups as ""naval infantry.""\n\nIn modern warfare, Marines are usually elite, highly mobile troops, and are used in situations that do not always involve naval elements. For example, the United States Marine Corps, the largest in the world, is often used as a spearhead for major military offensives or as a stopgap when an emergency military situation breaks out, performing critical military operations until more permanent forces arrive. Historically, Marines were part of the navy and served onboard warships. They assisted the crew in battles, boarded enemy ships, conducted small coastal raids, and protected the officers from mutiny by the crew. Eventually they have become the primary landing force.\n\nThe Navy on the other hand - \n\nA navy is the branch of a country's military forces principally designated for naval warfare and amphibious warfare (marines) namely lake or ocean borne combat operations and related functions. It includes operations conducted by surface ships, amphibious ships, submarines, and seaborne aviation, as well as ancillary support, communications, training, and other fields; recent developments have included space related operations. The strategic offensive role of a Navy is projection of force into areas beyond a country's shores (for example, to protect sea-lanes, ferry troops, or attack other navies, ports, or shore installations). The strategic defensive purpose of a Navy is to frustrate sea-borne projection-of-force by enemies. The strategic task of the navy also may incorporate nuclear deterrence by use of nuclear missiles.\n\nI.E. Navy fight at sea, Marines a branch of the Navy that fight on land."

Terrorists are not idiots, they sick, vile, demented humans but they are not idiots..\n\nLiberals on the other hand are IslamoFacist’s Most Useful Idiots & Best Soldiers...\n\nIslam enjoys a large and influential ally among the non-Muslims: A new generation of “Useful Idiots,” that Lenin identified as those who lived in liberal democracies and furthered the work of communism. This new generation of Useful Idiots also lives in liberal democracies but serves the cause of Islamofascism—another virulent form of totalitarian ideology.\n \nUseful Idiots are naïve, foolish, ignorant of facts, unrealistically idealistic, dreamers, willfully in denial or deceptive. They hail from the ranks of the chronically unhappy, the anarchists, the aspiring revolutionaries, the neurotics who are at war with life, the disaffected alienated from government, corporations, and just about any and all institutions of society. The Useful Idiot can be a billionaire, a movie star, an academe of renown, a politician, or from any other segment of the population.\n \nArguably, the most dangerous Useful Idiot is the “Politically Correct.” He is the master practitioner of euphemism, hedging, doubletalk, and outright deception.  \n \nThe Useful Idiot derives satisfaction from being anti-establishment. He finds perverse gratification in aiding the forces that aim to dismantle an existing order, whatever it may be: an order he neither approves of nor he feels he belongs to. \n \nThe Useful Idiot is conflicted and dishonest. He fails to look inside himself and discover the causes of his own problems and unhappiness while he readily enlists himself in causes that validate his distorted perception. \n\nUnderstandably, it is easier to blame others and the outside world than to examine oneself with an eye to self-discovery and self-improvement. Furthermore, criticizing and complaining—liberal practices of the Useful Idiot—require little talent and energy. The Useful Idiot is a great armchair philosopher and “Monday Morning Quarterback.”\n \nThe Useful Idiot is not the same as a person who honestly has a different point of view. A society without honest and open differences of views is a dead society. Critical, different and fresh ideas are the life blood of a living society—the very anathema of autocracies where the official position is sacrosanct.\n \nEven the “normal” spends a great deal more energy aiming to fix things out there than working to overcome his own flaws and shortcomings, or contribute positively to the larger society. People don’t like to take stock of what they are doing or not doing that is responsible for the conditions they disapprove. \n \nThe Useful Idiot, among other things, is a master practitioner of scapegoating. He assigns blame to others while absolving himself of responsibility, has a long handy list of candidates for blaming anything and everything, and by living a distorted life, he contributes to the ills of society.\n \nThe Useful Idiot may even engage in willful misinformation and deception when it suits him. Terms such as “Political Islam,” or “Radical Islam,” for instance, are contributions of the Useful Idiot. These terms do not even exist in the native parlance of Islam, simply because they are redundant. Islam, by its very nature and according to its charter—the Quran—is a radical political movement. It is the Useful Idiot who sanitizes Islam and misguides the populace by saying that the “real Islam” constitutes the main body of the religion; and, that this main body is non-political and moderate. \n \nRegrettably, a large segment of the population goes along with these nonsensical euphemisms depicting Islam because it prefers to believe them. It is less threatening to believe that only a hijacked small segment of Islam is radical or politically driven and that the main body of Islam is indeed moderate and non-political.\n \nBut Islam is political to the core.

I would suggest consulting your attorney.  Generally a bond hearing of this nature is to modify release conditions.  This can include the additiion of more restrictions, electronic monitoring, curfew, etc.\n\nI certain instances, however, the hearing may result in the bond being pulled and the defendant placed in custody.  This generally occurs if the defendant has new charges since the bond originated.  This is usually a reason to be held without bond in most states.  It is, however, discretionary.  \n\nAsk your boyfriend if this is the situation. If there new charges pending besides the case on bond I strongly urge you to consult your attorney.\n\nFor your information, my knowledge on this subject is a result of working as a licensed bail bond agent.  I have been in court for such hearing on many occassions.  Good luck.
Who are you and where are you from?   Why do you think the government should give you support?

I carried the USP .40cal for about 2 years as a police officer.  My department has now switched to the Beretta 92g 9mm.  I liked the USP much more.

The only thing i did not like about the issued USP was the 12lbs trigger pull.  A privately bought gun will not have such a stiff pull.  It is a great gun,  Really, anything made by HK is great.

"America's stance on Iraq has ALREADY changed, and that's why ""we the people"" recently elected a new Congress that looks the way it does. Hopefully, Congress will work the way it's supposed to now while it determines the U.S.' moral obligation to the Iraq it helped to destabilize (from way back in the 80's when the U.S. was busy EMPOWERING Saddam Hussein). Hopefully, statesmen will listen to one another and to their constituents for a change."
"Bosnia faces the dual problem of rebuilding a war-torn country and introducing market reforms to its former centrally planned economy. One legacy of that era is greatly overstaffed Industry. Under former dictator Josip Broz Tito, military industries were promoted in the republic resulting in the development of a large share of Yugoslavia's defense plants and fewer commercially viable firms.\n\nFor the most part in Bosnia's history, agriculture has been based on privately-owned small and inefficient farms, and food has traditionally been a net import for the republic.\n\nWhen it was a part of Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina financed many large construction projects throughout that country. The Highway ""Bratstvo i jedinstvo"", a pan-Yugoslavian project, which linked Ljubljana (Slovenia) - Zagreb (Croatia) - Belgrade (Serbia) - Skopje (Macedonia), was financed by B and H, despite the lack of direct benefit to that region. The funneling of capital to that project resulted in an increase in unemployment and a decrease in production in the region.[citation needed]\n\nThe war caused a dramatic change in the Bosnian economy. Production fell to 6%, GDP fell 75% and the destruction of physical infrastructure created massive economic trauma. While much of the production capacity has been restored, the Bosnian economy still faces considerable difficulties.\n\nFigures show GDP and per capita income increased 10% from 2003 to 2004. This and Bosnia's shrinking national debt are positive trends, but high unemployment and a large trade deficit remain cause for concern.\n\nThe national currency is the Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark (BAM), which is fixed to the Euro (€1 = KM1.95583) and is therefore very stable. The inflation rate was 1.4% as of 2005.\n\n \nLegal tender coins from Bosnia-HerzegovinaYearly inflation is the lowest in comparison to other countries that were formerly part of Yugoslavia. The inflation rate was 1.9% in 2004,[6] and international debt was $3.1 billion (2005 est); making it the smallest amount of debt owed from the former Yugoslav countries (Serbia and Montenegro's international debt is $15.43 billion (2005 est), while Croatia is at $29.28 billion (2005 est)). Real GDP growth rate was 5% for 2004 according to the Bosnian Central Bank of BiH and Statistical Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina has one of the best income equality rankings in the world, ranked eighth among the world's 193 nations."

"I work hard for one thing only, and that is money.  I have earned this money, and want to spend it in whatever way I choose.  Higher taxes take away my ability to freely spend what I earn.  It also enables those who are poor to refrain from trying to better themselves.  The Republicans stand for tougher national security and a beefed up military (I was driving to work yesterday, saw a bumper sticker that said ""Wont it be a great day when our children have books and the Air Force has to hold a bake sale for bombers?"") This drove me crazy, as our military must be strong for those children to survive!  Some may call that paranoid and my response cliche, but honestly, I do remember 9/11, and I want my kids to be safe.  And with less taxes on my income, I'll buy them some good books.\n\nAlso let me add that issues like affirmative action and the like are very offensive to me.  I feel that the government taking race and ethnicity into consideration is truly a form of racism disguised as helping people they paint as victims.  This does not help minorities, and I feel we will never truly experience equality until things like this are abolished.  Also, it tends to discredit their degrees, as it may seem suspect to employers who dont know if they graduated because they were a minority or because they were smart."

"Requires more thought...\n\nI don't have an easy answer to this question, because I think an agreement about who is who is required.\n\nIn specific contexts, such as when private property may be taken for the public ""good,"" my anwer is no.\n\nIf you are referring to culture clash, I'd like to continue with my usual ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil,"" because I do not consider myself qualified to judge."
You know, a year ago I would have argued this with you. Today I can't. I don't have a problem with the US coming to the defense of Israel. They have a right to exist and noone can deny that the land they are on was theirs over 2000 years ago.\n\nI do have a problem with Israel today though. Israel has taken the good will of the American people *and* the American Government and used it to contribute to the anarchy we are seeing today. I just don't see how their behavior over the last couple of years is justified. I am in no way shape or form supportive of Hezbollah or Hamas but Israel is stirring the pot and it is the United States that is going to pay the ultimate price. As a matter of fact, we already are. \n\nI also have little to no faith in the United Nations. They have proven themselves to be spineless jerks and don't even come close to honoring the Charter set forth by the United Nations years ago. \n\nSomebody somewhere needs to tell Israel enough is enough. They have the right to exist and we will help insure that right but the Israel of today really is no better than the organizations they are fighting against. You can not achieve peace by repeatedly killing innocent civilians. I don't give a hoot if it is in self-defense or not. It is clear Israel is incapable of controlling their own military.  I am tired of it.
No, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.

you should have mentioned that the one who did the hanging was the girls own father, the S.O.B. was to scared to go after the man ,he might get his butt kicked,  In America we would have went after the one who was actually guilty, the 51 year old man \nit amazes me hat this religion is so stupid and so many people accept it,  I can understand in the countries where the Muslims go in and force people to become Muslims such as Bangladesh, \nwhen they come around there it is either be Muslim or die, that is one of the reasons that Islam is such a fast growing religion ,but, when these people come to America for example and have the freedom to choose how can the possible remain Muslim since it is such a stupid and sinister Faith, and any  politician who will vote to accept them should be given some good old fashioned Muslim justice.
No they were long overdue.   Now that was a crook in the highest order and very good at covering his tracks.  I think the ba%tard should have been put in jail with his wife along at his side.

"Some of us are interested in the whole truth. 928 papers you think that is even close to all the papers written on the subject that is probably only one years worth. And notice your own quote says ""most of the warming"" and ""is likely"" not exactly words you use when you have a proven fact. When I was in college in the 80's we where taught that emissions where leading to an ice age. Global cooling was the concern maybe that is why a large precentage of Americans don't believe in global warming to many theories have been thrown out. I read papers on global warming and I wiegh them against other facts I don't buy it. Claude Allegre, a French scientist who supported the global warming theory 20 years ago and was once a supporter of the Kyoto accords, recently came forward and said it now appears to him that the theory is wrong. Other scientist put him down and said he ""was once respectable"". How do you explain everyones rush to close out any debate. You talk about conservatives but they are not they ones running around saying the debate is over and falsifying data( The Hockey Stick Graph) How can a scientist at the forefront of your cause defect and you call me ignorant and uninformed. Are you interested in the truth? Or are you more interested in convincing people there is no debate so they don't seek differing opinions."
because we are not done please stop crying about it until we finish our job like it or not.

.50 cal dessert Eagle ammo is different then the standard .50 cal M2 machine Gun. The pistol is a semi automatic weapon capable of firing one round per trigger squeeze. It fires in single and double action. The ammo for the DE is about 1.50 a round. The gun is not very accurate as the bushing tends to go out of them rather quickly due to the recoil force. You can pick one up for anywhere between 350 to 1500 bucks depending on the add ons and optics. You need only the standard permit in order to carry the weapon. You will however need a special range to shoot it at and will end up paying a great deal for the ammunition. If you are an avid shooter i would look into learning how to reload the ammunition this will save you a bundle and will allow you to tailor the grain load for target shooting and self protection.\n\nRobert Henry \nGunners mate
I agree. I did not see any republicans throwing pies at Nancy Pelosi, like they did with Ann Coulter. Or standing up and turning their back on the U.S. Chief of Staff or V.P. when Clinton was in office. I'm not talking about politicians either. I'm talking about left-wing radicals at universities. I guess that is all they CAN do....it's not like they EVER have any solutions. All they do is complain about the people that do. I don't think I heard one single solution from Kerry when he was running against Bush. All I heard from him were complaints about Bush's strategy with Social Securtiy, Economics, Iraq, etc.\n\nIf you want a REAL laugh, look at Pelosi's voting record. It's obsurd. lol.
I looked it up Jenny and he is close, it will be released later today. The man was retired Navy too, so that does send another message.

"American here, but living in Australia, here's what I'm seeing over the last 5 years... \nThe Australian media is spreading news of American companies doing harm to the Australian lifestyle. Let me give you a couple examples I heard on the news. 1. Dexter Shoe  company taking over the word ""Ugg"" for their boots. Now Australians have been calling ugg boots as such for decades and suddenly this US company comes along and bam, we can't say Ugg anymore. How unAustralian! 2. The FDA will not allow the importation of Vegemite, a top-selling spread aussies feed their kids, into the US. They said it was because it contained Folic Acid... thats a B vitamin that assists in cell reproduction within the body! Radio shows are putting up polls over here about it and callers are mad.\nI'm always hearing comments... ""stupid yanks"", ""arrogant Americans, they think they own the world"". \n\nI love being American, but some US companies are embarrassing the hell out of me. Australia is all about giving everyone a ""fair go"". America is supposed to be the same, but they dont' seem to care whose toes they step on. There is too much ignorance about what goes on outside the US. It's taken me a long time to adjust to the idea that America isn't perfect. I found myself not liking asians... but why? Hollywood paints this portrait that asians ( based upon ww2 dated cartoons and movies) are lesser people and aren't worth our time. When I finally realized this programming within me I was appalled and saddened. \nAs for the middle east... their hatred is mostly misdirected by their religious programming/preaching. Their religion is their world, like with most people, and those that are not of the same mind can only be ""lesser beings"" and not worth their respect. Sound familiar?"

Sure lets substitute one form of discrimination for another good idea. Now instead of being proud of what they accomplished they will always know they didnt have to work as hard as other people because they were given positions. \nI think reverse descrimination fuels a new type of racism. I hate the people that got into college with low test scores/gpa just beacause of their race. And on top of that they get money for being their. So congradulation R.D. you have made me into a racist.
Kerry is really not sorry.  He really feels that the soliders in Iraq are part of the underclass.  He and Michael Moore feel the same way.  Remember in Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore remarks that many of today's soliders are the poor.  He is really not sorry.  He should be though.

Is he now a citizen? If so, it should not be to hard. You will have to pass some basic test to make sure you know enough of the basics about our culture (our language which sounds like you have down, some basic laws, ect dont worry, you will not be expected to know anything right off the bat, they will give you time to learn and its really not much to learn) I think you will also hve to do some other test to make sure you are healthy and do not have any diseases.Make sure you apply for a visa and then citizen ship as soon as possible, you do not want to be tagged as an illegal immigrant!

"Supreme Court decisions, by definition, cannot be appealed.  They are the court of last resort.  They don't call them ""supreme"" for nothing.  Once your case has reached the supreme court of whatever jurisdiction you may happen to live in, you're done.

i think it is time that the brits got a bit more back bone on this subject generally.  it's time to stop feeling guilty and PC about the whole colonial times.  Get assertive and extablish identity before it is too late.\n\none of the strangest things i can't get my head around is the fact that a person has a right to live in britain, carry the british passport AND fight against british forces!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nthat used to be called treason... what happened?????\nanybody who fights against their country's forces in a war must be branded a treasoner and hanged as is the law in the UK, or booted out the country as well as all family and associates and never allowed to return.  to me treason is the biggest form of treachery there is....  i think for most people it is the same.  so what is going on???!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Try sending him a package that will remind him of home.  He will need the reminder especially being away from home during the holidays.  Throw in some items that represent his favorite sports team (hat, jersey, cards, etc).  Put together a stocking (with all of his favorite treats)...this gives him something special to do on Christmas day.  Include some DVD's for him and his buddies to watch as they are sure to get some down time for the holidays.  And include some PICTURES just to make him smile.  Try to get some from his family too and make a small album for him to enjoy.  Have fun with it!\n\nYou will need to package everything securly, make sure nothing is persishable or illegal (alcohol, cigs, porn) and take it to the Post Office.  You should try to have the package sent by the beginning of December so it will make it to him by Christmas.  Military Mail runs slower around the Holidays especially since it has so far to go.
Until recently, a foreigner could only purchase land through a Mexican-based  trust...meaning the foreigner technically did not own the land.  Now, foreigners can own land outright but not in prime locations, eg. near the coast, near the border, etc...These still have to be purchased and held via the trust.\n\nIt's ironic that Mexico and Mexicans scream about US policy, when Mexico is 100 times more discriminatory with regard to its laws and policies concerning non-Mexicans, eg. foreign ownership of land, designating Spanish as the sole official language of Mexico, preventing foreign-born persons from holding large numbers of designated jobs that are reserved solely for native-born Mexicans, etc...etc...They are arguably the most hypocritical country in the Northern Hemisphere.
Did any of you pass high school science? Maybe it has been awhile but think back and realize that your getting your panties in a bunch over nothing. This doesn't even make any sense. Since none of you want to do research on your own, let me break down for you. Especially you big brother conspiracy theorists that think Bush has somehow halted science. LOL\n\nYes, this guy is turning water into hydrogen gas, the process is called electrolysis and has been around, i dont know, 40 years or so. Junior high kids know that when you add electricity to water the hydrogen comes out as a gas that can be burned as fuel. But AH HAH! There is your problem. Where does the electricity come from. Well, you can burn GASOLINE to make electricity, you can use ATOMIC means to create electricity, or you can burn a crap load of COAL to create electricity. None of them are pretty options. How much electricity does it take to turn H2O into HHO? ALOT PEOPLE!!! So guess what? By the time you load your car down with acid batteries that need electricity, which comes from gas or coal and your car still needs gas to run, guess what? You were better going to the pump in the first place and doing the environment a favor. Its not gas companies that have us in the bind we are in folks, its mother nature. There is currently no better source of fuel for vehicles than good ol gas. You have to look at the efficiency of all processes and gas is the best. It takes less of it to move a car 100 miles than any other fuel on the planet, hands down. Sorry, next conspiracy that will change the world please. And affecting world banks? Calm down.....

We really do not need more troops.  We need to take the handcuffs off the troops we have there.

No that's physically impossible. In much the same way one could pose the question if we dropped you head first onto a land mine, how far would the sawdust fly? There's no sawdust in yer head, you just don't know anything at all about politics so you resort to personal insults and juvenile humor as a means of advocating your stance on politics, 'cuz ya just don't know any better. That isn't to say you're an idiot, b/c really there isn't enough proof to substantiate that based solely on your lack of education in politics. If one were to check out your Q&A profile they would see that you have a sense of humor, and the capacity to respond intelligently. One could infer that you are stubborn and maybe a little headstrong in your ways, but that doesn't give an accurate or even a complete picture of your personality, or even your intellect, so again we are at a stand-still.

"The International Court of Justice is not to be confused with the International Criminal Court.  The ICJ's main functions are to settle legal disputes submitted to it by states and to give advisory opinions on legal questions submitted to it by duly authorised international organs and agencies.\n\nThe ICC is a permanent tribunal to prosecute individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity, crime of aggression, and war crimes, as defined by several international agreements.  The Court can only exercise its jurisdiction when national courts are unwilling or unable to investigate or prosecute such crimes, thus being a ""court of last resort"". Primary responsibility to exercise jurisdiction over alleged criminals is therefore left to individual states."

If you watch a replay of that farce you can see by his body language how uncomfortable he was. I respect his integrity for following his boss's orders but in case you all forgot, he resigned as soon as he could afterwards and unlike a lot of former politicians, he hasn't blamed everyone else for things he did. Unlike his boss's and cronies, Powell knew the cost of war, he has been there. To go from him to ""Condi"" shows the true ineptness of this administration.

"Oh, they will dance a lot and make a lot of rash statements, but right now I think they are looking at payback for Bush.  \n\nMost liberals are still mad because their fine, upstanding president Clinton, the scum of the earth....got the boot...and was found guilty of lying.  Don't you love the way he struggled with the definition of what ""is"" is? and Don't you love the way he looked us in the eye (by media, of course) and sooooo declared his innocence.\n\nThere you go.  Payback is Hell and all the Dems have on their minds is a little hellish payback.  What ever happened to working for America?"
No. That is what the border authorities are for.\n\nIt is the same as anywhere else. If you see someone committing a non-violent crime, you can't just shoot them... no one's life is in danger; although, you do have a right to make a citizen's arrest and detain them until the authorities arrive.
i have been saying the same thing i saw the news conference about them finding over 500 WMDs in Iraq and all i ever hear from people is that there was no WMDs as you can see on here there are people that don't want to omit they are wrong they just hate Bush so they will never say he is right but he is right
He turned me off right away in 2000 with his dirty tactics on John McCain.  I had been a registered Republican at the time and was going to vote McCain in the Illinois primaries.  But after those dirty tricks, I  switched my affiliation to Democrat, and haven't seen any reason to look back.\n\nRove is a slimeball. How a man who professes to be a Christian can employ such a vile person is beyond me.
a bit of both. they sell the people like pimps would, but sell off their own principles like whores.

laissez-faire (lĕs'ā fâr`) [Fr.,=leave alone], in economics and politics, doctrine that an economic system functions best when there is no interference by government. It is based on the belief that the natural economic order tends, when undisturbed by artificial stimulus or regulation, to secure the maximum well-being for the individual and therefore for the community as a whole. \n\nWorks well in theory!
Its very heartfelt, it evokes pride in our armed forces and appreciation of their sacrifices.\n\nThanks for sharing.

"My Dear One, why someone would thumb's down this unoffensive question shows just what idiocy is. As for America's politics (I'm going to depart from my usual kindness to say...) it all goes into the same pot and say even though politicians say their party lines are different, they're really not. Politics really boils down to the sum of it's name; that being    poli: (lat) meaning ""many and  tics : blood sucking parasites. Gone are the statesmen. We only have politicians.

"It is not a ""bill of rights"" but rather a bill placed before congress as legislation.  Next, the legislation says nothing about interest rates and no down payments. The legislation does something completely different, guarantees the mortgage will be repaid by the government if the veteran defaults. Since there is a guarantee of repayment, the verteran is automatically a ""low risk"" borrower, and the mortgage lenders will allow a purchase without a down payment, but they don't give any special breaks on interest rates. I purchased my house this way. One other thing is also specified, that there is no prepayment penalty or fee. Some mortgage lenders will charge a substantial fee or penalty for paying back the mortgage early. The veteran can pay the remaining balance in full at any time without paying any fees or penalties for early payment. In addition to educational benefits, there are also medical benefits."

Can I just repeat Zulu9's comments on the bloody yanks, as usual they turned up near the end to claim all the credit and spoils. Hell, if you watch  world war 2 movies i don't think hollywood realised that Britain even participated let alone were  left standing against the nazi's on their own for two years while the US sat back and watched the cash roll in from lend/lease. WW1 was even worse they only fought during the last six months of the war yet demanded reperations of germany that crippled their economy and set the stage for Hitler to come to power.\nSorry, sorry I'm going off on one again, it always happens when someone mentions the war or the US. \nNow what was the question again?
Everyone knows that democrats are impotent with homeland security and they intend to rescend all of the tax cuts that Bush has put in place.\nDemocrats have no intention of shoring up our borders as a matter of fact the democrats beloved speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi voted against the bill to fence up the texas/mexico border.\nDemocrats want to redeploy the troops??????  Where???  New York? Pennsylvania? New Jeresy? \nBecause the last time I checked thats where the terrorists attacked last.\nWhen the troops come home then the terrorists will recoup and be back on our soil again! \nNow that these clueless democrats have power it is a mere countdown to 9/11 part two.\nI guess you democrats can start preparing your explanations to the United States on WHY YOU VOTED AGAINST ALL OF OUR HOMELAND SECURITY INITIATIVES AND NOW THERE ARE AMERICAN WOMEN AND CHILDREN THAT ARE GOING TO PAY FOR YOUR STUPIDITY AND ARROGANCE.\nFurthermore thanks to democrat power we can all just go ahead and pull out our checkbooks now and start making them out to Uncle Sam because once again your beloved democrat leaders have stated their intentions of rescinding the multitude of tax cuts that Bush has established for us all.\nWould you rather see soldiers fighting and killing terrorists on their ground, or American men and women jumping out of high rise buildings because terrorists hijacked commercial airliners and crashed into them?????? \nIt's so real and so tragic. Terrorists are extremely real and there existance is extremely dangerous.\nAnd the Democrats answer to this is to bestow constitutional rights upon terrorists?\nTo take Guantanamo terrorists and put them into American prison general populatrion so they can recruit men that are already criminals with an innate sense of hate for society to begin with?\nTo eliminate data gathering on American based terrorists?\nTo vote against shoring up the Texas/Mexico border?\nTo pull out of Iraq which is also a pivot point to other terrorist nations i.e. Iran, Syria, and Afghanistan.\nWhen it comes to Homeland Security, folks, I think you democratic voters have thrown America back to the wolves.\nI voted Republican. If you voted democrat I'm afraid you will soon be in need of the right words for your sincere apologies to our nation and our beloved United States of America.

Depends on what your visitation papers say.  If you don't want to be the one responsible for the transportation then you have to take the other back to court and state your case so the judge can rule in your favor.

The Eastern Europeans and some Asiatics are indeed aces at it and have been doing it for as long as anyone can remember ... however, it isn't all as easy as it sounds, the INS have copped on ... if you manage to get through the first hurdle you'll get a temporary green card, which will have to be renewed after two years ... you'll have to show proof that you are legitimately married, house deeds and bills in joint names, credit cards or bank details in joint names, correspondence, photographs, affidavits ... everything ... followed by a lengthy interview with the couple separately where everything and anything can be brought up ... yes indeed, once upon a time it was easy enough, but you'll have to be quite the wizard nowadays to get away with it ....

As the coal industry grew, mining methods and laws changed rapidly.\nAs early as the 1850s, immigrants from Wales, England, and Scotland were brought over to work in the coal mines. As the coal industry grew, most of the mining was supported by out-of-state capital and thus was run by out-of-state in the mine superintendents. These men brought in cheap foreign labor, especially from southern Europe, and often abused them with long working hours, poor medical care, and generally inferior living conditions. The poor conditions in the mines brought about the first West Virginia coal mining legislation in 1883.\n\nA state mine inspector was appointed to inspect all mines for adequate safety conditions. In 1890, the state union of United Mine Workers of America was organized in Wheeling to push for better conditions. In 1905, the West Virginia Department of Mines was established to enforce inspections laws. But it was not until the Franklin Roosevelt era that the federal government stepped in to help the miners. The National Industrial Recovery Act, passed to help industry and labor during the Depression, established an 8-hour day and minimum wage provision, and condoned unions. Although the act was later declared unconstitutional, most of the industries had unionized by then. Since the 1930s, the union has been a powerful force in procuring welfare, retirement, and many other benefits for the miners.

The electoral college is an anachronism from the time when the fast form of communication available was the pony express. Not only should it be eliminated, but the long gap between election day and inauguration day should as well, to prevent the possibility of last-minute lawmaking by people who know they have nothing to lose, and are therefore no longer accountable (like Bush trying to sneak Bolton's nomination through again).
I owe LOT to the other veterans that went before me.  To my dad, who served in WWII and the Korean War.  To the many who never made it home.  To the POWs who are still lost today.

Go to your state FOI (freedom of information)office and file a complaint.  There may be a legitmate reason (open investigation etc) but after 11+years thats not going to hold much water. If you can't make progress the media tends to get things done.  start making calls.  There is no reason why a family can't get information after this much time.... Best of luck to you.
Some crimes merge (conspiracy to commit crime is not longer charged when you commit crime) and some dont' (attempt to commit and the actual crime can be charged as once. So you can be charged w/ all the non merging offenses, lower offenses, and higher offenses, as well as federal offenses. There is no limit to how many crimes you can be charged with. You could be charged w/ committing crimes in all 50 states (if they happened in the states)  plus federal crimes. People have been charged w/ hundred of offenses at once (child porn rings, etc)

If needed, get medical help immediately.\n    * Get the following information from every vehicle: driver name, address, phone number, driver's license number, license plate number, make of car, insurance company name and policy number.\n    * Get the names and phone numbers of witnesses.\n    * Get the police report number from police on the scene.\n    * Write down how the crash happened while it's fresh in your memory.\n    * Keep (or photograph) any damaged clothes or equipment. Also, if you're a victim:\n    * Don't get mad at the scene. Keep a level head so you can ask questions and take notes.\n    * If you're injured, don't move unless you're sure you won't injure yourself more

"That's easy to respond to.  People know that the economy has been great, and that of course things have to pull back a little, or level off a little, otherwise there will be a crash.  So, as that article states, and which you fail to state, is that things are ""slowing"", not crashing or anything like that.  Slowing is okay and that is what we would hope our monetary policy could achieve.  If the economy doesn't grow at a slower pace, and we don't have some (small) corrections here and there, the the economy is not good.  Therefore, I would say we still have a pretty darn good economy.  I know I've done great this year!\n\nAs another note, I also read an article today that wage increases are still looking good and above the inflation rate.  \n\nTry another argument."

actually on this one i would have to agree somewhat with you. In FB the schools are complaining that if the ordinances that they passed go into effect many parents will leave and take their children with them.They argued that they get a percentage of money from the federal government depending on how many students they have in their school district and get extra money for all the classes they have that are ESL.personally I didn't know that was true but I guess that explains a whole lot why a lot of schools are so determined to have more kids in theirs school district and why many of them have a lot of ESL classes.all about the money.
Actually the Japanese announced today they are in fact capable of building a nuclear weapon.

Well, Cooljerk, when you named yourself at least you got it half right.  I feel abortion shouldn't be a partisan issue and I feel very strongly that men need to stay out of it.   The government needs to concern themselves with Healthcare, not just for elder's, or single parent's, but for everyone.  Especially those with Mental Health issues that can't get their medications because of costs or getting to the Dr in the first place.  Environment, is another big one, unfortunately not big enough with the Democrats, and non existent with the Republicans.   Education is a HUGE one.  We may be superior to other countries but it's not gonna do us any good if we're a bunch of idiots.  I feel our standards in school are too low.  I don't feel that all parents push their kids to realize their potential   There are too many high school dropouts and I feel strongly that their needs to be legislation against it.  And I think EVERYONE should have the opportunity to go to college or a university and not be held back because of costs.  I realize these are already partisan issues but they need to focus on them more and less on  Roe v Wade.

"People saying he can only serve eight years are not exactly correct. If a vice president succeeds to the presidency more than halfway through his predecessor's term, he can seek election twice. In other words he can serve two whole terms in his own right, as well as the two years minus one day (or whatever) of his predecessor's term. Had Lyndon Johnson sought and won another term in 1968, he could have served as president for over nine years (November 1963 to January 1973).\n\nSo it is possible to serve more than eight years, but not ten or more.\n\nEDIT: Whoever gave me thumbs down is ignorant. Here is what the 22nd Amendment says: ""no person who has held the office of President...for *more than two years of a term* to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once."" Ergo, if he serves less than half of another's term, he can be elected twice."
Republicans might find this as a shocking and controversial position, but most Democrats are *responsible* leaders and think impeachment is something you don't do for the slightest of reasons.  So, hopefully after the election Bush can still feel OK about his weekly visits from the Evangelical homo who does meth.
Believe it or not, there do exist people who are a danger to society, who cannot be reformed, and are a threat to everyone that comes in contact with them for as long as they continue living. There are also people for whom a lifetime of imprisonment is much more cruel than simply killing them.\n\nI have known people of both stripes. And you have undoubtedly heard of some of them too. Prisoners who beg not to be released because they know that they will commit crimes again and don't even want to. Suspects who commit 'death by cop' rather than be taken to jail.\n\nI not only think it is not wrong to kill these people, I think it may be wrong NOT to kill them. Society benefits in the former case, and the individual wishes it in the second.\n\nOf course, I'll be the first to grant that most of the people killed by the American justice system fail to fall into either category. That is not the fault of the death penalty as a punishment, but of the system that implements it.
"This isn't the first time the dem has tried to put on the floor the subject of the draft.  And for anyone who can put two and two togeher, it's a blanket admission that Clinton didn't know when to quit with the ""down-sizing"" of the military that Bush senior had started.  The dem.s said we'd never be in another two-front war and that because communist Russia had fallen, that there were no more enemies of the state.  Believe me, Clinton's down sizing was so completely ill conceived and ill advised.  I remember asking Admiral Nader (one of the politically appointed architects) about the reason.  His response was that ""the economy is slow.""  So, I said, if the economy is slow, that usually means that people aren't working.  If they're not working, they have no money.  No expendable income.  How is taking thousands of gainfully employed people who work for wages well below minimum wage, cutting their jobs and turning them out to an already retarded economy suppose to help?  Won't that be more of a strain?  I was told to sit down and was never really given an answer.  Yep, we'd NEVER fight another two front war."
"I definitely agree.  I want to put a bumper sticker on my car and a t-shirt I wear to say ""You're in America.  Now please speak English.""

They can at least know our language before they come here."

Such a ban would probably not happen in the United States.  The first amendment would prevent it.  Some lawmaker might try it and it might even get passed into law somewhere in the US, but the courts would slap it down pretty quickly.  Law should not dictate how a religion can be observed.\n\nNow, if you are referring to federal, state, or local government being prohibited from having religious displays, then that is already banned by the constitution.  The government should have no part in promoting or banning any religion.  Even if 99% of the US were the same religion, the government should stay out of the religion business.

Ask your doctor about xanax.
Unlike the the depraved rantings of previous posters, I'm going to try to give you a real answer.\n\nSocialists, like in France, Sweden, and a lot of other European countries, believe that the government should provide a certain level of basic services for all citizens. This includes universal health care, social security retirement savings, and a host of other programs. They tax heavily to pay or all this. In some nations, the tax rate is 50% or higher.\n\nIn the United States, Liberals believe that the government has a mandate to help the most unfortunate in our society. While they don't all believe in universal health care, they don't understand why the richest nation on Earth cannot provide medical services to any citizen who does not have insurance. They believe that the government should step in and help people who are unemployed or underemployed. US liberals are NOT socialists, but they are closer to socialism than the conservaives are. Conservatives believe that every citizen should look out for themselves, with no support from the government; that America is the land of opportunity, and if you don't take advantage of those opportunities, that's your problem, not the problem of society in general.
If Bush is any indication, they know they will not be hunted.  Just ask Osama and his boys if they fear Bush will catch them.  Bush's statement was loud and clear.  We will hunt whoever did this 9/11, find them, and prosecute them.  As you can see, Osama and his men are alive and well in a country we occupy, and have prospered quite nicely for many years.  With the best hi-tech military in history, we still don't seem to be able to find these guys?  You might just have to ask why not?
The people who proclaim Christain values the loudest are often the racists, perverts and crooks that you are having trouble with.\n\nThe bigger problem though is the Republican party is made from a coalition of crooked business interests and people who vote based off of Christian values. The Christian voters would lose their money and thus their power if they tried to remove even half of the crooks in congress.\n\nYour best bet is to work with liberals on getting election reform passed so that money plays a lesser role in the influencing election, thus the lobbyist would also lose power. Since that's not going to happen though, your only other choice is to vote third party and hopefully spoil enough elections to get people to pay attention.

Here is some information about what courses to take for the bar exam - I highly recommend all courses though because you will be tested on them. Also every state has different set of laws that you will be studying and you may be tested on those areas so it is good to have those courses out of the way as well. \n\nThe first component, the Multistate Bar Exam, is the same in every state. It consists of 200 multiple-choice questions prepared by the National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE) covering a range of legal topics, including contracts, constitutional law, criminal law and procedure, evidence, property and torts. You will have six hours to answer these questions, in two periods of three hours each. This gives you a little less than two minutes per question. The MBE questions are not short. A question might be several sentences long and each answer will probably also be a sentence or two. In other words, you'll probably need the whole six hours to complete the exam. The District of Columbia and all states except Louisiana and Washington require lawyers to have passed the MBE. \n\nVirtually every state bar exam includes a second, and sometimes even a third, day of essays. Some exams tailor questions to their state's laws (for example, California, New York, Maryland, North Carolina), while other states use the Multistate Essay Exam as their essay section. The Multistate Essay Exam consists of six essay questions spread over the course of three hours. Other states have their own format. Some topics might be familiar to you from your law school classes (like contracts, real property and torts), but others will only ring a bell if you took the course as an elective (such as wills, family law, conflict of laws or corporations). There will be as many as 20 different areas of law that you need to study. \n\nAnother component common to most bar exams is known as the Multistate Performance Test. This section is designed to test your lawyering abilities and responses to ethical dilemmas and clients. Not all states use this in their bar exams, and some only use part of it (New York, for example, has only one Multistate Performance question, while other states include more). This section is generally only allotted an hour or two. \n\nFinally, before you graduate from law school, you will probably be required to take an ethics test, known as the Multistate Professional Responsibility Test. The MPRE is a little over two hours long and consists of 50 multiple-choice questions designed to measure your knowledge of ethical standards of the legal profession. The exam is offered by the NCBE three times a year, in March, August and November. If you are not required by your state to take the MPRE, you might be subject to a separate ethics section when you take your bar exam. \n\nI hope this helps!

Yes, I have sent them a PLAN!\n\nTHE PLAN:\n\n1. No Amnesty in any form for illegal aliens. Do not reward illegal behavior!\n\n2. Immediate crack down on employers and increase penalties for hiring illegal aliens.\n\n3. Stringently enforce the existing immigration laws.\n\n4. Build a fence along our southern border.\n\n5. Secure our ports and secure and Close our borders!\n\n6.  Make it mandatory for all Americans to read this document:\nNEW: Homeland Security Report:\nhttp://www.house.gov/mccaul/pdf/Investigaions-Border-Report.pdf\n\n7.  DEPORT illegal aliens with the help of the military.\n\n8.The reasons why we should close our borders and deport illegal aliens are as FOLLOWS:\n*********************************\n\n1.  $11 Billion to $22 billion is spent on welfare to illegal aliens each year. \nhttp://www.fairus.org/site/PageServer?pagename=iic_immigrationissuecenters7fd8\n\n2.  $2.2 Billion dollars a year is spent on food assistance programs such as food stamps, WIC, and free school lunches for illegal aliens.\nhttp://www.cis.org/articles/2004/fiscalexec.html\n\n3.  $2.5 Billion dollars a year is spent on Medicaid for illegal aliens.\nhttp://www.cis.org/articles/2004/fiscalexec.html\n\n4.  $12 Billion dollars a year is spent on primary and secondary school education for children here illegally.\nhttp://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0604/01/ldt.01.html\n\n5.  $17 Billion dollars a year is spent for education for the American-born children of illegal aliens, known as anchor babies. \nhttp://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0604/01/ldt.01.html\n\n6.  $3 Million Dollars a DAY is spent to incarcerate illegal aliens.\nhttp://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0604/01/ldt.01.html\n\n7.  30% percent of all Federal Prison inmates are illegal aliens.\nhttp://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0604/01/ldt.01.html\n\n8.  $90 Billion Dollars a year is spent on illegal aliens for Welfare & social services by the American taxpayers.\nhttp://premium.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0610/29/ldt.01.html\n\n9.  $200 Billion Dollars a year in suppressed American wages are caused by the illegal aliens.\nhttp://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0604/01/ldt.01.html\n\n10.  The illegal aliens in the United States have a crime rate that's two and a half times that of white non-illegal aliens.   In particular, their children, are going to make a huge additional crime problem in the United States. \nhttp://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0606/12/ldt.01.html\n\n11.  During the year of 2005 there were 4 to 10 MILLION illegal aliens that crossed our Southern Border also, as many as 19,500 illegal aliens from Terrorist Countries.  Millions of pounds of drugs, cocaine, meth, heroine and marijuana, crossed into the U. S. from the Southern border.\nNEW: Homeland Security Report:\nhttp://www.house.gov/mccaul/pdf/Investigaions-Border-Report.pdf \n\n\nWRITE CONGRESS NOW!:\nhttp://www.congress.org\n\nor The White House:\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/\n\nor Senators:\nhttp://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm
Lots of misconceptions on this subject.  Let me try and clear up a few.\n\nBush ordered the release of these documents against the advice of John Negroponte.  Senators Hoekstra and Roberts, both Republicans, wanted this information released to the public for political reasons to try and help their case that there were WMD in Iraq.  According to David Kay, head weapons inspector, these were documents that were retrieved prior to 1991 and were already known about before W invaded Iraq.\n\nSecond year nuclear physics majors do not have all the information needed to build a nuclear bomb, let alone a regular physics major.  This information was not previously available on the internet, that is an urban myth.\n\nThere is no doubt that Saddam was a future threat, but there is still no evidence that he was an imminent threat.\n\nThese are the facts.
Probably just another political tactic.. Take one example and paint the whole party. Happens all the time. ex. Gay liberals, secular liberals, Liberals don't work, this guy said pull out of Iraq right now so all Democrats must want that. blah blah blah.. It's nothing new, fuel for the retards that's all...
Let me say first that a lot of things that you find on the internet are incorrect/outdated.  For example:  http://www.coolnurse.com/marriage_laws.htm states that in GA a pregnant minor can marry without parental consent.  They USED to be able to, but GA has now changed that law and pregnant minors can no longer marry in GA without parental consent.\n\nAnd DON’T run off and get pregnant thinking that you will then be able to get married or obtain permission from a judge to get married, because it’s usually denied.  A pregnancy ALONE does not automatically mean that marriage is in the best interest of the minor and is not normally a sufficient enough reason for a judge to override a parents rights/wishes by granting a minor permission to marry when their parents object to it.\n\nAnd as far as emancipation, which is VERY hard to obtain by the way, there are states where emancipation does not give a minor the right to get married.  \n\nAt 18 you can get married.
Sounds like you are fine, since the state you live in should be where you hold a valid lisence.  If you ever go to switch your licence back to CA, I think you are going to have problems and are going to need to provide the SR-22, And if you get stopped driving in CA you might have problems.\n\n  When you get a DUI on a out of state licence the state will not take your lisence on the spot like getting a DUI in most same states as your licence is issued in.  You would go through the penial penalties in the state you were caught in through the courts system, and that state transfers the info to your ID issuing state, and it is up to that states laws weather they implament the D.M.V(M.V.A) penalties like licence revoketion, or suspention.  The SR22 is just a insurance thing, and if you ever get your licence changed to CA you will need to deal with it, under a CA insurance issuer.  If it is something you want to try and clear up now, ask your Insurance company if they will give you a SR22 for your home state, then just send it to CA.  Tell them you need it for work or something stupid like that.

I'm in agrement.  I'm a non-smoker, and I think that if the restaraunt wants to, they should inform everyone that it's a smoking establishment, and let it be.  \n\nThere are other alternatives as well, for instance, a permit system that allows establishments to have a smoking bar/restaurant.  The local authorities could manage the number of places that allow smoking, and if demand increases, they could release more permits.  \n\nThese places should still allow a seperate section for non-smokers, completely seperate, or not.  It would just depend on the market. \n\nBut either way, I'm all for as little governemen interference as possible, allowing the market to set the demands.

Democracy means more than fair elections that represent the will of the people. \n\nThere are many definitions of democracy.\n\nHere are a few definitions:\n\nDEMOCRACY\n•Popular will; Rule by the people\n•Equal citizenship rights\n•Social contract among the people\n•Popular rule express and encourage to autonomy\n•Consist of moral compromise\n•Participation, election, liberties, check and balances\n\nThere are six types of democracy:\n\n1- Schumpeterian democracy\nDemocracy as “ that institutional arrangement for arriving at political decisions in which individuals acquire the power to decide by means of competitive struggle for people’s vote.\n\n2- Populist democracy - Popular will are:\n•Free speech, press and assocation necessary for political freedom\n•The rule of law, arbitary will of public officials\n•Formal voling equality\n\n3- Lıberal democracy\nHe indicates basic to idea of free and equal human beings:\n•freedom of speech, press, assocation and religion\n•right to property, freedom to vote,\n•hold public office and arbitary arrest.\nLiberal democracy contradicts tyrany of popular will; therefore, ıt encourages individuals. İndividuals are rather than whole. So, liberal democracy underlines check and balances and seperation of power for liberty.\n\n4- Participation democracy\nIt offers greater opportunities for citizens to participate direct in politics rather than indirect. So, it is called direct democracy which first used in encien Greece. Switzerland currently has the only Direct Democracy in the world.\n\n5- Social democracy\nIt tries to bring democracy into public life. Specifically, ıt considers family intercourse. For example, women and children rights in family, support family income in order to growth health children such as establishing child care center. Also, ıt gives democratic rights for workers. Workers have the right to participate in decisions in factory. As a result, social democracy is welfare state democracy.\n\n6- Deliberative democracy\nDeliberative democracy offers an aswer that integrates the populist and liberal ideas in order to dicuss an issue and find a solution. So, ıt encourages public deliberation an issues that are best understood through open , delibarete processes. While majority popular will gets to express their will, it also gives the minority the opportunity to express their feelings. It prevents minority rights from the majority tyranny because, ıts aim is to make a common decision.

Sounds like the secretary may have committed criminal impropriety if the student is under the age 18 (16 in some states). This should be handled by law enforcement.

A limited monarchy is one in which the royalty have only ceremonial powers. An example of this is in the United Kingdom.

Well, partly because so many of them didn't serve either. Relatively few of our elected officials are vets. Mainly because we've not had a draft to force them into service, so many choose not to.\nThey tend to be more affluent, too, so they don't choose military service as an option to get out of bad economic situations. Plus many are very politically aware and might disagree with how the President or Congress might use the military.

No it isn't. There have been a number of complaints about bare flor upboards up the stair from the people beleo beacuse of the noise. In such cases the local authorties noise abatement officer can measure for xcessive noise and issue an order tyhat it is reduced, this may mean covering the floor or simply taking of shoes and not jumping about up stairs.

Because you can't terrorize America if the Boogeyman is dead.  The fear card has been Bush's best play since 9-11.

"Bush is just a kid in a grown-up's body, playing ""cowboys and Indians"". The problem is he's playing with REAL people, and REAL lives, and he doesn't even REALLY realize it!\nHas he ever gone to Dover, Delaware to meet a plane load of flag-draped caskets returning from Iraq? Has he, like great military leaders of the past, ever stood on the front lines of battle alongside his soldiers (if he ever did, he'd need changes of underwear!))? \nBush is a spoiled rich kid planted in the White House as a 'patsy' by his own family and friends who want the Bush dynasty of war and war-profiteering to continue. The blood of 655,000 Iraqis and 2,800 American soldiers who have died as a result of Bush's ignorance, arrogance, and egoism is on his hands. You have to wonder how he sleeps at night.   -RKO-"

Not sure on the number, but the reason for low pay is obvious.\n\nRisk vs. Reward.\nCaptialism weights everyone on this metric.  It is far cheaper and better incentives to move jobs and manufacturing to China and India.  China has abundant resources, established manufacturing, and die hard work ethic.  India comes close and turns out a skilled workforce in serious numbers.\n\nMexico\nWeak economy, poor infrastructure and only one thing going for it; close location.\n\nChange must come from within and be a unified decision - as you can see, it is not currently.

This is what normally happens.  First, the principal must be notified.  The principal is required to notify the district office and the department of education.  The principal will take statements from the student, the teacher and any witnesses.  Those findings are reported back to the district office and the department of ed.  Depending on those findings, the teacher can be placed on adminstrative leave while the department of ed investigates.  The deaprtment of ed can either let the teacher keep their job or can revoke the teacher's certificate.  Criminal charges may also be filed, but that's a whole different deal.  Once the department of ed makes a decision, that's the end.

Here's what I think:\n\nIraq was formed by the British after the fall of the Ottoman Empire (WW1). Prior to this, they were three separately governed provinces, Bosra (Sunnis), Bahgdad (Shiites), and Mosul (Kurds). These culturally different people have been forced into unification and to live as one people since then and have been fighting each other for control since they gained their independence in 1936.\n\nHere's my proposal: Split Iraq back into the three separate provinces. With each of them finally able to govern themselves, there is no longer a need to fight one another.\n\nSupport: The Iraqi congress already voted to allow self rule of these separate groups so Iraq is a country in name only. Also, we already have allowed Germany to reunite to it's pre-WW2 borders. Why not get over aritificially imposed WW1 borders and allow this separation? Worked for Bosnia and Yugoslavia.
There are two issues going on. \n\nFirst the American people have lost all respect for the law.  Prohibition in the 20s did a great deal to change people's opinions of laws and turn respect for the law into a joke.  The 55 mph speed limit and the laws against drugs like Marajuana have removed all traces of respect for the law from most people. \n\nLaw enforcement itself is oppressive against the poor. The poor are not protected by cops, they need protection from cops. \n\nThird you have to reform the crooks running the justice system to have a chance at reforming the inhabitents of the justice system. How can prison inmates watching wardens taking bribes, often loading food paid for by the prison system or goods made in the system into private trucks to be sold for the benifit of the Warden's personal pocketbook? Now try to tell them to go honest. Minor crimes wind up imprisoned with hardened crimanals.  The system itself creates immense anger among the incarcerated. \n\nNext most who go in because of drugs are not really there because of a drug problem. They might have been caught selling drugs. Might have had a large quanity of drugs. The reality is that most people are quite happy and in control of their drug habits. The exceptions being the more addictive drugs like crack and herion.  Changing the environment and screening for those with real addictions will make more sense. The guy in prison for weed probably has no drug problem, instead they have education, anti-authority and economic problems. So if you get him to quit smoking weed you just changed the crime not the problem. \n\nSo the first reform would be to ban lawyers from writing laws. Many people are in trouble with the law and even prison for laws they could not understand or for laws they felt were unjust. \n\nEconomically roads need to be there for alterntive means out of poverty. There will always be those who take the quick money, but the majority of people are in crime because of socio or economic reasons. They grow up with cops on their backs even when they are doing nothing wrong. Their friends, relitives, often parents going back multiple generations are in prison or ex-cons. It's become a family tradition and in some neighborhoods it's expected to do time sooner or later. That or die on the street. You have to break up that social acceptance of crime. While laws are unjust and enforcement so heavy against the poor it will be construed as racism and as oppression. There has to be legitimate outs for such people and changing the social jail from one with bars to one without bars doesn't change the incarceration. \n\nPrisons are a manifestation of corruption in this nation. They cost us dearly. Every person spends probably %10-20 of their income dealing with the way we handle law in this nation and it's enforcement. Publicly people like our last two presidents are openly bought. Corporations like Microsoft openly taunt the world with illegal activties. Well known celeberties commit felonies and walk away to write books about how they got away with it. How then can you tell a youngster not to steal? Not to do what the big crooks are doing?  With a cops thieving, beating and harrassing those around them. With a school system that attempts to dehumanize it's patrons and offers little actual useful skills for work and career. With college nothing but a dream for so many in this nation. Jobs scarce and the fragmentation of our ethnic, religious and political groups. It's a wonder anybody who starts poor bothers to ever get a job. Then when released an offender comes out with nothing, knowing nobody sometimes but other offenders and with limited job opportunities. Of course they are going to get into more trouble. \n\nI agree totally with you about it being better to rehabilitate. However to rehabilitate you have to take care of the root causes. As our economy crumbles crime will shoot up again. As tensions increase between various
Okay, everyone sure makes great points. However, I truly disagree!! I am Canadian and do not support the anti-immigration measures. I have family members that are illegals, canadian illegals- that is- but they are still illegals. ( So why is everyone so focused on MEXICANs- take geograpgy lessons, many come from el salvador, costa rica and so many other places.!)Granted, people can say: well yea, but what about the sleeping giant of 11,000,000 illegals.. I say GET OVER IT!! i do not think any one should have the privellage 2 come over here but please whether people are citizens of a country, residents or even an immigrant they are all still HUMAN BEINGS!! Oh and by the way.. to the ignorent people; before prop 100 passed, regardless if illegal immagrants did pay bond they were not let out of jail to await trial. IDIOTS!!!!! They then were handed over to INS which then kept them and did whatever they wanted with them, then finally they were deported back to Mexico! ( and the bond that they paid was FREE money that went back into the jail systems anyways!

We should withdraw them as soon as possible. I know that many people want a phased withdrawal lasting something like 18-24 months. Abizaid also warns against a quick pullout. Here is the bottom line: if we left a year ago there would be a civil war, if we leave tomorrow there will be a civil war, if we leave in a year there will be a civil war. When we leave there will be massive bloodshed, no way to avoid it. There is really no point now in risking more American lives when the outcome is certain.

Go to your county courthouse, go to the clerks office and they have a form for you to fill out. You will be required to pay a fee and they vary from state to state. On the day you are scheduled to appear take any documentation you have and any witnesses and present them in an orderly manner, the judge will assist by asking any questions he may have and render a verdict. Keep in mind that even if you get a verdict the court does not collect the money for you, and usually a judgment is as difficult to collect as it is to get some people to purchase car insurance. A suggestion i would make is to file the claim and then contact some of these judge shows and if you are invited to appear in their forum they will cover your travel expenses and if you win they will pay your suit out of the other persons fee they would receive for appearing.
you know,that's a REALLY GOOD question!!!\ngreat point,you should get involved in your local govt and do something about that!

There are three commonly identified 'levels' in war.\n\nThe strategic level is where national and political goals are turned into military objectives.  At the strategic level most of the decisions are made by the civilian leadership with the military providing advice. \n\nThe operational level is concerned with the maneuvering of armies, fleets etc.  This is all large scale and tends to involve a series of battles in order to achieve an objective set by the strategy.\n\nNow we get to the tactical level.  The tactical level is concerned with how a battle is fought.  This can range from a general deciding where to out his brigades - to a sergeant telling an individual soldier to fire a particular weapon.

The smoking ban went into effect here in Colorado July 1.  You can no longer smoke in a bar, restaurant, or any business.  Friends of mine who are waitresses have seen a huge cut in their income--seems non-smokers don't tip nearly as well as smokers did.  Here in the small town I live in, three bars and two restaurants have gone out of business; the owners have said it is because of the smoking ban.\n\nAs a former smoker, it doesn't matter to me personally.  But, I don't like it any time we lose another little bit of freedom.  Before, it was up to the public to decide--if you don't like smoke, don't go to establishments that don't clean the air with equipment.  The cash register should be the way things like this are decided, not the government.

Written tests are designed to test basic problem solving skills, your knowledge of the english language and things of that nature. Think of them as a modified version of the SAT tests you took in school.\n\nPhysical tests are exactly that. You have a certain amount of time to complete the given task. This is usually a pass/fail type of test.\n\nPolygraph tests are to test your honesty. They ask you questions taken from the background information you give them. Seems kind of unusual to be administered the polygraph this early in the process. In most places in CA it usually follows this format:\nWritten--physical--oral-- background check --polygraph--medical--2nd oral.

I have had apprehension in the mind that perhaps the congress could grant it a status to meet its both ends near the 2009 general elections. \nIn my view,this demand would achieve nothing. it would not only augument the administration budget of government but surely would divide the nation and foment the similar demand in other parts of the country.\nI just put a simple example- we always say unity is the strengh but what we are thinking or doing- Just smashing and crushing that unity amidst some self-inflicted motives.\nIf that area has had some problems then it could be sorted out with a suitable planning.

"Technically, you've served in the military.  So, your honestly answer should be ""Yes"".\n\nHowever, it may impede your chances of employment.\n\nIf you apply of government jobs and you answer ""no"" and they find out otherwise, you can not only face losing your job, but also face criminal fines and/or jail time.  This goes the same if you apply for some government contractor's job.\n\nSome states and with some bigger companies (like Best Buy) can seek charges if you falsified any information on your official application.\n\nServing in the military and receiving an OTH discharge because of being AWOL is just as bad as going to jail or had charges with a crime.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether you finished training or not.  You signed on the dotted line and said I swear/affirm.  The fact that your DD Form 214 or other documents state that you were discharged from military service, shows you had served.  Good thing for you, you didn't received a Dishonorable Discharge (this is worse), instead you got an Other Than Honorable.\n\nIt sucks but it would behoove you to be honest, because at least it will show them you have integrity.  Just be honest and upfront why you went AWOL and why the military was a mistake for you."

Unfortunately, there is some myths mixed in with the facts.  \n\nThe supposed Masonic symbols in the street layout of DC is non existent.  \n\nThere were many Masons involved in the formation of the US government but there were also anti-masons.\n\nThe dollar bill does have an all-seeing eye (a Masonic symbol) but it is supported by an incomplete pyramid.  The combination is found no where in Masonry.  In addition, the design of the one dollar bill was made by a non-mason.\n\nAny attempts to connect the symbols which haphazardly appear in DC (and the rest of the world) are cases of people seeing what they want to see.  Masons feel pride when they recognize Masonic symbols attached to buildings or in artwork.  Conspiracy theorists make up claims to support their theories.\n\nThe fact is, symbols import meanings to the viewer and reveal things only when people look for meanings behind them.  To understand Masonic symbolism one would have to become one or pursue a life long study into Freemasonry.

First I'd like to say, I wish more people like you would come here.\n\nBecause the US is obsessed with competiting with poverty stricken countries.  The less education and job training you have, the lower wage you're willing to take, the better chance you have of coming here.  My husband has a Bachelor's degree and had to take a 12 thousand dollar a year cut in pay to keep his job.\n\nThe value of our home went down several thousand dollars within one year.  Utilites, other necessities and taxes all went up.  45 years of hard work down the drain all in the name of competition.\n\nOur government is working hard to bring in uneducated poor people to work at sub level wages, the goal being to bring our wages to the level of China, India and Mexico.

well first at all i am happy that the American just brought the repugs down from their cloud where everything is extreme and everything requires extreme measures . i believe that even when they ( the repugs ) might had been able to convince some that there is an invasion going on abusing of their ignorance and fears and also of the racism of some the majority of Americans do not want that kind of negative attitudes towards any group of people . i am pleased to know that America is about to change from intolerance to a more polite way of dealing wit every situation .\n\nthe migratory reform is not a simple issue but then again the dems do have a plan while the repugs could not even come together to deal with not only that but with more of one problem , the destruction of new Orleans for example and to  make sure osama was the first priority on the war on terror and so on  . \n\ni do agree with gocart in something Mexico has a huge problem at its hands which is the drug cartels but then again this problem was not created only by Mexico by itself , America must recognize that it is a huge part of the problem and that just by being able to stop the drug traffic and weapons traffic in its own lands a huge number of jobs which are being currently oppressed by pure and crude violence would be created in Mexico , leading to less people wanting to immigrate .\n\na reform can only be positive and can only bring stability between both Mexico and USA and i happily know that the NEW HOUSE and SENATE will be more comprehensible and less judgmental when it comes to people who are just like any other normal person but were not able to find an opportunity in it owns lands just like many immigrants before them , immigrants who are America today .

You didn't mention your state and I believe it varies.  I'm going to assume since you said 'Freeway' and not 'highway' that you are closer to the west than the east, so the speed limit was probably 65, maybe even 70 as I know there are places in CA and NV that have a 70mph limit.  \n\nSo, you are 10 maybe 15 miles over the speed limit on a highway, you also didn't mention how the officer got your speed, again, I'm going to assume it was vascar or something similar.  They are pretty accurate and I wouldn't use that as the crux of my case if I were you.   \n\nThe thing in your favor is that the cop has to show up for his side to be heard so if the cop is busy, is on call, is sick or forgets, you walk.

Show up on time, be respectful of the process, stay calm and answer the questions, treat this like a business matter, it will make you look more responsible, not like some 17 year old kid who drives too fast. \n\nGood luck.
If you paid it, its probably too late.  You should have scheduled your traffic school instead of paying your fine.  The only thing you can do now is call the place you paid your fine and ask if it is too late.
When you live in a country you are not serving the government. The government is not your master. Infact the government is your servant providing you facilities and servicses.\nSo it is better to have two servants then one if you can afford.

"Essentially, this view is based on the fact that the two States have their nominating processes (the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary) at the very beginning. Candidates want to make a good showing here in order to demonstrate that they are viable within their own party. However, I feel it's overstating the case to say they ""choose.....with limited input""  Recent campaigns have not borne that idea out. Voters in New Hampshire and Iowa do not, as a rule, represent opinions and concerns of the rest of the country.\n\nViewed as a horse race, which is how the media cover campaigns and elections, these two States do have an inordinate amount of attention paid to them, again only because they come first in the cycle-------they're the only show in town in the early stages. Most years, they're quickly forgotten once the next round of primaries come along.\n\nThinking back, the last time I remember these States  having real impact was in 1968, when Eugene McCarthy got 42% of the N.H. vote in the Democratic Primary to LBJ's 58%, but that was enough of a shocker to cause LBJ to take his hat out of the ring.\n\nThe reality is,not the early state contests but the wheeling and dealing that bring the foregone results at the National Conventions. You have to go back 46 years, to 1960, to see a Convention where the outcome was in any doubt."
They're probably not going to draft again simply because the question is....what about women? If they didn't draft women it would be insulting. But they couldn't just choose women at random because of the whole mother thing. It's a sticky situation.

You should contact a lawyer.  $600 is totally unreasonable.  I would say that $2500 is the absolute minimum that you should consider.  You have bills for towing, buying a new car, lost work, and medical expenses.  Contacting a lawyer will show that you mean business and maybe will get you a better deal.  If not, I would definitely consider legal action to recover at least your expenses (not including any pain and suffering) incurred as a result of this accident.

"I'm not sure what all the reasons are, or if there is a way to untangle the problem.  Politicians act very much like commissioned salespeople I think.  They keep selling stuff we don't need.  Remember that many things ARE helped by centralization.  I, for one, believe that the entire world should be under the control of one government that imposes anti-murder laws, anti-theft laws, anti-rape laws, and anti-pollution laws, and possibly others.  Centralization improves standardization.  (crucial with the pollution issue)  Some projects cannot be attempted on the scale of the States, but can be accomplished by the central government.  NASA is a good example of this.  The armed forces, the intelligence agencies.  Since these are such a large part of what ""the government"" is, the government tends towards centralization."
"In a civil case, a wife can invoke what is called ""the marital privilege.""  This is different from the right of a criminal defendant's spouse to refuse to testify all together, the ""spousal immunity privilege.""  The ""marital privilege"" applies in both civil and criminal cases.  The spouse still has to testify, but certain testimony will be priviledged. Here are the basics:  \n1.  All confidential communications are privilege.  This mean no third party can be present (with the exception of children too young to understand).\n2.  The parties must be married at the time the communication occurs.  \n3.  There is a split about whether actions observed by a spouse fit under the privelege (i.e. a wife witnesses her husband receiving stolen goods).  This will be up to your individual jurisdiction. \n4. The privilege does not apply to suits between spouses.\n5.  Only the spouses can claim the privilege."
The draft is an excellent idea. Let's make this an equal opportunity war, where the rich and middle class have to go to Iraq to fight and die along with the poor. Let's see these armchair generals & war cheerleaders go out and have to do their share of fighting or send their kid off to fight.

"As a person, I could care less about Bush. As our president, he is in a league of his own. Forget about Iraq for a moment. Where is Osama Bin Laden? Why has he not been captured or killed? He was the person behind 9/11, have we forgotten so soon with the distraction of Iraq? As a president Bush is an absolute failure. Telling America if we don't fight them there we are going to have to fight them here...a crock of bullsh*t. Is all of our fighting over there going to stop some crazies who hate us from attacking us here? If you think so you are as delusional as our president. When my president tells me God is talking to him, it tells me he thinks he can do no wrong. He disregards the constitution, the Geneva Conventions and anything else that gets in his way of being the ""decider"".  I've watched forty-five years of presidents come and go. He rates at the very bottom of the list in my opinion.\nNixon is probably smiling, the heat is finally off of him."

Not sure about KY, but in AL and most other places indictments are handed down from a grand jury who usually hear evidence regarding felonies and determine whether or not there is enough evidence/probable cause to believe the accused has committed a crime.  That would be seperate from simply not showing up for court which is a violation which carries little or no jail time.  Call the jail and see what his charge is and go from there.
She had custody of the child initially because he didn't ask for it.  If he had, then there would have been a custody agreement.  It sounds like one is needed now.  Probably she will have permanent custody & he will have visitation rights.\n\nI sure hope that they can come together & provide the child with a stable and loving home environment.  The last thing any child needs is to have parents fighting over him.  Or should I say, using him to get back at each other.

You can't drop it, it is up to the state to take charge regardless of the incident. Even if it was you who assaulted him it would be the same outcome. They have cracked down on so much of the domestic situations these days in every state nation wide. To many people end up getting killed and hurt very badly after females (males) drop the case. It's just impossible for you to drop it it's up to the state your in to protect you now. Even if you don't want it to happen. It's evident that he needs help controlling his anger and it doesn't mean your a bad person. Hopefully you understand that could have been the last time he ever hit or abused you. You could have ended up in a pine box.

Standard requirements are to be 18 years of age, and either not have been convicted of a felony or to have had civil rights restored.  I cannot buy in to the notion that paying taxes should enable an underage person to vote, as this is not evidence of judgment or experience.  But I will offer the following idea for your consideration: each year, the IRS would publish the median amount of taxes paid; anyone who had paid that much or more -- or who elected to make an additional payment to cumulate to that amount, could vote.  Why? To keep people who earn less from voting goodies out of the pockets of people who pay more.  Such entitiement programs are becoming an increasing strain on the Treasury.
Humans are a very small cost of global warming.  Anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere only account for 4% of all greenhouse gases.

There has been warmer times before.  I don't really know how the scientists can figure out what the temperature was 100,000,000 years ago but i have a graph in my environmental science text book that shows that they have.

I don't support the draft; but it has less to do with my support of Bush, and more to do with the fact that I'm in the military already.  Honestly; and I'm not trying to be rude *smirks*, but I don't want to have to deal with a bunch of whiny draftees that don't give two shits about our country.  I don't want someone who basically had to be forced into military service, watching my back.  The very thought makes me uneasy.  Give me a whole bunch of people who take pride in themselves, our country and joined of their own free will and everything will be great.  Give me a bunch of cowards who don't care about our country...and they might start falling victim to friendly fire.

Everyone is equal to me . \nMiddle Easterners-  have many friends of various decent and yes some are from the Middle East. \nAtheist & non-christians- Not my place to judge. My one grandmother is an atheist and my husband is angnostic and I have my Muslim friends others I don't ask their religion as that isn't my business. \n\nSo sorry but none of that pisses me off.

I am not of the Jewish faith, I do not live in Israel, I am not Palestinian I do not live in Palestine and I am not an Arab.\n\nIf you look at my questions you will see that there are some very interesting answers - some rather pompous and some misinterpreting my question and details entirely.  So many people are judgemental is it any wonder that the grave problems between the Israeli Jews and the Palestinians have made no progress whatsoever?\n\nThe Palistinians know of no other way to fight for their existance against the most technically superior and heavily armed force in the Middle East - Israel.  \n\nWhat other action can they resort to now that will enable them to live freely and justly in the country they reside in other than sacrificing themselves as human bombs?  \n\nIt is tragic that in the 21st Century the political men in the World are incapable of having the courage to produce a solution that will enable Palistinians and Israelis to 'integrate' justly and with compassion.  \n\nI know for a fact that the attitude of the Israeli police and border guards to Palistinians is nothing short of arrogant - even to a British subject on vacation. Palistinians gueue from 2.00 am to cross checkpoints to get to work by 9.00 am - what kind of treatment is that and what kind of behaviour is that? \n\nThe Palistinians organised what was acknowledged as a democratic election - the only problem was that the democratically elected party wasn't the party which other prople/countries wanted.  \n\nThe big mistake the democratically elected Hamas government made was not to renounce 'terrorism'.  What it should have done was to form their own 'Defence Force' in uniform under the authority of the government, made up of those who are trying to preserve the human rights of their fellow men, women and children - so blatently abused by Israel - evidenced by UN resolutions which are ignored by Israel.\n\nAre we expected to forget the virtual wipe-out of Lebanon by Israel just weeks ago - that seems to have disappeared from the media - and one has to ask why - although I suspect we all know that money talks in politics.\n\nMy emotions are mixed - I really would like to think that all the inhabitants of the land called Israel and Palestine could live together side by side in peace.  \n\nThe Israelis may have suffered deaths at the hands of the Palistinian suicide bombers, but the Palistinians have also suffered death by Israeli military forces in addition to the  loss of their livelihoods and their farmland.  At least the Israelis can go about their daily lives and employment - something denied to the Palistinians by the Israelis.

that is not acceptable, the main dealer must get the permission of whoever is paying the bill before any work commences (excluding diagnostics which shouldnt cost over £50) as they must inform you of what is wrong and the cost involved.\n\nwho has the bike at the moment, the main dealer or the repair shop? It should still be at the main dealers in which case you should phone or drop by the dealers and explain that permission was never given by you for the work to be carried out, they can NOT charge you for this.\n\nif the bike remains at the small repair shop then they have already paid the main dealer in order for them to take possesion of the bike - in this case get them to explain why permission was given by them to carry out the repair when you specified that work should not exceed £200.\n\nif you need to you may have to contact the police to regain custody of the bike.\ngood luck.

"How Do You Get Rid of Land Mines?\nThere are movements by the UN, military and civilian groups (about 300 groups in total) to ban the manufacture and use of land mines. The chances are good of convincing First World countries of a ban, but the facts are that the most heavily mined countries are a result of dirty wars, not major conflicts. The majority of land mines have been planted in the last 20 years. Currently, 36 nations build land mines and most countries use them. These countries produce about 10 to 20 million units a year. About 2 million new land mines are laid each year depending on what conflicts are raging. The U.S. budgeted $89 million for land mine warfare in 1996.\n\nThe first task a newly stabilized country faces is cleaning up land mines. Traditional land mines are cleared in a variety of ways. In large open areas, tracked vehicles with flailing chains can clear most mines. In less accessible or poorer areas, the old-fashioned metal detector is used. Some new Scheibel-type models can detect many plastic versions. Some countries use the old-fashioned method of probing at a shallow angle with knives. Sniffing dogs can be used, along with a raft of new high-tech methods employing radar, sonar, thermal neutron, microwave, and even satellites. For now, most mines are detected and dug up the old-fashioned way, by hand or the painful way; by foot. Wildly speculative estimates on the costs to remove the world's land mines come in at about $33 billion.\n\nIn Cambodia, an on again/off again adventure travel destination, estimates hover around US$12 million annually for 10 years to remove the 10 million land mines left from the war. There are a few groups like HALO working in Cambodia, but they still have to put up with being kidnapped and harassed by roque Khmer Rouge bandits. There are 60,000 victims of land mines in Cambodia today, with every 237th Cambodian an amputee. But it is not the pain and disfigurement that ultimately kills. The reality is that unlike handicap-friendly America, losing a limb in the Third World is a fast ticket to poverty, begging, sickness and death.\n\nLand mines can be found in Angola, Afghanistan, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, the Falklands, Iraq, Iran, Laos, Mozambique, Somalia, Thailand, Kuwait and Vietnam. In addition to carefully planted land mines, there is a significant amount of unexploded ordinance in Europe, Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. Don't get smug because you think you know your mines and your history. One mine clearance expert told us they are digging up British Land mines in Mozambique because Qaddafi had his folks dig them up in Libya and sell them to rebels. For those who need to know, there is an excellent book by Eddie Banks titled Anti-Personnel Mines, A Recognition Guide ($120, 512 pages, ISBN!-85753-228-7) sold by Brassey's (800) 775-2518, FAX (703) 661-1501.\n\nOne Small Step... \nIf you can't dig them up and you can't stop them from planting them, what can you do to help? First, write your local and federal politicians to make them aware that the U.S. and its allies manufacture these insidious killers. If you have experience in explosives or mine clearance, read the ""Dangerous Jobs"" section to contact a number of mine clearance companies. If you would like to donate money or time to help the innocent victims of mines, contact EMERGENCY, via Bagutta 12, 20121 Milan Italy (% 39-2-7600-1104, or FAX 39-2-7600-3719), \n\n\nThere were 7 million land mines laid in Iraq and Kuwait before and during the Gulf War. Kuwait spent $800 million clearing out land mines after the Gulf War.\n\nIt costs between $500 and $2000 per mine to remove them. A few years ago, 80,000 - 100,000 mines were removed around the world at a cost of $100 million. To remove all the mines in the world would cost $58 billion. Unfortunately, 2 to 5 million mines are put in the ground every year.\n\nA DP reader who spends much of his time in mined are"
The answer is simple:  Any ally of ours that is caught implementing your described means of warfare, we use a distinct show of force, absorbing as much colateral damage as we see advisable, and immediately terminate the offenders and the alliance.  If you have attacked, encouraged an attack, financed or planned an attack against the US or our allies, we will accept your immediate surrender or be ready to be invaded.  After securing those terrorists who still exist, we tackle war in and of itself.  Through media, common sense, logic and enligtenment, we somehow make peace profitable and convince people to not like money, thereby ending the cause and effect that enables people to distract  us with war.

"""There is another class of coloured people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs, and the hardships of the Negro race before the public. Having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs - partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays. Some of these people do not want the Negro to lose their grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs.""\n\nSounds like Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, Maxine Waters, and Louis Farrakhan to me."

Possibly, if they're in the 500k yield range, that would be 15,000 kilotons detonating or 15 million tons of TNT.   Would that be enough to trigger a nuclear winter?  ....depends.\n\nA Nuclear Winter threshold level of nuclear use is around 100 - 500 warheads, particularly if they are targetted at high carbon targets such as oil installations or coal storage areas.  Prolonged period of cold and dark after nuclear war due to large amounts of carbon particulate aerosols being injected high into the atmosphere would kill most of the earth, i suspect there will be some survivors. ...those in deep shelters with 1-2 yrs of provision or isolated settlements that are self-sustaining.\n\nConsider Tasmania. As an island in the southern hemisphere, nuclear winter effects would be minimised. It has large hydropower capacity for providing heat and power, and the large sheep population could help tide the modest human population through a failed harvest.

"This forum is not representative of the whole population.  A lot of people talk as extremist in Y!A.

When you call 911 you'll most likely be getting the same people at your local PD that would answer if you called the 7 digit non-emergency number. If they ask why you are calling 911 for a non-emergency explain to them the long distance call block on your phone service, they will understand.  If it's an emergency you have nothing to worry about.
MOS = Military Occupational Specialty.. a nice system to label a job in quick alpha-numberic manner.

"When Bush expressed confidence in Robert Gates I cringed a bit remember such things as "" great job Brownie"".\n\nGates has a pretty good resume, and was briefly head of the CIA.

Socialism is a fraud.  Marx and Engels lived off inheritances; there are no traitors to that class, which is proved by the fact that socialists are such bossy snobs.  Aristocracy must be abolished.  Politics, as misrepresented by the choices given to Chavez, is just a food fight in a prep school.  Castro himself came from the upper class--until that automatically disqualifies him because people finally come to the realization that nothing but tyranny and incompetence comes from the spoiled, the South Americans will just bounce between rotten right-wing governments and rotten left-wing governments.  Chavez seems like a typical peasant who has to worship the rich, so when the rich offer this phony socialism he falls for it and the Venezuelans will sink.
There has been a profound disagreement over the correct response to the attacks.  No matter what course the administration took there would have been opposition.  The difficulty has been the secret nature of the attacks.  Before Pearl Harbor there was a large isolationist faction in the US.  No president could get elected, advocating war but after the attack there was almost universal support for war against Japan and ultimately all Axis powers.  The difference was that the enemies were nations who declared war.  It has been very difficult to develop a meaningful strategy agains attackers who operate in secret without alienating allies.  In my opinion the Bush administration could have done things differently to better effect but then some its current supporters would have been opponents.
I think it would be best to contact the Boston Police Department.
Murder a murderer for murder? Not only barbaric, but also illogical. Thank God Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have seen the Light and have done away with this Draconian punishment.\n\nAnd that's not even mentioning the probability of murdering an innocent man (look how many have been released through DNA testing).
Do you think that everyone should be required to serve as a police officer for two years?  How about as a public school teacher for two years?  Most people are not well-suited for these types of jobs either, hence the efficiency and effectiveness in capitalistic job force specialization.  It would be a major dis-service to our country and to her security to force unwilling, unmotivated, and unfit soldiers into our military.
Immigration violations are taken very seriously in the Philippines. Every year, dozens of foreigners pay fines and are put in Immigration detention for breaking the law. Visa regulations in the Philippines change often – be sure to check the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) website at www.dfa.gov.ph frequently for updates. Visitors U.S. citizens do not need a visa to enter the Philippines for stays of less than 21 days. Visitors coming to the Philippines on the no-visa policy must enter for tourism purposes, have a passport valid for six-months beyond their estimated stay and present proof of onward travel.ention.ivileges.\nTemporary Residents If the intended stay is over 21 days, a visa is required. Currently, 21-day visas can be extended to 59 days for 2,020 pesos. Visa extensions can be made at the Bureau of Immigration in Manila or at a regional office. If avisitor overstays their temporary visa, they may have to pay a fine of 1,000 pesos. Failure to pay the fine may result in detPermanent Residents There are many types of visas for permanent residents. \nThe non-quota types are similar to U.S. family based categories. For example, spouses of Philippine citizens are eligible for a 13-a visa, which will give the holder a green card status.

The SRRV is advantageous because the holder receives a permanent non-immigrant status with multiple entry prYour Visa is a very important document.

My father served in Vietnam, has never talked about it and never will.  This is not uncommon for Vietnam Vets.\n\nMy suggestion would be not to push it.

Even though the prosecution in its case in chief can not use evidence illegally seized to convict the defendant, the evidence may be used to impeach the credibility of the testimony given on direct or cross examination.

However, the evidence can be used to impeach defendant's testimony, not one of defendant's witnessess.  \n\nThe exclusionary rule (rule excluding illegally obtained evidence) only applies in criminal proceedings.
Firstly you need to divorce yourself from earth reality, remove all those nasty little reminders that your human, like social friendship and a job.\n\nthen you need to isolate yourself from human contact, I hear the middle of the Gobi desert is a great place for doing this, but you will probably want to live in some great big old forest.\n\nI suggest the the more remote parts of the Amazon may just serve you in your quest to reach Endor's forest moon. \n\nYou might want to take away any similar like minded individuals, so I suggest that spend a year recruiting fellow ewoks at the Star wars conferences, and then go for it, as far away from the rest of us as you can.

I think this is a really excellent question and I'm linking to a law review article on this topic (the link is to a .pdf so be sure you have Acrobat installed before you click).  I do remember that in the Enron case, where Enron's lawyers were filing 200-page pleadings, they actually put a copyright notice on the pleadings!

"Boy. There are a lot of people answering this question who really don't know the rules in this country. I speak from 11 years of law enforcement experience, many of those specifically developing traffic offenses into greater crimes. So people don't think I am feeding you a line of police BS, I included the laws that established each of the rights and reasons to search. Feel free to research them yourself so you can see I am giving you the straight scoop.\n\nThere are many times when the police can search your entire car, including your trunk, glove box, and even locked containers within your car, without a warrant. I'll lay out four of the most common techniques I use to search cars.\n\n(1) Consent. Can't go wrong here. If you ask for consent to search and the driver (or person in charge of the vehicle) gives you consent, you can search the entire vehicle. The consenting party has the authority to withdraw their consent and/or limit the areas you can search.\n\nOn reasons (2) through (4) consent makes no difference. If the police can meet one of these requirements, they will legally search your car with or without your consent.\n\n(2) Probable Cause. If you develop probable cause during a traffic stop, you may search the vehicle without a warrant. This is commonly called the ""motor vehicle exception"" to the search warrant rule. The authority for the police to do so was first established under a US supreme court case called Carroll v. United States. The courts have since expanded on this case and allowed the police to search items within the vehicle regardless of who claims ownership of the items. Under this technique, the police can only search areas where it is reasonable to believe the contraband they are searching for may be found. For example, if the police believe they are lookng for a rifle, they would not be able to search a purse. However, if they find the rifle and now believe they might be looking ammunition, the search of the purse is good.\n\n(3) Pursuant to arrest. If the police arrest you for a bookable offense while operating a motor vehicle, they may search the areas under your control (including the passenger compartment and possibly other areas of the car) for contraband or weapons that you may have discarded. This authority is established under case law named Chimel v. California.\n\n(4) Inventory search - If the police have the authority to tow your car, they may search it under the premise that they need to inventory all items contained within the car prior to towing the car. These searches were upheld under the community caretaking doctrine established under South Dakota v. Opperman.\n\nThere are other ways to get into a car. Too many to go into here. Truthfully, there is almost NEVER a time when the police need a warrant to search a car. In my 11 years, I think I have obtained a warrant for two or three of the probably 1000 cars I have searched, and those cars were firmly secured in the police impound lot pending the warrant."
I have a good idea, instead of paying them any money, work out how much coke,heroin etc that we owe them and inject the lot in one go that should sort out their problem and as a taxpayer I would be happy too...,,,
If the U.S government still ignores the illegal immigration, it will be very hard to enforce the law and order in the major U.S cities. Look at what happened in L.A and across the country.
There would be no lasting damage from the troops being progressively pulled out over a period of time. Although there are certain people who will bemoan that doing so would be a win for the terrorists, it would not be. It is unlikely that terrorists (international ones at least) make up any more than 5-10% of the insurgency in Iraq. The great majority of insurgent fighters in Iraq are from within the country. If the US and its allies were to progressively pull out of Iraq will still training the Iraqi forces and bringing in neighbouring countries to aid with stability there is no reason to believe that the insurgency would not die down and sought itself out. Fighting between Shiite's and Sunni's will not stop because the troops leave, in fact, it may even get worse, but the they have been fighting for hundreds of years all around the world. Leaving the country would however take away a big reason for their fighting in the first place and maybe open up a common ground avenue for them to begin talks to re-establish some sought of working government within their own country.
No, only the military academies have automatic commissions.

Reality. What you find with extreme partisans and I include extremist right wingers as well as the left wing is that when their claims are proved false they just change rhetoric. As to the what they have said before, they will either never mention it again, or deny that they ever said it in the first place if challenged. When denials do not work they resort to the final tactic in their arsenal which is too discredit anyone who doesn't agree as stupid or intolerant depending on the issue.\n\nWow, what short memories some people have. Did those posting that it was never stated live through the eighties? There was constant rhetoric in the media and political circles to this effect. I don't remember how many times a week we heard that Mr. Reagan was just a dangerous cowboy who was going to lead us into a nuclear war with the Soviet Union and that our goals would never be achieved.

In principle the prison authorities are responsible for medical and dental care of incarcerated persons. In fact, most (at least most non-federal) institutions give abysmal care.\n\nIt is well known that states abolished their mental hospitals and now use their prisons instead to warehouse them.

Yes.  If you want to be a citizen you should respect the country that you are applying for citizenship in.  If you move to a country it is very arrogant of that person(s) to think that, that country should bend over backwards to accomodate their wants and needs such as religious orders.  Britain is a christian country yet it has done a lot to accommodate other religious factions,  yet when christians go to some muslim countries they can not practice christianity or drink alcohol because its against the muslim beliefs.  I respect this but believe that they should do the same in other countries. It goes with the adage 'when in Rome do as the Romans do'.  Its about time that people are stopped being seen as racist just because they want their country to think of their wants and needs before the immigrants.  If you don't want to be disliked, join in with the country and speak the local language when outside of your home.  Terrorists who have claimed British citizens should have that revoked and returned to their country but those that were born to that country should serve a life sentence.  Or to upset a lot of people receive the death penalty if they caused the death of others.  Unfortunately that is no longer an option in the UK thanks to the Europe Union interferring again.

If you treat people and this nation like ca ca then expect retaliation  in kind.I love this country and every time I hear anyone say any thing bad or disrespectful about her,it makes me angry.The illegal will talk about that in the future they will be the majority,but nothing is written in stone,something could happen that would render the illegal from reproducing,you could suddenly have a zero birth rate.What happens to your plans for take over then?\nI'm only asking that people think,nothing is for sure but death,and they are postponing it longer and longer.Why not live for today,live for right now .Why not open your heart and your mind to this nation and its people.Why do you hate us so much?America will never be Mexico,never.\nOr any other country that you come from.Its always going to be the United States of America.
Find a range that rents .... always try before you buy ...Glocks are preferred by law enforcement because of the integrated trigger and grip safety ... in short there isn't really a safety if you grip the gun with your finger on the trigger ....because of this there have been alot of accidental shootings .... Why do you want the weapon.....do you have a need to draw and fire quickly (like a cop on a traffic stop) then yes the Glock .... There were shooting incidents where law enforcement forgot to take the safety off ... that's why the Glock is so popular ..there is not lever or button to press the fire ..just grip & go....\n\nI have the seperate safety ... I hate the accidental discharge potential of a weapon I carry on my person..... I prefer to think before I fire.\n\nBut to each his own......\n\nYou do test drive a car before your buy onw right ..... when you invest the money in something for self defence you should know how it works and handles before you take it home!\n\nHappy Huntin'

The need for foster parents is so high I have a feeling alot of agencies have lowered the standards for becoming foster parents. You would think this day and age with the fear and reality  of all the crimes commited against children the standards would be higher, I have no idea if this is true or not. There are many great foster parents that think of the child's welfare before theirs and dedicate their life to helping displaced children. But just like everything else there are bad seeds/people in all walks of life. This country and our current government are in chaos, and every level of the federal government and alot of state governments are full of corruption and incompetence, and the people that suffer the most are the poor and the children.

People need to vote in every election. That way you can get people in that aren't controlled by the party. If you vote along party lines that's all you get. If only 40% of people vote, that means that 60% of the people don't even care who gets elected. How can you have a government that cares about the people if they know they won't vote anyway? The rich corporations will pay them millions to push through their agendas.
I don't know if you are going to find this answer, because everyone gets one vote, and the total of votes should equal the number of voters participating. The only way I could think of would cost you an arm and a leg, because you would have to buy the registered voter lists from all the voting districts in each of the 50 states; and that may not be correct, because they don't tell you if the person voted or not.
you can't print more money and put it into circulation in order to get rid of debt. this is an economics question that a lot of people have trouble with. the best answer can be found at the federal reserve website.
"I read the article, and she seems to forget a few facts ( as people on Al-Jazeera seem to have a tendency to do ), she repeatedly brings up Iraq and I believe the term was the stench of burning cities, the only problem it's arabs not Americans doing the killing and burning in the guise of sectarian violence. Also she seems to have forgotten the fact that Israel attacked Lebanon ""after"" Hezbolla attacked Israel not before. Also she mentions the Middle East as being to ""complex and unruly "" to be governed by I assume she means the western influence, but really all it means is that the middle east is to complex and unruly to be governed by anybody, including them!! no mater how much they try to hide behind nationalism of regionism or whatever you care to call it."

If ever a court lets you plead guilty by post it is a sure sign they don't intend on sending you down :)\n\nYou are likely to be fined - but like a driving offence, it should NOT be something that ends up giving you a criminal record - assuming there was no violence etc at the time.\n\nOf course, a letter of really good mitigation always helps - full of apologies for wasting the courts time - and had it not been for the mad panic that morning / evening when you borrowed your brothers jacket as you had spilled food on yours - and ended up with HIS things but not YOUR wallet etc etc.\n\nDepending on what was told to the officer - and if there is any way of them knowing if you have a card of your own (you picked up your brothers card my mistake) there are possibilities for fairly good mitigation.\n\nOf course, it would only be right and proper to say thiese things if they are true.

Ideally, we vote for the person who's idea(l)s represent that which we agree with, and who will have American citizens' best interests at heart.  \n\nUnfortunately, some politicians say one thing and do another once in office.  Or, serve their own (and their rich cronies') interests at the expense of the U.S.

"I think that as a teenagaer myself, adults help the children learn rasiscm as much as anything.

There's a huge group of us that plays Runsecape, and we use that as the common denominater. If teens can find something in common it doesn't usually matter."

And then they claim he did nothing wrong, as if the mass execution of thousands of Kurds using chemical weapons, interogations before trails where 50 children died, hangings on pregant women, and torture chambers where fingernails are pulled off, drills sent through shin bones and the like, they claim he did nothing wrong as if these things are permissable, and then they get upset when Cheney says it'd do em good, a dunk in the water.  What is their real stance on torture, or do they just ignore the facts

"Becuase the Koran is a Muslim's Holy Book. Personally I think they should just get rid of this ""swearing in on a Holy Book"" entirely. I don't think such a swearing in ever stopped someone from violating an oath of office. Just have them personally affirm that they will obey the rules of Congress and uphold the constitution."
It was simply the electorate balancing the scales. This also happened in '94. That is what is so great about our form of government. The people, although they can be swayed, cannot be swayed forever. There is, sooner or later, a balancing of the governmental process. If one party is becoming megalomaniacal, the people swat it down in favor of a more balanced view. All parties should take heed and recognize their power only extends to the next election.

If you know the name of deceased aircrew then the Commonwealth War Graves Commission site is _the_ definitive source of information since all deceased aircrew are on their lists.  The records will show, the airman's service details e.g., aircrew category, service number, squadron on which when KIA,  home country (often the parents' or wife's name and address), etc. plus the date of death. \n\nFor really thorough details the only way is to visit the Public Record Office, Kew, London and look through microfiche copies of Squadron, Station, Group and Command Operations Record Books (ORBs). These will give details of the crew, their positions, date of operation, target, ordnance carried, crew debriefing or if 'missing in action', etc..  You can also read actual Combat Reports written by fighter pilots and bomber air gunners. There are also bravery award details with copies of 'citations'.\n[ NB To examine all these things personally is free - all you need is a Readers Ticket. Issued on production of some form of ID such as your passport. ] \n\nIf you would like to sit at leisure and read about WW2 aircrew casualties then go to your local library and ask to see the series of books written by W Chorley (and old acquaintance of mine), called  'Bomber Command Casualties in World War 2'.  He has produced a volume per year and brief details of all casualties are recorded by date of operations.

"This WAR is for REAL! \nDr. Vernon Chong, Major General, USAF, Retired\n\nTo get out of a difficulty, one usually must go through it. Our country is now facing the most serious threat to its existence, as we know it, that we have faced in your lifetime and mine (which includes WWII).\n\nThe deadly seriousness is greatly compounded by the fact that there are very few of us who think we can possibly lose this war and even fewer who realize what losing really means.\n\nFirst, let's examine a few basics:\n\n1. When did the threat to us start?\n\nMany will say September 11, 2001. \nThe answer as far as the United States is concerned is 1979, 22 years prior to September 2001, with the following attacks on us:\n\n* Iran Embassy Hostages, 1979;\n* Beirut , Lebanon Embassy 1983;\n* Beirut , Lebanon Marine Barracks 1983;\n* Lockerbie , Scotland Pan-Am flight to New York 1988;\n* First New York World Trade Center attack 1993;\n* Dhahran , Saudi Arabia Khobar Towers Military complex 1996;\n* Nairobi , Kenya US Embassy 1998;\n* Dares Salaam , Tanzania US Embassy 1998;\n* Aden , Yemen USS Cole 2000;\n* New York World Trade Center 2001;\n* Pentagon 2001.\n\n(Note that during the period from 1981 to 2001 there were 7,581 terrorist attacks worldwide).\n\n\n2. Why were we attacked?\n\nEnvy of our position, our success, and our freedoms. The attacks happened during the administrations of Presidents Carter, Reagan, Bush 1, Clinton and Bush 2. We cannot fault either the Republicans or Democrats as there were no provocations by any of the presidents or their immediate predecessor, President Ford.\n\n3. Who were the attackers?\nIn each case, the attacks on the US were carried out by Muslims.\n\n4. What is the Muslim population of the World? \n25%.\n\n5. Isn't the Muslim Religion peaceful? \n\nHopefully, but that is really not material. There is no doubt that the predominately Christian population of Germany was peaceful, but under the dictatorial leadership of Hitler (who was also Christian), that made no difference. You either went along with the administration or you were eliminated. There were 5 to 6 million Christians killed by the Nazis for political reasons (including 7,000 Polish priests). \n(see ""http://www.nazis.testimony.co.uk/7-a.htm...\n\nThus, almost the same number of Christians were killed by the Nazis, as the six million holocaust Jews who were killed by them, and we seldom heard of anything other than the Jewish atrocities. Although Hitler kept the world focused on the Jews, he had no hesitancy about killing anyone who got in his way of exterminating the Jews or of taking over the world - German, Christian or any others.\n\nSame with the Muslim terrorists. They focus the world on the US , but kill all in the way -- their own people or the Spanish, French or anyone else. The point here is that just like the peaceful Germans were of no protection to anyone from the Nazis, no matter how many peaceful Muslims there may be, they are no protection for us from the terrorist Muslim leaders and what they are fanatically bent on doing -- by their own pronouncements -- killing all of us ""infidels."" I don't blame the peaceful Muslims. What would you do if the choice was shut up or die?\n\n6. So who are we at war with?\n\nThere is no way we can honestly respond that it is anyone other than the Muslim terrorists. Trying to be politically correct and avoid verbalizing this conclusion can well be fatal. There is no way to win if you don't clearly recognize and articulate who you are fighting.\n\n\nSo with that background, now to the two major questions:\n\n1. Can we lose this war?\n\n2. What does losing really mean?\n\nIf we are to win, we must clearly answer these two pivotal questions:\n\nWe can definitely lose this war, and as anomalous as it may sound, the major reason we can lose is that so many of us simply do not fathom the answer to the second question - What does losing mean?\n\nIt would appear that a great m"

The Police will make sure that he is sober before they charge him.  He will learn his lesson though because he will know lose his licence.  It will have to be returned to the DVLA.  He will have to take it to Court with him when he attends.  If it is a new plastic licence he will have to take the counterpart paper bit with him.  The Magistartes have guidelines to follow depending on the level of intoxication.  When he goes tell him to say that he could lose his job without his licence and this could seriously affect his livelihood.  Tell him to be really remorseful about the situation.  This may lean the Magistrates slightly!\n\nIf he goes on the Drink Drive Rehabilitation course he will get a third of the time taken off his ban.\n\nMay I say that many people will knock him but it takes your body 1 hour to disperse 1 unit of alcohol and you start counting 1 houtr from when you last drank.  Many people don't realise that they are still over the limit the next day when they drive their cars. \nIt is my view that more education is needed to teach people the facts.  Many people who have been caught drink driving are VICTIMS due to this fact.\n\nI am sure your boyfriend is not a bad person, just a little foolish.  Thank god he wasn't involved in an accident, maiming himself or others, because that would be hard to live with!
I've been wondering that very same thing.  It's not like they fill out a survey or even report themselves on a census.  Someone in the immigration forum even went so far as to say that 96% of them are Mexican!!!  I got a good laugh out of that one!  As if everyone coming up from the south is Mexican!  I guess they don't realize there are other countries below Mexico just as impoverished and willing to travel long ways in terrible conditions to try to find a better life.

I don't know if we should have gone over there to begin with, but either way we can't pull out now. In two weeks the Iraqi government would be overthrown and the country would serve as a safe haven for terrorist. And one thing I try to keep in mind is that the CIA does not tell us everything, and God knows there may have been other reasons for this mess than we realize. I look forward to the next decade and seeing some of this stuff come into the public view.
Let's put it this way...a guy was arrested for pointing a laser pointer at airplanes as they took off or landed. Some pilots were affected. I don't know if he is still in jail or not.\n\nI would suggest growing up, and getting stupid ideas out of your head, since a laser can burn the retina, thus blinding somebody.\n\nWould you like your vision robbed of you by some idiot?
This is the problem.  When you steal something you do not respect it.  If you are always given something without having to earn it or work for it through the proper channels then you do not appreciate it.  You have no idea the value or worth of what you have.  This is why legal immigration is so important.  My Mother earned her Citizenship in this Country.  She had to go to school and learn about our Government and take a test and after she passed the test it still took eleven years for the Government to send her her papers in the mail.  She was very proud to be an American.
"I know you are receiving negative responses to your question, but I side with your Lawyer, you see, this is only the Beginning, you could have problems from that ""fall"" for a lifetime. If your own insurance company found a ""loop hole"", maybe your Lawyer has also! Just as long as he will NOT charge you, regardless of the outcome, what I mean, if you loose, so does he. If he wins, you both win. Make sure of this, and get his ""commission fee"" in writing. It could be as high as 50%. So be careful. I would, if it were me, get a medical statement as to your prognosis and go from there. In other words, if the prognosis is that ALL is OK now, Move ON, if it doesn't - take your Lawyer's advise. Not All lawyers are money hungry. I am a Paralegal, and do Tenant/Landlord cases for FREE for people in need  and so do several of the Lawyers I associate with. See a doctor first and go from there. Don't see a Plastic Surgeon, See a Oral  Surgeon and an Orthopaedic Surgeon. These are the Specialists that will determine future problems, if any! Good Luck"

"He has run out of ""straw dogs"" to fool us with on this one, so he has been forced by the election to get closer to the truth.  This has always been about oil, plunder, greed, and power, and now Bush is using the threat of terrorists getting the oil instead of him and who he represents, as if that would make a significant difference to us at  the pump.  We will always pay more, no matter who has the oil.  What a cynical ploy for a very  cynical puppet figure."

Basically Use Form W-7 to apply for an IRS individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). An is a nine-digit number issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to individuals who are required for U.S. tax purposes to have a U.S. taxpayer identification number but who do not have, and are not eligible to obtain, a social security number (SSN).\n\nThe ITIN is for federal tax purposes only. It does not entitle you to social security benefits and does not change your immigration status or your right to work in the United States. Also, individuals filing tax returns using an ITIN are not eligible for the earned income credit (EIC).\nSSNs. Do not complete Form W-7 if you have an SSN or you are eligible to obtain an SSN. You are eligible for an SSN if you are a U.S. citizen or if you have been admitted by the United States for permanent residence or U.S. employment.

Mexico has had similar problems in the past and has survived.  True Obrador has not accepted his defeat and the street talk is that he may have good reason. PRI has a history of dirty politics and although I do not condone this, PRI does provide stability which is much needed to invite investments.  I love Mexico and have lived in the Yucatan for ten years and will return soon.  It is very peaceful in the Yucatan and the current violence in Oaxaca and San Cristobal does not reach the Yucatan.  Does it not seem odd to you that the PRI won by only 1% of the vote and then refused to do a recount but only a partial recount?\nMexico is not a joke.  Mexico has not invaded any other country.  Mexico is not responsible for mass wars and mass destruction.  Mexico in more ways than the US offers more individual freedom.  Where I have lived and will again return it is peaceful, lovely and loving.  Qualities which I have not found plentiful in the US during my current visit.  Yes.  The Cartels need to be stopped.  They are to be feared and their damage to Mexico is extensive.\nI would not apologize for your native homeland.  I've been throughout most of Mexico and have found the people generous in ways that most Americans who have so much more materially would find unthinkable.

Sorry dude, I'll have to answer you in English and just hope you can read this.  I am a liberal who usually vote Democrat.  We, at this time do not officially have a 1 vote lead.

"Usually they are separate, but there are some states that house those inmates with the rest. That decision depends on the individual inmate. Just because someone was criminally insane at the time they committed the act does NOT mean they are still insane. Infact, if you are found criminally insane you are, essentially, found ""not guilty by reason of insanity"". The court does NOT have to take any further action and can release the individual back to society. After all, they are ""not guilty"". Now, if you have a CONVICTED person who is later deemed ""insane"" they can be housed with the ""general public"" in the jail, or they can be moved to a secured facility such as an asylum."

"Sure,  I'll help you.  I did some research on that same topic a few months ago.  What I found will curl your hair.  Here is a quick summary of what I found.\n\nMost all the evidence that is available to us, show that the WTC buildings were rigged with explosives. Our own government had motive as was well as an opportunity to do this crime. Here is the evidence, presented for your scrutiny. \n\nFAKE CONFESSION\nThe official government story is that the 9/11 attack was orchestrated by Al Qaeda, which is lead by Osama bin Laden. The proof our government provided was a video with Osama confessing to the crime. The problem with the video is that the person in the video does not look like Osama bin Laden: See picture.\nhttp://911blimp.net/vid_fakeOsamaVideo.shtml\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk519bkcLjg\n\nEVIDENCE\nThere are many other factors that do not fit the official story. They include, secondary explosions that were seen, heard, reported, and recorded by firefighters, in and around the WTC buildings.\nhttp://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=-4574366633014832928&q=firefighter+bombs+in+the+building\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcRs1fv8i3I\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHz9YWVgJWM\n\nHere is a video clip showing a trail of explosions just before the destruction wave.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_DkzhonpGY&mode=related&search=\n\nMolten, beyond red hot, ""steel"" was video recorded coming out of the South Tower just before it collapsed. Jet fuel does not burn hot enough to turn steel to liquid.  Melted red hot steel was also found in ""ground zero"" of all three WTC buildings, including WTC7; the one no jet ever hit.\nhttp://youtube.com/watch?v=ExrVgioIXvk&search=thermite\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3D2myMbQjQ\n\nFORENSICS\nA chemical analysis of the solidified molten iron,conducted by independent firms, yielded an explosive, called Thermite. Also found was a WTC core beam; most probably cut using the demolition cutting charge (Thermate). No core beams were left standing beyond a few feet high, for it to have been cut by an Iron Workers torch. Click on pic. to enlarge.\nhttp://portland.indymedia.org/en/2006/06/341238.shtml\n\nCONFESSION \nWe also have a video recording, where owner Larry Silverstein, admits to demolishing WTC7.\nhttp://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7750532340306101329\n\nTESTIMONY\nThere is also a problem with the Pentagon attack. Listen to this retired general, He says, ""The Plane does not fit the hole; so what did hit the Pentagon...""\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2VoUN-7RVU&eurl=\n\nThis video still shot shows the top profile of a small craft hiding behind a call box. Some say it resembles a U.S. military Global Hawk:  Whatever it is, it is not big enough to be a Boeing 757.  See time = 00:28 through 00:35.\nhttp://membres.lycos.fr/applemacintosh2/Pentagon2.htm\n\nMOTIVE\nThe New Conservatives (Neo-Cons), with the help of their friends, started planning the invasion of Iraq, shortly after Pres. Bush took office. Apparently, the plan would include the attack of the WTC buildings. It did this to get the support of congress and the nation, to attack Iraq. Read it from their own PENAC document. Pay special attention to the section entitled ""Creating Tomorrow's Dominant Force"" page 50 and the top of page 51, where it states we need a new Pearl Harbor attack to get the ball rolling.\nhttp://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf\n\nOPPORTUNITY\nWitnesses saw a work crew going into the WTC buildings with rolls of wire, supposedly for internet upgrades. Tenants were moved around while crews ""upgraded"" the cable systems. The Port Authority cut power to the building for a whole weekend, just prior to the attack; shutting down the entire security systems. Witnesses also heard crews operating heavy hammering equipment that left a gray cement like dust, in the building. This activity took place just weeks before the 911 attack"
"I Believe that when a crime is committed because of a racial difference, then of course the offenders hatred should be brought to light. And Yes, violent crimes can be committed out of ""love"". I'm sure you've heard about stalking. In some cases stalkers have been known to kill or attempt to kill their prey.They do it because they can't have that person, so they kill them  or attempt to kill them so no one else can have them. I used to live in the Mid-South, near a Klan ridden town. It was shameful watching the havoc they wreaked on innocent people.Hate crimes have been around since the Germans tortured the Jews, it's nothing new.

No, inciting violence and disturbing the peace are crimes.  Those people who commit these types of crimes would be arrested.

"Technically, ""fiscally conservative"" means that he believes in the original designs of our founding fathers in terms of how much control of our money the government is allowed.  Our federal government should be primarily set up for protection and infrastructure.  It should leave the other stuff to the states. \n\nTo be socially liberal, you would have to believe that the constitution does not specifically give enough rights to certain peoples and must be amended to include such rights.  Historically, these rights are things like abortion, gay marriage, women's rights, and perhaps even such things as the separation of church and state (which is not stated in the constitution -- it merely says that ""Congress shall make no law"" governing religion)."
Love some of the uninformed answers here. The fact is inspectors confirmed before the war started that 98% of Iraqs WMD's had been destroyed, and the US military in charge (Zinni) of containing Iraq said even if he had them, he could not have used them because we were watching and could reach anyplace in Iraq in 15 minutes with bombs. Don't find that on Rush and Beck and O'Reilly though do you?

I don't know the 'by land' route, but at my work they just sent out an email stating travel to canada and mexico requires a passport,  the email states:\n\nNew 2007 Passport Requirements: \n\n \n\nU.S. citizens planning for their travel in the new year should be aware that effective 8-Jan, 2007 passports will be required for air or cruise travel to Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico, Central and South America and Bermuda. All children regardless of age (including newborns and infants) must have their own passport.\n\n \n\nhttp://travel.state.gov/passport/passport_1738.html
As far as I understand, it's okay to enter on a 6 months visitor's visa.  In fact, it is now possible to enter the country on the visitor's visa and THEN apply for permanent residency using the family class.  Apparently it is even faster this way.\n\nIt makes sense, as long as you are clear to immigration that you are entering the country as a visitor and are prepared to depart in six months if your permanent residency doesn't come through.  But if you declare at immigration you are intending to reside here, and you don't have your permanent residency yet, that may pose a problem for you at the border .\n\nMy father is entering this way and has communicated with Canadian immigration to confirm this is okay.  But please don't take this as advice, just anecdotal experience.
Iran is next
Ummm... I'm going to ignore the Trolly aspects of this post and answer it as if it were a real question.\n\nA lot of Americans do, yes, but more of them don't. It's funny to me that the foreign perception of the United States is of a bunch of religious zealots just because our president happens to be one. Turn it around: Americans don't assume that all French are corrupt, all Russians are borderline fascist, all Iranians are fundamentalist nutjobs, all Bolivians are coca farmers, all Egyptians are Arab nationalists, or all Finnish people look like Conan O'Brien. Back when the Taliban was in power, we recognized that not all Afghans were radical Islamists. That's why we allied with the ones who weren't.\n\nSo why is it so hard for the rest of the world to see America as a country of individuals?\n\nI think a large percentage of Americans (probably about half) believes that God has blessed us. I am one of those people. But within that group, there is a large portion that believes those blessings are not guaranteed. When America turns its back on God - as I believe it has under the current administration - I believe God will turn its back on America. He already did once before, in the 1850s. We continued to enslave our fellow men, and we were engulfed in civil war as a result. Those lessons seemed to be lost until last month.\n\nIn the most recent election, an overwhelmingly large majority of Americans voted against the Republican party. Many of those voting against them were, in fact, Christians who are sick of seeing our religion exploited by people like the president and his allies. We don't have a problem with wars of necessity like Afghanistan... but we do have a problem with being lied to, told that we were in imminent danger when we in fact were not.\n\nThere is nothing Christian about the war we waged on Iraq. Their dictator was a horrible man, and he deserved to be deposed, but the violent and haphazard way we went about it has cost the Iraqi people a great deal of suffering. Will God punish us for it? Undoubtedly, he already has. Will he punish us more? I hope we can use the 2008 election to turn the direction of the country around, and regain his graces.\n\nYes, there are American Christians who consider our blessings an inalienable right granted by God in exchange for, I don't know, being a democracy or something. I've never really understood them.\n\nBut there are also American Christians who believe that God will only be on our side when we are the good guys, not just the lesser of two evils.\n\n(P.S. We're not going to apologize for Korea. Go to South Korea, then go to North Korea and try to tell us what we did was wrong. And as for the Philippines, we inherited them from another power, developed their government and infrastructure, and then gave them freedom. Sure it took a while, but I'm not sure how we compare negatively with any other colonial power in history.)
I doubt strongly that they'll change it anytime soon, however it's an antiquated law. Just like an age requirement. Theres no reason for it, if a person is a citizen they should enjoy equal rights.
"Well the premise in the tv shows is that the accused officer now has the time and the motivation, and they are further driven by anger and a need to prove their innocence.  And yes, it is one of the most over-used plots for cop shows.\n\nIn real life if you tried to follow up on anything especially a case that you were involved in prior to your suspension, you would find yourself in jail for obstruction of justice, or stalking the witness/suspects who got you in trouble in the first place. Additionally, you could be charged with carrying a concealed weapon, since you wouldn't have the right to do so off duty. Also, when you hand in your badge, even if it is for a suspension, you are told you have no police powers, so if you pulled a gun on someone or took them into custody or even said ""I am Officer (or Detective) _______"" you could be charged with impersonating a police officer. \nInternal Affairs may also assign a detective to keep an eye on you and make sure that you don't try to follow-up on anything and that if you do, they are there to put a stop to it and take you into custody. \nFinally, if the real criminal is someone in public office, what usually happens is the accused officer (or his attorney) can use the press to bring that person down. \n\nNow, what sometimes happens in ""real life"" to good cops who are falsely accused is:\nThey wait until their suspension is over, they gather up all the evidence possible, they either retire or leave the department, and then they write a book about what really happened. \nOr, if they are fired, they can write about it right away, unless there is some type order that stays in effect after the incident.\nOr, they can personally sue the public official or executive for damages, prove their innocence in civil court and get a nice fat settlement, then go on to write the book.\nMaking money from the incident can be far more satisfying than putting the executive or public official in jail."

"Every UCLA alumnus should call the UCLA President's office (310-825-4321) and let Pres. Robert C. Dynes and Chancellor Norman Abrams know that you will withhold all contributions until the police officers are fired.  \n\nA university is usually far more tolerant and respectful of students' rights, and far more restrictive on police brutality, than outside the university gates.  In Mexico, police are not even allowed inside a university gates unless specifically invited in by the Chancellor.  Having worked in universities for the past 20 years, I can safely say the behavior of the UCLA PD as exhivited in the 6-minute video (not 10 seconds) is inexcusable.  They could have dragged the guy out, let him scream all he wants.  If he resisted phsycially, they could have handcuffed him -- for 200 years our police did not need tasers or pepper spray to handcuff people.  (Maybe he was already handcuffed when they Tasered him, which is even less excusable.) \n\nThere is a big difference between being tased once (often by a low-voltage) in a test situation and having it done to you multiple times in a row in a hostile situation.  There have been 73 deaths associated with tasers between 1999 and 2004.  Even police officers in five states have sued Taser International claiming they ""suffered serious injuries after being shocked with the device during training classes.""  http://orlando.injuryboard.com/defective-products/an-alternative-to-the-defective-and-deadly-taser.php"

"The only person I can find tied to the quote is supreme court justice Clarence Thomas.  His complete quote is, ""No government can blatantly favor one faith or church over the others, or favor belief in God or the Supreme Being over non-believers.”"
I'm not sure if he was the last but the last one I remember was Nicolae Ceausescu, President of Romania who was shot on Christmas Day 1989 during the revolution of that year.  He was executed immediately after the trial and footage was actually shown on BBC television that day.

Abortion is acceptable to most people if it happens because of:\n\nRape/Incest\nBaby will not survive after it is born\nMother's life is at risk if baby is born\n\nI do believe that abortion should be legal, with the exception of late-term (this is currently how it is now.)  I do NOT support abortion as a form of financial or birth control, as some use it for, and I would like to see children adopted instead, but I realize not everyone will be willing to do this, and may find other, less-satisfactory ways of aborting the baby.\n\nAbortions now are regulated and licensed.  If abortion were illegal, I do fear that back-alley abortions may start up again.  And if one woman is forced to do this, instead of going into a clean facility with properly-licensed people, and ends up getting a disease or dying from a improperly-performed procedure, that's one too many.\n\nTherefore I do believe that abortion be legal, safe and RARE.
the whole thing could have been avoided with a living will but that being said the investigation into her collapse and coma was not properly done. the fact is her husband was the only one who seemed to think she would have wanted to pull the plug, despite her strong catholic beliefs which clearly are otherwise. i find it strange that on at least two occasions he tried to 'pull the plug' and it was reinserted. the problem with this case is do you see a feeding tube as extraordinary care...now consider those who have had throat cancer, strokes, or any other condition that warrants a feeding tube. the other thing too is her family was willing to take on the financial and emotional burden of her life and he refused. why? why also did he purposely deny her own parents the right to see her before she ultimately died? i say that is cruel and considering there was no clear wish made by terry herself of her wishes it really came down to the word of her parents and her obvious religious beliefs and the word of her husband who had children with another woman and was living with her for over 10 yrs. why did he not just give full custody to her parents and family and move on with his life? one thing that out to be considered with removing the feeding tube...the husband thought that it was cruel to have her in the state she was in but removing the feeding tube and not allowing water or food is a horrendous death and not easy or peaceful. i am hopeful that the truth will come out one day and that her husband will be held accountable. he is not a nice guy and has a history of lying and cheating which leads me to believe he would no doubt lie to protect himself and lets face it, he had no love for her what he wanted was for her to die so that she couldn't ever talk and of course there is the book deal.

Well then dont try to buy any  lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, green beans. peas, apples, pears, oranges, lemons, limes, or mangoes. Dont try to get a reservation at your local restaurant or hotel. There are no rooms there either no one to clean them. Mow your own grass and clean your own pool, cut your own flowers and  trim your own hedges. Then you can dig some ditches and maybe after we will treat you like scum for a while so you start to understand.

The earliest recorded official contact between China and Rome did not occur until 166AD, when, according to a Chinese account, a Roman envoy arrived in China, possibly sent by Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Remarkably, that was the only contact between the two great powers of which a record survives. The Romans referred to the people of the remote east as the Seres—the silk people. But that term could have referred to the Central Asian tribes whose trade with the Chinese no doubt included silk—which the Romans long thought grew on trees. The secret of silk production reached the West only in the sixth century, from the Byzantines. \nIt may well irritate some of the proud custodians of China's cultural heritage that it was foreigners who first promoted the theory of the Roman settlement. Homer Dubs, a professor of Chinese at Oxford University, raised it in a lecture delivered to the China Society in London in 1955. According to Dubs, the journey to Gansu began in 53BC when Crassus, who together with Julius Caesar and Pompey formed Rome's First Triumvirate, decided to make up for his lack of military glory by going to war with the dreaded Parthians.\n\nDubs says the Chinese kept the ex-legionaries as frontier guards, installing them in a specially created town called Liqian in what is now Gansu\n\nCrassus's legions were no match for the Parthian archers, nimble horsemen who could loose their arrows off even as they turned. Of the 42,000 Romans who set out, 20,000 were killed and 10,000 were captured in the battle of Carrhae, in modern Turkey; it was one of the most spectacular losses of Roman military history. According to Pliny the Elder, the Roman prisoners were used by the Parthians as guards on their eastern frontier in what is today Turkmenistan. From there, Dubs conjectured, some escaped and joined the Huns as mercenaries. In 36BC, Chinese troops on a punitive venture defeated the Hun ruler Zhizhi in today's Uzbekistan. Among their captives they found 145 Romans. Dubs says the Chinese kept the ex-legionaries as frontier guards, installing them in a specially created town called Liqian in what is now Gansu.

i do believe so.
I'm not quite keen on small arms but this is what I know between these two guns:\n\nThe AK and the M16 are a product of different philosophies and needs the USA and USSR were going through. The USSR was constantly in combat in 300 meters, and thus needed faster weapons. And because of the fact that it was a large-conscript based Soviet army, they needed guns that were cheap, reliable, and easy to use. The AK is known to work perfectly even under the dirtiest conditions the gun has gone through.\n\nOn the other hand, the US army preferred Lighter weight, accuracy and ergonomics. Thus came the accurate, semi-auto M16.
Hopefully he'll shoot himself in the head this time.
It depends.  Your DD Form 214 needs to have the right Reentry Codes (you will need to see the recruiter).\n\nSecond, you need to be within the age limit required.\n\nThird you need to look at the pros and the cons (which means talk with the recruiter).\n\nThe Navy (currently) will might give you the your Air Force rank if you are/were SrA or below.  SSgt and above 90% chance you will start at E-3 or E-4 (which depends on your Navy job you get).\n\nThe Army will most likely let you keep your rank.\n\nBoth Navy and Army will only have a real hand full of jobs (like six or less) available for you.\n\nIf you're active duty Air Force and have at least three years of service, and have an Associates Degree or at least 90 semester hours of college, you could become an officer (butter bar:) in the Army.  It's call Operation: Blue to Green.

"Earmarks are funds assigned to certain projects that are attached to a completely unrelated appropriations bill. Say a bill is being passed that puts 25 more police on the streets in DC and say at the end of that bill there is a paragraph that says 1.5 billion dollars goes to the state of Alaska to build a bridge that goes to a city with only 50 ppl in it. (true recent earmark btw)\n\nWhen that bill passes, the earmark (funds) are approved.\n\nEarmarks increased from 1,300 in 1994 to 14,000 last year = $27 billion... so much for conservatives believing in small government and fiscal responsibility.\n\nThere are a few more facts worth noting:\n- Earmarks are also used to buy votes on legislation. Say a congressman is not wanting to approve a bill. They will approach that congressman and offer him x funds to be added to that bill as an earmark if he will vote for it. This happens a lot.\n- Bush recently asked congress to give him line item veto power which would allow him to cross out specific earmarks only without vetoeing the entire bill. That scares the heck out of me because I am sure he would only cross out democratic earmarks or use it to punish ppl who did not obey him.\n- There is a senator named Tom Coburn whom is notorious for bringing to the congressional floor earmarks. By him bringing them up for a vote, it 'outs' them.\n- This point is VERY IMPORTANT - whichever party has the majority controls what earmarks go into legislation. This means that right now democrats have been literally shut out by the republicans from getting funds to their democratic districts. It is my belief that this is Bush's way of punishing democratic districts.\n-The majority leader makes the final decision as to which earmarks are allowed... there is no vote on it... nothing. Most of the time, nobody even knows about them which means a lot of the time congressman will vote on a bill that has this pork attached to it and never know they are approving it.\n- There is currently a bi-partisan effort in washington to pass what is called the Pork-Barrel Reduction Act. This legislation doesn't stop earmarks but rather, it brings them out into the open.\nhttp://www.thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/021406/news1.html\n\nCheck out this PBS Now video. It is short and you will learn a lot.\nhttp://www.pbs.org/now/politics/earmarksetc.html\n\nThere is a group called Citizens Against Government Waste that print annually print a book called ""The Pig Book"".

Because it's there. Donut shops have a long tradition of giving donuts and coffee to police for free. This tradition has become practice because donut shops open so early in the morning they used to be targets for hold ups and other crime. Having the cops around deters that kind of thing. In the wee hours of the morning, the donut shops are often the only business open, the cops might as well be there as anywhere.

It is altogether possible that the US would have blown up in a Civil War over this (Monarchists vs. Republicans). At this point anything could happen. But let's assume two things: that the monarchists won the battle, and that the basic constitutional rights of the people were preserved in the Bill of Rights.\n\nIf we accept both of these, I think in the long run, the monarchy would have been disestablished and replaced by a republic. As America grew in the 19th century, the population moved westward. It was far more independent minded, less inclined to be deferential, and altogether wedded to notions of basic equality. And I think that old Jeffersonnian spirit would have appealed to them more and more. The ""Republican"" party would become more popular, and eventually, I believe, the monarchy would have been disestablished.\n\nBut of course, that is only one scenario of many possible outcomes. \n\nGreat question. Cheers, mate."
Ireland, the IRA was/is the militant branch of Sinn Fein, a Politically recognised party of Ireland, in fact when Sinn Fein set up the Assembly of Ireland there were attempts to officially recognise the IRA as the army of Ireland. Despite being part of a relatively credible political party, the IRA performed many acts of political terrorism, including the infamous Brighton bombings.\n\nNote that this is also labelled as 'Geurilla Warfare' by some commentators, to be fair the idea of Political Terrorism depends on your point of view i suppose

Nice.\n\nSeriously though, the population problem is not as simple as space for people to live on. People also require arable land to grow their food, access to clean water to drink, and other resources. \n\nWe could plunk the teeming masses of India or China into the open spaces of northern Canada or the Sahara, but if that land can't support agriculture and has only a limited amount of water, it won't do them very much good.
The United Nations do not keep a standing miltiary force.  All the soldiers deployed under the UN flag are put forward by member countries.\n\nTo be on a UN deployment, first of all you must join the military of a member nation.  \n\nThen, you have to either volunteer or be selected for UN duty by your chain of command, however high that winds up on going.  Only then do you get to wear the sky-blue helmet, beret, ball cap or what have you and be kept under the most stringent rules of engagement you can imagine. \n\nMost deployments are either humanitarian in nature or unarmed observers.  High-profile missions like Rwanda are a rarity and no one really wants those.  I have afriend who served in Rwanda under Canadian General Romeo Dallaire (upon whom the 'Canadian Colonel' in Hotel Rwanda is based).  Like the good General, he came back pretty messed up.  \n\nAnd note that UN duty is hard work in very dangerous situations, in which you might not even have a weapon to defend yourself with.
The polygraph examiner will ask a series of Yes or No questions based upon the information they have about you, or to get information out of you.\n\nThe test is pretty accurate.  They worse you feel about the event the greater the chances something will register if they ask have you ever stolen anything, or have you ever committed a crime.  if they ask about it be honest, that you shoplifted some stuff as a kid because you felt peer pressure.  Tell the truth but don't volunteer extra details.
I'm sure there are people who are; after all, it's a career just like anything else--with an added patriotic benefit of being able to say you serve your country.  But just like other people get burnt out of being architects, lawyers, etc., some military people can also reach a point where they would like to leave the military and do something else.  It doesn't make you a whiner or a traitor--you probly just need a career/lifestyle change.  Don't let some of the responses here get you down--I appreciate your service and if you are 'sick of being in the military' then just finish out your time and try something else!  The world is a big place with lots of opportunity...

Many politicians today are career politicians. Their motivation and the decisions that they make owes more to whether it will serve them well personally, rather than what might be in the best interests of the country. This current Government has forgotten that it is there to serve us, and not to set up a left wing totalitarian regime, which seems aimed more at destroying British culture with its obsession with PC, minorities, immigration, and the eventual handing over of sovereignty to the EU. We have never had a government so absolutely determined to destroy the traditional English way of life. Unfortunately, the process has been going on for some time, aided and abetted by indoctrination from left leaning teachers/lecturers, and not forgetting the biased TV media.
"Aw, you can't be that dumb...you're smart enough to live in Canada, eh? \n\nCongress refers to the full legislative branch of government, we have a bicameral Congress split into the Senate and the House of Representatives, (""House"" for short.) There are two senators from every state for a total of 100 senators, giving each state equal representation in senate, while the 435 Representatives, or congressmen, are divided into districts according to a state's population. (So Alaska has only one representative, while California has 53.) Mid-term elections are the elections that take place right smack in the middle of a presidential term. We vote for ALL of our congressmen, who serve only 2 year terms, and a third of our Senators, who serve 6 year terms. We also voted for various governors (terms vary by state,) city council members, state laws, and town ordinances. \n\nThe Democrats do indeed now have the power to change things. Bush still has the ability to veto, but with the Democratic majority share of both the House AND the Senate, hes going to have to go along to get along. The biggest change that will happen now is that Congress (meaning both houses,) will cease to ""rubber stamp"" everything Bush proposes. Thats been the case for the past few years, with not so much as a meek protest emerging from the Capital building when Bush cuts taxes for the rich or sends more of our boys and girls to die. So...no more of that. Its a new era, and I can't tell you how happy I, and everyone that I know, truly is to see it ushered in."

Americans have just lost the loyalty of American businessmen who would rather get filthy rich then show their patriotism by employing fellow Americans.

"It depends....\n\nYou don't say what state you're in.  I succesfully fought a speeding ticket in California.  It took a lot of time and effort and was rather confusing at times, but I prevailed.\n\nI prevailed because the officer at trial didn't provide required documents to prove that the road upon which I was cited wasn't an illegal speed trap.  That meant that the officer was ""incompentent as a witness"" to my speed, and that the court was ""without jurisdiction"" to find me guilty.  (That's in the vehicle code; I didn't make it up.)  Police officers need to follow the rules, too...\n\nIf you're interested in fighting your speeding ticket, look up books from Nolo Press (www.nolo.com).\n\nI fought the ticket because I had nothing but time and nothing to lose.\n\nKeep in mind, in some states, if you go to traffic court and are found guilty, Traffic School isn't an option.\n\nOften, traffic school is the best option."
"They have staff consisting of many people whose sole job is to educate themselves on the issues and condense those and inform the politician.

Both.  But mostly a message to the GOP.  \nThough I am not pleased with the way Iraq has unfolded, I'm more concerned about corruption and greed.   Do I believe the GOP has a monopoly no.  I believe that power corrupts and we should vote out again sooner than later as a rule.
"Per your additional comments, let me add an explanation. You're quite correct, there is no law compelling anyone to say something political -- that's why it's political. Moreover, I agree with you; I too have no doubt that Mr. Rangel was serious in everything he said. What I meant was that members of Congress often say things in a more overblown way to secure a more favourable bargaining position vis-a-vis the opposition. \n\nIf I know I'm in a strong position (and Mr. Rangel believes himself to be in the proverbial cat-bird seat) it's quite normal for me to ask for far more that I think I can get. And this is true for a variety of reasons:\n\n1. It allows for greater flexibility in the negotiating process (more room to manoeuver).\n\n2. It affords the person the luxury to make more trivial concessions and appear as one attempting to be statesmanlike and bi-partisan, (thus shifting the blame for failure onto the other side).\n\n3. The possibility exists that the other side may just cave in and give me whatever I want. So I might as well ask for it.\n\nBottom line, though, regardless of sincerity, take every statement every person in Congress makes as the staking out of a provisional position always subject to renegotiation. And that's what I meant about his MUST in this situation. He must do it because he's a professional politician, and asking him not to think politically is like asking a fish not to swim.\n\n==============================================\n\nPlease understand that what Mr. Rangel says, and what the Congress will do are entirely different things. For political reasons he HAS to say what he said. However, if the Democrats regain Congress (or at least the House) they will attempt to undue provisions of the tax code such as the estate tax and other features deemed to be aimed the wealthy, which in purely economic terms, will have a dampening effect of the economy.\n\nWithout a doubt, the single most difficult fact of public finance to get across to people is the understanding that the burden for the heavy taxation of the wealthy disproportionately falls on the middle class and working poor. People either cannot, or will not recognize it.\n\nConsider the new taxes imposed in the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990. As part of the new taxes imposed by Congress, the law imposed a 10% luxury tax on high ticket items such as private jets and yachts. While many in the working class and the poor cheered because they thought that finally the rich are going to have to pay, they were wrong. The rich did not pay -- everyone else did.\n\nBecause the rich believed the tax was unfair they simply refused to pay it. They canceled contracts for new jets and yachts. The bottom line was that ship-builders throughout New England were forced to close down. A great many hard working men and women who worked in these yards were thrown out of work, and subsequently went on public assistance. So who was hurt? The Rich? No. The working class got hurt.\n\nIn a post-expenditure analysis the GAO reported that the tax generated about $75 Million, but cost the government about $125 Million from a combination of reduced revenues and increased outlays to take care of the newly unemployed.\n\nThere is a simple proposition in taxation policy that (if it were possible) I'd gladly tattoo on the forehead of every single man and woman in government (federal, state and local)\n\nTHE EFFECTS OF TAXATION ALWAYS FLOW DOWNHILL.\n\nIf you overtax corporations -- consumers pay higher prices.\nIf you overtax the wealthy -- the working class pays.\nIf you overtax the middle class -- consumer buying dries up.\n\nUnfortunately, Modern tax policy isn't about raising revenues anymore; it's about making sure one's constitutents feel good that ""the other guy"" is getting stuck with the bill. The answer, of course, is tax equity; but in these days of polarized politics, what should be a policy based on reason and sensib"

Impossible to say. You can't predict the future. However, if you put the question in a historical context the majority of the answers to your question will be 'NO' because he was knocking around only 60 years ago so lots of people remember first hand what happened.\nThe Romans were a pretty bad bunch too, invading countries, making people slaves, killing millions, persecuting the christians etc. If you ask whether the world is a better place because of the Romans the answer would probably be 'YES'.
Before tax, remember your base pay is the only pay taxable, all the other benefits such as quarters pay, subsistence pay, uniform allowance lodging, overseas pay, combat pay, etc are not taxable.

"To answer your question: a TRUE republican does respect black people and their culture.However, alot of conservatives that CALL themselves republicans do not. But don't be fooled; a closet racist is not a TRUE republican.\n\nI'm sure you know that Abraham Lincoln, the president who freed the slaves, was a replublican. However, did you know that the Republicans in the senate at the time of the civil war/reconstruction were even more tolerant then Lincoln? They advocated such ""radical"" proposals as a 'freeman's office' to help get the newly freed slaves on their feet, give them jobs and ensure a right to vote. Their major opposition after Lincoln's death was Lincoln's democratic successor Andrew Johnson.\n\nImmediately following the civil war, many congressional districts in the south went to black candidates (all running under the republican banner.) However, the KKK and other terrorist organizations (many affiliated with the democrats) soon put an end to this early success and it was another 100 years before blacks began to once again recieve true political rights. \n\nSo what about the civil rights movement of the 60's? A purely democratic movement? Not true: the legislation of the late 1950's through 1960's was largely bipartisan and many forget that it was president Dwight Eisenhower (a republican) that helped foster the earliest, and some might say most crucial beginnings of school desegregation in the south.\n\nThe southern realignment of the early 1970's shifting many of the racist southern democrats (or 'dixicrats) to the republican camp is also widely misconstrued as a ""switching places"" of the two parties.\nFirst of all, only a minority of congressmen held these views and that minority (which is now nearly 100% dead or retired) cannot be called TRUE republicans, since they essentially jumped parties. Second of all, the voter shift in the south can hardly be chalked up to purely racial views, there was a lot of unrest (due to the vietnam war, poor economy, etc) that caused all kinds of demographics to 'switch sides.'\n\nToday, politics is undoubtedly more bitter and hateful then ever. Both parties are guilty of this and race is often brought up as an issue. However, it would be unfair to stereotype either party as not 'liking another race.' So, take this history into account. \n\nPersonally, I come from Kansas where the head of the republican party happens to be an african american, and he's as TRUE a replubican and as strong a leader as I've ever had the honor of meeting."
At minimum, the death penalty.\n\nHowever, I think in such cases, the victim's loved ones should be allowed to choose the manner of death. If they want it to be painful and take a few weeks, that's fine by me.
Officially a General is not allowed to state his true opinion on such a matter while still serving.\n\nAs for politicians the way to tell if they are lying is to see if their lips are moving.
Why not?  Most countries operate their immigration policies based on things like keeping families together, bringing in skilled workers to fill shortages, and such.  If someone fits this criteria we should welcome them with open arms.
The vast majority of draft bills are NOT passed by both the House and Senate without some sort of modifications.  Any speculation as to the requirements, punishments, and deferments of the final law based on what this first draft bill says is VERY premature.\n\nAnd that's if the draft bill passes at all.
I am a Christian and I know God gives life and we should wait on him to take it from us..However, I think it should be but only in certain situations. If a person is terminally ill I think it's only humane.When a person is in a lot of pain, you can only give them so much pain medicine and then they still suffer.Then you get into the fact that some families just will choose it because they don't want to take care of grandma/parents anymore. I think it should be legal but should have restrictions.

The technology now shows that if you let someone get that big a foothole the devistation will be catostorphic.\n\nthe other problem is the world has gotten so pc you cant take care of problems until you have a concreate case which by my statments above show that is impossible.

hey right now my husbands doing time in a state prison it sucks but about your friend if they have where they can work day for 2 days then he wont be surving the full sentence although there is a such thing as a judicial release basically he has to serve 30 days in state prison no jail no correctional facility he has to be in prison for the 30 days then his lawyer can file a judicial release but that means he could be on parole for like 5 years,or house arrest.Most of the time at least where my hubby is the judge is a bitch and on top of that a dyke so shes pretty hard on men and hasnt gave a judicial in like 10 years although we filed i even wrote a letter to the judge but  did me know good im sorry to hear about your friend i know it sucks but if they did the crime they will do the time but i would check into the judicial realease what was the charge anyways casue that also plays a big part if he is harmful the society they wont even consider it until a parole hearing has come up and about appealing it you better have damn good evidence as to why he shouldnt be there and be able to prove his innocence cause if you appeal it and the judge still finds him guilty they can up his time it all depends on the judge i hope my advice helps you good luck and tell your friend to hang in there it will go by fast is it there first time being incarcerated i know my husbands not going back he dont belong in there hes not no convict well he is now but hes nothing like the people there murders,child molesters shit like that thats sad he got caught with a stolen 4wheeler and got 6 months but the good thing about it he gets out on my b-day jan. 15th i cant wait ok well good luck

"Fifty percent feeble-mindedness, fifty percent the morbid nature of the Republican paradigm that can and does bed down with fascists for a buck. Such as when President Bush's grandfather supplied Hitler with at least a third of his war machine until an act of Congress (Trading With the Enemey Act) put an apparent stop to the Bush family's putrid plans for that time period. It's a paradigm issue with Republicans. Democrats tend to believe in the social contract, that we are stronger as a nation when we empower each other and conduct our government for broad social benefit rather than for individual benefit. Republicans, on the other hand, operate from a lower level of human development where individual empowerment means ""survival of the fittest"", ""a sucka's born every minute"", ""dominion over the planet means plunder rather than guardianship"", ""them first so that their ""superior"" genes survive"", genecide, rigging elections, lying and torture are ok if it means their survival"" sort of reasoning and so-called ""values"". They have never believed in the American Dream. Since the beginning of this democracy, the dream to be free and have a fair chance has been under attack by the Conservative's belief system. Republicans and Conservatives do not believe in the U.S. Constitution, unless it serves their self-interests. They have never been real Americans. Real Americans believe in free speech. Conservatives/Republicans do not. They deleted this entry as quickly as it was posted yesterday. Real Americans look out for each other's rights in our pluralistic society. Conservatives do not. Conservatives do not care for anyone but themselves and their own viewpoints, their own religions, their own bank accounts. That is their platform. They would have the rest of us put down like animals or enslaved if they could get away with it. They are not believers in the common good. They plunder, even from the weak. They do not care about their own neighbors or their own communities or people who are different than they are. They prefer to live in gated communities and build massive fences and walls. They relentlessly strive to disenfranchise as many people from the American Dream as possible. They fought against Americans who wanted slavery abolished. They fought against black Americans who wanted to vote. They fought against female Americans who wanted to vote. They fought against Americans who wanted to keep church and state separate. They fought against older and disabled Americans who wanted American public restrooms and sidewalks to accomodate wheelchairs. They fought against American workers who wanted a decent minimum wage and a forty-hour work week. They fight to this day against poor people by refusing to raise the minimum wage yet voting themselves raises in legislative bodies. They fought against American children and forced them to work like slaves in factories and mines. They fought against American children and spent our money making arms dealers rich while taking money away from the public school system. They fought against working American mothers who needed equal pay and decent childcare. They fought against hungry American babies and slashed preschool nutrional programs for the poor. They fought against pregnant poor Americans and slashed prenatal care programs. They fought against American healthcare professionals who were struggling to stop the spread of AIDS and they blocked the distribution of condoms that would have saved millions of American lives. They fought against American homosexuals who wanted to be able to rent a house or an apartment and live together in peace. They fought against American police organizations that pleaded for a ban on the guns that slaughter police officers and over 40,000 Americans every year.

If the two former inmates/probationers are family members, it usually isn't a problem.  If not, it probably won't happen, since the standard conditions prohibit felons and/or offenders from associating with one another.  It's really at the discretion of the probation officer.
My mom was around Christmas, they said there was an arrest for back child support! They put her in a Federal prison 3 days. Then dragged her all the way up to IN. Guess what no was no warrant!!!!They couldn't even find the paper work! The best part, she just found out she has been paying child support for 2 kids who haven't lived with there dad for over 3 yrs! I wonder if her ex will get in trouble for lying in court? That's IN the majorly corrupt!!!!!!
Strange set of morals they have: Pro war. pro death penalty, pro-big business, pro religion in government. Anti-science, anti-education, anti-civil rights, anti-poor, and anti- anything that looks even vaguely progressive.

No. You might say he's his own foot; and he's always \ngot it in his mouth.
are you including government parks and such things like that?  As of 1997 it was 21%.  We have closed bases since then so that number is now probably less.
No, there are laws in the lawbooks that make it illegal.  But without the amendment, those laws are wide open to lawsuits.  Anyone can bring a complaint forward and have those laws scrutinized and possibly wiped from the books.  THEN same sex marriage will be possible in AZ.\n\nHopefully one or more brave homosexual couple will come forward demanding equality.  Then it will have to be decided if the current laws the prohibit same sex marriage are valid and just.  These kind of laws have been struck down elsewhere.  I'm confident it can happen again in AZ.
The teacher was on trial, accused of having sex with a minor, she was filmed on a mobile phone by the pupil giving oral sex, she claims he held a screwdriver to her head whilst this happened although I don't think the screwdriver was visible in the video.  The trial didn't prove she was forced, just that the jury wasn't convinced beyond reasonable doubt that she was guilty.  If you took the boy to court the jury would probably clear him for lack of proof also.

Republicans are more conservative, meaning they do things the safe way, when democrat is more liberal and a democracy.
Well living in Britain where the 3 'main' parties are all left of centre and trying to ban any party that even thinks of slipping over the centre line towards the right, it becomes a difficult question. However I would vote for any party that would give the power back to the British people, ban 'political correctness' and bring back common sense! So I guess that makes me a +10 and a racist......or at least it does in Blair's Britain!
"To begin with, this wacko in Congress will NEVER get the draft reinstated.\n\nHowever, there are loads of women who choose to join the military.  Why should we force the women who don't want to or are too ""girly"" to go?  Keep it just men with the women volunteering.  I attempted to volunteer for the service right out of high school but failed my physical due to a heart condition that I didn't even know I had.  I wanted to fly!  and yes, I'm a woman.  But I know many women who would NEVER make it in the military.  Just leave it volunteer and we will have a stronger military than countries who require service from their young men."
the people who read this in the entirety and see that death is not the goal you are right... but the fact is there are groups that dont read this as the way it is intended.  the Islamic religion has been hijacked by extremists.  Just like in catholic history people took liberal translations and ran with them but they were put down.   They caused death but their technology was limited.  Now the technology is not limited.  so put the two together.  Hijacked religion that can be interpreted as kill and the ability to get weapons to destroy the world.  Then read teh new testement with the Idea that they also believe Abraham was Muslim.  you cant deny facts no matter how hard you try.  sticking your head in the sand (metaphoric or physically) doesnt make this threat go away.  the Political correctness is trying to hide the facts but it must be rebeled.
Ooooo, ooooo, I know this one, people that voted for him on 04 are ashamed of themselves and do not want to advertise that they did.
I think that this a race by race election, and the DNC won't have to do ONE thing in order for ALL races to end up for the DNC.  Just race by race the candidiates are going to have to figure out what is relevant to the voters.  And right now they have a huge lead by NOT being republicans.

As long as there is Israel and Palestine, they will be fighting. Neither is right as far as I can see, this conflict goes back thousands of years. To be fair, look at your source; Al Jazeera saying negative things about israel is about as shocking as Fox News ripping on democrats.

"A Communist state is a state governed by a single political party which declares its allegiance to the principles of Marxism-Leninism. The term Communist state originated from the fact that most of the states in question were or are run by parties that called themselves ""Communist Party of [country]"""
The word originated in British Parliament when five ministers of King repaired to a small side room(cabinet) for discussion before facing Parliament.In any democratic govt cabinet minister is appointed by Head ofThe State( king,or president) on recommendation of Prime Minister,if there is one.Where there is no such provision(u.s.a)  President appoints but subject to the ratification by Senate. \nThe cabinet minister is responsible for performance of his dept.He is answerable to parliament/assembly for his dept/minisry.Also he attends cabinet meetings and participates in decision making process of govt.even inrespect of other minisries. Also he is accountable to parliamentary committees where depts are discussed thoughourly.He represents his country in interaction with other countries
The limit to the president's term is 2 terms in office according to an amendment to the Constitution.  If you are asking will a republican win, it depends who the candidates are from both parties.

"Stalin literally starved millions of his citizens to death, withholding and confiscating grains and other food. These were his ordinary citizens, most commonly the peasants, so religious denomination had nothing to do with it. In that time frame and location, most would have been greek orthodox. \n\nSome stats:\n\nEarly researchers of the number killed by Stalin's regime were forced to rely largely upon anecdotal evidence, and their estimates range as high as 60 million.[13][16] But with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, hard evidence from the Soviet archives finally became available, and such estimates became more difficult to sustain. For example, the archives record that about 800,000 prisoners were executed (for either political or criminal offences) under Stalin, while another 1.7 million died of privation[citation needed] or other causes in the Gulags and some 389,000 perished during kulak resettlement - a total of about 3 million victims.\n\nThus, while some archival researchers have posited the number of victims of Stalin's repressions to be no more than about 4 million in total [15][16][17], others believe the number to be considerably higher. Russian writer Vadim Erlikman,[18] for example, has made the following estimations: Executions 1.5 million, Gulag 5 million, Deportations 1.7 million (out of 7.5 million deported), and POW's and German civilians 1 million, for a total of about 9 million victims of repression.\n\nSome have also included the 6 to 8 million victims of the 1932-33 famine .[18][19][20] But again historians differ, this time as to whether or not the famine victims were purposive killings - as part of the campaign of repression against kulaks - or whether they were simply unintended victims of the struggle over forced collectivization.\n\n\nEDIT: As for Stalin being a jew, you are quite incorrect.\n\n""Joseph Stalin was born Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili in Gori, Georgia, Russian Empire to Vissarion Dzhugashvili and Ekaterina Geladze. In 1913, he adopted the name Stalin, which is derived from the Russian stal’ (Russian: сталь) for ""steel"". His mother was born a serf."""

Well, in order of sucession, it is the Speaker of the House.  Sucession, meaning that if the president and the vice president were both wiped out in a freak accident, the Speaker of the House, right now, Dennis Hastert, would become president, per the constitution.
I think Guns -n- Roses should stick to love ballads and drug anthems. \n\n Bush is an idiot if he really believes that you can force democracy on people.  It can't be done.  \n\nThe democracy in Iraq thing was never more than a backup excuse (and a lame one at that) for invading on the false pretense of the US being in imminent danger of Iraqi WMDs, anyway.

It depends on what the board has done. If it is a matter of being dismissed you need to consult with your union representative. If it is a matter of the board not answering your questions in an open and fair way you have a couple of options. First contact the superintendent of the board and advise them of your concern. If this doesn't work you can go to the director of the board of Education and be sure in both the above cases you have witnesses and documentation to back up your claim.
I really don't know. Probably lots of things to go through. Call your leaders that are in politics. In U.S. we have a state capitol buiding we can call or they can refer us to someone.

They are politicians, and politicians are all the same - self-centred, and self-serving. They probably sleep fine, because they have no moral fibre.
Who your heart tells you to vote for, not what I tell you or anyone else on this site tells you to.\n\nI personally am voting Libertarian or Democrat if Libetarian isn't an option.
I vote for the person I think will do the best job. In 2004 presidential elections, Michael Badnarik was the best man for the job and I voted for him. Locally, I just today had a Senate candidate come to my house to introduce herself and answer questions. She answered all of my questions about her policy, I will definitely be voting for her regardless of party affiliation. \n\nI fail to understand why people HAVE to be one way or the other. Whatever happened to using common sense and voting for the candidate best able to perform the job? I know that answer already, it was replaced with blindly voting for your party's candidate regardless of policy or personal preference.\n\nAnd I very much disagree with the Libertarian = Democrat thing people have going on. Its not the world vs. the Republicans people, its a democratic election which means every vote gets counted.
Grand Old Party - It refers to the Republican Party
I would not vote for Bush. I do believe that the cards were stacked against him because during the last 6 years so many unpredictable events have taken place.   Although I am a staunch Republican, I believe he made the Iraq War a personal issue and the US should not be there.  I support our troops and I appreciate their dedication to our country and I really think Bush should bring them home.

"For historical reaons unclear to me, the Chosen Soren (the ""non-governmental"" North Korean Assn) has represented a substantial portion of the ethnic Koreans in Japan. In other words, these ethnic Koreans have chosen to affiliate with the North rather than the South.\n\nA third state cannot force the nationality of a first state to those whom a second state consider its nationals.\n\nJapan does not easily grant its nationality to ethnic Koreans, nor to the children born in Japan to ethnic Koreans.\n\nEssentially the problem arises from (1) Japanese national exclusiveness and the unwillingness of many Japanese to marry Koreans; (2) Japan's sorry, in fact more than sorry -- nasty and vicious --  imperial past; and (3) the inability or unwillingness of the Koreans and their offspring now in Japan to leave. (And why should they? Their ancesters were brought there during WW II as slave labor, or otherwise involuntarily. Compare the Turks in Germany whose ancestors were recruited for factory jobs after WW II, when so many German workers had died in the war. And also the pre-reversion two German (FRG/GDR) nationalities.)"

Did he (your mother's spouse) sign anything at the hospital stating that he would be resposible for the medical bills?  If he did then a prenup can't help.  Honestly, prenup or not his credit can be at stake here if they own a home together.  A lien can be attached to the home and even if the lien is entirely in your mother's name, you father could still have to pay off the lien with interest and court costs and attorney's fees before selling or refinancing said home.  Its called a lien on real and personal property.  \n\nI would just make payment arrangements with the hospital and dutifully pay it.  If your mother is not in the position to do so, maybe her spouse will lend her the money and she can pay him monthly or add to the pernup that he gets something equitable in return, in the event of a divorce.\n\nOnce again, I REPEAT, if he did NOT sign ANYTHING at the hosipital then he is can NOT be held financilly responsible in most states.\n\nGood Luck and Take Care
"I agree and my vote will reflect that displeasure with this government.I see nothing wrong with having a ""Let Take Back America for Americans Day"" We could march in the streets,go to Washington DC,wave the American flag and voice our concerns for this nation.A day without Americans might convince people we are serious.\nOf course with out legal Americans this nation would come to a stand still wouldn't it.Maybe that is a good plan,maybe then the illegal alien Will realize that without us there is no America .\n\nStop the old tired we are all illegal because  (BS)that's just a lie,no laws equal=not illegal\nlaws =illegal.I know that's VERY hard for some of you to understand but it is a FACT.And we All know that the Indians were NOT indigenous to this country\nAnd yes we do own this land its been bought and paid for with the blood of our ancestors.And I own my land that I paid money for here in Arizona and no one is going to take my country or my land away from me."
No one with full knowledge that the unborn is a person would then kill it. I am pro life, however i believe someone would have to be pretty sick to commit murder, therefore at least in the mothers minds they are not committing murder. I feel sorry for the mothers, they are told their child is not a child, made to feel that abortion is the only way out, robbed of being a mommy, blindly being the cause of their own baby's death, and lied to about the hideous, long lasting after affects of abortion. Instead of giving them a hard time u should give them sympathy and prayers. that's what being pro life is all about, love of life.

I think the Government needs to clean up the mess they have let happen. It might be to late. I was just at a Wal*mart in Las vegas, first of the month you know, I thought I was in Mexico.\n Hundreds upon hundreds of illegals and their babies. Shopping cart filled to the max with food that American tax payers are paying for.\n Think about that every time you get your pay check....Mexicans eating at your expense, they live 15 to a house and you and I are footing that bill too, then they work under the table and pay no taxes, then send their money to Mexico.\n Lottery, how about finding another country to move to where the Government cares about its own people!

No, it was not appropriate for him to announce his disappointment to the American People. He should have kept his personal feelings to himself and publicly supported the outcome. Because he has to work with these people for the next two years and he shouldn't start making waves now.

I say ""our money"" because it is the money of America...and our government is a part of, not above, the people. If anything, they should be below the people, because that is the true idea of a democracy.  Government appointed by the people.  People who should have the final say. And this has gone on for many years, if not centuries.  We need another Revolution similar to what our founding fathers were part of.  That is what our contry needs to move forward.

So what if the south won the war is the question here.\n\nWe'd be a farming nation and economically challenged socialist and less a world power than say Canada.

"A glide bomb is an aerial bomb that is modified with aerodynamic surfaces to modify its flight path from a purely ballistic one, to a flatter, gliding, one. This extends the range between the launch aircraft and the target. Glide bombs are often fitted with control systems, allowing the controlling aircraft to direct the bomb to a pinpoint target.\n\nThe first glide bombs were developed by the Germans during World War II as an anti-shipping weapon. Ships are typically very difficult to attack: a direct hit is needed to do any serious damage, and hitting a target as small as a ship was difficult during WWII. The US felt the solution was massive fleets of bombers dropping a huge numbers of bombs, leading to the development of the B-17, but the Germans instead concentrated on making the bombing itself much more accurate. At first they used dive bombers with some success in this role, but their successes were countered by ever increasing anti-aircraft defenses placed on the Royal Navy ships they were attacking. By 1941 such attacks were still just as difficult as ever, but the added defenses made such attacks almost suicidal as well.\n\nThe German solution was the development of a number of radio controlled glide bombs. These were constructed by fitting a control package on the rear of an otherwise standard bomb, starting with their 100kg armor-piercing bomb to create the Ruhrstahl SD 1400, commonly referred to as the Fritz-X. The bomb aimer dropped the bomb while the aircraft was still approaching the ship, and guided it into an impact with the target by sending commands to spoilers attached to the rear of the bomb. This proved to be difficult to do, because as the bomb dropped toward the target it fell further behind the launch aircraft, eventually becoming difficult to see. In addition it proved difficult to properly guide the bomb to impact as the angle of descent changed, and if the bombadier didn't ""get it right"" and end up with the bomb roughly right over the target, there was little they could do at late stages to fix the problem.\n\nNevertheless the Fritz X proved useful once crews were trained on its use. In test drops from 8000m, experienced bomb aimers could place half the bombs within a 15m radius and 90% within 30m. Following the capitulation of Italy in 1943, Germany damaged the Italian battleship Italia and sank the Roma with Fritz X bombs. Attacks were also made on the USS Savannah, causing heavy damage, and on several transports off Anzio. HMS Warspite was also hit, had to be towed to Malta and was out of action for six months. Fritz X attacks also damaged the cruiser USS Philadelphia and sank the British light cruiser Spartan.\n\nA more useful weapon was the Henschel Hs 293, which fitted a set of small wings to the guidance system to flatten the trajectory and make the system easier to guide. On release a small liquid fueled rocket fired to speed up the weapon and get it out in front of the bomber, which was aimed to approach the target just off to one side. The bomb then dropped close to the water and glided in parallel to the launch aircraft, with the bomb aimer adjusting the flight left or right. As long as the bomb was dropped at roughly the right range so it didn't run out of altitude while gliding in, the system was easy to use.\n\nDesign work started as early as 1939, and a version of the guidance package mounted to standard 500kg bombs was tested in September 1940. It was found that the bomb was unable to penetrate a ships armor, so changes were made to fit an armor-piercing warhead before the system finally entered service in 1943. The basic A-1 model was the only one to be produced in any number, but developments included the B model with a custom armor-piercing warhead, and the C model with the conical warhead that was designed to hit the water short of the ship and then travel a short distance underwater to hit the ship under the waterline.\n\nThe Hs 293 was first used operationally"

Believe it or not, I have always said that. The government is the reason that we don't get ahead, too many politician competing with each other. Instead of looking for the welfare of their country. I feel ashamed of both parties, I do vote, but I vote for the candidate not for a Republican or Democrat. Even though that still doesn't help much. But the little I try to do, makes me feel better. Great question, hope you get a lot of different answers.
"Gun control had never worked.  Please provide a link so that your ""proof"" can be seen.  Assault weapons have been illegal to own since 1968 (unless you get a special class III license from the B.A.T.F.) so I don't understand your problem there.  You need to read the book by John Lott .  ""More Muns, Less Crime"".  Also,  the FBI recently did a study that shows that from 1991 to 2005, Americans have bought 70,000,000 guns, yet crime, since '91 has decreased by 38%.  I can't find this study on-line, I read about it in a magazine.  Concealed carry works also.  Florida's 2005 murder rate was 58% lower than in 1986, which was the year before Florida adopted (wisely) Right to Carry laws.  There are already many laws  to keep the wrong people from buying firearms.  The problem is that for some reason, criminals will not obey the law!!  They keep acquiring guns illegally.  So more laws are obviously not the answer.  Laws only affect the law abiding.  And by the way, I am NOT a conservative.  But, I believe that since guns do not kill, people do, then people should take the responsibility and the punishment, not guns."
Probably because America hates veterans but loves money!\n\nYou in Da Nang?\n\nJH, you might argue, but those ARE the FACTS!!\n\nBush sent the military into combat ill-equipped, unarmored Hum Vees, and families had to send their own children body armor that cost's $600.00! What did you do about that JH?\n\nBush likes vets so much he cut widows benefits to those whose spouse was killed in Iraq by 1/2, what did you do about that JH?\n\nBush cut Veterans hospitals by 8 BILLION in his 2006 budget after flat-lining them for 4 years! And that is after 3 years of people coming home missing arms and legs! What did you do about that JH?\n\nBush tried to cut Combat Pay to the military in Iraq but was not allowed to after the firestorm!\n\nThe government stonewalled vets from service connected disabilities for PTSD, Agent Orange and Blue! It took them 40 years to find the link between cancer and the defoliant’s, but that didn't stop people from dying of cancer or committing suicide! Where were you on that one jh?\n\nThe government denied there was anything to the Gulf War Syndrome and denied service connected disabilities! Guess what? There is A Gulf War Syndrome! Meanwhile vets were living under bridges! Where were you on that one jh?\n\nThere will be one from Iraq, mostly from enhaling depleted uraranium used in shells? There is going to be a lot of cancer that the government is going to deny they had anything to do with! Where are you going to be on that one jh?\n\nThe government was charging military who got ourt of the service for lost body armour in Iraq! $600.00 is a lot of money, especially because they had to cut it off you after you were wounded and it was soaked in blood! How you stand on that one jh?\n\nMilitary who were wounded in Iraq and many months later discharged from Walter Reed Hospital, were given a bill for their food when they left! Sen. Clinton had that changed! Where did you stand on that one jh?\n\nYou really think Bush cares about Vets?  Do you think the majority of the people care about vets? Go to a Memorial day parade sometimes JH! Going to Walmart to buy a yellow ribbon magnet made in Japan for $4.99 and putting it on your vehicle is  NOT supporting the troops jh!!\n\nCome sit on my side and see how your views might change, especially if you were wounded and then given a discharge from the service to go to an understaffed, underfunded VA. JUST LIKE WE DID! I have a Purple Heart and a Purple Heart plate on my vehicle! You want to know how many times people have approached me to even say hello? I can count them on 3 fingers! What do you yhink about that jh?\n\nI bet you did nothing to support the troops, but plenty to clamour for the continuation of a war that was lost in 2003! Am I right jh?

After marriage you will need to file for Adjustment of Status (Form I-485) to receive your Permanent Resident status.\n\nAnd yes to some extent you will be put under a microscope.  Once your AOS application is processed, they will schedule an interview for you and your spouse.  You will be required to submit evidence of a continued and genuine marriage such as financial documents in both names, utility bills in both names, shared credit cards, pictures, letters, etc.  The USC will have to submit an Affidivat of Support (Form I-864) to show that the foreign spouse will be financially supported and not become a public charge.\n\nIt's really not as daunting as it sounds.  If the marriage is genuine, its not difficult at all to prove it.

"Really we only have two very general choices. \n1) Stay until either the country is secure, or their own domestic army can protect the country;\n2)Pull out prior to 1)\n\nThe problem with 1) is how will we know when the country is secure? Insurgents claim they will fight till the US leaves, and the US says it will stay till the insurgents are defeated. Seems a bit of a quandry eh? And by who's view of ""secure"" is the litmus test? By Iraq's standard? By the US's? Make no mistake that those are very different conditions. The US faced the same choice in Viet Nam.\n\nThe problem with 2) is when do you pull out? Right away? Gradually? From where? Chances are as the troops pull out, fighting will get more intense and country wide panic will set in. For comparison read up on the pull out of Viet Nam. It is the spectre of those images, of people crushing against the gates of the US Embassy; of those people running up the stairs of the embassy roof; and of those helicopters being pushed into the sea as more helicopters with evacuees arrived that haunt the US conscious, and exactly why the administration won't think of pulling out. If we pull out one also has to wonder what it was all for? Why did all those soldiers and civilians die if we weren't going to stick around to finish it? If we were just going to pull out then why didn't we do it earlier? It also opens up the administration to charges of incompetency. It will never happen.\n\nAnd as a side note, its getting a little tiring to see all the Republican kids come on here and spout mis-informed opinions (probably because they heard their parents say it). Democrats are ""anti-military."" Tell that to the Democrats that fought and won World War 2. That was a pretty big anti-military operation there...Dem's also won World War 1. Dem's fought (under UN action) the Korean War. Dem's started Viet Nam escalation (not exactly a crowning achievement but certainly not ""anti-military""). It was a Republican that pulled out of Viet Nam. It was Republicans that attacked Panama, Grenada, and Iraq.\n\nSo before you characterize all Democrats by one loud mouth (it would be like me characterizing all Republicans as big-eared coke-heads that can't talk in complete sentences based on Bush) that can't get a joke right, let us review the parties and the countries they have fought:\n\nDemocrats:\n1) Germany x2 (at the height of their military power)\n2) Japan\n3) N. Korea (and China later) (won then fought to stalemate)\n4) Viet Nam \n\nRepublicans:\n1)The US (Civil War)\n2) Viet Nam (lost/pulled out)\n3) Panama\n4) Grenada\n5) Iraq\n\nWho do you think is better with the military?\n\nTo Whip: What does military service have to do with anything?

"Totally irrelevant.  One of the lamest of the lame ducks, ever.  9-11 was the high point of his administration, without it he'd never have been re-elected, never able to play the FEAR card at will, never able to (temporarily) win the support of other nations....and never able to reach a roughly 85% approval rating.\n\nAnd then in a few short years later, BAM.  Zilch.  Endsville.  \n\nThe ""war on terror"" has only inspired more terror.  Bush's approval ratings are in the toilet (about 33% approving, and those are die-hard right-wingnut jobs) and many of his original cabinet have left.  His stance on Iraq and homeland security handed over Congress to the rival party.  Despite accusing John Kerry of flip-flops, he's welched on social security reform, immigration, steel tariffs, the Dubai Ports deal, and the justification for invading Iraq.\n\n3000+ American personnel are dead, in a war even Kissinger deems unwinnable.  The deficit is horrendous.  And many of his supporters are now tied to lobbying scandals or various other forms of tyranny or corruption.\n\nLong story short -- he's a joke we played on ourselves.

Neither is correct.  It is just the personal philosophy of each official.
I worked for many years in community mental health and I know exactly what you are talking about with regard to services.  The problem here is that liberals have infiltrated the offices that supply those services and routinely reject people who aren't pawns in their plans to overthrow the government by bankrupting the social services systems.  That means no welfare for you if you are white, not an addict, not an illegal, not a felon etc.\n\nYou need to understand something.  Although this is the rule, not the exception in most major metropolitan areas, it is also highly illegal.  What you need to do is get a lawyer (one's who specialize in this are a booming business in these areas) and serve them with a letter of intent to sue.  This  will cause them to immediately approve your aid (at least it used to work 100% of the time in Cook County, where I worked)  These people know that what they are doing is illegal and they definitely don't want to be sued as that would most likely result in alot of people being fired and setting back the marxist revolution or whatever.  None of that is your problem.  The situation exists because all your idiot neighbors vote irresponsibly and don't pay attention to these issues.  You can't change it and shouldn't even try.  Instead, you need to focus on your own health and well being and getting what you need from the system.

"In the first example, the defendant would want to have the accuser crossed examined, as is his right, but won't be able to since the person is deceased; also, a clever attorney would claim and probably succeed in objecting under the heresay rule; additionally, credibility and the state of mind of the now deceased witness would be questioned (drug induced, delirious or hallucinating, not in right frame of mind... etc) and put enough doubts in a jury.  I am not familiar with the technicality of deathbed testimony but I am under the impression that more than one witness must be present and certain other circumstances must be met (knowing that she's dying, being of sound mind, etc).\n\nThe second example can be argued that the ""witness"" was prejudiced by the sight of the handcuffs and argue, furthermore, that the proof is in the inability to identify the same person in a lineup.\n\nGood question!

"If I remember the jury instructions correctly, ""reasonable doubt"" is the doubt that it would take for a reasonable person to act. Reasonable doubt is not beyond all doubt.\nIt's a tough standard, and it's subjective.  But I think it's about the best one that can be developed. \nI think it does not matter too much, because in most cases you've got jurors who are _sure_ (99-100% sure), jurors who are sure that the person is not guilty, and then people who are not quite sure (in the maybe 60-70% range).  I don't think defining ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" helps for most of the jurors. At most, it helps for group (3), but so long as you tell them it's more than ""more likely than not"", they are able to act on their instinct."

"It is puzzling as to why Bush's folks would so brazenly display the banner for all the world to see. Because certainly it's obvious: no weapons of mass destruction have or will be found (unless the U.S. plants them); nor did the Iraqi government use any against the United States. So that mission wasn't accomplished. And it's pretty clear that the Iraqi civilians haven't been liberated, unless you consider being shot at and killed for protesting against the United States, liberation. Or having your collective history and rich culture destroyed in a matter of weeks, liberation. Or going without sufficient food, water or medical care, liberation. Or having an interim government imposed on you, liberation. So that mission, unfortunately, wasn't accomplished either.\nPretty pathetic scorecard. But certainly if Karl Rove decided to parade the banner ""Mission Accomplished,"" they had to have accomplished something. So as Mr. Bush dragged on with his insipid speech, one would continue ponder what exactly was the mission?  And then it hits, as clear as day, or rather, as ""black"" as night: the oil! the Texas tea! the Bush-Cheney life-blood! Mission CERTAINLY was accomplished!!!!!!!!"
A system of government in which the state plans and controls the economy and a single, often authoritarian party holds power, claiming to make progress toward a higher social order in which all goods are equally shared by the people.

Some buy every year, some every couple of years, but most buy a certain number each year to replace the ones currently in use.  The attrition of some cars are due to accidents, but most are due to the wear and tear on those cars.  You figure they are well maintained, but the starting and stopping, high speeds, and being run nearly constantly during the shifts, it takes it's toll.  \n\n20,000 miles on a police car is like nearly 100,000 to ours.\n\nAs for money, each municipality sets aside a fixed amount for it's law enforcement detatchments.  Police, jails, etc.  Each department is responsible for allocating the amounts in their respective accounts.  Salaries, equipment, cars, etc.  Check with the city clerk or city manager for the exact percentages of both the budget and the budgeted amounts for vehicle expendatures.
Sounds like a great guy...
The reality is now that normalisation has been happening for 10 years. People are more concerned about increases in domestic taxation (massive increases in Rates and Water charges) than they are about Michael Stone. Thing about Stone is he's a self-publicist. He became a celebratory of sorts for Loyalists after he attacked a funeral in Milltown cemetery years ago and lived for years of this fame. Giving interviews to Sunday newspapers, slagging off his gangster mates (Johnny Adair, Jim Gray), becoming an artist(!), So it was another stunt. Purely to benefit Michael Stone.\nNI Assembly members have been paid £50 million in salaries since the Assembly was shut down. For sitting on their ar$es and waiting for the next election. Local (council) government here works just fine - no different than anywhere else. In January there are more elections were we vote for people to go to an Assembly that doesn't exist. There'll be another round of whataboutery - and they'll fail miserably to agree on what they disagree about. Like they have for the last ten years. No matter what happens here its just not a surprise anymore.
Already the shias are looking upto Iran for guidence. The US presence in Iraq is strenthening the Iranian influence in this region. Dont be supprised if the main shias break away and join Iran. It is in the interest of Iran to expand there territory. The US has achieved exactly the opposite effect of what they set out to do. They are actually handing over Iraq to the Iranians on a silver plate and there is very little they can do, to totally avert this. This is probably the main reason that US does not want to withdraw its troops quickly.

Hard security deals with military threats, regional conflicts, arms smuggling and terrorism.\n\nAs opposed to soft security, which deals with transnational crime, threats that undermine human capacity and the strength of society. \n\nAdditionally, human security focuses on the human dimension and factors affecting living conditions: the environment, social welfare and the quality of life.
Too hard of a question.
The ASVAB is device used by the military to determine where your talents might be best utilized. I personally believe that talent cannot be measured but that's just me. As a former Navy type, I can tell you that after boot camp you will probably be offered the opportunity to try to qualify for consideration for BUDS training. In the early 80's, at NAS Millington A school, you signed up to attend a tryout for BUDS, we marched over to the base swimming pool and were promptly half drowned by a group of very zealous Seals. This is just a preliminary to see if;\n1.       You can swim\n2.       If you panic\n3.       How much heart you have.\n\nIt does not qualify you for anything, other than a second look.\nBUDS candidates are a fairly select group of people, gleened from a much larger school of tadpoles, but even they get thinned out significantly. As a group these guys, contrary to movies, already tend to be highly intelligent though (this is not determined by an ASVAB but by a process) and have an incredible amount of perserverance, guts and determination. The process is designed to weed out those that think like individuals, don't take direction exactly (also what bootcamp does), and can reach into thier gut and find strength when they don't have the steam for more abuse. This is only BUDS, these folks are not neccesarily SEALS, From my point of view, these folks are more than remarkable, my hat is off to them.\n\nIf this is something your looking at doing, the entire military, and the Navy especially (Don't let a jarhead, air force puke, grunt, or a beach comber Coastie tell you different.), is a good life and offers opportunities you can't get anywhere else on the planet. I wish you success in your endeavor.

"This is a question that historians are going to be writing about for centuries to come... if our planet last that long.\n\nOf course, the war in Iraq is illegal and immoral. It really doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that.\n\nThe problem is that most Americans don't want to believe that they have supported, funded with their tax dollars and flat believed in a war that has killed 600,000+ civilians. They can't...\n\nYou see, the human mind can only handle so much guilt. I guess I am saying that most ppl actually have a 'need' to believe it was for a just cause.\n\nPut it this way, say a guy came to you very excited and confident that in 1 week the family next door was going to blow up your house. Say he went on and on about how he heard this and saw the bombs they had etc...\n\nSo, you said ok go get him and here is some money to go buy the weapons you need to get him out.\n\nThe next day the guy raids the neighbors house, captures him but in the process he kills 3 of the man's kids and his wife.\n\nWhen all the dust has settled, come to find out, the neighbor was just a bad husband, bad father and a jerk but had no weapons, no plan to attack you and was no threat to anyone.\n\nNow, how would you feel?\n\nWould you be sick to your stomach? I would.\nWould you regret it? I would.\nWould you be rethinking your decision? I would.\nWould you wish you had gotten more evidence? I would.\nWould you wish you had waited and not felt so rushed? I would.\n\nAnd the question that answers your question is:\nWould you tell yourself, ""... but I did what I thought was right at the time.""\n\nGet it?\n\nThat is what the mind must do and say to itself to handle such atrocities.\nDoes it excuse it? No\nDoes it justify it? No\nDoes it make it right? No\n\nShould you be punished? Yes"

"I think you're right.  But he did win with his charm, which I guess is different from charisma.  It's what was called that ""aw, gosh"" appeal.  He seemed like a regular guy, in contrast to that over-practiced, slick style of Gore in the 2000 Presidential race.  I think that's why Gore lost to the underdog, Bush.  I think it's the simplest explanation for Bush's victory, since there was no way to judge his fitness for leadership, other than his governorship in Texas, which most Americans knew nothing about."

I dont know where you are from but here in the states your sister could or can not keep you from seeing your mother if your mother wishes to see you. Second if the property is in your name still then you have every right to it and your sister cant say a word. Well she might say a word but she wont be able to do anything. I wish that your mother could get better but you said she is terminal  and I really dont like saying this but I guess you have already pretty much prepared yourself for her passing when she does pass away if she didnt make a will anything that was or is in her name will go into probate and if there are any outstanding bills what ever is in her name will be sold to pay the bills and what is left divided between her children. If the property and the house are in your name you have nothing to worry about other than making sure that there are no deliquint taxes owed or anything else in which everything could get repoed. I dont know what kind of lawyers you are talking to but they dont sound very helpful. If you have the paperwork on the property and house then I would just go to the local police with the paperwork and have one of them go with you so you can check on the place and you can go to court to have your sister kicked out if she is living there.  I cant think of the name of the organization right now but I know In california if a family member is not allowing you to see your mother or whoever it may be they will go with you and make sure you area able to visit with the person. I would defintily get in to see your mom if I were you so you can find out if she has a will or not.

Well, the US fought its own bloody civil war on the way to nationhood; perhaps it’s a right of passage democracies have to go through. Imagine if there had been a third power standing between the Yankees and the Confederates saying ‘cant you guys just all get along?’ Yea…right…. Would have gone down a treat.\n\nThe US is now no more than the meat between the two slices of bread trying to eat each other. Those who can afford to flee Iraq are doing so at a rate equivalent to 1% population per month. 1%…. that’s bad, real bad…. Do the math, civil war is inevitable and is already there, its just not yet very organised. That is changing. Blood will point the way to the future, and rather a lot of it.\n\nHow on gods earth the Americans thought they could bring democracy to Iraq is beyond me, a high school history student should have seen this coming. Power held for centuries by a 30% minority now suddenly and effectively disenfranchised from power by democracy. Who would swallow that? I know what will happen though; the US will pull out of Iraq and support the government against the anti government ‘insurgents’… which will be on a percentage of population basis more than those Americans who voted for Bush.

"Good point you have there. The problem is that with the corrupted governments of many Latin American countries, financial aid would be kept by the rich. The solution would be that the United States Government stopped intervening in Latin American politics as much and let them have a socialist kind of government. Uncle Sam wants every country to have their kind of democracy, but they don't realize that it only works with educated people. Most people in the U.S. have a fairly good education, but this is not the case with many Latin American countries.\n\nLet's take Chile as an example, which is the country with the strongest economy in Latin America. They used to be consiered ""third world"" as well, until President Pinochet got into power and he FORCED children to get an education. After many years of ruling this country, he finally ended his term but now Chile has a strong economy and good education. I would guess that if that happened in every Latin American country then we would all be a different continent. Contact me if you have any thoughts about this."

It's basically a loophole in the law with a long tradition.  When Congress approves a bill and sends it to the President, he is allowed 10 days to either approve (sign) or reject (veto) it.  If he does neither then the bill becomes a law by default.  However, if Congress adjourns before those 10 days are up, then the President can do neither and the bill will not become law.  The rationale is that the legislature has to be in session to affirm that a bill would become a law without the President's signature if he did nothing; if they're not in session, then a bill that the President has not acted on cannot become law.

Liberal values stem around the idea that individual liberty is the primary political value. Essentually, each and every person has the same rights and liberties, and can live their life however they feal fit, including religion, sexuality, political association, as long as their actions do not infringe on the rights of others.\nBecause of the basic Liberal ideology that individuals can have free expression, values becomes a missnomer. For instance, conservitives consider family values to mean that families that consist of a mother, father, and children are correct, while other forms of family are some short or broken form of that valuable family. Liberals however consider family values to mean, any intimate relationship that values respect, love, honesty and providership.\nA good liberal family could be a single mother, her best friend, and her 2 children, as long as the mother and friend love and respect the children, work to provide for eachother, and are honest and open.\nConservitives on the other hand would consider this family very broken, and dissfunctional.

"Primarily, #3 epitomizes the doctrine.\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine states three major ideas, with one more added by President Theodore Roosevelt. First, it conveys that European countries cannot colonize in any of the Americas: North, Central, or South. Second, it enforces Washington's rule of foreign policy, in which the U.S. will only be involved in European affairs if America's rights are disturbed. Third, the U.S. will consider any attempt at colonization a threat to its national security. Roosevelt added to the doctrine, and summed up his additions with the statement, ""Speak softly and carry a big stick.""\n\nThe border dispute with Venezuela would have essentially grown British holdings in South America, thus breaking the primary tenant of the doctrine >> European countries cannot colonize in any of the Americas: North, Central, or South.\n\nBut more deeply seeded and self-serving plans were behind the creation of the Monroe Doctrine...\n\nThe end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 marked the breakup of the Spanish empire in the New World. Between 1815 and 1822 Jose de San Martin led Argentina to independence, while Bernardo O'Higgins in Chile and Simon Bolivar in Venezuela guided their countries out of colonialism. The new republics sought -- and expected -- recognition by the United States, and many Americans endorsed that idea.\n\nBut President James Monroe and his secretary of state, John Quincy Adams, were not willing to risk war for nations they did not know would survive. From their point of view, as long as the other European powers did not intervene, the government of the United States could just let Spain and her rebellious colonies fight it out.\n\nGreat Britain was torn between monarchical principle and a desire for new markets; South America as a whole constituted, at the time, a much larger market for English goods than the United States. When Russia and France proposed that England join in helping Spain regain her New World colonies, Great Britain vetoed the idea.\n\nThe United States was also negotiating with Spain to purchase the Floridas, and once that treaty was ratified, the Monroe administration began to extend recognition to the new Latin American republics -- Argentina, Chile, Peru, Colombia and Mexico were all recognized in 1822.\n\nSo the dispute over the Venezuelan border was truthfully the best example of enforcement, as we (and the British) tacitly supported the Bolivarian movement in Venezuela. So we publicly chastised Britain t give them an image of compliance while, gaining their support of the doctrine against France, Russia and Spain... giving us and the British free reign over the commercial markets."

Some are. Some of the largest minor parties in the former soviet countries are Communist. There are different strains of communism and some have started taking on more democratic socialist leanings like other european countries. But, for example, in Russia, I think the Communist party there still holds one of the largest, if not THE largest voting blocs in their congress/parliament. They are still out there, just not in control like they used to be. Besides, some would argue that it is worse since Russia appears to be Capitalist and all, but has Putin and others at the helm that stifle freedom and use old Soviet KGB tactics in running their government.Ok...enough for my rant. Hope this helps.

Recent history shows that more gets done when power is shared between the two parties.  Reagan got major economic legislation passed by a Democratic Congress.  Clinton got the deficit under control with a Republican Congress.  My theory is that when one party controls both the White House and the Congress, they are reluctant to take risks because they have no one else to blame for a failure.  When the parties share power, they both take the blame/credit for failures and successes.  I think this new Congress will take this opportunity to get something done.

Whatever all that Q stuff means.  Cops do not contest rights, they enforce the law.  If you break a law, even if you feel its a violation of your rights, the cops can do nothing about it...the decision as to whether it is a violation or you will be punished is in the jurisdiction of the court to decide.\n\nTake a good luck at the work of Martin Luther King Jr. with peaceful civil disobedience.  If you get involved in an issue regarding civil rights, you must be willing to be arrested.  Peaceful civil disobedience has several facets.  One, you do not resist arrest.  Two, if arrested you stay in jail as the goal is to fill the jails (hit the government where the money is).  Three, when you do get out, you go back out and do it again.  Four, you tie up the court system.  Sooner or later the issue will be adjudicated at the Supreme Court level which is the ultimate goal.  GBU\n\nOkay, since we are having some fun with this.

Quite frankly, I am surprised that someone hasn't tried to raise this issue already in the courts.  \n\n     I definitely see your point and I do sympathize; however, I can't say I agree whole hartedly.  I think it is a good law  per se  even if it is somewhat discriminatory.  What I don't like is the states that require the offender to register for life after the first offense.  Reason being, there are some who are falsely accused and convicted of a crime they didn't commit and end up having to pay for it for the rest of their life.  Now if they are accused and convicted a second time that is different.  I also think the laws should be more specific as to which types of sex offenders should have to register rather than all of them.  For example, in some states indecent exposure is a sex offense and those convicted have to register.  If it is someone who is exposing themselves in a park i.e. a flasher then perhaps they should have to register.  But, a young kid who moons someone, gets arrested for indecent exposure, and has to register as a sex offender is going bit far.\n\n     I guess what the real problem is, there is no way to address this issue that is completely fair to all.  But, by the same token, that doesn't mean it should be done away with either.

illegal porn has illegal actions performed in it such as brutal violence and genuine rape. If the performer is under 18, it is illegal, if the woman says no, it is illegal. There can not be any vulgar actions such as using the opposite sex as a toilet, that is also illegal.
"History\n Original sign with seal from the CIA's first building on E Street in Washington, DCThe Central Intelligence Agency was created in 1947 with the National Security Act of 1947 signed by President Harry S. Truman, and is the descendant of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) of World War II, which was dissolved in October 1945. In 1944, William J. Donovan (a.k.a. Wild Bill Donovan), the OSS's creator, proposed to President Franklin D. Roosevelt creating a new espionage organization directly supervised by the President: ""which will procure intelligence both by overt and covert methods and will at the same time provide intelligence guidance, determine national intelligence objectives, and correlate the intelligence material collected by all government agencies.""\n\nDespite strong opposition from the military establishment, the State Department, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), President Truman established the Central Intelligence Group in January 1946. Later, under the National Security Act of 1947 (effective September 18, 1947), the National Security Council and the Central Intelligence Agency were established. Rear Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter was appointed as the first Director of Central Intelligence.\n\nIn the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency, many disposed Nazi operational agents were recruited as U.S. secret agents; they were induced financially and promised exemption from criminal prosecution and trial for war crimes committed during World War II, their recruitment was under aegis of Operation Paperclip.\n\nThe now declassified National Security Council Directive on Office of Special Projects, June 18, 1948 (NSC 10/2) provided the operating instructions for the CIA:\n\n    Plan and conduct covert operations which are conducted or sponsored by this government against hostile foreign states or groups or in support of friendly foreign states or groups but which are so planned and conducted that any US Government responsibility for them is not evident to unauthorised persons and that if uncovered the US Government can plausibly disclaim any responsibility for them. Covert action shall include any covert activities related to: propaganda; economic warfare; preventive direct action, including sabotage, anti-sabotage, demolition, and evacuation measures; subversion against hostile states, including assistance to underground resistance movements, guerrillas and refugee liberation groups, and support of indigenous anti-Communist elements in threatened countries of the free world.[2]     \n\nIn 1949, the Central Intelligence Agency Act (a.k.a. Public Law 110) was passed, permitting the agency's using confidential, fiscal, and administrative procedures, and exempting it from most of the usual limitations on the use of federal funds. The act also exempted the CIA from having to disclose its ""organization, functions, officials, titles, salaries, or numbers of personnel employed."" It also created the program ""PL-110"", to handle defectors and other ""essential aliens"" who fall outside normal immigration procedures, as well as giving those persons cover stories and economic support.[3] By 1949, the West German intelligence agency Bundesnachrichtendienst, under Reinhard Gehlen, was under the CIA's control.\n\nIn 1950, the CIA organized the Pacific Corporation, the first of many CIA private enterprises. Director Hillenkoetter approved Project BLUEBIRD, the CIA's first structured, behavioral control program. In 1951, the Columbia Broadcasting System began co-operating with the CIA; President Truman created the Office of Current Intelligence; Project BLUEBIRD was renamed Project ARTICHOKE.\n\nDuring the first years of its existence, other branches of government did not exercise much control over the Central Intelligence Agency; justified by the desire to match and defeat KGB actions throughout the globe, a task many believed could be accomplished"

"Be sure to include the fact -- which I am sure is a fact -- that their progress is largely dependent upon how quickly and how well they learn English.  \n\nBlacks, of course, have grown up around English, but lately there has been a movement to emphasize rather than diminish their language differences with standard English.  I believe this is a mistake.  I also believe it is being fostered by people who have hidden political and even criminal agendas: the gangs seem to love to be incomprehensible to ""the straights.""  \n\nFor the rest, learning English is usually high on their agenda anyway.  Most of it has to do with not letting your pride get in the way of your learning: someone tells you how to pronounce something properly, say, ""Yes, thank you,"" and pronounce it the way they just did.  Two or three times.  You are memorizing it.\n\nEducation more generally is also terribly important, but it will not go well until you learn English to the point where you are not handicapped in an all-English speaking classroom.  So most people who come here from elsewhere know that they must knuckle down and study.  American Blacks also seem to be getting that point.  Being citizens, however, they have another option:  they can enlist in the military, and let them pay for their education.\n\nGood luck with your essay.  I am fascinated by the process of immigration: see my avatar?  I take that kind of thing seriously as being one of the major ways we get new Americans.  Notice how old our population is growing, Baby Boomers becoming senior citizens.  This country needs fresh blood, fresh ideas, fresh energy.  We get some in our children, and some in our immigrants."
I am assuming that you need to deposit your ex's support payments directly into his/her account.\n\nGo to the bank where the account is held and tell them you have a court order stating you must deposit the funds (you do, don't you?).  They will get the paperwork you need then you and then your ex will have to sign it, probably in a bank officer's presence.\n\nIf you are transfering money from your bank to a completely different bank, you need to go to your bank first and find out how to transfer the funds electronically without incurring any Wire Transfer fees (which can be as high as $50 per transaction).\n\nIt may be easier to just go to the ex's bank and get a bunch of blank deposit slips.  Fill in his/her name address and account number and then either mail them, deposit as normal, or use the night depository.\n\nGood luck, support sucks.
Wow Candycane just got called a liberal by Silentdeath I never thought I would see that.  \n\nWhile your question in theroy is nice they really dont make anywhere near enought to make any type of dent on the deficit.

I already voted for him.  But he doesn't want to legalize marijuana...he wants to decriminalize it.  There's a difference.  What is trying to get at with the decriminalization of marijuana is that too many people are being put in jail as first time offenders (possession of pot and what not).  We would be better off as a state if those people wouldn't be taking up jail cells that could be used for more serious offenders.

"The reason stated by the President was to remove the threat of weapons of mass destruction from Iraq. The Administration publicly and repeal stated that there was proof of WMD, and that it was the duty of the United States to remove this threat before it was put to use. A statement was made at the U.N. by the Bush administration that ""we don't want the proof to be in the form of a mushroom cloud"". That was referring to the theory that Iraq not only had weapons of mass destruction, but was also pursuing a nuclear program.\n\nNo weapons of mass destruction were found by the UN weapons inspectors in the years between the Gulf War and this invasion. There were WMD that were destroyed immediately after the Gulf War in 1991, and verified by the UN weapons inspection teams.\n\nIn addition to this, there was a unified Republican attempt to try to link Saddam Hussein to Bin Laden, 9/11 and Al Queda. This all proved to be baseless.\n\nNo weapons of mass destruction have been found since the invasion. This means that the reason for going to war was based on faulty intelligence to put it in the best light."

Not usually. They'd have to do a background check, and even then, you're probably ok. It's when you get a felony that your options in life become extremely limited. You can buy a gun in many states with a misdemeanor, so you're probably worrying a little too much when it comes to being a renter.

I don't know how you could blame high school students for being here illegally when they were brought here by their parents.\n\nAs long as they aren't receiving any affirmation action style preference, I absolutely believe they should be allowed to compete for college admission.

I don't think he did anything.  He was seriously ill in 1776 and signed as a member of the Connecticut delegation later.
Because they know it's wrong.  All that would mean is that the soldiers that did lose their lives, will have lost them for nothing.  Isn't it a coincidence that they started that one year before the elections?  Before that, they never said much about it.  A majority of Democrats voted to go to war also.  Did you know that?  I'm not for the war, but I am a strong believer in finishing what I started.  Besides, it's not up to the Democrats or the Republicans or even the President.  In case you aren't aware of this, President Bush has left this decision up to the commanding officers looking over the operation.  They are the professionals, so once they decide that we have applied enough stability for Iraq to function on it's own, then we will withdraw troops.  It's not up to the President.  I wish people would get off of his back about it.
The Democrats will win.

Most college liberals have enough education to use birth control and varying methods of contraception to prevent unwanted pregnancies. The question should be rephrased towards conservatives, who despite their rhetoric of chastity, are just as promiscuous as anyone else, and are probably very ignorant of birth control and contraception, given that their churches have inculcated them with propaganda stating that these things are ineffective and immoral.

"The debt does not only represent an increase in spending, it also represents a decrease in revenues.  Since spending went up and revenues went down, you have an increasing federal deficit.\n\nThere has been a lot of money spent on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

There have been a huge increase in ""earmarks"" which are basically money Congress loots from the budget to give to people in their own districts.\n\nAs a registered Republican since 1979 I am distressed to see my party abandon fiscal responsibility and even more distressed that this burden will now fall onto my children and grandchildren."
They come here to seek a better life, that much I don't doubt. However, that doesn't make it right. I, myself, am an immigrant and I have several friends who are also immigrants. I, along with my friends, have come here through legal methods. The ones who continuously cross the borders are not. If they come here through the correct means then I don't have a problem with it. But with what they're doing now, it's a slap in the face to every immigrant who's had to come here lawfully.

I don't know who posted that question, but the premise is silly.  From an economic standpoint, America gains from immigration (legal and illegal).  \n\nThose that legally enter America do so because we are a land of opportunity.  They are able to apply their skills and talents to better themselves.  In the meantime, they are part of the population that find better ways of doing things (technological advances).  Technological advances increase everyones standard of living.  \n\nThose that come here illegally are hired by firms because of the cheapness of their labor.  This lowers the costs of products that all Americans buy.  If this wasn't true, then there wouldn't be an illegal immigration problem.  The government would have taken care of it long ago.  But, in the end, money talks so the political question on illegal immigration will not be decided in the near future.  There is a lot of disagreement over this.  Many people contend that illegal immigration overwhelms government programs costing the country more in services than their labor provides.  For myself, I wonder how much the American consumer has saved through lower prices compared to what they pay in taxes so the  government can pay for those services.  Granted individual states may experience problems, but my bet is that for the nation as a whole, the American consumer is the beneficiary.\n\nAs an example, our population recently went over 300 million people; a 20 million increase from 5 years ago.  This was attributed to immigration.  Has our standard of living gone down?  No, it has gone up.  That's because these people are working.  They increase our GDP.  Even if they do not provide for increases in knowledge and technological breakthroughs (which everyone does through specialization), the proportional split on GDP is the same as if they did not immigrate.   \n\nMy thoughts on illegal immigration are solely from an economic viewpoint.  From a societal, security, etc. viewpoint, I think we must stop illegal immigration.  I fully support legal immigration and believe it is a strength in America.\n\nSorry so long, but I can be a chatty bugger.

"In New York, the rule is simple - and a little different from California.\n\nYou serve a photocopy of the order with a letter or back stating ""that the attached is a true copy of the order entered by Judge X on (DATE)"" - (that's the notice of entry) - you do this by regular mail or personal service. \n\nYou then file a copy of the notice of entry with an affidavit of service with the clerk of the court or county clerk, depending upon the court.\n\nRemember that in New York you can NOT serve papers if you are a party - so someone else has to do that for you and sign the affidavit of service."
I agree with you, there was no reason to go to Iraq in the first place. However many people still believe the repuglican talking point that we are fighting them over there to prevent them from coming here which is an out and out lie. But with the repuglican propaganda machine cranked up with the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox news I guess you have to expect it. The truth will come out in history when George Bush has been outed for what he is and that is a war criminal that should have to answer for his crimes against the Iraqi people and his crimes against humanity.

"It generally depends on the state you are in.

Basically, in a ""no-fault"" insurance state, fault is not placed on either party, and each driver generally submits a claim to his or her own insurance company instead of establishing blame.

"Some will tell you that democrats don't care about morals. I am a democrat and I think that most conservatives do not even know the meaning of the word moral. Most people don't share the same morals. Democrats are more accepting of the many different views that are guaranteed to every person by the constitution. Conservatives believe we are only free to do what we want if it doesn't disgust them or their ""God"". Democrats believe in the freedom of religion and in helping the less fortunate. The most important part is helping the less fortunate. In our own country and around the world, regardless of their oil properties or political agenda. The democrats have a small majority now and hopefully that means they will start to prioritize what is most important. Generally the democrats are in support of helping Iraq reach their goal of self-sufficiency, taxing the people who should be taxed in order to pay for things like health care reform, welfare, and basic things like highway improvements and schools. The democrats have only narrowly gained some control, though, so it is yet to be determined how their goals will be reached."

Police in India is not as bad as they are projected through movies. They have solved very tough cases whenever they have wanted. It is the politicians who create problems for handling cases in accordance with law. Otherwise both the law and the police in India are adequate and efficient.

Jehovah's Witnesses always work in obedience to secular law and deference to the personal decisions of victims (and their families, where practical). Jehovah's Witness ministers do not investigate criminal matters, leaving such matters to law enforcement authorities.\n\nAn unrepentant baptized Jehovah's Witness who is found guilty of a serious secular crime is likely to be disfellowshipped (or ""excommunicated"", although Witnesses do not use this latter term). However, a sin against God's supreme authority is clearly a different matter from a sin against secular superior authorities. The standards for criminal conviction and forced religious disassociation will never be identical.\n\nLearn more:\nhttp://watchtower.org/library/w/1997/1/1/article_01.htm\nhttp://watchtower.org/library/g/1985/1/22/article_01.htm\nhttp://watchtower.org/library/w/1995/11/1a/article_01.htm\nhttp://watchtower.org/library/g/1996/5/22/article_02.htm\nhttp://jw-media.org/vnr/2122827332/717263.htm\nhttp://jw-media.org/vnr/2122827332/713173.htm\nhttp://jw-media.org/vnr/2122827332/716353.htm\nhttp://jw-media.org/region/global/english/backgrounders/e_molestation.htm\nhttp://jw-media.org/region/americas/usa/english/releases/educational/usa_e990402a.htm"

It depends on your pay grade (rank) and your time in service.\nThe current paychart is here. http://www.dod.mil/dfas/militarypay/newinformation/WebPayTableVersion2006updated.pdf\n\nWe will be getting a 2.2% raise on 1 January.  Some grades will get targeted raises beyond that.\n\nAlso, continue to scroll through the pay charts.  You'll see that there are incentive pays for extra duty statuses as well.\n\nFor example:  I am an E-5 with 13 years service.  My base pay right now is $2526.60 per month.  But I am also deployed to a combat zone.  And I'm a deployed reservist with a mortgage.  DoD helps me compensate for my mortgage payment with an entitlement called BAH.  There are differnt kinds of BAH, what I get is based on the cost of living in my home of record.  I'm also married, so that amount is bumped up a little for that.\n\nTher is Hazardous Duty pay of $150.00/month.  Family Separation Allowance of $250.00.  Hostile Fire pay of $225.00...\n\nAnd deployed pay is tax free.\n\nI sat down and added it up, for this deployment including the 3 months train up, reimbursement for expenses and terminal leave, and a one time $15,000 reenlistment bonus, I'll clear just shy of $110,000 for this deployment.  My credit cards are now completely paid and my car will be before I get home.
I have my family here in Korea.  Your daughter can choose to take your granddaughter with her as well.  Not living with your granddaughter is your daughter's choice.

I believe you have answered your own question quite well, especially with the wiki article. It has some off the worst aspects of both traditional liberalism and conservatism. It is pro - big government and pro - big spending, while it still insists on cutting revenue.

Try to get laws passed that stop/slow down corruption.\n\nAlso before you vote, check out Vote-Smart.org\nThis site tries to inform people about the different candidates out there, it also tried to provide as much information about them as possible. The best way, I think, to stop corruption is to Vote Smart and don't elect someone who is apt to misuse their position.

The GOP was hijacked by the Reagan Neocons with the 30 year plan, it's about time the real GOP voted them out to stop the Bush Dictatorship.

To be honest with you I don't think the word victory and iraq belong in the same sentence... With that said, any positive change that happens over there will have to come from within. Yes our mission is to provide the vehicle for that happen, but I'm not convinced it will in the near future.\n\nPerhaps dividing the country up into three provinces would be an answer - but that leads to bigger problems. I think our victory will be when the troops come home once and for all, and thier victory (should it happen) will be when they can learn to live with one another.

The British House of Lords currently serves as the Court of Last Resort for many (but not all) appeals in the United Kingdom.  It hears most cases on appeal, but the process is bit more complicated than it is for most national supreme courts.\n\nIf you consult the following article, you should gain a pretty good understanding of the types of cases the body hears (and doesn't hear).  Please note that under recent constitutional reforms, the judicial functions of the House of Lords will soon pass to a separate national supreme court.
terrorism is a point of view.. does that make it right? of course not.. but if you truly believe there was an evil nation that was going to destroy the world and you knew no other nation could stand up to it toe to toe, how would you fight back? from their mentality i can understand why they are terrorists even if i completely disagree with that mentality and their cause... and understanding that is why i say the War on Terror can only be won threw changing people minds in ways other than force.. sure sometimes force is necessary.. but to use it all the time just makes them believe more strongly in their cause.. at some point diplomacy has to resume and a mental war has to be waged.

Do the easiest thing which is to let them sue in court for the amounts owed.\n   The creditors are filling in the cheques with larger amounts so that they can sue for larger amounts, hoping that the cheques will be proof that the amount is owed.\n    The burden of proof is on the creditors. If someone goes to court he must prove that your son actually owes the money that he's being sued for. While a cheque can be viewed as a form of proof, the fact is that the number amount filled in the cheque isn't in your son's handwriting and therefore the cheque loses it's value as proof.\n    The original loan agreement will have to be provided to the court, and that will have the correct amounts on it.

The US has a large arsonal of nuclear weapons. The nastiest is the one most tempting to use, that is Neutron bombs which only poison the land it's dropped on for hundreds not thousands of years. \n\nNuclear weapons are scary in that whole cities go poof. Then a cloud of radiation spreads poison accross the world. Huge clouds of dust are kicked up which if enough nukes are discharged can bring on what's called nuclear winter. That is a literal ice age. So in short we never want to see nukes used on Earth every again if we can help it. At one point the US and USSR created enough nuclear weapons that we could split the crust of the earth completely ending life on Earth. The radiation released if most of those weapons were discharged would keep the Earth glowing in the dark for thousands of years. Both the US and USSR have destroyed many of those nukes but not all. \n\nIf nukes are that bad why does anybody keep them? \n\nThere are several reasons. The first being to prevent others who are more likely to use them from getting and using nuclear weapons.  Isreal for example if it were nuked would deffinitely respond. It's retaliation would obliterate the Arab world to the point that Arab culture would cease to exist and the rest of the world would be poisoned by the nuclear exchange between the Arabs and Isrealis. \n\nWhich leads me exactly to why we don't want Arab nations gaining nuclear power. The Isrealis are not going to nuke Iran just because they don't like the way the Iranians part thier teeth in the morning. Isreal has a stable goverment and it's people would not accept a leader who'd use a first strike tactic. England, Germany, France and most other members of the nuclear club are the same way.  Instead of desert storm we could have nuked Iraq. We in the US wouldn't even seriously consider it. Iran would not hesitate to use nuclear weapons. Saddam used chemical weapons. This is typical of most Arab nations. \n\nIn general every nation that has nuclear weapons is a nation that can start a war that will erase mankind from the face of the earth. So the fewer the better. Despotic governments CAN NOT be tolerated to own nuclear weapons. They are far too likely to use them. In the case of both North Korea and Iran the nations are led by sanity challenged people who have have little santicty for life.  These are exactly the kind of people who will use nuclear weapons. At the least millions will die, possibly every person on the planet if nukes are used. A non-nuclear nation will find it very difficult to prompt a nuclear response. \n\nOther reasons we keep nukes include the fact we may need to use them to split an astroid on a collision course with the earth, they are the strongest weapon we have, so it might be the only thing we can attack  a hostile alien force with. We keep them as a guarentee to our existance.  China for example has nukes. Were the US to not have them China could nuke key US cities and invade us. Our possession of nukes is a deterrent to such actions.  So nukes are here to stay until an even more destructive weapon is harnessed. \n\nAs for places like North Korea and Iran, they are not interested in protecting themselves. Were we to invade one of those nations we'd take out the nukes before they could use them. Iran and North Korea have only one reason to want nukes. That is as a first strike weapon. Niether have the air force to defend thier nukes. Niether nation has the affluence to afford the budget to develop them without harming thier own people. North Korea for example has literally allowed it's own people to starve in the streets so they could fund thier nuclear weapons program. So for North Korea and Iran having nukes is like bringing a knife to a machine gun fight. They might get lucky but really it's very slim chance they could use thier weapons defensively against a current nuclear power. It is possible they could use thier weapons against a non-nuclear p

We are beyond the whole should we or shouldn't we have invaded Iraq. We are there now, it is a mess and we need to clean it up. The only way for that to happen is for the US to stop playing the backup role to the Iraqi government in Iraq and take charge... again. \n\nLeaving Iraq in the disorder it is today should be unacceptable to any Americans. Especially those who whine about the number of civilian deaths that have occured. Do you think if we leave that the Shiites and the Sunni's are just going to put down their weapons? Do you think that the Kurds in the North aren't going to get attacked from all directions? Turkey would like to see them cease to exist. Iran, Syria and the Sunni's. Genocide? What Saddam did to the Kurds will be childs play if the US walks away now. Then who will share the responsibility of having the blood of the Kurds on their hands. I would say it is all of those that demanded the US leave. Our own countrymen included. Bush may have not handled the mission in Iraq in the best way but that is beyond the point now. We can't just walk away. \n\nPeople like dstr disgust me. If nothing else, his/her response to this question makes it perfectly clear that he/she wants the US to fail in Iraq and in a big way. If this person is a citizen of the US he/she is one piss poor excuse of an American and should be singled out and ostracized for his/her treasonist behavior.

There is a difference between hate and envy.  The world doesn't hate us, they only envy our power.  Envy is hate with the desire to plunder.

The problem with political correctness is that, while it started out with the idea of getting rid of prejudice and discrimination, it has developed in such a way as to validate these forms of behaviour, and it is just a matter of argument about who is allowed to do it to who. As an example. In a discussion on TV between a man and a woman, the woman dismissed the man's point by saying 'That is just a white middle class male's view' as though that statement alone was enough to refute the argument. In one phrase she managed to be racist, sexist and classist, yet nobody even blinked.\n\nSo we have a situation where\n\nSex discrimination is OK for women against men\nRace discrimination is OK for blacks against whites\nReligious discrimination is OK for Muslims against Jews and Christians\n\nIt has become just a game of semantics.\n\nYou must not say disabled, you must say differently abled, but that begs the question ' different from what' the obvious answer is different from normal - just as demeaning.

At a minimum you would be required to prove that you are capable of fully supporting yourself--paying for rent/utilities/food/medical expenses/etc with no assistance from anyone. You would also have to provide a *valid* reason that emancipation would be in your best interest. The court could require other things as well.\n\nThe court can deny emancipation for any reason that it sees fit, including, but not limited to, their belief that you lack the maturity/ability to function as an adult.\n\nGenerally speaking, it is not a quick or easy process, and more often than not, it is denied.
"Take care of your own first unless your existence is being threatened.  Iraq never threatened the existance of the US.  It was the same thing I heard during the war in VietNam.  We have to fight them over there or else we'll have to fight them over here.  We lost the war and I still haven't seen that invasion by the Vietnamese.  30 years and still waiting.  And to ""I Hate Liberals"".  More Iraqis have now died since we invaded the country than did under the reign of Saddam Hussein.  Also, why aren't you over there protecting America?  Chicken?  Just like your leader, George W. Bush."

I think that most politicians want what is best for their constituents, generally speaking. The bad apples get a lot of press coverage & it just seems like most are corrupt.\n\nI personally believe that Bush, Cheney and Rove are corrupt.  They are all arrogant & Bush abuses the power of his office as much as he can get away with. But I have noticed that we haven't been seeing Bush's smirk (I would just love to wash that smirk off his face) in a while.\n\nWhen the Presidency appears to be corrupt, it demoralizes the citizenry & it's easy to believe that all politicians are corrupt as well.\n\nI'm 60.  I don't think that there is any more or less media coverage on corruption now than there has been in the past.

The RAF wasn't formed until after the First World War.\n\nIt was an amalgamation of the Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal Flying Corps.\n\nSomethings not right with your question.
In a naval reserve unit or Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corp or Summer Training Camp, a Gunnery Officer is responsible of the parade, morning and sunset procedures, protocal and in general discipline abord the unit. The Gunners in the unit can be identified by the chain they wear...it looks like the Boatswain's chain but is a little larger. Also, they have a gunner's call, which resemble the old English Police Whistle. This tradition dates back to the Royal Navy and has been carried on to the RCSC.  Originally also, Gunnery Officers would wear black leather gaiters, this tradition was flopped by the CF upon unification in the 60's.

Well, you aren't very specific..are you still awaiting trial?  If so, there is no time limit per se.  However, once you are sentenced, there is a limit as to how long a county jail will keep you.  In CA, if you are sentenced to over 1 year for a felony, then you go to prison.  If it's less than 1 year, then you stay in county.  I believe each state has a time limit they can hold you after arrest without filing charges.  So that may be the 30 days they are talking about.  \nPlease don't listen to everything prisoners say.  A few really do know the system, but most of them know just a little bit.\n\nAfterthought?...You have internet access in jail?  Sounds more like Camp Snoopy
I can only express surprise that your question was banned. It raised a legitimate concern, as it seems absurd first that such large sums of compensation should be paid in the first place to people who upon release will obviously be approached by contacts with an invitation to spend it on further drugs and secondly that it should be paid as compensation for something which cannot be termed as an offence or wrong against them, inasmuch as it would have been unlawful for prison officers to have administered the drugs in question to them and under the influence of such drugs they would have posed grave security issues.  I for one am glad that you raised it and sorry that it has been suppressed.

Tilden vs Hayes in 1876.  Tilden got popilar vote.  Hayes got electoral majority by one vote after three disputed states were given to him by an electoral commission.  The commission voted along partisan lines.  The Republicans had the majority.  So one man decided the outcome.  \n\nThe dispute, however, did not end, as Democrats threatened to filibuster in the Senate. Eventually, a compromise was reached whereby Hayes agreed to name at least one Southerner to his cabinet and to withdraw all federal troops in the South, bringing to an end the era of Reconstruction.

At one time, Christianity was an illegal religion in Rome.  The Christians who were fed to lions, hung on crosses to die, dipped in Tar and put on fire to light celebrations, and put to death by a whole host of other interesting tortures, were those who were found to be partaking in what were declared illegal and heretical Christian activities.  Those who were killed included Christian Leaders as well as their followers and many people who were wrongly accused of being Christians by neighbors who had grudges and wanted them punished.\n\nMost Christians were from the poor. Rich and educated Romans followed other religions, not Christianity. For example, The Military followed Mithra almost to a man.  Many Roman women followed the worship of the Mother of God, Isis.  Most Roman men followed the worship of the Roman Emperor, who was by law the son of God (which was why the Christian beliefs were considered heretical).\n\nSomehow, I don't think that the men, women and children who were killed for being poor and found in the wrong place because they were following a religion which was teaching them they would be rewarded in heaven for their piety and poverty here in this life, had any real leftist leanings.  Most of them were more interested in trying to find their next meal.

It becomes this nations business when this person is exploiting her 7 year old son for her own agenda.This is a frail looking child any way ,he always looks like he needs a good meal and to be able to play like other little 7 year old boys play..I feel concern for the child but none for his mother.She is using him as a tool for her own selfish gain,if you think its none of our business then tell her to bring her butt out and surrender to the ICE,do things the right way instead of acting so selfish.I too think that CPS should step in and rescue that child until this charade is over.Hes a 7 year old being sent to Mexico to speak to both party's of the Mexican government.Poor little boy,he must be scared to death.
we could have sealed that border years ago we chose not to, we as americans have reaped the rewards of cheap hard working labor, its built our economy to where it is today, without them be prepared to be dropped a notch on that totem pole
YES, i do! Our borders should have been SEALED tighter than a first-class hotel is to a hooker! How many terrorists have ALREADY sneaked in across the mexican border? How many nuclear weapons? If we'd have had a president with any balls, he would have done exactly that!
The ones most people miss are the nice little old ladies with a clutch purse held tightly against her midsection, people in wheelchairs, & baby strollers, & obese people & pregnant women.   Also suspicious are people who stand in line & keep going back to other isles to exchange items for other things.  Somewhat absent-minded, yet with no real purpose.  Many security guards mistake people on perscription medications for people on street drugs just by the way they are dressed.  It's not fair, but it happens.  Do you fit into any of these categories?
There are civil tensions not doubt due to religion.  But most of the killings are courtesy of Syrians, Iranians (mostly) and even the Lebanese who have entered Iraq to cause discourse.  There has been elections and a democratic, shaky but never the less still there, government in place.  This is what the Iraqi people want.  They are getting better at this, but little at a time.  The fact is, most Iraqi insurgents aren't even Iraqis-they come from other countries.

I heard New Zealand is actually one of the hardest places to migrate to. In order to even be considered you have to have a job offer. A job that is valuable to the New Zealand economy. Even with that it will take about a year to get everything in order. Another way is to have family who already live there sponsor you. Other than that you are looking at a waiting list of one year or more. Heard its beautiful and tranquil.

This is a great question and it has nothing to do with bleeding heart liberals or any political bashing.\n\nUnfortunately what happens usually when someone is arrested and then questioned by the police they are not read their rights on purpose.  Because the un-written rule is whatever the accused says prior to being read their rights is considered a spontaneous comment.  As soon as the accused ask for an attorney all questioning is suppose to stop.  If it continues anything said after and before that point is inadmissable in court.  \n  This is where coercion comes to play.  The accused can say he was coerced into signing the confession.  Which in many cases happens.  Some police officers get anxious to solve the case.  Most police officers have the best intentions of the victims in mind.  But by not following the law and rules or knowing how to write a report they end up hurting the victim.  Because now the accused can get off on technicalities caused by the investigation of the police.  Does this make sense?\n\nThe victim can pursue a civil law suit against the accused also.  A civil law suit is mostly for damages which means money for the victim.  A criminal court is for punishment.  Sometime you can collect damages while they are in prison or jail.  For instance if the judge states the accused must pay restitution then any money he receives from family, friends or whatever while incarcerated will go to the victim.\n\nAs far as victim's rights.  Well it is a lowsy program.  There are victims rights groups out there.  Ask the nearest probation office where they are so your friend can get some help.  The victim's rights groups would be the bleeding heart liberals you are being told to stay away from.\n\nI am truly sorry for the pain you and your daughter are going through.  You probably here it all the time to get counseling.  But how does counseling really help such a violation.  I can only tell you how the system works.  It is not the best system but it does work at times.  Hopefully the DA will pursue this and put this guy behind bars. \n\nI have an old friend from the service whose daughter was murdered at 18 yrs old.  My son and her grew up together. This world has to be hell.  That is all I have to say.
"President Bush was quite successful actually at accomplishing many of the aims of his party:  1. passage of legislation ""necessitated"" by the events of September 11th that empowered his administration and future administrations to monitor the actions of its citizens more carefully than ever before (ie - Patriot Act), 2. firm support of many of the conservative ideals of the ""conservative side"" of his party - halting progress in stem cell research, support for instruction of intelligent design within schools, defense of marriage as an institution reserved for heterosexuals (by way of constitutional amendment!), etc, et cetera, et cetera.  3. Continued exploitation of foreign economies through legislation such as CAFTA, hypocritical stance on illegal immigration that ostensibly suggests that his administration is against it when, in reality, they couldn't be more for it - that which injects much cheap, productive labor into the economy, 4. That whole war on terror / war on oil debate isn't really a debate is it.  So long as the US is able to continue its penetration into new foreign markets, wrest control over other nations' resources, our economy may continue growing.  Like a sales ad, I'll stop right here and say that there's ""too much to list!""  I have no doubt that Republican interests coincide with strong economic growth in this country, but I have always argued over the ethical cost of that growth.\n\nNo, they probably wouldn't apologize for a thing.  He was quite productive at realizing or perpetuating many of their ideals.\n\nI am neither a Republican or Democrat."
Neither the insurance company nor your attorney want this thing to go to trial.  It is costly and most often times cheaper for the insurance company just to pay you to go away.  Chances are very great that if you present them with a reasonable demand, they will meet you with a reasonable offer.  If you are unreasonable, you will end up in trial.  \n\nAnd yes, your attorney has to make every offer to settle known to you.\n\n[edit]  Also remember, probably part of your agreement states that you will be responsible for reimbursing your attorney for expense incurred.  These can kill your settlement offer.  Things like postage, copying, deposition expenses, expert expenses, all are very very costly.

1.Go to the official websites which were given to you by two people.\n\n2. Read up as much as you can about Canada. Look at a map of Canada.  It is a huge country. Every province is a little bit different. Weather, job opportunities and language.\n\n3. Try to get in touch with friends, relatives or pen pals  who are already here to get feedback from them about their experience.\n\n4. Disregard the stupid answers that some people gave you.\n\n5. Do not come as an illegal. Some criminal elements smuggle people into this country. Illegals have no rights, no health care, no protection and are usually exploited as slave labour. Sometimes they loose their lives in transit  If caught, illegals are deported.\n\n6. Canada is a beautiful country. Immigrants are valued depending on the skills they bring with them. Immigrants contribute much to our multicultural society.    \n\n7. Research, read, inform yourself. Good luck.

Don't waste your time argueing with them.  No matter how hard you try, you'll never be able to give them a soul or a conscience.
that is correct,, that is the living soul.. the breath of life is given by God when a child is born.that is the human life> that small pocket of air will remain in the lungs of the person until they die. That last breath of life>>> that same pocket of air will be the last one to leave the body>>>. doctors have proven this! The soul is alive before birth and to abort a baby is to try to kill that which God has created> These crazy people  can kill the body but not the soul!!!!!
Liberals smear anyone who disagrees with them with a nasty label. \n\nYou may have just and logical reasons for being against affirmative action, but no matter.

Don't know how accurate this history is.\nhttp://www.woodentoys-uk.co.uk/gavel%20history.html\n\nIn the US, the gavel was taken from European backgrounds and was used to quiet the masses in order to call a meeting or court to order.\nVery few judges today actually USE a gavel, but most have one on the bench for appearances sake (the image of a judge banging a gavel to get control over a courtroom is a hollywood scenario ONLY)
Heck no.  Once your buddy finishes basic training they'll send him off to another base where he'll learn how to be an infantryman.  There is a possibility that he could be sent to Iraq after that, but it's POSSIBLE, not DEFINITE.\n\nP.S.:  The vast majority of men and women in the U.S. Armed Forces who have served in Iraq (better than 98%) have come back alive, in one piece, without any debilitating injuries or loss of limbs.  Yes, being an American soldier in Iraq is dangerous, and there's always a chance that your friend could be sent to Iraq and could die there, but don't believe the garbage being spit out by the mainstream media.  They want you to think that going to Iraq is a death sentence for every soldier that has to go, and it's simply not true.  BOTTOM LINE:  Yes, your friend could get sent over to the sandbox and he could end up dead or maimed, but chances are he'll do his time (if he even has to) and come back no worse for wear.

CIA could be good work for you depending on your exact post. \nMaybe you'll be involved in the (exciting but morally dubious) gung-ho culture operations which have occured against 'Terror'. \nMaybe you'll spend hours every day checking out conversations and emails sent by Muslims. \nMaybe you'll be a desk officer waiting for the next event to happen. \nMaybe you'll be transferred to Mossad 'control' and work for them without even knowing about it (apparently happens a lot- an Israeli boast I read.)\nMaybe you'll create false identities for other agents, or handle communications.\n\nIf you love your country the ethics shouldn't be a problem- and I say that as a British guy critical of the CIA. As long as you know what your job may entail in terms of duties then go for it.

"Alright, this sounds like simple miscommunication. First, there is no MOS ""Mike 6"" - that is an ASI designator to the 91W MOS (which is converting to the 68W MOS). The concept here is that you enlist with the 68W MOS (which is the Army's equivalent to First Responder - in fact the AIT is recognized by the DOT for such purposes), then after some service time BUT BEFORE YOU REACH E-5 (P) RANK (that's Sergeant promotable), you go to the M6 school (M6 is an ""Additional School Identifier or ASI) which trains and then licenses you as a licensed practicing nurse (LPN). There is no way to get the M6 ASI without first attending AIT and being qualified as a 68W, then reporting to your unit. If it is not in your enlistment contract, then the M6 school is NOT guaranteed. Instead you will have to apply through your chain of command for it. If it is in your contract than you are set. It doesn't sound like he/she is lying to you but it certainly sounds like there is some miscommunication going on. For further info - I have linked the 91W/68W MOS web site and the M6 ASI websites below. If you are really concerned, do just like you would with a doctor - get a second opinion from a different recruiter in a different city. Sounds like everything is good to go - just confirm that your M6 ASI School is guaranteed in your enlistment contract."
Mark Adam Foley (born September 8, 1954) is an American politician who served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 1995 until 2006, representing the 16th District of Florida.\n\nFoley resigned from Congress on September 29, 2006 as allegations surfaced that he had sent suggestive emails and sexually explicit instant messages to young men who had formerly served as Congressional pages. As a result of the disclosures, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement opened investigations of the messages to find possible criminal charges. The House Ethics Committee has also opened an investigation into the response of the House Republican leadership and their staff to earlier warnings of Foley's conduct.\n\nFor more info visit this site :\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Foley
Sorry to disappoint you.....That will never happen....Our economy relies to much on them.....And no, they should not be sent back if they are only here to work......Should Americans be sent back to USA, from Mexico?  Many American fugitives flee to Mexico, what should we do with those?  Many American's retire in Mexico...
Of course they do.  That's the point to make the person who did harm pay for the harm they did.\nIt is also to discourage others from doing the same nasty stuff.\nUsually you have to prove you had 'real' losses in order to prevail so that means you have lost money in some way and have damages.\nYES they should have to pay all your damages and treble if that is an option.

What happens is they take you to civil court it is not a felony ,they dont issue no warrants and they place a judgement against you and you have to pay back-if your dont pay judgement it puts a mark on your credit and they will garnish wages (in some states)and get it back -point is ,it has nothing to do with the law-its a loan they handle it in civil court-dont get messed up with the payday loan stuff -it very hard to get back out of the hole.

"War is a conflict involving use of weapons and physical force by states or other large-scale groups, coinciding with a lack of dialogue between the parties. Warring parties usually hold territory, which they can win or lose; and each has a leading person or organisation which can surrender, or collapse, thus ending the war. Wars are usually a series of military campaigns between two opposing sides involving a dispute over, amongst others issues, sovereignty, territory, resources, religion, or ideology. A war to liberate an occupied country is called a ""war of liberation""; a war between internal factions within a state is a civil war. Until the end of World War II, participants usually issued formal declarations of war.\n\nOther terms for war, often used euphemistically to circumvent limitations on war, include armed conflict, hostilities, and police action. A time when no formal war is taking place, although there may be international and internal tensions, is sometimes called peacetime or peace. However, some consider the definition of peace to be more complicated. Baruch Spinoza (1632–77) said, ""Peace is not an absence of war, it is a virtue, a state of mind, a disposition for benevolence, confidence, justice.""\n\nWar almost always results in many unnecessary deaths. In the wars and conflicts of the 20th century, an estimated 130–142 million people died, of which 51 million occurred after the end of World War II"
This was probably a no-knock warrant. Remember, the police purchased drugs from the residence earlier that day. If they conducted a knock and enter, this would give the occupants time to destroy evidence. The police did not know who all was in the house. We have to assume it's the same people that sold the drugs earlier. The idea that there were fake cops kicking in doors, well, I'd like to see some articles about that happening in the last few months in her neighborhood. Tragic scenario indeed.

"Most states have a penal code section for justifiable homicide.  You would be commiting homicide, you would just have to explain why you did it.  I am sure the kid would be a witness for you. Officers commit justifiable homicide when they kill someone in an officer involved shooting incident.  The issue you have however, is you're not a cop, therein you would have a harder time justifying why you used the amount of force you used.  I say, ""you would have a harder time,"" because police officers are in use of force situations daily, therein, they deal with the use of force more often and can articulate their reasons for shooting a bad guy.  Nonetheless, even the officer would be represented by extremely well-trained council."
With our technology and tools, a war that we're engaged in should NEVER be a long war. We should use whatever tool is NEEDED to make it be a short war.\n\nIt is advantageous for this particular war to be LONG, because the disruption in an oil producing country will insure higher oil prices.....and this is an advantage to Oil Men.....Oil Men such as those who own lots of oil stocks....Oil Men like Bush and Cheney!

"I have researched this for many an hour over the last 2 months and I am deeply disturbed by my findings.  \n\nFor the most comprehensive answer watch ""9/11 Mysteries"":\nhttp://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=-6708190071483512003&q=9%2F11+mysteries\nIt was started by 4 wodows from the WTC - they wanted to know exactly how and why their husbands died.\n\nIt will start a chain reaction.  I am 31 and I have never seen such shocking news!  I have checked and tripple checked the details on offical sites, news sites and other respected resources.\n\nYou can make your own conclusions about who created 9/11, who allowed it to happen, who knew about it in advance, who financed it and MOST IMPORTANTLY - look at who benifited and how it changed the world.\n\nSince 9/11 the American constitution has been taken from you.  If Bush doesn't like you he can arrange for you to be locked up indefinately, without proof of a crime, he doesn't even need to accuse you of a specific crime.  \n\nI am very glad to hear anyone ask this question.  Please keep asking more and tell your friends your findings.  Most of the mass media (TV and newspapers) are owned by 5 very powerful corperations - they control what you see.

I'm wondering where you are from but this is how it works.\n\nThere is a system of checks and balances, so that no one has all of the power. Before the election the Republicans had the most people in the system that checks the presidents power, but now it has changed to Democrats, who can now vote against him and limited his power.\n\nGeorge Bush will be in office until the 2008 Elections.

I don't get offended.  If you want to fly the flag of another country, this is the land of the free, go for it.  I probably will get a bunch of thumbs down for this opinion, but if you think about it, flying a flag of another country is not showing disrespect for America.  It is showing pride in where they came from, but not disrespect of America.  I was born and bred here in the US.  I can trace back my lines to my american Indian heritage, and also to my English heritage.  However, my husband is from Honduras.  I, not him, but me, bought a Honduras flag, and it is hanging in our children's room.  I also bought one of those flags that go onto the windshield of our car - and it was a Honduras flag.  But that doesn't mean that I am showing any disrespect for America.

Although Cromwell had no military training, his experience as a large landowner gave him a good knowledge of horses. Cromwell became convinced that if he could produce a well-disciplined army he could defeat Prince Rupert and his Cavaliers\n\nCromwell trained his cavalry to keep together after a charge. In this way his men could repeatedly charge the Cavaliers. Cromwell's new cavalry took part in its first major battle at Marston Moor in Yorkshire in July 1644. The king's soldiers were heavily defeated in the battle. Cromwell's soldiers became known as the Ironsides because of the way they cut through the Cavaliers on the battlefield.\n\nThe Parliamentary forces were also able to capture the Royalist baggage train that contained his complete stock of guns and ammunition. \n\nThe Battle of Naseby was the turning point in the war. After Naseby, Charles was never able to raise another army strong enough to defeat the parliamentary army in a major battle.

"There are different opinions on this question. Perhaps the most obvious is that the Scottish Parliament has control over Health Expenditure and is prepared to devote more money that it's equivalent in England. As to why this is, is a matter of opinion. Some people may argue that Scotland health departmant is more efficient. Other people may say the ""Barnett Formula"" introduced in 1978 provides more money for Scotland than England and Wales. It could, of course be argued that if Scotland was allowed to keep all the money from oil revenue, than there would be even more money available for heath expenditure, but this is not an argument I am prepared to debate on these pages!"
honestly nothing. Govt wise since we have a republican president and a democratic house we will have a more balanced govt. but with that nothing gets done.

Well I can safely say that it sure the hell wasn't the USA!!!  Although I have to say that all our military is doing an outstanding job.

under a sonogram, the dr can see where the instruments are going and will be less likely to puntcure the uterus, or any other organ wall, and he/she can also see that the entire fetus is removed. this is a very contriversual area for debate, and a woman should have the choice to have an abortion, and of course then there will be drs. to do it,  where there is a need, there is a means, remember the roe vs wade case, before that, women got abortions in dirty attacks, sometimes with coathangers not even by a dr. of course, this should not be a means of birthcontrol,

There are programs that offer education help and child care assistance and travel assistance.  The thing about welfare is that if the people who used it didn't abuse it and honestly used it to get back on their feet then it wouldn't be an issue.  I was on Cash Aid and Food Stamps after I left an abusive relationship.  I was a single mom of a 7 year old with one on the way and moved from VA to CA to get away from the most eveil man I have ever met.  I had always said that welfare is bad and should be abolished UNTIL I needed it and was grateful that it was there.  I did exactly what I was suppose to do: They make you attend classes and help you find a job.  I stayed on the assistance long enough to get back on my feet then I cut the benefits off (only about a year).  My case worker said that even though they have tons of rules and regulations and safe guards there are still people who abuse the system which makes it hard or impossible for the people who actually need it to get it.  I don't think its fair to just say that our government is gonna cut everyone off and no assistance at all because there are people who don't use it right.  My dads girlfriend is in England and on all types of welfare and every assistance you can image yet she doesn't work and just lives of my dad who is here in the states - now that is wrong!!\n\nI wonder what all the people who are totally against welfare would do if they came to a point in their lives when everything gets turned upside down and they have to do what they have to to feed their children and provide a roof over their head.  Would they take the assistance they have so admittly said they hate or would let their kids starve?  You just dont know until something like that happens.  3 years ago, I would never had thought I'd be in a position to need assistance but it helped me get a job (and paid for daycare until I could afford it)\n\nHere in CA, if you arent disabled and can work you have to have at least 32 hours a week of some sort of work related education/job search/work etc.  I wonder how these people can abuse the system - even though I was doing everything they asked and more they were on me so very hard... wanted pay stubs and updates from my boss.  All that made me work even harder to get to a point when I could just live and not worry about handing in my pay stubs to them everyt other month.\n\nTo all those people who say its time for men to step up and take care of kids and for women to stop having kids they cant afford: Nice theory but reality is some men will continue to make promises and support their family then leave (or become an abusive jerk), women will get pregnant by those guys, we will make a bad decision that put us in the most unwanted of situations regardless if welfare is around or not.

Nobody is winning the war in Iraq.  Sacrificing our soldiers lives are not worth it
Do us all a favor, stop thinking. You'll just hurt yourself. The whole point of a volunteer military is to make sure that the only people in it are the ones who want to be there. Draftees are a lot more likely to be unmotivated, unqualified, and just make bad soldiers in general. The last thing we need is a military made mostly of people who don't give a damn about their sworn duty.

Can you rephrase your question in a manner that makes sense?
To correct errors of law by judges of the lower courts. Except in New York where the Court of Appeals is the highest court (and the Supreme Court, as in England, the lowest court of general jurisdiction). There it is to assure conformity with the state constitution, and consistency within the state judicial system.

The memorized Islamic response to all of this seems to be one of 2.\n\n1. The Crusades, The Crusades, what about The Crusades - You mean The Crusades that ended 800 years ago.  You're justifying modern violence because of something that ended 800 years ago?  In any event, The Crusades were the Christian's response to Musim conquest and violence...end of story...try to focus on, say, the last 7 centuries.\n\n2. Well, every religion has some elements of violence, Islam is no different...ok...name 5 acts of violence that have been committed in the name of Christianity in the last 10 years...you might need some extra time....  Ok, now name 50 acts of violence that have been committed in the name of Islam in the last 10 months...you can even exclude Iraq and Afghanistan...pretty easy, huh.\n\nMuhammad was a warrior and a military leader right up until his death.  Name one other religion whose founder had a background even remotely similar....you can't?  There's your answer.

"you have a TON of researching to do....you need to research the free masons, new world order, bush, nazi, etc.  this site will help some:  http://www.infowars.com/ .  plus google the video section for all I mentioned above.  At least 100 videos on the topics.\n\nto all those that say there is no conspiracy......then explain this.  why did George HW Bush give a speach  to congress on Sept 11th, 1991 and he spoke about a NEW WORLD ORDER.  Then exactly 10 yrs to that day, while his son is in office....exactly what it would take to begin a new world order...happens...total chaos.\n\nthose that don't believe that our government could have or would have done this are blind to what is really in this world.  they have been brainwashed well by the propaganda.  and those that have been fooled will be hard to teach the truth too as its hard to accept that one has been deceived and lied to.\n\nwhen JFK was shot they said it was oswald only...but now years later real facts have come out to prove it was actually a CIA hit and there were up to 4 shooters.  The final fatal shot was given by the limo driver...a trained CIA assasign.  Video clearly shows him with a gun and JFK's head blowing backwards.\n\nPlus think...Mrs Kennedy is sitting there...riding along...her husband gets shot and senator in front of her gets shot...then they all hear 2 more shots bounce off the pavement and all this time she sits in the car...cause she knows the shots are coming from outside the car.  then the fatal shot, and she clearly sees the gun in the drivers hand...at this moment she realizes what is going on and attempts to leap from the car...only to be stopped and pushed back in by secret service.\n\nbut then you have to wonder....why weren't the secret service men on the back of the limo like they were prior to the turn into the plaza?  all the videos show them on the back of the car.  but what most don't see or have never seen is the video of them being ordered off the car as it turns by a high ranking CIA officer from the car behind the president.  you even see one CIA guy shrugging out of confusion...he knows his job is to protect the president yet he was ordered to stop doing his job.  plus they couldn't be on the back of the car as that would stop the line of sight for shots from the driver, oswald, grassy knoll and beside the building.\n\nhistory today has proven that the government killed its own president.  and people today can't believe that our government would kill a few thousand to create a cause that they feel is justified?\n\npeople that think its not possible don't understand how the real world works, how the world banking community works, who owns what companies, etc.  as it is all tied together and if the real truth did fully get out....there would be a massive uprise of the people to over throw all governments in the world.\n\nEven Ford (creator of the model A & T) himself stated back in 1919 "" If the World knew who actually controled the money in the World, the World would revolte and destroy all governments"".\n\nFord was actually trying to give the public a hint so they would look into more...but they didn't understand the hint at that time.\n\nHopefully the world is smarter to today to take the hints."

"We have primaries. The presidential primary system is the generally the same as in other states. I should also note that we have closed primaries -only registered Democrats can vote in the Democratic primary and only registered Republicans can vote in the Republican primary. In some states unaffiliated voters can choose one primary to vote in, but unaffiliateds are not permitted to vote in primaries in Connecticut.  The Presidential Primary is usually on ""Super Tuesday"" - the Tuesday in early March when the most states simultaneously hold their primaries."

They will send your wife a package of instructions.  After your wife is finished (personal documents, police clearance, physical exam, etc...) she'll turn it all back in to the embassy or consulate.\n\nThey will process everything and call her for an interview.\n\nAssuming everything is okay, and she passes the interview, a visa will be issued.\n\nIt's going to take at least 6 months from start to finish.  \n\nSo, get everything ready NOW and mail it to CIS 6 months before she finishes school.

Convention against Torture, is scheduled to begin consideration of the United States on Friday. The last U.S. review was in 2000.\n\nIt said in November it was seeking U.S. answers to questions including whether Washington operated secret detention centers abroad and whether President George W. Bush had the power to absolve anyone from criminal responsibility in torture cases.\n\nThe committee also wanted to know whether a December 2004 memorandum from the U.S. Attorney General's office, reserving torture for ""extreme"" acts of cruelty, was compatible with the global convention barring all forms of cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment.\n\n\nUNTIL THE END \nIn its own submission to the committee, published late last year, Washington justified the holding of thousands of foreign terrorism suspects in detention centers abroad, including Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, on the grounds that it was fighting a war that was still not over.\n\n""Like other wars, when they start, we do not know when they will end.

"This is a difficult question because, from your statement, I'm guessing that you don't have a lien on the computers -- you just sold them to him and he has an outstanding balance.  Thus, in general, you don't have a possessory interest in the computers (you're just his creditor--you have an interest in the $1,900). Thus, it is likely that you can't repossess the computers.  You can allege a breach of contract (you performed and he didn't pay) and seek monetary damages ($1900 + interest) and perhaps seek recission of the contract (asking the court to ""unmake"" the contract) to result in the return of his money and his return of your pcs (although i'd guess that you couldn't resell them for the same retail value, since they're a year old).\n\nNonetheless, you do have to file an action -- try small claims court (sometimes call reconciliation court, or city court, or something like that, depending upon your state).  Usually they can handle cases up to $2-3,000, and there are not a lot of formal requirements.  Then you have a judgment upon which you could collect (by either him paying you or you attaching a judgment debtor lien on some of his property).  Unless he's willing, it's highly unlikely that you could repossess the computers without this process.\n\nAlso, consider talking to an attorney -- perhaps at legal aid. A per-hour attorney is probably not going to take this case because of its low monetary value, although if you have a regular attorney, he may be willing to take it ""pro bono,"" perhaps as training for a younger associate with his office."

Depending on which state you live in, you may be entitled to a copy of a criminal records check through your state police agency. \n\nAs an example, Illinois allows an individual to view what is contained in their arrest record; charges, case status, and convictions. Juvenile information is not included unless you were charged as an adult.  However this information cannot leave the office, in this case the Bureau of Investigation. I think it was in Joliet, and it was a twenty (20.00) charge. \n\nCheck with your state police agency website to see if they offer that, or something similar. Another way is to contact your home town pd to see if your state offers something similar.\n\nIf you did not go to court on it; meaning you moved to 'miss trial' do not be surprised if there is or was a warrant issued for your arrest. Bouncing a check or 'floating' is usually a misdemeanor offense, unless you have prior convictions for a theft or fraud offenses, then they might bump it to felony charges. \n\nGo to a library and look up your state's criminal code, that should tell you what time you may have to do.\n\nHope that helps.

"Capitalism is an economic system in which the means of production are mostly privately owned, and capital is invested in the production, distribution, and other trade of goods and services for profit in a market. These include factors of production such as land and other natural resources, labor and capital goods. Various theories have tried to explain what capitalism is, to justify or critique the private ownership of capital, to explain the operation of markets, and to guide the application or elimination of government regulation of property and markets.\n\nCommunism is an ideology that seeks to establish a future classless, stateless social organization, based upon common ownership of the means of production. It can be classified as a branch of the broader socialist movement. Early forms of human social organization have been described as 'primitive communism' by Marxists. However, communism as a political goal generally is a conjectured form of future social organization. There is a considerable variety of views among self-identified communists, including Maoism, Trotskyism, council communism, Luxemburgism, anarchist communism, Christian communism, and various currents of left communism, which are generally the more widespread varieties. However, various offshoots of the Soviet (what critics call the 'Stalinist') and Maoist interpretations of Marxism-Leninism comprise a particular branch of communism that has the distinction of having been the primary driving force for communism in world politics during most of the 20th century. The competing branch of Trotskyism has not had such a distinction.\nKarl Marx held that society could not be transformed from the capitalist mode of production to the communist mode of production all at once, but required a transitional period which Marx described as the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat. The communist society Marx envisioned emerging from capitalism has never been implemented, and it remains theoretical; Marx, in fact, commented very little on what communist society would actually look like. However, the term 'Communism', especially when it is capitalized, is often used to refer to the political and economic regimes under communist parties that claimed to embody the dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Marxist theories motivated socialist parties across Europe, although their policies later developed along the lines of ""reforming"" capitalism, rather than overthrowing it. The exception was the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. One branch of this party, commonly known as the Bolsheviks and headed by Vladimir Lenin, succeeded in taking control of the country after the toppling of the Provisional Government in the Russian Revolution of 1917. In 1918, this party changed its name to the Communist Party, thus establishing the contemporary distinction between communism and other trends of socialism."

The Marines need the information, so they can provide it to the civilian agency that will do the background check and conduct the interviews.  If you do not provide the information, then it is possible that they will find it out some other way, through public records, but it will take longer and your niece's security clearance could be delayed, or even denied.  \n\nyes, this is perfectly Legit.  Yes, your niece was the one to ask you, the military is not in the habit of calling random people up out of the blue and demanding identification numbers.  \n\ndeopending on the relationship your niece has with her aunt and how high her Clearance needs to be will depend on whether or not you will be contacted for an interview.  All the Marines are interested in is finding out whether or not your niece could ever be put into a compromising situation witha foreign governmnet\n\n\n\nIf your wife has nothing to hide(she's here legally, etc) then there is nothing to worry about.  Quit being so bloody paranoid.  Be grateful that your niece is serving her country, giving you the freedom to badmouth your president.

I can help you with this, as I am a Supervisor in a Nursing Home.\n\nAs you know, Residents of a nursing home have the very same rights as any other U.S. Citizen. \n\nUnfortunately, because of their confinement to the facility, in many cases, the lucid and cognitive RESIDENTS harbor a great deal of anger. This stems from their feelings of abandonment by family and friends, the inability to do for themselves and an overall feeling of inadequacy.\n\nAs a supervisor, I have been the target of this 'anger' many times, but have learned to let it roll off my back. I also have learned to make sure I do not put myself in a compromising position where a resident can accuse me of any kind of abuse.\n\nIf you are being FALSELY accused of abuse by a resident, the first thing you should do is sit down with your supervisor and clear the air. Ask that you be placed on another unit (if possible) away from that resident for a while.\n\nAs far as taking him to court?.... don't go there. You won't win ANYTHING, and you will be pegged as a troublemaker.\n\n\nFinally, monitor your tone and demeanor when addressing residents in the future. If you are percieved as being loud, boisterous or even a sharp talker, you will experience this again and again.\n\nGood luck.

Take a look at this:\n\nTop 10 Democratic Sex Scandals in Congress\n \nFound this list at Human Events Online\nWhat Rep. Foley did was evil immoral and reprehensible. I hope he is fully punished unlike the below listed Democrats.\nhttp://www.humanevents.com/lists.php?id=17357\n10. Sen. Daniel Inouye. The 82-year-old Hawaii Democrat was accused in the 1990s by numerous women of sexual harassment. Democrats cast doubt on the allegations and the Senate Ethics Committee dropped its investigation. \n9. Former Rep. Gus Savage. The Illinois Democrat was accused of fondling a Peace Corps volunteer in 1989 while on a trip to Africa. The House Ethics Committee decided against disciplinary action in 1990.\n8. Rep. Barney Frank. The outspoken Massachusetts Democrat hired a male prostitute who ran a prostitution service from Frank’s residence in the 1980s. Only two Democrats in the House of Representatives voted to censure him in 1990.\n7. Former Sen. Brock Adams. The late Washington Democrat was forced to stop campaigning after numerous accusations of drugging, assault and rape, the first surfacing in 1988.\n6. Former Rep. Fred Richmond. This New York Democrat was arrested in 1978 for soliciting sex from a 16-year-old. He remained in Congress and won re-election—before eventually resigning in 1982 after pleading guilty to tax evasion and drug possession.\n5. Former Rep. John Young. The late Texas Democrat increased the salary of a staffer after she gave in to his sexual advances. The congressman won re-election in 1976 but lost two years later. \n4. Former Rep. Wayne Hays. The late Ohio Democrat hired an unqualified secretary reportedly for sexual acts. Although he resigned from Congress, the Democratic House leadership stalled in removing him from the Administration Committee in 1976. \n3. Former Rep. Gerry Studds. He was censured for sexual relationship with underage male page in 1983. Massachusetts voters returned him to office for six more terms.\n2. Former Rep. Mel Reynolds. The Illinois Democrat was convicted of 12 counts of sexual assault with a 16-year-old. President Bill Clinton pardoned him before leaving office.\n1. Sen. Teddy Kennedy. The liberal Massachusetts senator testified in defense of nephew accused of rape, invoking his family history to win over the jury in 1991.\n\nSee the difference between the Republican Foley and these Democrats is that Foley was ostracized and resigned. These Democrats, including the ones you mentioned, were re-elected countless times and rewarded by the Democrats. And then there is Nancy Pelosi's support of the Man Boy Love Association.

You need to prove your genealogy back to a person who is on the final rolls of the tribe.\n\nYou need to get your birth certificate, then your parents' birth certificates, then your grand-parents', and so on until you get back to your tribal member ancestor. \n\nBefore 1900 or so, there were very few birth certificates kept. They were not required. You can get baptismal records or census records instead.\n\nYou can get both census records, and all of the final tribal rolls at the National Archives and records Administration (NARA) Go to www.nara.gov for info.\n\nWith all of this, you are now eligible to JOIN the tribe. You will need to write to them and request to be enrolled. I suppose that gets you all of the benefits of tribal membership, but you aren't owed any money.
Let me just clarify something! No one is given free citizenship in this country! You have to first become a permanent resident (green card) then after 3 -5 years of continuous residence and a clean record you may apply to become a citizen! Illegals may get green cards, but that does not make them a citizen. All green card holders are NOT citizens! Citizenship is only given to people who want to become citizens! Immigrants who respect the constitution and who really truly love this country! I am a legal immigrant who once held a green card but I'm now a naturalized citizen who was awarded a certificate of naturalization and a passport! There is also a civics test and an oath of allegiance at a naturalization ceremony!

"Most of the people on here only ask questions to start trouble.  Just because you disagree with somebody doesn't mean you have to attack them.  We should be able to have a free exchange of ideas on here.  If people would quit with the attacks and name calling, they might just realize that we share a lot of the same goals for our country, we just have different ideas on how to achieve them.  Instead of belittling somebodies position, people should try and use facts and reason to convince them otherwise.  It might not work, but it's much better than just saying ""liberals/conservatives are stupid.""  There should be some kind of quiz about politics that people have to take to get access to this section.

But anyway: I agreed with 90% of that letter. True, it was an obvious political ploy, but he made a ton of sense. And I DO think he has a higher IQ than Bushie--but of course, that ain't saying much.

It is sexual harassment because it is offensive, sexual and made by a teacher regarding a student. The Director should reprimand or warn the teacher that it is inappropriate conduct. At the very least you should have the option of changing teachers or modifying your education plan to minimize interaction with him/her (honestly, someone who would make that comment to a student is very unprofessional and has poor self control, I wouldn't blame you for avoiding him). \n\nIf the Director does none of these things--go back when the teacher does or says anything else to make you uncomfortable.  You have a witness and you are documenting it which is very good. You have a right to continue your education in peace and if the Director does nothing, you can make it a legal issue.\n\nSexual harassment doesn't require comments be made directly to you. He/she is openly creating a hostile learning environment.

"The reason is to keep one branch from being too powerful.  One branch making all of the branches decisions is a dictatorship.  Dictatorship is when one party controls the making, execution, and interpretation of the law.  The ""Federalism"" idea, keeps one branch from being too powerful, and keeping one legislation from being too powerful.  That is why the House of Representatives, Senate, and  Congress all work for different aspects of the government, and why they are seperated is simply to keep one legislation from ruling all aspects of the Government."

There hasn't been a 5-Star General since WWII.  Once you do make 5-Star, you'll probably too close to retirement.  If it's a field promotion (meaning someone died in battle and your next one up), the military have their right take your field promotion away.  But, being a 4-Star promoted to 5-Star, that probably won't happened (because of politics).\n\n(My uncle was in the Air Force during the Vietnam War.  He was TSgt in EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal).  He received a field promotion to Colonel (because back then the Air Force didn't have EOD Officers just enlisted because they were under the base commander.  So they needed someone with a power and respect.  When the war was over and he returned to Florida.  He got demoted back to TSgt, but he was able to keep his paygrade of a Colonel.)\n\nThere isn't any public record of the exact number of 4 star generals and Admirals because some of that information needs to be classified, but the roundabout number is: 800 (for all services, including the Coast Guards, National Guards, and Reserves).

Both are racists, spouting extreme views and both should have been convicted.\n\nThe difference? Rahman is an extremist nutter, who talks shite and nobody actually listens to.

The fact that he didn't succeed is neither here nor there.\n\nGriffin is an intelligent manipulator of his group of thugs who hang on his racist words like mad dogs.\n\nThe fact that Griffin spoke at  a closed meeting is irrelevant. His words were intended to incite crimes of violence and arson against non-whites by his half-witted foot soldiers. He should have been convicted.

You're 17 years old and wet behind the ears.  Don't you think it would be a good idea if you went through boot camp first?  Either Navy or Marine Corps boot camp will get you a lot closer to the Seals, but first you have to complete that part of the journey.\n\nThe Navy Seals really aren't looking for 17 year old's to fill their ranks, they would rather have seasoned veterans who have been around the block once or twice.  So my suggestion to you is slow down, if you still want to be a Seal once you are in and through training, go for it then.In the meantime get yourself ready for Navy or Marine boot camp.  \n\nBy the way, regular boot camp, particularly Marine Corps boot camp,is not exactly a walk in the park, so get yourserlf in condition, it will make life a lot easier once you're in the thick of it.

My husband has been in federal prison for 26 years.   \n\nRespecting the staff and behaving as if you have been reformed doesn't matter regarding earning good time.   You earn good time by specific acts, not by sucking up the staff or trying to BS anyone by pretending you finally found Jesus.    If it were that simple, everyone would walk out after a year.   \n\nMy husband files administrative remedies constantly against the staff for THEIR misconduct and lack of training and other violations, but has still earned good time.   So schmoozing the staff doesn't have anything to do with good time.\n\nThey earn good time by staying out of documented trouble, which results in time spent in SHU (the hole).   They can also participate in the (remaining) programs offered.\n\nA lot of the snitches also find out they can get good time for ratting out their cellie or another inmate.    They don't care if that guy gets another ten years for having a cigarette as long as they get five more minutes of good time.    Snitches are very common at low facilities, as most plea-bargained in the first place when they were convicted.    I wouldn't recommend that as a means of earning good time, tho, as there's often retaliation.   Even snitches don't like snitches.\n\nIf an inmate can stay out of documentable trouble, he can accrue good time, which DOES make a difference at the end.\n\nGood luck.

All of the US states run welfare programs.  Each state has their own rules.  If you are able to work and qualify for welfare, you collect welfare while you are looking or training for employment.  The welfare payments are limited to two years in my state.\n\nSome people cannot work  and have never worked, so they do not qualify for Social Security.  Say a person is blind and confined to a wheel chair.  That person will never be able to work, so he is entitled to welfare for as long as he lives, or until state laws change.

I understand your sentiments.  I myself am an American finishing up a PhD in England.  Alas, you cannot trade your own citizenship.  Citizenship is, for the most part, an inalienable right.  While the US government has in the past attempted to revoke the citizenship rights of certain parties convicted of treason, the Supreme Court has actually ruled such actions as unconstitutional as 'Cruel and Unusual Punishment'.\n\nMy suggestion to you, if you are set on moving to and working in a specific country, would be to do a 'dry-run' so to speak.  If you know that country's immigration rules you probably already know that you can move there temporarily to look for work, usually for a period of 3 to 6 months.  In many countries, such as Britain, once you're in the country it is much easier to find work there.  Once you've found work get a temporary work visa.  In many countries, again, like Britain, once you've lived in country for 1 year you are eligible to go through the naturalization process.  You can be naturalized in any country in the world, you just have to be willing to go through the beauracratic processes to reach that point.  They may seem daunting, but if you're set on moving to and staying in a different country, there is no reason to hesitate to seek naturalization.

At the end of that time, if you are still together and she hasn't needed any form of public assistance (benefits, council housing, etc) then she should get settlement here.\n\nIf your beloved is legally resident in Canada, and you can show that you can accommodate her, etc, you'll probably be OK. If she's there illegally, you may have problems! If she's there on a temporary basis, they'll treat her as if she's applying from Russia, ie skeptically, I should think.\n\nAnyway, I think she could apply at the British High Commission in Canada, she'll probably be called there for an interview, where they'll look at her documentation, and question her about the nature of her relationship with you.\n\nLook, I'm not an immigration advisor, so check out the Home Office website www.homeoffice.gov.uk, and get some free advice from somewhere like a CAB or Law Centre - it's really important not to get these things wrong, and the law is changing all the time.\n\nBy the way, if she comes here on some other visa, eg tourist visa, she will NOT be allowed to marry you here. So check it all out first.\n\nGood luck!

Eric, dammit, if you want me to tell you all this; then I have to write a book, as well.\n\nI used to be a Republican and I lived most of my life in Washington, DC from the Truman years to the Nixon years.  All my family were civil servants in one capacity or another.\n\nThe conservatism we see today is nothing like the conservatism in the days of Reagan or before: it is all about dirty politics and hate mongering.   The good conservative people of our nation who have family values and inspire the American ideal, are being manipulated by the Republican party to no good end.\n\nI was alive in the late 40's and 50's and I remember the Reagan years quite well:  they were not that good. Working people were struggling during the Reagan years with higher gas prices, food costs, and higher retail prices.  This era was not a good one.  \n\nReagan was not St. Reagan; he was a man who had a great cabinet, a lot of charisma, and great common sense.    He also had a nutter for a wife who tried to control everything he did and after he was shot he was really not up to governing the US so Nancy was allowed to have too much power.  \n\nBy the way Reagan was not a conservative and his thoughts were much more liberal than anyone today would imagine.  He was an actor from Hollywood who had tons or problems with his family and did not treat his adoptive won well (Nancy again). \n\nReagan (when he was Pres. of the Screen Actors Guild) had the courage to fight the McCarthy Gestapo when they were tearing at the gates of Hollywood and the entertainment industry and ruining a lot of Reagan's constituents. Not many people stood up to McCarthy (who was the ultra Conservative of his day) but Reagan did.\n\nI often wonder if Reagan was alive today and had all his faculties; what he would say....He would not like being the icon of the Repulican party as it is today...I think he would be more of a Arnold Schwarzenegger type Republican and Reagan was all about honor.  He would not have put up with the Carl Rove types for 5 minutes.
Right now it is Bill Frist, when the new congress takes over in January it is speculated that it will be Harry Reid, but that is not a given as they vote on their leaders just like the american public does.
We actually do better economically with a divided congress. If they don't change the operating rules, the economy is self correcting for the most part. It will also be harder for any off the wall plans someone might have in any area to get started. Hope they cancel each other out for a long time.

I think it's a shame that we are going to have to wait for a dirty bomb to blow up in our country before we throw this political correctness in the garbage where it belongs
"I dont believe that our politicians are liars any more than anyone else.  They probably live more honestly than most.  Anyhow, we live in whats known as a ""representative republic"".  That means our elected officials are chosen by whom best represents the people there, or at least the people that voted.  So, if you think all politicians are liars you can do two things:  1. be vocal about the fact that you want someone who is honest and will do what they say they will do (George W. Bush did do that look it up) and 2. you vote.  People often get the leadership they deserve."

I am afraid they will cut funding to the troops, raise my taxes get rid of my additional child tax credit, and raise taxes on my business.

"Norfolk, Va. - While the results of the research are preliminary, scientists at the Diminutive Male Genitalia Disorder Research Organization have discovered a genetic link between small penis size and the being liberal. The organization recently began to tabulate data from a two-year study of men with Diminutive Male Genitalia Disorder (DMGD) and has posted the results on its Web site, DMGD.org.\n\nThe subjects of the study varied from men with a slight abnormality in penis size to men with pubis innius, a term for an inverted male pubic region. By tracing what has been identified as the ""DMGD gene,"" an abnormality in the 21st chromosome was discovered. Researchers found that this abnormality appears to be consistently linked to two traits: abnormally small male reproductive organs and the ability to derive joy from liberal activities, which starts with acting out in school and, in isolated instances, can manifest itself in homosexual acts. Research team leader Dr. Brad Uplurch and his colleagues in New Orleans, La., plan to investigate whether DMGD was a factor in making San Fransicko California the home of liberal indecency.\n\n""These findings confirm what we have believed for a long time: Liberals just don't measure up.""  ""They are apparently overcompensating for their failure to succeed in life by adopting deviant behaviors and delusional attitudes."""

People have a tendency to fear what they don't know. I have explored Islam and find nothing wrong with the religion. Not all people are haters. Just like all Muslims don't hate us all. Islam is a very docile and peace loving religion from what I have learned. Fanatics can twist any religion to suit their needs.
So who's plan are we following?  Interesting question eh?
No offence, but try following the proper immigration channels.  The old days of marrying yourself into citizenship are over in most countries.
I am a born&raised New Yorker, and, even after I relocated to Florida, I still considered Rudy to be one of the best mayors anywhere, even BEFORE 9/11. He had a way of cutting through the bs and helping to get the city back on track. During the 9/11 aftermath, he was the glue that held NYC together. I don't agree with his politics these days, but I will always be grateful for the leadership he showed in those very dark days.
Mine would be ABC by the Jacksons....you know ABC as easy as 123 as simple as you and me....because that is what it is going to take politicians working with people.
This wont happen for numerous reasons, but I am fond of what if scenarios.\n If our troops were to pull out of Iraq, the civil war would continue and Iraqis would continue killing other Iraqis because it is three different ethnic groups with different ideas all wanting control of the country. Eventually what would happen would be the group with the most money power and brute force would take over establishing a goverment of dictator control and most likely and ethnic cleansing of the group they hate unless said group goes along and behaves and accepts the dictator.
he looks a sight better than when he crawled out of that spider hole,, he lives quiet well,, 3 square and a cot,, US troops don't live as good as enemy #2,,, Osama would be enemy #1,,, it's all about his freedom,,, he doesn't deserve it,,,, redeploy about 100,000 troops from Iraq to go after him for the attacks of 9-11,,, watching Saddam sit on trial for crimes in what year was that,, compared to having Osama brought to justice just doesn't seem right

"Those claims come from people who are mentally inflexible, which is to say authoritarian personalities that cannot recalculate based on new information.\n\nThey have a plan for a multi-ethnic parliamentary Iraq.  They will not deviate.  They will not partition.  They will not LISTEN to their own GENERALS.  The murders and bodies don't matter.  The fact that no one will defend the border does not ring any bells or inform them that there is no nation to be built.\n\nGood explanations  can be found in Kevin Philips ""American Theocracy"" and in John W.

I'm not a Republican, but they do fight for tax cuts that tends to help people.\n\nThere are several ways they can help the working guy. Like health insurance for those that don't have it. Lower to zero interest rates for college loans. Locally, lowering property, and sales taxes.
No, why whould they, all of a sudden. I mean, did anyone ever in history came to the sences because they decided they had enough lies? Never.

They are concerned about taxes. Their concern is how much more money thay can get out of you and give to those who don't work.\n\nOur enemies are happy tonight. They now know just how much we will fight to defend our freedom, our nation and our way of life. I'm sure they never expected it to be so little...

Hey there.  I just researched my DD-214 from top to bottom and it didn't have any info on it either about the MGIB.  When I decided to go to college last year I called 1-800-827-1000.  This phone number is generalized to route you to your nearest VA regional office (it does this automatically).  Whoever answers will put you in touch with a vocational rehabilitation couselor that will explain your options of the two programs.  I opted to accept the MGIB option because it pays you cash every month and you decide, based on full or part time college how much you will have from that cash every month.  The VR (Vocational Rehabilitation Program) is different.  If you sign up with either program you will be scheduled a class about the pros and cons of both programs.  The MGIB was the bread winner in my selection, but the down fall of it is if you withdraw early and spend your tuition money on other things, you will be left a nasty bill from your college.  With the VR program, you never see your tuition money because the finance office pays the college and you don't get any cash to play with.  Also, in the VR program if your grades start slipping or if your absent from school, you'll have to 'answer' to 'big brother'.  It's really your choice which program you choose, as long as your responsible enough to pay your bills on time and not fraternize with the co-ed's, like I did.  Either way, though, you'll recieve a letter of eligibility and alot of late nights and early mornings....studying, of course!

"The issue of States' Rights, specifically the ""right"" of certain states to continue the practice of slavery when it was abolished nationally, started the Civil War.  Hundreds of reasons are given for the actual cause, including the oversimplified issue of the South's right to seceed from the Union, but there would never have been an issue with secession if the South's slavery market had not been threatened.  We're talking millions of dollars here, which is like billions today.  Slavery, despite what you'll read, was the root cause.\n\nThe Iraq war was started because false intelligence was given to the United States Congress that the Iraqi government was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction.  Later, when it was discovered that there were no weapons of mass destruction, President Bush changed his justification for the war to ""freeing the Iraqi people""; however, the WMD threat (which was not in existence) was the original reason.  It has yet to be determined whether or not the President and/or members of the CIA deliberately misled Congress into allowing the deployment of US troops in Iraq."
Because it has not slapped anyone in the face yet. In other words, global warming has not had a major impact on their lives yet, so it is not yet on the person radar as being important.

"Talk to a Welfare Rights Officer at your local Social Work Department immedidaetely and appeal this decision. You must complete and return the IB50 failure to do aso means that your Incapacity Benefit/Income Support will stop. if you have ""Goodcause"" for not returning the form the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) must reinstate it, Goodcause could be that it wasn't resaonable to return it due to your state of mind etc. It looks like the DWP have accepted your Goodcause and reinstated, this should then be fully backdated to make a continous claim. They can not disallow you for a period in the middle. If they have done so get a letter of decision from them asking why this has been done and under what legislation. The decision letter must state your appeal rights. For the DWP to have done this they would have had to supecede your intial decision, this can be appealed against and it is up to them to prove your are not entitled. Ask for a full written statement of reasons but seek the support of a WRO immedidately and they will assist with this."

"The laws for the patent process are completely outdated.  In addition, the trolls called patent attorneys have figured out that they can make a lot of money by just filing tons of patents covering very generic processes/inventions/meds.  They then sit back and wait for someone to actually ""INVENT"" something and watch it be built with effort and dollars and promoted and sold to market and make a profit.  Then they come in and sue for their rights because they made the patent.\n\nIn addition, they advertise for those having patents and try to drum up business like ambulance chasers."

Actually lynching does not necessarily to have anything to do with hanging someone.  A lynching is violence committed by a group of people.  In SC law, 1st degree lynching is a death causing by an act of violence by a mob.  2nd degree lynching is an act of violence by a mob which does not result in death.  A mob is defined in the statute as two or more people.  1st degree lynching can result in imprisonment from five to forty years.  2nd degree lynching can result in imprisonment from three years to twenty years.  Of course, the definitions and penalties for lynching will vary from state to state.

Capitalism provides the best upward mobility for people of all classes of any economic system practiced. It is not particularly friendly to those that are handicapped mentally or suffer from a lack of motivation but  given the other choices I'll stick with capitalism.\n\nJess- the US has far fewer monopolies than are tolerated in most non-socialistic systems \n\nCantu- Stop spreading lies the larest percentage of earnings as in almost all capitalistic systems is controlled by the middle class. The US by a wide margin has a greater percentage of its population that are among the worlds truely wealthy that any country out there barring some very small countries where by its nature the percentage appears skewed.\n\nVoltare- you are presenting a skewed case. For one why would you include Liechtenstein ( correct spelling by the way) in your argument it's economy is extremely capitalistic and the government exhibits the least socialistic tendencies of any in Europe! On the issues of poor people in France being worse off I can not reasonably justify such a statement in general. I can say that Opportunity to move from the lower economic strata  into into a better economic strata is greater (did not say better) in the US.  Certainly without dispute the productivity combined with with earnings of the US economy dwarfs anyone in the world

I generally do vote for another party. The Libertarian Party is the most viable 3rd party alternative. I think that most Republicans and most Democrats are just as evil as each other, maybe just in different ways, so it makes no difference to me which one is in office.

If more people voted for who they really wanted, we'd be better off, even if it is just sending a message to the powers that otherwise be.

Why are wars fought?  It is a philosophical question not a political question.  Think about it for a moment.  Why would anyone kill or risk being killed in massive numbers.  History is littered with dead soldiers and dead causes.  It defies all logic to run towards gunfire or to press forward after experiencing casualties.\n\nWars are started by politicians.  Wether it is a king, president, general, dictator, etc., it is a small group making the decision and thrusting others into the fray.  This is the case with Iraq.\n\nAs a native Mississippian living in Alabama, I am familiar with the blood that was shed for black America.  It was shed in Selma, it was shed in Money, it was shed in Jackson, it was shed in Philadelphia, it was shed in Memphis, it was shed in Birmingham, and a whole bunch of cities and towns no one talks about and many can't remember.  The civil rights movement was a fierce struggle.

Only a competent legal malpractice lawyer in your area, having a greater knowledge of the facts, will be able to advise you of your rights and your chances of success.\n\nOnce you've done that, make sure and report your former attorney to the state bar.  Yes, he screwed up.  He most certainly should have advised you of the time to appeal and left the decision up to you as to whether to appeal.  He should be disciplined for this.  He potentially screwed up very badly.
I think single digit counting from bottom.
Just like any nosey neighbour the like to stick there nose in.
I think you hit the nail on the head.  Most of them people who are making minimum wage are thoes in high school.  They don't have any bills to worry about and that is great for a small business to hire people without costing them an arm and a leg.  Also they don't need to pay them health insurance with helps keeps costs down.  \n\nI don't think that people realize that business will have to raise the prices of their goods to make up the cost of the increase in minimum wage.  The increase didn't do any good with helping people get ahead.  It made it for thoes who are already making $9 an hour have a harder time because the cost of goods are going up and their income isn't.  Liberals just saw $$ and followed the dollar signs without thinking about it.  Thoes costs of goods along with costs of shipping thoes goods all get passed on down.  The trucker wants more pay due to the increase of diesel and the shippers want more money to pay the truckers then they are going to have to raise their prices to pay for that and now for the minimum wage.  want want want....that is america for ya.\n\nI am a stay at home mom of 5 children and my husband is working to provide for us.  Plus we send our children to a private school.  I know if we can do it most people can.  People need to seperate their wants to their needs.  I want that boat, I want that snowmobile, I want that world vacation etc then they demand that they increase minimum wage because people are having a hard time paying for it.  Also people think that just because minimum wage is going up that everyone will get a raise.  Nope!  Just the minimum wage.  So thoes making $9 or $12 and hour will not get a raise.

"Hell, that's nothing! I'm a conservative Repubican from the great state of Texas. I used to get really drunk while I was in college, but my Dad always managed to ""take care of it"". Even when I was into drugs, he kept it all covered up so that I could continue my path toward public service. Then I joined the Reserves, but only because I thought it would be cool to fly a jet plane. So my Dad arranged that, and then saw to it that I could get out of any real 'military service' since I was too busy bilking investors out of millions of dollars. My brothers might not have killed a movie star, but one of them caused the infamous Silverado Savings & Loan scandal; my other brother helped me steal an election (or two) with fraudulent voting 'chads' and irregularities in how those votes were tabulated. Then my Dad's influence with Supreme Court justices helped me go on to become the best damn president this country ever's seen! I enjoy hanging out with my capitalist buddies and planning how to illegally invade sovereign nations just so we can grab all the oil underneath their sands and make me, my buddy Big Dick, and all our cowboy friends richer and richer and richer.\nWhat the heck, we've killed tens of thousands of Iraqi women and children, and more than 2,500 American soldiers, but like my buddy Donnie Rumsfeld once said at a news conference, ""Stuff Happens."" \nI've single-handedly put this country trillions of dollars in debt, while playing ""Robin Hood in Reverse"" (that's where we take from the poor and give it all to the rich). \nWith the help of a pliable, cowardly, corrupt U.S. Congress, I've dismantled the U.S. Constitution, destroyed all environmental-impact laws and regulations that were designed to keep our fragile ecology in place, and turned this country into a police state where citizens are considered guilty until proven innocent in a rigged court of law.\nSmall countries all over the Earth are now terrified of the U.S., and are considering their own nuclear weapons programs just to defend themselves against the globe's newest ""evil empire' - the United States of America!\nI condonded all of my friend Donnie Rumsfeld's unspeakable terror, torture tactics, abuse and murder until the damn press got wind of it all. Then I put on my best actors' face and told gullible Americans that I think it was unconscionable. Ya' gotta love Ronald Reagan for writin' the Republican manual on great acting!\nI watch out for my wealthy elitist friends, lobbyists, special interest groups and huge corporations that can all make generous (if not illegal) contributions to help keep the GOP in power. Meanwhile, we like to neglect the needs of the poor, the aged, the homeless, the disabled, the underprivileged, and the unemmployed. Why should those scumbags think they have a right to live in America anyway?\nI've pretty much accomplished everything my Dad and Big Dick told me to do, all without much accountability or remorse. But, then I've lived the life of a spoiled rich kid who never had to take any responsibility for his actions. I just wish I could find an intern in the White House with whom I could have oral sex (of course, she'd have to proclaim to be a born-again Christian).\nI'm not sure whether I should retire from public office of wait until I'm impeached or tried for high treason and crimes against humanity. \nBig Dick and Donnie say there's a special oil-soaked corner of Hell that Satan's reserved just for us where we can spend our eternal damnation blaming each other for what a mess we made of the world. \nAnd, maybe, if you're as confused and drunk as you are right now, we can have a drink and talk about our differences. Just make sure I'm within earshot of Big Dick so he can tell me exactly what to say. Ain't politics great? It don't matter whether you're a Republican or a Democra"

Cops are about 3x's as likely to be involved in domestic abuse than the average profession.  It is usually due to job stresses, rotating shifts, heavy badge syndrom, etc.\n\nIn society, there is a 5/95 rule.  That means that rule, that infers that 95% of all crime is committed by the same 5% of the population. The population of cops is no different.  5% of the cops will have 95% of the complaints.  5% of the cops will be involved in 95% of the domestic violence claims.  \n\nThe best marriages are when a cop marries after he or she is in law enforcment for a while.  The reason is simple, people always change and the job changes them to a greater degree than most other professions.
Statutes of limitation don't apply to warrants, only to the crime (IE rape in NY has a 7 year statute of limitation). So to answer your question technically a warrant has no 'statute of limitations', but since there is a statute of limitations on most crimes (exceptions are crimes such as murder) essentially the warrant wouldn't be valid if the crime charged with in it exceeded the statute of limitations.

[Uncle Sam] name used to designate the U.S. government. The term arose in the War of 1812 and seems at first to have been used derisively by those opposed to the war. Possibly it was an expansion of the letters U.S. on uniforms and government property, but some sources attribute the.
Come to Canada, there are lots of jobs, and we welcome people from all nations. People of different nationalities live together, work together and do their best to accept each other's ways. We have a pretty decent medical system, and we have some of the best Internet coverage in the world. Also, there was a recent news story that Canada is looking to Mexico for people to come up here work (not as underpaid laborers) as we have too many jobs to fill. Good Luck.
"Because these representatives and non-representatives have serious problems with sex.  Of course, the fact is when Republicans cheat or get divorced, all of a sudden the issue becomes personal privacy and the debate switches to, ""we have no right to look into their lives.""  Never mind that Newt Gingrich (Former Speaker of the House during Clintons years) is on wife number 3, yet no one brings that up.  It's because of their religious upbringing that is so conservative and restricted that these people have such reactions to sex."

i know several people that follow the old religion and they have bumper stickers and pentagrams showing and with the exception of a few loons they have no trouble at all. you are free to worship goats, the moon, cow patties, or anything else here without government interference and as long as your practices do not conflict with existing laws [ you could not practice human sacrifice for example] you can pretty much do as you please. personally i have not seen any example of GWB doing anything to interfere with your practicing your religion or anyone elses unless you consider defending the country from islamic nutcases to be interfering with beliefs.

Personally, I hate to hear stories about how people have been hurt by drunk drivers.  Apparently, keeping alcohol away from them won't work, so I feel we should try the other approach.  On the first conviction of drunk driving, lose the right to own a car.  On the second conviction (driving someone else's car), have their eyes put out.  Blind people can't drive, as far as I know.
With regard to Federal income tax, anyway, very, very little.  The top 5% of wage earners pay 54.36% of all Federal income tax.  The top 50% pay 96.54% of all Federal income tax. (the median income being roughly $44,000, depending how you calculate).  There are rougly 300 million Americans, so there are 150 million (which, I'm sorry, does include children), paying a total of $25.9 million in taxes.  There are, if it helps, approximately 12 million people between the ages of 15 and 17.  I'm sorry my numbers are dead-on precise, but I don't have detailed breakdowns at hand.

"http://cronus.com/bushresume/\n\n\n\n\nGeorge W. Bush: My Resumé\n Arrest Record, Crimes & Misdemeanors:\no  Two negligent collisions, July & Aug 1962 at Houston TX. Fined. (Page 20 of linked PDF document)\no  Two speeding tickets, July & Aug 1964 at Houston TX. Fined. (Page 20 of linked PDF document)\no  Arrested for Disorderly Conduct, December 1966 at New Haven CT. Charges were dropped. (Page 20 & 37 of linked PDF document)\no  Arrested for Disorderly Conduct in New Jersey, in 1967. I was cautioned and set free. \no  At least one conviction for drunk driving in Maine when I was 30 years old, where I pled guilty, was fined and suspended from driving. \n\nPast work experience:\no  Ran for congress and lost.\no  Served for a decade on the board of a company that financed several R-rated, slasher and sundry B movies.\no  Bought an oil company and generated an astounding $3.1 Million debt, sold the company to another Texas oil baron, and then sold it again to my dad's Saudi friends and made over $1.5 Million from the sweetheart deal. I sold all my stock just in the nick of time, using insider information, to a wealthy Saudi friend of my father.\no  Bought a small portion of the Texas Rangers baseball team in a sweetheart deal that forcibly took land using eminent domain and tax-payer money. Most notable decision: Traded Sammy Sosa to the White Sox for Harold Baines. Most notable profiteering: Parlayed a $605K loan into a $14.9 Million profit using taxpayer money and eminent domain laws to evict homeowners, obtain land and increase the value of the shares in the Texas Rangers.\no  Elected to governorship of Texas, with the help of George Bush Sr. and generous donations and support from wealthy oilmen and Christian evangelicals.\n\n Accomplishments While Governor of Texas: \no  Relaxed pollution laws for power and oil companies (I ""grandfathered"" the dirtiest coal burning power plants, making them exempt from clean air laws, for example) and made Texas the most polluted state in the Union, in 1999. I invited polluters to write Texas's environmental policies, a theme that I carried on into the WhiteHouse after I was selected President. The same year, Houston had the ""highest ozone level reading in the nation"", and was second most ozone polluted city in the country from 1997 through 1999.\no  Slashed taxes, reduced state revenue to the point of bankruptcy and put the Texas government in debt for billions in borrowed money, the interest for which is now paid for by the Texas taxpayer.\no  Set a record for the most executions by any Governor in American history and became famous for publicly mocking Faye Tucker, a Christian female death row inmate, for her passionate clemency plea before she was executed. \n\n\no  Appointed US President, on a questionable decision by a highly partisan Supreme Court, after losing the popular vote by over 500,000 votes.\n\n Accomplishments While US President:\no  I attacked and invaded two countries so far, losing more US soldiers after I claimed ""Mission Accomplished"" than the total number who were killed during full combat operations in both wars combined.\no  I spent the largest surplus in the history of the country and nearly bankrupted the treasury. \no  I shattered records for the biggest annual deficit in history. \no  Set an economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in a 12 month cycle of any presidency, beating the previous record which was set during the depression years. \no  Set all-time record for biggest loss of value in the history of the stock market during any presidency ($5 Trillion drop equalling a 27% drop in investor stock portfolios from the date of my inauguration). \no  First president in decades to execute a federal prisoner. \no  First president in US history to enter office with a criminal record. \no  First year in office set the all-time record for most days on vacation by any president in US history and continued that practic"
Do you have any sort of chronic illness or condition that requires ongoing medical treatment? If you do, then the insurance you have with your company might be the least expensive that you’ll find. I would say go with less insurance coverage if you were comfortable with that, except for your age – you’re not 16 any more (and I haven’t been in a while, either, thank God). You don’t qualify for Medicare because you have to be 65 or have serious kidney problems. You’re best bet in finding out whether there is an affordable private insurance out there is to talk with local state-licensed health insurance agents. Below, I’ve included a link to a site that can help you do that. However, keep in mind that moving from a group health plan to an individual health plan negates the time you were insured at work. What I meant is that, if you have group health insurance (through work), and were to get another job, the new job would have to give you health insurance (as long as they offer it to their employees). You’re not protected in that way if you go to an individual plan. That’s why if you have a pre-existing condition, you might want to make sure the people at work won’t do something for you.\n\nHere are some quick thoughts. All the Web sites I mention are listed below.\n1.Welfare: It’s not insurance, exactly, but if you need help, you need help. The money you could save through the program could be used to help get insurance or afford your insurance at work.\n2.Medicaid: Link below to get in touch with your state’s Medicaid office.\n3.State Insurance Office (link below). Ask them about programs to assist people who are in your situation.\n4.Consumer Credit Counseling Services (CCCS): It’s free and they can help you and your daughter build up your credit and help with financial planning. They can also negotiate credit card debt to lower payments and interest rates. Make sure that if you go to a consumer credit counseling service they are part of the National Foundation for Credit Counseling.\n5.Benefits Check Up (link below): Find out what government-sponsored program you’re eligible for. It’s not just for health insurance, and it’s provided by the National Council on Aging.\n6.Needy Meds: If you have a specific illness, there might be an organization that can help pay for your treatment (link below).\n\nI’d try to find help first, but I’d also check around to see how expensive private insurance would be. Visit MostChoice.com. It’s a site that provides free quotes and plan details on health insurance, but it also lets local insurance agents know you’re looking for a new health plan. There’s no cost or obligation. You just tell the agents what kind of coverage you need and the money you can spend, and they do all the legwork. Even if you don’t find anything that’s right for you, it will give you a good idea of what’s out there without having to do all the work yourself.\n\nYou can find it here: http://www.mostchoice.com/health-insurance.cfm\n\nGood luck.\n\nBarnes@MostChoice
First, it depends on who you are and your relationship to the inmate.  For the most part, that type of information is not public, and security and safety reasons, the institution will not release it.  \n\nHowever, for example, if you are a wife, and your husband is about to be released, he will know the exact day.  Then you can arrange with the institution for the time that you can meet him.\n\nIf you are a victim of the inmate, again, release is not public information.
i don't think so neither of them

"Yes, I support President Bush. He is doing a better job than anyone he ran against in either election could ever dream of doing. I think that it is unfair that people blame him for the false intelligence he received before going into Iraq. (I only hope that if a Democrat ever makes it back to the Oval Office, that all the ""Government Conspiracy Theorists"" will give that person's administration the same skepticism.) The fact of our situation now, that we are in Iraq, makes the false intelligence obsolete. I support Bush in ""staying the course."" I know that the Democrats' hearts are in the right place, but their planned troop redeployment could have devastating effects on our troops. Senator George Allen (Rep. VA) made a good point today during the Senate vote on the two proposals for troop redeployment when he said it is never good strategy to tell your enemies what you are going to do. That is the whole point, to me, against giving a time line on our troops in Iraq. If we broadcast to the insurgents the day we plan to leave, they will know that the day after that,  they can begin destroying all the hard work the Coalition forces and Iraqis have accomplished since the ousting of Saddam. The troops need to stay until the Iraqi government feels secure enough in its ability to defend its own people. One good thing could come out of the recent Congreesional debates over this issue. Hopefully someone within the Iraqi government was watching the debates. Both sides of both houses of the U.S. Congress stressed the importance of the Iraqis need to defend themselves. That is the key to troop removal. The people of Iraq need to realize that they have the opportunity to create a real democracy. The different sects need to stop squabbling and join together and build a secure Iraq together. They need to make it clear to the insurgents that they want to have their country back. It is up to the Iraqis to fight back against the terrorist element that is perpetuating the stay of Coalition forces."
You need to get away from that mountain cabin of yours pal and travel the world like I do and you will find that there are infinitely more freedoms enjoyed by other nations that in the US.

Real property is different from Personal property.  Real property ordinarily refers to one's home.  Personal property would be something like a car.  If someone has damaged real property, like the home, or a state sign for example, then the court can order that person to make restitution to the owner.

It is an order by the court of jurisdiction to appear before that court at the date and time specified.  It is sent instead of having a law enforcement officer arrest you.

"Osama Bin Laden lives in the white house.  This is my belief because whenever 9-11 first happened and president bush sat there like a dumb dick, the first thing he did was flew Sadam husein's family to a safe place.  I don't understand why people still believe that we should be over there ""fighting the war in iraq"".  There is nothing more to do.  We are just gonna keep losing our troops.  What the predisent needs to do is send his troops over to where the real disaster was, (Huricane Katrina) and clean some stuff up.  I wish the president would actually pretend like he cared about someone other than himself and the rich people."
A business or companies adopted way of doing business.  I not quite sure if that is what you are asking.
My fiance and I were in the same situation. We did some research and from what we read, it's easier to bring in your fiance into the country, then get married, and then apply for permanent residence. It's easier that way. If you get married first, there's lots of red tape because it's harder to prove to the government that you got married for all the right reasons and arent just trying to help someone immigrate. It takes longer that way. So, my fiance and I applied for the fiance visa in February, it got approved this month, and he should be here by August. So, it basically takes about 6 months, but with bringing a spouse over, it can sometimes take longer. Good luck.

The 16th Admentment of the Constitution directly answers the question of taxation. it reads as follows\n\nThe Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportioment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.\n\nAlso Taxation is very vaugley addressed in the preamble
People emmigrate from the US all the time.  I don't understand your question here.  Are you already illegally in the US and so you wonder if you could leave, say on an airplane or ship to another country, whether US immigration would stop you?  If so, I don't think so.  You would have to make it through the customs of the country you were going to, though, and if you did not have legal documentation to show for your being in the US, they may not let you into their country.  Could try it - also depends on which country you are planning on going to.  However, if you are not presently legally in the US, you won't be able to return legally and would eventually be deported from the country you are in back to your own home country and not to the US.

Communism is an economic system, not a system of government.\n\nThe opposite of communism (central/shared ownership) is capitalism (individual ownership). But either could theoretically exist in anything from a democracy to a republic to a monarchy. \n\nDemocracy is straight voter control. All decisions based on individual votes. The US is not a democracy. It is a republic, where we elect people to make laws for us, rather than doing it ourselves.\n\nThe opposite of a democracy is a monarchy, where one person has total control. If that person chooses to ignore the laws of the country with impunity, then it becomes a tyranny.\n\nBut it's mix-and-match how you combine economic systems, which determine how property is owned, with government systems, which determine how laws are made.

I can't answer that based on the information you've given.\n\nThe California Probate Code (start with sections 6110 and read on) cover the requirements for formal and holographic wills.\n\nThe tricky bits come when wills intersect with community property laws, and when you have complicated property ownership issues that need to be resolved. If it's simply ""X and Y get everything in equal shares"" and you're not married, then you might be fine. Otherwise, it's probably worth getting some legal help. Many schools offer legal clinics that are run by law students and supervised by attorneys.\n\nOf course, if you have a lot of property assets, it's worth spending a little money now on a lawyer, to make sure the will is drafted correctly. A little money now could save a lot of money for your heirs if your estate is at all complicated."
Well first you have to state why you are scared? When you enlist in the armed services your real job is to protect the country.  You will be trained to kill. If this is all right then join but if you really can't or won't then stay home, because you are not needed.
"Bush cuts taxes for the wealthy at the same time as his administration gets us embroiled in an unnecessary war, based on a pack of lies, that is costing us hundreds of billions every year. The cons like to say ""tax and spend liberals"", while their own so-called conservative administration is spending like drunken sailors. The deficit and debt have ballooned to record levels, the Fed has to keep raising interest rates to ward off impending inflation, foreign nations are buying up our securities so we can pay INTEREST on the debt, manufacturing jobs are going overseas, being replaced by low wage, no benefit service sector jobs..and STILL people think this country is on the right track???

illegal aliens are my top concern.  the war in iraq, no big deal, illegal mexicans stealing stuff and destroying other stuff, yeah, big deal.  anything other than complete deportation for illegals is considered amnisty, and i do not support anyone who supports amnisty, as it gives them a reward for being a criminal.
"First, since you are a college graduate, I highly recommend you enter military service as an officer versus as an enlisted member.  They pay is 30 to 40% higher if you are an officer.\n\nSecond, I recommend the Air Force.  I was in for 10 years and enjoy it.  I am biased and I know very little about the coast guard.\n\nThird, ensure the military training you are going to receive can be transferred to the ""civilian world"".  You will have to leave military service one day.  Makes sure your talents are transferable.\n\nGood Luck"

"Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (Arabic: أبومصعب الزرقاوي‎) (c. October 1966 – June 7, 2006) was a Salafi Muslim terrorist leader and the self-proclaimed leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq. One or more individuals identifying themselves as Zarqawi took responsibility, on several audiotapes, for numerous acts of terrorism in Iraq, including the killing of many civilians and the taking of hostages. He was also allegedly responsible for many other acts of violence, including the beheading of hostages (possibly including Nick Berg) in Iraq.\n\nAs an Islamist identified with the Salafi movement of Wahhabism, Zarqawi opposed the presence of American and Western military forces in the Islamic world and opposed the West's support for Israel. In September 2005, he reportedly declared ""all-out war"" on Shia Muslims in Iraq,[1] and is believed responsible for dispatching numerous Al-Qaeda suicide bombers throughout Iraq, and especially to areas with large concentrations of Shia civilians. As the leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq he is suspected of causing thousands of people's deaths--many if not most of them civilians.\n\nZarqawi, a longtime ally of Osama bin Laden, was a high-ranking member of bin Laden's Al Qaeda network, and since October 2004 had referred to his own organization Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad, or Monotheism and Holy War Group, an insurgent network operating in Iraq, as ""Al-Qaeda in Iraq"". On October 21, 2004, Zarqawi officially announced his allegiance to Al Qaeda; on December 27, 2004, Al Jazeera broadcast an audiotape of bin Laden calling Zarqawi ""the prince of al Qaeda in Iraq"" and asked ""all our organization brethren to listen to him and obey him in his good deeds.""[2]\n\nZarqawi was the most wanted man in Jordan and Iraq,[3] having participated in or masterminded a number of violent actions against United States, Jordanian and Iraqi targets. The U.S. government offered a USD $25 million reward for information leading to his capture, the same amount offered for the capture of bin Laden before March 2004. On October 15, 2004, the U.S. State Department added Zarqawi and the Jama'at al-Tawhid wal Jihad group to its ""list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations"" and ordered a freeze on any assets that the group might have in the United States. On February 24, 2006, the U.S. Department of Justice's FBI also added al-Zarqawi to the ""Seeking Information – War on Terrorism"" list, the first time that he had ever been added to any of the FBI's three major ""wanted"" lists.[4]\n\nZarqawi was killed in Baquba by a United States airstrike on June 7, 2006"

From the standpoint of classical liberalism, welfare would never have come into existence, but families and charities would take care of those unemployed or unemployable.  That would definitely put some emphasis back on the family, which is absolutely obliterated by the welfare system.  Noone on welfare depends upon a breadwinner, but rather on their buddy - Big Brother.  \n\nClassical liberalism placed emphasis on individual responsibility, whereas a welfare state is a malignant cancer that rewards those void of personal responsibility.\n\nHowever, corporate welfare is far more an agregious form of redistribution of wealth than society's well-intentioned, though flawed attempts to help the poor.

"The answer is that we do away with the party system ALTOGETHER and create an Independent political system. As long as America takes its ""team mentality"" from the sports field into the political arena and votes based on a ""label"", this country can only go even further down than it already is. When people start voting issues instead of party affiliation, candidate popularity contests, or advertising dollars, we can reclaim this country with leaders of fairness and a vision for the true equality of ALL Americans.\n\nOur votes are stolen (See 2000 and 2004 elections), the elected officials care more about ""job security"" than their constituents (government was to be ""service"" NOT a career path!), and ""We The People"" suffer in the long haul. Don't cross party lines to vote--BE INDEPENDENT and vote the issues close to and for the good of ""normal"" Americans."

actually, i think there is a biological factor.  for example, when i watch the news, child molesters look a certain way, and as we know looks are decided by genes (i also think personalities are partially gene affected).  certain looks are really the only common factor among these tiny balled freaks, so that leads me to think of a possibility of small biological factor.  however, this is no excuse for their actions.  everybody gets evil ideas, and most of us can easily override them and forget them in the same instant that they were conceived.  how they were raised and where they were raised also play major factors.  now im not a psychologist or a gene specialist.  in fact, im not even out of high school, so i could very well be wrong.
He cut $12 billion from the student loan program.  \n\nThe new budget will make it impossible to consolidate student loans.

I believe that most state and federal governments in the western world allow courts to enforce paternity testing for child support, and where there is a threatening situation the child support can be automatically deducted from his income.  That being said, I think you might also need to look into making your family safe before anything else.  Check your phone book for local counselling services who will  be able to tell you what your rights are and what support you can access.  I won't kid you that this will be easy, but you must go onwards and upwards for your children.  If he won't do anything about his behaviour, you need to protect your family from him and put it down in writing with the local law authorities.  Good luck.  I'll think of you in my prayers.

Well, obviously the people that have answered this are not thinking correctly and/or have never smoked marijuana in their lives.  I used to be an avid smoker and I still can't believe how naive people in this country are.  Not one person that answered mentioned alcohol and the fact that it is responible for thousandsn and thousands of deaths in this country every year.  People who smoke pot are not even close to being crackheads and whoever said that is an idiot.  I would much rather stumble upon 10 people who are stoned while walking down the street thatn 10 people who are drunk.  The latter of the above statements usually results into some kind of fight or people pissing all over the place or destroying something.  If you are going to be that person who is against the use of marijuana but condones the use or uses alcohol, needs to take a closer look at themselves.  Alcohol impairs your decision making a great deal, hence the amount of people who drive drunk.  When was the last time you heard of a peron who was stoned getting into a major accident and killing people?  I have yet to hear that story.  All legalizing pot would do is cut down on the amount of drug dealers that there are in this country.  If pot was legal, I would grow my own, and I'm sure that most people would.  Stop listening to things that people made up in the 60's and start living in the present.  Alcohol is bad and should be illegal.  Did you ever think of that?

I found this on wikipeida:\n\nThe largest concentrations--about 47% of all Muslims in India--live in the 3 states of Bihar (13.7 million) (16.5%), West Bengal (20.2 million) (25%), and Uttar Pradesh (30.7 million) (18.5%), according to the 2001 census. Muslims represent a majority of the local population only in Jammu and Kashmir (67 % in 2001) and Lakshadweep (95 %). High concentrations of Muslims are found in the eastern states of Assam (31 %) and West Bengal (25 %), and in the southern state of Kerala (25 %) and Karnataka (12.2%).

Everyone talks about ~us~ losing or ~us~ getting tired.  What about the bad guys?  Ever think ~they~ are losing, or ~they~ are getting tired?  We killed their leaders and reduced their ability to organize.  Once we can limit their presence to that of an American street gang (Bloods, Cryps, etc), which is happening as their reach gets more and more limited, the local police can deal with them and we'll be able to withdraw victorious.  Key word - victorious!!\n\nWithdrawing earlier, under worse conditions (i.e. we lose and they win) is an option, but it will still take over a year to fully withdraw.  It's not like we can snap our fingers and pull everyone home overnight.

Well....have you tried just calling the Grand Rapids PD to ask them?

I understand about wanting to go into the service. It looks like it might be a way to pay the bills and get some education and a way up. For some of us it was. I was a chemical staff specialist. My job started out being in radiation protection. That was great. It eventually got me where I am today. I teach the stuff in a nuclear power plant.\n\nBut wait.\n\nThe Army decided that they needed me to make and drop napalm, agent orange, white phosphorus, and other stuff like that. I got sent to Vietnam. I was a good soldier. Did what they told me. Even got tortured in training without talking (South Koreans broke my knee in a training exercise). I dropped napalm on people, dude. Burned them to death. Sprayed Agent Orange that we later found out caused all sorts of genetic defects and liver problems in the Vietnamese and in our troops. I watch a helicopter blade take off my pilot's head when we crashed once.\n\nDid not seem much like radiation protection somehow. \n\nAnd then when I got back people spit on me. They called us baby killers. The sentiment about the war had changed. There was no money much to treat vets either (a lot like it is now, btw) and my buddies were very screwed up. I hear that US soldiers coming back now 1 in every three are seeking help about PTSD. Yeah, good idea to seek help. I still have it. Fourth of July is hell for me. Hate unexpected fire crackers.\n\nThe job of the military is to meet with and kill the enemy. The recruiters will try to tell you there are lots of other things to do, but that is the number one job. Right now we are not at war, we are occupying a country that does not want us there. The Iraqi president and VP have both asked for us to leave, have talked about granting amnesty to those who have only killed Americans. The troops on the ground there are tired. They are there to protect the contractors who are raking in the dough on fat no-bid contracts. \n\nAre you sure you want to do this?\n\nHow about something like Americorps or Peace Corps? \n\nIf you still are intent on the Army, get everything in writing. When they try to weasel out, show them the paper and leave. Seriously. Recruiters lie and cheat.

You can take him to civil court, or you can just move out. If he is screaming obscenities at you and you keep the tapes and they still won't talk to him for threatening you. Talk to an attorney. I can't believe that you have to put up with living in fear.\n\nHe can't just stomp on in and throw your dog out in the street. You have an addendum that he already agreed to. So long as you have that, you can sue him cross eyed. It isn't legal to harass you constantly either. Unforatunately, it means you may have to take him to civil court or get a protection order against him. Me? I would move, and if I couldn't move, I would sue. I've done it before and Mr loudmouth became pretty timid after that.\n\nKeep a journal of what he does with dates and times and don't erase his recordings on your answering machine.

I checked out your previous question and WOW!  I would say you definitely have a problem.  I know how emotional and vindictive teens can be so I completely understand your dilemma.  When it comes to your children's safety, I would rather err on the side of caution!  Think of all the hormones and testosterone this young man has running through his system...  if you were to only attack this situation half heartedly, you run the risk of simply embarrassing him and further enraging his already emotional state.  Obviously if he is stalking your daughter, he has little to no self control.  Think of a pissed off teen boy catching your daughter in a situation where she is alone or off guard.(walking home from school, on her way to a friends house...)  What is he capable of?  I would rather you never find out!  I would certainly go to the police and talk to someone involved in juvenile services.  His behavior is NOT normal and should be investigated.  It is entirely possible he needs a mental health eval and would benefit from some professional help.  Good Luck and God bless!
No.\nThe district is a public servant (in some states elected), who can bring criminal charges against an accused.\nA plaintiff figures in a civil lawsuit. (not a criminal trial). The plaintiff is directly involved in the civil lawsuitl The plaintiff is the complainant who files a civil lawsuit against the other party called the defendant. Civil trials usually result in the court awarding damages against the defendant if the plaintiff successfully proves his/her case. The award is usually money or a court injunction of some sort.
KYOTO is relating to the CO2 emissions which countries emit, The majority of Europe has signed up to this agreement but the real harmful players have not. U.S.A for instance thinks it can battle global warming with technology and will not sign up to it and China has plans to build one coal fired power station every week for the next seven years so the real effects that KYOTO was intended to do will be offset by these two nations alone. I think it was a great idea and I am not a tree hugger or anything but I do beleive that the KYOTO agreement is the best way to go. The fact of the matter is that those countries which have signed up to it are not cutting their emissions by nearly enough anyway and our own government is giving it's big companies it's own ways to bypass their responsibilities in buying 'CO2 allowances' from other companies anyway, I can not help but think that this KYOTO agreement was doomed to failure the moment it was signed
The government isn't really looking for a solution. If they were then they would have done something years ago like putting armed US troops along the border. Just like the so-called drug wars, they could have done something about it long ago but haven't. Why? Because look at all the money, from OUR taxes, that they go and waste on different programs and ideas instead of tackling the real problem. I am all for putting a wall, fence, or whatever along our southern border. I am all for putting armed US troops along the border. I am all for shooting to kill anyone that is coming across the border illegal and refuses to halt when instructed to do so. Only extreme measures like this would make a difference. As for those illegals that are already here. I would say we give them 30 days to get out and then let the military gather them up for deportation. Hey we have a lot of military that aren't really doing anything so let's make them work for their pay. Any illegals have a problem with this, well tough this is my country and not yours. You were not invited here. You are a criminal and continually break our laws so leave.

"a noun:  a civil wrong (tort) in which one converts another's property to his/her own use, which is a fancy way of saying ""steals."" Conversion includes treating another's goods as one's own, holding onto such property which accidentally comes into the convertor's (taker's) hands, or purposely giving the impression the assets belong to him/her. This gives the true owner the right to sue for his/her own property or the value and loss of use of it, as well as going to law enforcement authorities since conversion usually includes the crime of theft."

"No it doesn't.\n\nLife began many million years ago when chemical processes happened to create DNA and the first rudimentary organisms. Life hasn't stopped since then. Conception is just a process of continuation. The individual cells that participate in conception are alive as well. The sperm is alive, as is the ovum.\n\nLife is not an isolated event like many people think it is. Life is a phenomenon that doesn't care whether we put arbitrary stop signs and say here is where it begins.\n\nA correct question to ask would be ""Is the fertilized egg a complete person?"" And the answer to that is also no. A fertilized egg is a zygote. It is not even an embryo. After the zygote has divided into more than one cell and it has attached to the female's uterus, it becomes an embryo.

"Don't place all conservatives as ignorant. But I agree with you that abstinence only is wrong. I think it is the prudish society that doesn't even want to tell their 5 yr old what their body parts are. People should be taught responsibility for their actions. If you engage in sex, this is what can happen. Teach them the consequences for the action, not ""don't do it""."
Good question, I too would like an answer to this.  As far as I'm concerned gay marriages have nothing to do with my marriage, of course, neither do other straight marriages.  I'm more concerned with home wrecking tramps who think a married man is a challenge.

I think somebody was going to get their pockets padded. I do not think that it is Bush this time as he is making plenty of money from the Oil and pharmaceutical company's. But one of his subordinates made this decision and Bush just stood behind it. It is a very corrupt government at this time.
"Friend, I am not sure who ""they"" is.  In the context of your question, your philosophy could apply to both sides of the immigration issue.  People in America march for many constructive causes.  What are you wanting here?"
yes, but i think the question is, can we all put our heads together?
Although I know nothing about West Virginia law, I know a fair amount about criminal procedure, and that's probably more at issue here than what state this took place in.\n\nDepending on the circumstances, I would expect there to have been a police report filed by the victim.  An investigation would follow (hours/days/weeks/months), followed by a review by the prosecutor's office (often known as the District Attorney), which can also take hours/days/weeks/months.\n\nAssuming the prosecutor's office believes they have the information they need to successfully prosecute the suspect, (after reviewing all the information), they probably file an affidavit for arrest warrant with the local judge.  A judge can take as much or as little time as he/she wants to review the information (but I'd bet it would be handled pretty quick), and then the arrest warrant can be issued.\n\nMy best answer is that in any state, it can take a few hours to several days...or longer.  Like I said, there's bound to be a fair amount of fact-gathering that has to take place before anyone decides when/if someone will be arrested for an offense...and gathering facts isn't always a quick process.\n\nIt's also possible (unless you know otherwise), that while the victim in the case you're asking about considers the crime to be attempted murder, the police (and the law) may consider it something else, altogether.  And depending on what the law considers it, this process could take significantly longer.

Unlawful detention without trial or access to representation and, what amounts to imprisonment without trial, is accepted by most countries as criminal.\n\nIt is significant that none of the other countries that went to war in Iraq has anything to do with gitmo.   It is not surprising as they are all full signataries to the internation war crimes court and accept that their citizens are subject to the same.\n\nAmerica whilst insisting that all countries be subject to war crimes trials refuses to have their citizens subject to it.  If they were full signataries to it there would be warrants out by now.

I was diagnosed with MS May '05.  I applied for SSI last October, and was approved for Presumptive Disability.  I received 3 checks, then they denied me.  I appealed, and was denied again.  Now I am on the third appeal.  I hired a retired Social Security representative, and will be going before an administrative law judge within the next 2 months.  He told me that was just the way it was.  So many people get denied the first time, and never appeal, that Social Security tries its best to screw you.  But they will have to keep hearing my case until I exhaust all options.  But hopefully I can win this damn case!

"Fourteen US Presidents were members of the Masonic Fraternity.  This includes Lyndon Johnson who did not advance beyond the First Degree.  William Clinton, a member of the Masonic Youth Group ""Demolay"" has not yet petitioned a lodge.  The teams of George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush have not yet petitioned a lodge.  Perhaps you are confusing their fraternal membership with the Skull and Bones Society at Yale where they are both members.  This society is not related to the Freemasons.\n\nMany of our founding fathers were Freemasons; including Generals on Brother Washington's Staff and a number of signers of the Declaration of Independence.  In fact most of the patriotic and god fearing citizens of our county have been and still are Freemasons.  If you check you will find that the most respected members of your community are Freemasons and Shriners.  Remember every Shriner you see in a parade, raising money for crippled children is a Freemason."
France and Spain.\nSee the article below:\nAgents of the new nation (USA)—notably Benjamin Franklin, Arthur Lee, Silas Deane, and later John Adams—were striving to get help, and in 1777 Pierre de Beaumarchais had succeeded in getting arms and supplies sent to the colonials in time to help win the battle of Saratoga. That victory made it easier for France to enter upon an alliance with the United States, for which Franklin and the comte de Vergennes (the French foreign minister) signed (1778) a treaty. Spain entered the war against Great Britain in 1779, but Spanish help did little for the United States, while French soldiers and sailors and especially French supplies and money were of crucial importance.\n(Forign Aid)
There are no pros in illegal immigration.  It doesnt benefit anyone. Those coming in are always on the run, looking over their shoulder, waiting for the INS to come break in their door. They cant legaly get health care, affordable housing, or protection under the law. As for the legal citizens, we have to take up the extra burden of higher taxes, we have to absorb the cost of funding the free clinics that the illegal's have to use, and there is the problem of drug use, gangs, and additional police presence and border patrol personnel. I'm certainly not suggesting all illegal immigrants are bad people. Most are not. And I agree that the immigration process sucks, and it needs to be redone in a big way. I dont think the answer is just saying the hell with it, and jumping the fence though.
Your question did not make sense so I did not bother following the link.  Perhaps you could ask it again in terms people can understand!
A Bureau is a goverment Agency. A Bureaucracy is a agency with a lot of rules and regulations and red tape that prevents things from being done efficiently -- the prime example being the Department of Motor Vehicles.
To answer you question with another question...What is the difference between terrorism and collateral damage? Innocents die in anycase. Its the value of life associated with the victim that counts. Brown, dark and yellow people who live in far off lands, speak obscure languages, believe in obscure things and wear funny clothes and rags on their heads are not as valuable as our folk back home.  So killing a few of them, albeit be they innocent,  in the course of spreading democracy is well within the tolerance limits set by our civilized society.  Besides, they not completely innocent. The're muslim right and the 9/11 attackers were muslim right. So their you go. They can't be completely innocent. We just need to get them to understand that killing a few of their kids is all for a good cause. We did'nt target them. It just happened, like oops. And sometimes we say we're sorry.  Damn, if only they'd understand that we're killing them for their own good. Just see the brilliant mind numbing comment below. His got the spirit. You see, we Americans are superior to the rest of those folks.
As an Australian I have to correct a couple of you. We are not yet a republic, however we are not ruled by England. \nIf you knew anything about history you would know we were in both the 1st and 2nd world wars. We were nearly invaded by Japan during the 2nd.\nWe have troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, East Timor,West Papua, Bougainville, The Solomon Islands and are also having problems with Indonesia.\nApart from that, we live in a fairly peaceful environment. We have mistreated the native Australians, as all white settlements have in their countries and that is an issue that needs addressing badly.\nAs for ruling the world, I would say the present government is equipped for that. I believe we would really give it a go mate. LOL
"I'm going to put this question on my ""watch"" list, because if anyone can come up with ANYTHING, I really want to know what it could possibly be...\nWell I knew this would be fun! if it wasn't so damn sad...I have posed the same question to the radio talk show geeks and they do the same thing Accuse Democrats of posturing and then saying something  absurd like ""Well I'm safer now then I ever was under Clinton"" Well there wasn't a 9/11 catastrophe under Clinton, it's your guy that let the Country down..  And that their  rhetorical answer  is always  ""well it was all in motion before we came into power"" doesn't sit well with the ""We have saved the United Staes, because Bush got up on a heap of stones and talked with a bullhorn"" They want everything both ways! The fear they are trying to instill in the common man is based on what?

Yes. All persons born here are given one. But your parents were supposed to file with the social security office after your birth, or the hospital supplies the forms, the parents fill it out before the mom and baby leave the hospital and then the hospital files it with the Social Security Administration.\n\nIf you are not born here, but come legally, you are eligible for one and need to file paperwork with S.S.A.\n\nIf you are not here legally, you are not entitled to one.

From 1991 to the present day the United States Air Force and Navy have slaughtered over 200,000 civilian people in Iraq with Depleted Uranium missiles, cluster bombs, cruise missiles and other so-called “smart bombs.”\n During the “Desert Storm” terror campaign the arsenal also included fuel-air bombs and napalm. 177 million pounds of bombs were dropped on the people of Iraq in the most concentrated aerial bombardment in the history of the world. In the 110,000 sorties of the six-week onslaught the cowardly American and British pilots (and to a lesser extent French and Saudi pilots) mass-murdered at least 200,000 people, using depleted uranium missiles, napalm, cluster-bombs, fuel-air bombs, cruise missiles and other so-called “smart bombs.” The slaughter of civilian people in the Amariyah bomb shelter was a Prime example of this American/British state terrorism. Most of them were women, children, elderly, and invalids from a new housing development. Cowardly U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force jet pilots caught one sixty-mile-long column of fleeing Iraqi soldiers and Palestinian civilian families in vehicles on the Kuwait to Basra highway - and pounded them ruthlessly with bombs and machine-gun fire. The road, clogged by four lanes of one-way, bumper-to-bumper traffic, was carpet bombed by B-52s dropping 1,000-pound bombs, and repeatedly hit with laser-guided missiles and “smart” bombs. All the Iraqi soldiers, as well as Palestinian workers and their families, were slaughtered without mercy. The bloodthirsty American pilots gleefully described the massacre as “shooting in a sheep pen.” \n During the Desert Storm terror campaign at least 944,000 rounds of Depleted Uranium ammo were fired from American A-10 Warthogs all over Iraq and Kuwait . When a depleted uranium tipped shell strikes a tank or armoured personnel carrier it easily penetrates the armour and burns the crew alive. The impact also vaporizes the depleted uranium, creating an aerosol of radioactive heavy-metal particles which can spread as far as 190 miles on the wind. When inhaled or ingested, the depleted uranium particles cause chemical and radioactive damage to the bronchial tree, kidneys, liver and bones. Cancer often results, and the effects can even include genetic damage. \n The Dutch Laka Foundation estimates that the United States terror campaign left behind 300-800 tons of radioactive waste from this ammunition all over Kuwait and Iraq - poisoning the air, the land, the water and the people everywhere. Afterwards, wherever the depleted uranium firing had been concentrated, there were cancer epidemics among Iraqi civilians living nearby. In the ten years since then, sanctions, polluted water and depleted uranium together have killed somewhere between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000 Iraqi civilian people. At least 600,000 of the dead are children. Cancer rates have quadrupled in areas of southern Iraq bombed by the American and British state terrorists. Since it began, thousands of Iraqi babies have been born with horrible birth defects. This is something that has never before been seen in Iraq . \n Over the course of only 43 days and nights, approximately 62,000-80,000 air-delivered cluster bombs were dropped on the Iraqi people by the American-led state terrorists. In addition, 10,000 MLRS rockets and 100,000 “Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition” artillery shells were fired. All this translates to about 24-30 million “sub munitions” or bomblets. Assuming a dud rate of 5%, it is estimated that the number of Dangerous land-mine cluster bomblets lying on or just under the surface of the ground in Iraq and Kuwait would be from 1.2 to 1.5 million. At least. In the desert, however, the percentage of these duds rose to 30%. So the number of unexploded ordnance still lying in wait for unsuspecting Iraqi children and civilian people could be as high as 7 to 9 million bomblets. A Human Rights Watch report says that of the estimated 24 to 30 mi
These offenders are clearly in violation of public decency and also under the influence of being lame. Such punishments must match the offense. Therefore I would like to put forth a bill that would make such lewd acts not only criminal but a federal felony and would make the offenders candidates for the death sentence. We also must take precausions and make sure that these people not be allowed to reproduce and possibly influence the next generation to act like whiggers. As for Eminem, there would be exceptions to the law. Every now and then he has some good songs.
Depends on the felony. If it as DUI, then yes.  If it dealt with a moving violation, such as vehicular homicide, the judge can revoke thier license.  Normal felony such as assult and robbery, no.  Each case is different.  If no driving was involved, most likely no.

"Black powder is a mixture of saltpeter (potassium nitrate or, less frequently, sodium nitrate), charcoal and sulphur with a ratio (by weight) of approximately 15:3:2 respectively. The ratio has altered over the centuries of its use, and can be altered somewhat depending on the purpose of the powder. Unlike smokeless propellants, it acts more like an explosive since its burn rate is not affected by pressure, but it is a very poor explosive because it has a very slow decomposition rate and therefore a very low brisance. This same property that makes it a poor explosive makes it useful as a propellant — the lack of brisance keeps the black powder from shattering the barrel, and directs the energy to propelling the bullet. Historically, potassium nitrate was extracted from manure by a process superficially similar to composting. ""Nitre beds"" took about a year to produce crystallized potassium nitrate."

"You are leaving out a lot in your comparison, which is a far stretch at best.\n\nSaddam was a dictator.  There was no form of government to break away from.  There was no forum for the Kurds' voices to be heard.  Many women and children were intentionally killed as a result.\n\nThe Civil War came after many years of differences between the North and South that was kept together through compromise.  It was a slow, pain-staking series of events that led up to it - didn't just erupt.  Every state agreed to a pact, this Union, when they accepted the U.S. Constitution and were annexed.  The reason for war was much different.  It wasn't one race or religious sect against another.  It didn't have anything to do with ""ethnic cleansing"" like the situation in Iraq.\n\nYou can't be serious that you're comparing the two.  I think your question is just meant to stun..."

It takes a special mindset to do the job of a police officer. It's not all doughnuts and coffee. It's like 80 % boredom and paperwork and 20 % terror. They're as scared as anyone else in some situations; it's only their training that helps them survive and get thru a confrontational episode. I've seen videos when some guy went ballistic on the officer, and he either lost control or had to have help bringing the perp down.\nI do feel though, at times, that it goes to their heads. I don't think it's a clear cut case, though, like a percentage are all bad. I think there are gray or shaded areas where they might be nice for awhile and then something or someone rubs them the wrong way, and they act like jerks.
"No one with extreme opinions should run any country. Feminism started out with virtuous goals - equal pay for equal work, the right for women to vote, equal protection under the laws, etc. Those goals were met a long time ago. Now the feminazis want special rights and privileges.\n\nIt's time for the feminists to step back and realize that, if they want to be treated as equals, then they must accept equal responsibilities in society. You can't claim to be so easily offended that you have ""emotional distress"" from hearing someone say something with which you disagree, yet claim you're emotionally strong enough to hold down ""manly"" jobs.\n\nPersonally, I'm rather annoyed with the feminist movement for not stopping when they got the playing field leveled. Now, a man is afraid to open a door for a lady because he might get yelled at or sued for sexual harassment.\n\nOnce again, the minority makes the decision for the majority. Thanks a lot.

"We can work on parts of it. For one thing, universal identification; no more us and them, instead everybody and everyone.((Stop living in the dark ages, move into the 21st)).\nSecondly, end suicide bombing by applying cultural pain and shared responsibility.  When a bomber goes off, collect enough biological material to identify the family and render the rest by grinder, divide into five parts, bury four in dry well drillings at the four points of the compass, sink the fifth part at sea. Wipe the bombers name from all public records so they can not be memorialised. Find the spiritual advisor and tattoo above his brow the Arabic equivalent of ""Voice of the Devil"". Find the family and deport them; I hear Greenland has vacant land now with global warming. And in the case of Israel and the Palestinians, every bomb  = ten sq. hectares land permanently in Israels boundary., starting with the west bank area.  Draco was too soft for these bombers."

"Colin Powell himself admitted, back in 2003 that the U.S. military ""doesn't even count civilian casualities"".

See, the rise in protest against Vietnam is almost directly attributed to Walter Cronkite reporting the carnage night after night...it inflamed public opinion to the point where people started speaking out. This is what the Neo-Cons are afraid of with Iraq and Afghanistan. \nAmericans aren't speaking out because most of them are afraid if they do Homeland Security is going to come knocking. Which may be true, but is it better to sit back and do nothing or take a risk? Remember, we let the Nazis get away with terrible atrocities for a long time before we did anything about it. Myself, I don't give a damn- I've been speaking out all my life and I'm either too old or too stubborn to stop now!"

Passages in the Christian's New Testament paint ""The Jews"" as being the children of the devil, hypocritical, and interested only in money rather than in Gd. \n\nWho wrote the following???\n\n""""""But since I learned that those miserable and accursed people do not cease to lure to themselves even us, that is, the Christians, I have published this little book, so that I might be found among those who opposed such poisonous activities of the Jews and who warned the Christians to be on their guard against them....Now, in order to strengthen our faith, we want to deal with a few crass follies of the Jews in their belief and their exegesis of the Scriptures, since they so maliciously revile our faith. If this should move any Jew to reform and repent, so much the better. We are now not talking with the Jews but about the Jews and their dealings, so that our Germans, too, might be informed....Our Lord also calls them a ""brood of vipers""; furthermore, in John' 3:39 he states: ""If you were Abraham's children would do what Abraham did.... You are of your father the devil."" It was intolerable to them to hear that they were not Abraham's but the devil's children, nor can they bear to hear this today.... For they are a heavy burden, a plague, a pestilence, a sheer misfortune for our country. Proof for this is found in the fact that they have often been expelled forcibly from a country, far from being held captive in it....Therefore be on your guard against the Jews, knowing that wherever they have their synagogues, nothing is found but a den of devils in which sheer self-glory, conceit, lies, blasphemy, and defaming of God and men are practiced most maliciously and veheming his eyes on them.......but then eject them forever from this country. For, as we have heard, God's anger with them is so intense that gentle mercy will only tend to make them worse and worse, while sharp mercy will reform them but little. Therefore, in any case, away with them!""""""\n\nIt was Martin Luther, one of the founders of the Protestant movement in Christianity!

Hemlock is also classified as a poison.  Furthermore, it is illegal to import or possess any number of plants.  Marijuana is the only plant classified as a controlled substance, I believe, but it is certainly not the only plant that may not be imported or possessed.   It remains illegal in most countries.  Even in the Netherlands where it is openly smoked in coffee shops, that is only by benign neglect and it is still illegal in the Netherlands.
Besides the obvious names like court, or circle, the use of street, avenue, and terrace are up to whomever is naming the street.  Usually developers name streets for neighborhoods they are building, and at times, use names that are meaningful to themselves.

Simple answer:  because most of their arguments do not hold water when challenged on logic and merit.
No, that doesn't make you a racist.  That is what the liberals would have you believe, but wanting your borders  to be secure and immigrants to be legal is not racist!  It's intelligent!
What is the point? Isn't this getting old? Why wouldn't we think he had them? He used them before. He intentionally led other countries to think he had them hoping to scare off exactly what we did. I think he got rid of them (Syria) personnaly. Look, the biggest mistake Bush made w/Iraq was not getting into all the complex geo-political issues for attacking Iraq and just taking for granted that because of 9/11 people would be real gung-ho. I don't think he anticipated how the same Dems that were all in patriotic, we're all united mode, would go all political and try to bury him.
would be a means to keep all the money he stole

Dear Phildoc\n\nIn answer to your question, there are legal UK restriction's on the bringing into this country of any weapon, whether fake, real, or as a ornament display. \n\nJust like knives, swords, whether sharp, or blunt are classified in the UK as being an offensive weapon and therefore unless you clear your ornamental swords with the UK Statutory Authorities first before making your journey to the UK, you will find out that upon your arrival in the UK, you will be arrested and your ornamental swords will be impounded by the UK Criminal Authorities irrespective of what reason you may have for bringing them into this country.\n\nMy advice is that you should leave these commodities at home in your own country in order to save the inevitable happening when you reach the UK as ornamental swords are quit easily obtainable legally in the UK.\n\nAfter reading this, if you still wish to bring into the UK your display of ornamental swords, then you should contact The British Embassy in China in order to obtain the addresses of the people you have to clear your swords with first before bringing them into the UK.\n\nPlease print off a copy of this reply for any future use.\n\nI therefore trust that this answer's your question\n\nMR STEVEN NEWBERT JP\nHER MAJESTY THE QUEEN'S\nJUSTICE OF THE PEACE\nfor\nENGLAND & WALES

Do it legally, get him a fiance visa, it let's the government know that he is coming here to get married.  Either that or get married in Canada and apply for a visa after you are married.  Just remember, even if you get married in Canada, he is still a Canadian citizen and would still need a visa.
"my business law teacher in college always told us to think of the ""deep pocket"" rule, meaning only sue people that have money.  but unless you signed a CONTRACT with your employer, then your employer is not at fault, nor is he/she liable for reinstatement.  find out if your state is an ""at will"" state as far as employment is concerned.  if it is(as is the case in (i believe) 34 states), then you are screwed. \n\nif what you are seeking is REVENGE, then do this:  file a small claims lawsuit against her(costing you b/w $35-$70 to file), but be careful about how you come up with the number you are suing for.  if and ONLY IF you can prove that she lied, then i THINK that you should sue her for 6 months of wages, since that is generally how long it takes to find a job (ie unemployment insurance lasts 6 months).  don't say ANYTHING about defamation of character in small claims court, this area ONLY applies to people in the public eye, ie politicians.  just focus on how HER LIE LED TO YOU LOSING MONEY.  if you can prove that, you will win.\n\nwhat happened to you is bullshit, but you can't really DO anything about it other than really just harass the lady.  even if you win in small claims, she won't pay you.  you would have to get a judgement against her, then garnish her wages, etc, which BELIEVE ME is not worth doing.  so if it is revenge you seek, sue her.  if you want money, then find another job and use a friend as a reference for your last job.  if you are pissed off, i've found that throwing eggs is a good outlet for hostility.\n\nhope that helps!!!!"

Your Bylaws and the Constitution shouldn't really be the same although there might be overlap.\nPerhaps the best analogy is the US Constitution, its Amendments, and federal law.\nYour constitution should state:\n1) the goal of the organization\n2) the reason for this goal\n3) the means for achieving this goal\n4) the basic structure of the organization\n5) the basic rules/expectations/ethics for attaining 1-4.  \nOnce the constitution is created, the bylaws are the nitty-gritty rules and procedures to follow.  These are the things that are easy to change by simple majority or plurality.  If there is to be any change in the constitution it usually requires a 2/3 vote or some greater membership participation.\n\nBottom Line - you want the constitution to reflect the basic ideals, principles, rules, and structure of the organization.  Bylaws are specific detailed rules/guidelines that help maintain and promote your constitution.

There are a number of volunteers who never finish their assignment; more than half cannot handle the pressure.  So it is quite common.\n\nUntil your friend actually goes to the Staging Location (DC most of the time), she will have the option of easily backing out.  Some people never show up for staging, and some show up but then change their mind or don't pass medical exam.  \n\nOnce over there, it is still possible to quit, and we had about 5 who quit during training out of a group of 67.  She will not be in a massive amount of debt, but if she quits after finishing training she will have to return a certain sum of money -- like relocation allowance, living allowance, things that she should not have spent if she quits early.  \n\nI hope that she will not back out, as the experience is very rewarding.  I greatly enjoyed my time overseas and would like to have extended it, but the bureaucracy only approved a limited number to do so.  \n\nWhat country will she be going to?  What assignment -- teaching, environmental, health?  \n\nLet me know if you and she have any more questions.

Yes if you can prove it. Usually however their is security cameras and pictures are taken when the car comes in and dents and things are logged.  So ask for the paperwork for the car being logged in.   Then compare, if they say no damage: take a picture and have a witness of the car in the impound and make a complaint there, and  go to the police because they put the car there.\nwould be a civil suit.

So here it is there has been no war crimes, If saving a country  from a mad man who has slaughtered his own people with chemical weapons is a crime then what is helping humanity. Most of the civilian losses in the war are from the ignorance of the people- they stand outside during a firefight watching the battle (common sense says not to due that). \n\nLets see rebuilding schools, hospitals, power plants, water purification sites. Yea real war crimes there.\n\nMedical attention to the population- another war crime in the making.\n\nGee if only the media would tell the People of the the World the real truth instead of the half truths that sell.\n\nIf anyone should be held responsible for war crimes it should be the media - just ask the 200 detainees who were killed because of the detainee abuse coverage- insurgent bombed a prison in Iraq as retaliation there's your war crimes.

Pick the wrong recipient and this whole idea is a FIASCO.  Pick the wrong organization (like the UN, a whorehouse for the world's remaining dictators and despots) and nothing good will happen, either.\n\nYou need to get her to agree and come up with a central location for them, like the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea.  Then you need to get the governments of the world to agree to disarm and ship them there.  This will take 30 to 50 years.  The wise leader may have to threaten the last two or three holdouts, who will be dictators, in order to get them to cough up their nukes.\n\nOnce they are all in one place, they can be placed on a destruction schedule by the wise leader who won't abuse them or use them to threaten others.  the destruction will take 10 to 20 years.\n\neliminate nuclear energy by coming up with something superbly more efficient and less expensive -- ""research"" is the answer to this question, and not the kind of political throw-away junk research the US Department of Energy has blown billions and billions on since it was stupidly founded by Jerry Ford 30 years ago."

You are from Kordestan, aren't you?
yes, you may need to drive a ways. If they are only in the immigration building then they will not let you see them, you can only see them in a detention ceter. Most of the time they will let you bring a bag of clothes to the immigration building though, as long as you do it asap. A person can be deported in the matter of a day. I would suggest that you call the place that they are being held and find out if you can see the person. You also can bail the person out for $7000.00. Then you will have to go to a hearing with a judge, and they will return the money to you and decide if he must be deported.
The US Postal Service is always running at a loss.  They have to try to cut that loss, so we're stuck with buying 2 cent stamps.

That's how my husband and I went for months without even realizing the rate had been changed.
You should pay something but limited to services, amenities used, in line with anybody using a house a boat or even  a second home, but you should pay only for one at a time.
"A criminal history is not necessarily a disqualifier when trying to join the military although as you said it will require a waiver.  Technically even if your history is expunged you are required by law to disclose it on the military application papers.  Your best bet is to work with a recruiter although obviously some serious offenses are disqualifying.  Also if any of your offenses are related to domestic violence they are disqualifying.\n\nThe MEPs station does not do a very thorough job checking your teeth.  They do a vision screening although I am not sure what the situations are where they would disqualify someone.\n\nAs a side note I would encourage you to ignore frank_ramirez_81.  Clearly he is ignorant as to the army/military and how it works.\n\nThe majority of troops are middle class and indeed lower class.  He would probably reserect that tired argument that lower class minorities are forced by their situation to join the military.  As someone from that background (Lower Class) I can say unequivocally that this is false.  There are opportunities out there for anyone who wants them.  I attended college before joining the military for example.  There are dozens if not hundreds of programs out there for those who wish to succeed.  The military is just one option.\n\nAs to his statement, ""You know that by joining you will be sent to Iraq right?""\n\nThat is possible but increasingly less likely.  I've been in for a while now and have tried on numerous occassions to volunteer to go down range.  Foolish perhaps but something many of us in the military want to do.  The long and the short of it is that despite my efforts I've not met with success.  Of course if you were to pick a combat arms branch (Infantry, Armour, Calvary etc.) the likelyhood is much greater.\n\nAnyone ignore Frank and people like him.  Talk to a recruiter if you want to get in they will likely find a way."
"I don't understand what people mean when they say it's not ""natural.""  Natural means something that exists in nature... homosexuality is naturally occuring, therefore it is natural.  Homosexuality is frequently seen among other primate species, not to mention that it has always been a part of human culture (whether openly or not).  What do you mean by not ""natural?""  It happens in nature, therefore it can't be not natural.  I just don't get that argument.  \n\nI do think that same sex marriages should be legal, I don't think that there's a substantive difference between ""unions"" and ""marriage""--it's not all in the name, there's nothing in the name but pointless bigotry, and haven't we already been through ""separate but equal""?  And I don't get how legalizing same sex marriage would be the end of society.  Nobody has yet explained that to me, except to say that in Norway they have legalized gay marriage and more Norwegian kids are now born out of wedlock.  What the connection is there, I'm not sure, and why it's bad for kids to be born out of wedlock, I'm not sure either, as long as they have a loving home."
"The term 'politician' implies the person employs politics to achieve goals that cannot be achieved by the will of a single person absent the consent and willing support of other people.  Politicians come in all types. All require a healthy ego,but some are more ""cold"" than others. It does not mean they do not ""care"" about the ""People"".  All the political parties in USA have a ""core belief"" about HOW they wish to do the most good for the most people. These ""core beliefs"" are very different. But they do both have the same intent - to help the people and thus strengthen the nation (town, county, state - whatever).  They both also deal with a limited set of resources with which to show how they ""care"" by helping in one way or another. In the end, they must achieve allocation of the resources in a way they feel will do the most good and do it with (in USA anyway) a majority of thier peers accepting the solution. If the politician does not ""care"" for enough of the people, they will sense it and turn him out - or his party out. In a perfect world ALL the people will find some measure of gain but at the margin of satisfaction there will be just under 50% who would prefer a different politician was leading the policy agenda.\nI think one politician that ""connects"" and reaches a high level of satisfaction among his constituents is Jeb Bush. I think Reagan was able to ""connect"" like that and also John Kennedy. I think Clinton and Bush ""cared/care"" but the fog of partisanship in the rank and file (with these particular personalites among others in our history) leaves about half the people unable to see the good the other half are seeing."
I don't live in her district, but her office was very helpful a few years back when a friend of mine from Sharon WI was in a bit of a jam.  I think she cares about people, so yes, I would vote for her if I could.\n\nP.S. I would never, ever vote for Phil Koss!
I totally understand what you are saying and feel that if most people were faced with the same circumstances they would do the same thing. It is easy for people to judge when not in that situation and have such a good life here in our country. \n\nDon't judge any man until you have walked a mile in their shoes.\n\nAnd no one is saying that logically they can come here and break our laws and rob, steal, rape sell drugs etc because of their situations but what is the harm in them coming here to work? And it is true that Visa's are almost impossible to get.\n\nIt's not all cut & dry and that simple as people would like to think.

Article I, Legislative Powers; Article II, Executive Powers; Article III, Judicial Powers; Article IV, Privileges of Citizens and State powers; Article V, Amendments of the Constitution; Article VI, Authority of the United States, shall be the Supreme Law of the Land; Article VII, Ratification of the Constitution by the States.
There are bits and pieces throughout the responses that are correct.  \n\nThe Marines are within the Department of Defense.  However, within the DoD they are administratively attached to the Department of the Navy which is led by the Secretary of the Navy.  A Marine 4-star is on the Joint Chiefs of Staff (one is currently the Chairman) as is a Navy 4-star.  So, for all intents and purposes they are their own branch of the military but due to traditions and history they have not been given their own department within the DoD.  Although, I believe there is  probably a large majority of senior Marines that would like their own Dept even though falling within the Dept of the Navy is really only administrative.\n\nIt's just the history that at one time they were the Naval Infantry.  There is no reason to not think of them as their own entity.

I think the leaders of most nations cater to big business and organizations that don't always have the peoples interest in mind. These companies put large amounts of money into their local/national politicians and usually have economic implications that affect all classes. Our precious planet ultimately suffers as well.

A child (anyone under the age of 18) cannot just move out from their parent(s) home. The parent(s) are responsible for the child till that child reaches 18. You can leave your parents' house without their permission when you reach the age of 18, or they can kick you out. \n\nYou cannot leave before you reach 18, although there are a few exceptions. \n\nExceptions to this rule: \n\n\nIf a child gets pregnant, that child can get married without parental consent and after the marriage will be consider emancipated. \n\nThe teen can become emancipated. There is no prescribed emancipation status laws, such cases are adjudicated on an individual basis. This requires a ruling from a judge. You must convince the judge that there is good legal reason for you to be able to leave your home. In the state of Georgia on an annual basis this happens about a dozen times. \n\nThe teen can join the military with parental consent at age 17.

Every country in this world has the right to develop nuclear weapons, and have nuclear armaments. However, when the leader of said country threatens the very existence of another, I believe that right should be taken away from him. \n\nYour question is quite ambiguous. What do you mean good? 'Good' to you is 'despicable' to others. The lower-class people of Iran think him to be 'good' because they think he's striving for an independant, fearless and powerful Iran. Israel thinks he's 'bad' because of the threats he made. \n\nIt all depends on your viewpoint.
"They aren't 100% oil-free, it's just that alternative fuel (E85 ethanol most of the time) is offered at virtually every pump, or at least in Brasil. This was done via heavy government influence, something Americans don't usually like. But the answer that i love the most is that of Representative Dave Camp (Republican-MI) who said that it is, and i quote, ""the current political air of washington right now is very against alternative fuel"". When asked to specify if it was the executive office (ie the president and his men) he agreed that it was."

I don't know of any state that automatically gives the spouse of a convict a waiver of court costs; however, every state does have  a method for obtaining a waiver of court costs by persons who have low incomes.  Check with your local court to find out what the schedule is.\n\nStates do not supply attorneys to divorce litigants, so your choice is to hire counsel, try to find free counsel, or do it yourself.   Most local bar associations have referral services including referrals to attorneys who have agreed to take some cases for free or on a sliding scale.

In Wisconsin the law states that anyone who has sex with someone under 13 is guilty of first degree sexual assault and anyone who has sex with someone under 16 is guilty of second degree sexual assault. So, you must be 16 to legally have sex and cannot have sex with any younger teens.
"There are a lot of good reasons to join the military.  You get the opportunity to travel, meet people from backgrounds that are very different from your own, learn and continuously practice self-discipline, be part of a team, serve your country, hold a job where the ultimate goal is to defend our country versus make a corporation money, and to constantly push yourself and your limits further.  There are the benefits like health and dental care, a steady dependable paycheck, and money for school (even grad school).  The only cons are that to receive these things you need to be willing to sacrafice.  You will sacrafice a lot of your personal time (this isn't a 9-5 job).  You will sacrafice some of your personal freedoms, you are expected to live by certain rules and codes (all of which is completely achievable).  You will have to sacrafice always  being comfortable, a lot of what the military expects you to do isn't fun when you are going through it (it is the experiences that are the hardest when we are doing them that we learn the most from and are the most proud of later).  In my opinion it is 100% worth it and I have never been ""screwed out"" of anything in my time (I haven't always gotten what I've wanted, but that is life).  \n\nIf you are currently in college, you have a couple of different options.  You could go through ROTC and consider a commission as an officer.  There is nothing wrong with the option of enlisting and is just a different choice (and is certainly one to be respected).  ROTC is for the Army although there is seperate commissioning program for the Marines (I would look on their web site if you are interested).  If you really want to go to Ranger school you need to join the Army and make sure they put it in your enlistment contract.  If you go in as officer it is a different process.\n\nWhatever decision you make, Army or Marines, officer or enlisted, I wish you luck and hope you decide to join."

"Liberals -vs- Conservative only applies to those who are in the position to make decisions. The masses who use this rhetoric are simply building up some false bravado to feel less impotent than they know they are - politically of course. \n\nThe focus that people who are not in control, who are being controlled, like us, should first be understanding what power is all about.\n\nThe distinctions we should realize are obvious. There is no ""Liberal"" or ""Conservative"" bias in the Media, the Media responds to those who control things. The Media is designed to present an image of the world that represents the wishes and desires of the elite who own the Media. \n\nNo greater example of this could be found than the way venezuela is being portrayed now. It is a complete hoax, by writers who are on the oppostion parties payroll. This is occuring in the US press because after a failed repression by force, a failed coup, a failed election, a failed referendum on legitimacy of the democratic election, a failed drive to upset the nation to rise against thier chosen leader, the oppostion has gone abroad to drum up international dissent against the democratically elected president of Venezuela. Is that ""Conservative"" or ""Liberal"" no, it represents Power. \n\nThe distinction we people should make is - does this policy or political opinion agree with OUR needs, wants, desires, OUR concept of freedom and liberty? Or is it part of this new takeover by the power-elite who could care less what we think, no matter how much people want tp prop thmeselves up as Young Republicans or Anarchists and all in between.\n\nThis mentality has been lost, this is one aspect of unionization, the union hall, where people could talk to people about people's issues, that has been attacked, and drummed completely out of our heads.\n\nAs a result, we cannabalize eachother with meaningless distinctions like ""Libs"" or ""Repuglicans"" in doing so we are capitulating to the needs, wants and desires of those who run the show, just as planned.\n\nFreedom starts with you, your soul, and your mind... if you can't break free from this psychological warfare then you will lose to it. \n\nbest wishes."
Time doesn't erase the past.\n\nAn estimated $850 million in U.S. assets were seized by the Castro in 1960.\n\nThe guy spent his whole life comparing capitalism to imperialism, and at the same time killing thousands of political opponents over that same span.\n\nHe was on the wrong side of the Cold War.\n\nHe had many opportunities to forge a partnership (or mend it depending on your perspective) with the U.S. before the embargo of 1962.\n\n\nBottom line is that a lot has to happen for us to just forget the past and let bigons be bigons.

The judicial branch interprets whether laws passed by the executive and legislative branch are constitutional or not.\n\nObviously, the system doesn't always work, as the members of the supreme court can be biased to either extreme.

Fact is there is more than enough food produced on the planet to feed everyone. In the Untied states alone we produce 3 times the amount need to feed our people, yet there is still starvation in this country.\n\nThe only answer to why is politics. One side says that its wrong to just give way food, that the poor must work for it, the government has no buisness funding programs.\n\nOn a global scale it is much more complicated. and population is not the reason it can not be solved.\nMajor reasons include.\n\n*unstable governments in the poorest nations.\nWaring nations.\n*Lack of Prioritization of the problem by stable rich nations.\n*Lack of Funding to distrubute food, lack of storage facilities.\n*Lack of evironmental regulations..(rivers and oceans, ect ect)\n\nBut if you want the simplest answer...is that mankind is flawed. They nation before humanity, they see borders before need. They say there is no solution so they do not try.\nIs there a soultion to that....I am not sure.

"Go to any store and buy something. Then read what the label says. Usually it says ""made in China"". If you stop trading with them, you won't get the microwave or toaster or the laptop or the memory chip inside the laptop or the iPod or the shirt or the sneakers.. and you will become like the people in Africa. Because when you send manufacturing jobs abroad, you stop and tear down the factories and stop training the labor force, and stop producing the capital goods needed to make the factory again and stop training the labor force to build those capital goods.. and so on. It's a long chain backwards: the supply chain. You don't have a supply chain anymore. Just like Africa. What you do have is money to buy the products from that supply chain. In order to keep your civilization alive, you need China. Or you could rebuild the industries in the USA from scratch. That would take another 50 years again."

"The narcissistic leader is the culmination and reification of his period, culture, and civilization. He is likely to rise to prominence in narcissistic societies.\n\nThe malignant narcissist invents and then projects a false, fictitious, self for the world to fear, or to admire. He maintains a tenuous grasp on reality to start with and this is further exacerbated by the trappings of power. The narcissist's grandiose self-delusions and fantasies of omnipotence and omniscience are supported by real life authority and the narcissist's predilection to surround himself with obsequious sycophants.\n\nThe narcissist's personality is so precariously balanced that he cannot tolerate even a hint of criticism and disagreement. Most narcissists are paranoid and suffer from ideas of reference (the delusion that they are being mocked or discussed when they are not). Thus, narcissists often regard themselves as ""victims of persecution"".\n\nThe narcissistic leader fosters and encourages a personality cult with all the hallmarks of an institutional religion: priesthood, rites, rituals, temples, worship, catechism, mythology. The leader is this religion's ascetic saint. He monastically denies himself earthly pleasures (or so he claims) in order to be able to dedicate himself fully to his calling.\n\nThe narcissistic leader is a monstrously inverted Jesus, sacrificing his life and denying himself so that his people - or humanity at large - should benefit. By surpassing and suppressing his humanity, the narcissistic leader became a distorted version of Nietzsche's ""superman"".\n\nBut being a-human or super-human also means being a-sexual and a-moral.\n\nIn this restricted sense, narcissistic leaders are post-modernist and moral relativists. They project to the masses an androgynous figure and enhance it by engendering the adoration of nudity and all things ""natural"" - or by strongly repressing these feelings. But what they refer to as ""nature"" is not natural at all.\n\nThe narcissistic leader invariably proffers an aesthetic of decadence and evil carefully orchestrated and artificial - though it is not perceived this way by him or by his followers. Narcissistic leadership is about reproduced copies, not about originals. It is about the manipulation of symbols - not about veritable atavism or true conservatism.\n\nIn short: narcissistic leadership is about theatre, not about life. To enjoy the spectacle (and be subsumed by it), the leader demands the suspension of judgment, depersonalization, and de-realization. Catharsis is tantamount, in this narcissistic dramaturgy, to self-annulment.\n\nNarcissism is nihilistic not only operationally, or ideologically. Its very language and narratives are nihilistic. Narcissism is conspicuous nihilism - and the cult's leader serves as a role model, annihilating the Man, only to re-appear as a pre-ordained and irresistible force of nature.\n\nNarcissistic leadership often poses as a rebellion against the ""old ways"" - against the hegemonic culture, the upper classes, the established religions, the superpowers, the corrupt order. Narcissistic movements are puerile, a reaction to narcissistic injuries inflicted upon a narcissistic (and rather psychopathic) toddler nation-state, or group, or upon the leader.\n\nMinorities or ""others"" - often arbitrarily selected - constitute a perfect, easily identifiable, embodiment of all that is ""wrong"". They are accused of being old, they are eerily disembodied, they are cosmopolitan, they are part of the establishment, they are ""decadent"", they are hated on religious and socio-economic grounds, or because of their race, sexual orientation, origin ... They are different, they are narcissistic (feel and act as morally superior), they are everywhere, they are defenceless, they are credulous, they are adaptable (and thus can be co-opted to collaborate in their own destruction).

"I would recommend consulting with an immigration attorney for a full answer, but here's my experience.\nIf you lose your legal status for one reason or another, you can still be eligible for a Legal Permanent Resident status at a later point. As a matter of fact, the applications asks you the question, whether at some point you were ""illegal"". Things like that happen, and the expired student visa case is not unique. The key to avoiding legal problems is not leaving the country before obtaining the LPR status.\nHowever, when it comes to leaving and then re-entry, you will have some serious problems. Violation of the legal status can lead to anything from a 3-year to a 10-year bar from obtaining a visa. I have also heard from an attorney of a vast number of cases where people were barred from re-entry permanently. Check Ch. 8, CFR. for more details, or the www.uscis.gov website."
America has flaws in the democratic system, in school you're never taught what they are.  Some flaws have been resolved now, such as inequality being written into the Constitution itself with the 3/5 Compromise.  Now African Americans have full rights, but before it was different.  That's an example of a past flaw, but now, we have problems with corruption, just like any other government.  Most flaws lie in the setup of the voting.  Technically the people do not select the president, that is done through the electoral college, which was created because the formers of the Constitution believed that the people of the United States were too stupid to elect the president themselves.  \nAnother flaw with the voting is the fact that Congress passes laws affecting people who are not represented.  Such laws include driving and abortion laws.  \nWith the party system we currently have it makes it almost impossible for someone outside of the a 3rd party to be on a ballot, let alone win an election.

Although 'the shaved head' was originally applied for good hygiene, it progressed to being executed as a means of 'humility of the military individual.'\nIt also strips the individual of his individuality and allows everyone to be on par, or on an equal level with each other. As the basic-training uniform is also standard and applied to all recruits, allowing everyone the identical or uniformed look, so likewise is the shaved head. \n\nIn concluding: It is for personal hygiene, uniformity, and this promotes team work, unity and Esprit de Corps.

I did a lot of research to prepare this answer.  I scoured the Internet for more data, and reviewed many issues of both the New Yorker and the Los Angles Times for more background information.  When Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was a young boy living in his native land, he was thirsty for knowledge and learning.  There were few books in the desert, and those that were available were written in English, a language the youngster could not comprehend.  He slowly learned to read and speak English, mostly self-taught.  One day, as legend would have it, he discovered a box of books that were tattered and torn, all with wonderful animation and written by the same author.  He read the books, carefully, and at first glance did not appreciate the dry wit.  After learning more of the nuances of the English language, he began to find the books mildly amusing, then later, uproariously hilarious.  The books were all written by an American infidel named Charles Schultz.  Abu Musab al-Zarqawi found the most interesting character to be Pig Pen.  He could identify with the constant dust swirling around the young lad, and felt a kinship to him.  He started to write long, flowing letters to Charles Shultz, all of them with the same theme.  He wanted to know about the Pig Pen character.  He also requested that Charles Shultz change the name of Pig Pen to “Infidel Pig Pen”, but none of his letters were ever answered.  Later, to his horror, he found out that Pig Pen was based on a real human being, Rory Emerald.  He discovered this one day, while reading the New Yorker.  He was most outraged when he found out that Rory Emerald had violated Charles Schultz’s pet animals, and even had “relations” with a disgusting swine.  \n\nIt appears that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was not obsessed with destroying America or Americans.  His obsession was more in the destruction of Rory Emerald, the noted celebrity, who has residences in both New York City and Los Angeles.  When he learned of Mr. Emerald’s bedding down with swine, it so enraged Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, that his vision became blurred.  His mantra became “the infidel must die!”  As a known terrorist, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi had many weapons at his disposal.  Fortunately, his timely death ended the threat to Rory Emerald’s life.  At Abu Musab al-Zarqawi’s funeral, Rory Emerald was quoted as saying “It is a sad day in mankind, when we cheer and applaud the death of another human being”, while tears slowly cascaded down his cheeks.  \n\nPersonally, I am glad he is dead, but in keeping spirit with Rory Emerald’s sage words, I will not applaud too loudly.  His words brought tears to my eyes.

I believe you can join certain divisions of the Italian military if you are a non-citizen. Doing so will:\n\n1)Automatically Grant you Italian Citizenship.\n2)Will not invalidate your American Citizenship (as long as the country whose military you are joining is not at war against the US).\n\nFor example, a number of naturalized US Citizens of Jewish decent go back to Israel become dual citizens and serve within the Israeli Defense Forces without penalty to their US Citizenship.\n\nA US Supreme Court Ruling in the 1960s stated that the only way an American can lose his or her citizenship is if he or she formally renounces it.

"A contract consists of three parts.  An offer, acceptance, and consideration.  The offer was from the mechanic saying he would fix your car for $300.  There was no acceptance, because you said no.  Consideration is something one side gives up in order to fulfill the contract...this would have happened if you paid him for the work he did.  \nThere is no agreement here, no ""meeting of the minds""..you do not have to pay, and he needs to give you your car back.  He also violated professional courtesy by taking your car home...\nTry telling him you have talked to a lawyer, maybe that will convince him to give you your car back."

Ken Starr's (and other key Republicans) relentless quest to debase Bill Clinton during his presidency (from Whitewater to Vince Foster to Monica Lewinsky..its important to note that he was unable to find incriminating evidence against Clinton in any of these areas.  He had to rely on a Republican Congress to get impeachment, which Americans were adamantly against)...where's our non-partisan, independent counsel now?

If you can define yourself as either Liberal or Conservative then you are a sheep in someone's game. What this country needs is free independent thinkers, who want to better the country no matter what party they are from. Furthermore attacking someone just because they are more liberal or conservative then you is igorant. You never know what someone might teach you if you just open your ears.

LOL.. No, that is not how it works. At this time we have an abundance of natural resources. More than enough for everybody to have a decent standard of living. In fact we waste more natural resources worldwide than we actually use. The poorest nations being often the biggest wasters. \n\nThe concept that all should just be instantly shared with everybody has allure for the scared and desperate. The lulling thought that you will always be taken care of. That some devine fairness will magically appear in a species which has always in the past had to work so hard to establish fairness and justice. Hate to bust your bubble but it aint going to happen. People are people and communist systems like that breed corruption even faster than other systems. Think about it this way. You have a computer, which is something the majority of the world doesn't.  Should they not chop up the parts in your computer to pay for food in a nation that used to produce excess food until a corrupt Government took over and destroyed the agricultural system?  Should you be responsible for the mistakes made in another nation which you personally and your nation had nothing to do with? \n\nIn reality barter/trade is the fairest system we've yet devised. Taking something away from somebody will only instill hostility and bitterness. It doesn't make the person you give it too any more wealthy. It just makes all poor. Instead of some being miserable all are miserable except for an elite core which replaces the rich with an even deeper and less challlengble elite caste. So in the end all your suggestion accomplishes if it were implimented is to remove all chance you personally have of gaining wealth. It will make life even less fair. It will make the poor poorer as redistribution is both an incentive not to produce and costs resources which means there is still less left to go around. \n\nYou want to help the poor then help them learn self sufficiency and fight corruption wherever you find it. Corruption is the main cause of poverty. It is injustice embodied. A bribed politician is the cancer of civalization.
Ya some people do think it's OK.  NOT ME!  Our government is a disgrace to our founding fathers and all our ancestors who died in battle for our right to sit here and discuss this issue freely.  Our government has forgotten what it is to be an American.  The care our government offers illegal immigrants is a spit in the face of my grandfathers, my widowed grandmothers and orphaned cousins.  Respect and gratitude for the sacrifices and pledges to our American Flag is almost gone.  We're turning into a country of sissy's scared of a few years of hard economical stress. Our compassion is misplaced.  I'm not afraid of the hard times we may go through if we send them all back where they came from.  My hard times are already here, an illegal stole my identity, ruined my credit and got my taxes this year.  I struggled for months to get a min. wage job and was beat out over and over again by illegals cuz I don't speak spanish and wouldn't fit in.  I don't make enough $ to buy health insurance for myself and my kid but I make too much to get health care for free.  I'm deep in debt and have not been offered a single break.  F*** this S***!  What do I have to be afraid of?  Economical set back in this country for a few years is the better sacrifice for me.  At least I'd stand a chance of living out my last years with the pension I've earned and a hope for my grand children's future.  Wow I need to catch a breath, LOL.
"Many Green  Berets are also qualified Rangers. Green berets are trained in unconventional (guerilla) warfare, but are mostly tasked with Indigenous Force Multiplication. They train irregular guerillas to in the arts of soldiering. A Ranger, could be referred to as a ""Super tropper"" They're trained in patrol, ambush, assault, etc. over any terrain, in any weather, against any type of target. In addition to the ""ninja"" type methods of recon, or ambush. Both are elite soldiers, but have very different missions. Green berets actual name is ""Special Forces"". But this term has been popularized by the media to refer to any type of Speciall Operations soldier."

Definitely not. Anything that is confiscated and considered contraband would be destroyed after disposition. If it was evidence it would be returned to it's rightful owner. If it is something other than that like found property or the like, the person who turned it ion is usually given the property after a set period of time depending on the jurisdiction.\nIf it is something that has been taken in a forfeiture, the court designates a date and time for an auction. Auctions are made public and posted in the newspaper or another form of media so anyone can bid on the item.\nThe only 'advantage' that an officer may have here is a better opportunity to examine the item before it goes up for auction because they studied it, had it analyzed, secured it etc.

"Che was an Argentine-born physician, Marxist revolutionary, politician, and leader of Cuban and internationalist guerrillas. As a young man studying medicine, Guevara traveled ""rough"" throughout Latin America, bringing him into direct contact with the poverty in which many people lived. Through these experiences he became convinced that only revolution could remedy the region's economic inequality, leading him to study Marxism and become involved in Guatemala's social revolution under President Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán.\nAfter his death, Guevara became an icon of socialist revolutionary movements worldwide. An Alberto Korda photo of Guevara (right) has received wide distribution and modification. The Maryland Institute of Art called this picture ""the most famous photograph in the world and a symbol of the 20th century.""[1"

To succeed in a case such as this three things must be shown: There was a duty of care owed, this duty of care was breached and the damage resulted from that breach. All employers owe a duty of care to their employees, in the U.K this includes adequate training, supervision and competent colleagues. Provided he was actually an employee and not a contractor or self employed then a duty of care can be presumed and in this case the remaining two conditions will be fulfilled. \n\nI am presuming that your solicitor will be suing in Tort (negligence). I remember a few years ago, there was a book which detailed what one would receive for a certain injury, I'll see if I can dig it out to give you an idea so check back in a few days. The amount you will receive in damages depends on a number of different factors though and is subject to enhancement or reduction for several reasons, i.e the severity of the damage and the impact this will have on his daily life etc and also whether the employer manages to atribute any contributory negligence to your husband. Your husband should also receive any back pay which he may be owed as a result of missing work and any other out of pocket expenses (i.e. travel costs for hospital appointments).

I would never trust Muslims because of their religion.  I know this is generalizing.  However, because of their propensity for violent acts and trying to mass murder any people who don't agree with their insanity, it would not be impossible for a Muslim to be your friend but highly unlikely and suspect.  I have had several opportunities to have made friends with Muslims but they make me nervous.  I do not trust them and therefore, would not pursue the friendship.

Castro is more popular than any other US President because his philosophy is rooted in fighting for the rights of the poor and under-served in society.  More than 80% of the world is made up of hard-working but marginalized people who need a leader to champion their causes, such as fighting for a living wage, universal healthcare, etc.  This is what Castro, Che Guevarra, and Hugo Chavez champion.  They work for the common people -- not for multi-national corporations.  That's why he's more popular.

"Contrary to popular belief, ""only sons,"" ""the last son to carry the family name,"" and ""sole surviving sons"" must register for the draft, they can be drafted, and they can serve in combat. However, they may be entitled to a peacetime deferment if there is a military death in the immediate family. \n\nProvisions regarding the survivors of veterans were written into Selective Service law after World War II. Details have varied over the years, but the basic premise remains the same; where a family member has been lost as a result of military service, the remaining family members should be protected insofar as possible.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that the provisions are directly related to service-connected deaths. The mere fact that a man is the only child or only son does not qualify him for consideration - he must be the survivor of one who died as a result of military service.\n\nThe present law provides a peacetime exemption for anyone whose parent or sibling was killed in action, died in line of duty, or died later as a result of disease or injury incurred in line of duty while serving in the armed forces of the United States. Also included are those whose parent or sibling is in a captured or missing status as a result of service in the armed forces during any period of time. This is known as the ""surviving son or brother"" provision. A man does not have to be the only surviving son in order to qualify; if there are four sons in a family and one dies in the line of duty, the remaining three would qualify for surviving son or brother status under the present law.\n\nThe surviving son or brother provision is applicable only in peacetime. It does not apply in time of war or national emergency declared by the Congress.\n\nThe original law, passed in 1948, exempted the sole surviving son of a family where one or more sons or daughters died as a result of military service. No restriction existed at that time to limit the exemption to peacetime. The provision was intended to protect families which had lost a member in World War II.\n\nIn 1964, recognizing that sons of World War II veterans were reaching draft age, Congress changed the law to include the sole surviving son of a family where the father, or one or more sons or daughters, died as a result of military service. At this time the peacetime-only restriction was also added to the law.\n\nA further change was made in 1971, expanding the exemption to any son, not necessarily the sole surviving son, of a family where the father, brother or sister died as a result of military service. This provision was recently expanded to include mothers.\n\n\nMilitary Discharges\nIn addition to peace-time draft deferrment, the Department of Defense authorizes discharges for any son or daughter in a family in which the father or mother or one or more sons or daughters: \n\nHave been killed in action or have died when serving in the U.S. Armed Forces from wounds, accident, or disease.\n\nAre in a captured or missing-in-action status.\n\nHave a permanent 100 percent Service-related disability (including 100 percent mental disability), as determined by the Veterans' Administration or one of the Military Services, and are not gainfully employed because of the disability.\nUnder the provisions of DOD Directive 1315.15, this is a voluntary separation procedure which must be initiated by the service member. It does not apply during times of War or National Emergency declared by Congress.\nIt also does not apply to commissioned officers or warrant officers unless they were involuntarily drafted into the Armed Forces (as there is currently no draft going on, that means commissioned officers and warrant officers cannot be released from service under this provision).\n\nAdditionally, service members who enlist, reenlist, or voluntarily extends his or her active duty period after having been notified of the family casualty on which the surviving status is"

"Obviously, it's both.  The Constitution protects freedom of expression, but there is nothing in the Constitution about a flag.  Therefore the right of self expression, including desecration of the flag, is a higher law than laws prohibiting flag desecration.  Or in other words, the Constitution does not prohibit flag desecration; on the contrary, the Constitution protects it.\n\nOne problem with flag ""desecration"" is defining it.  I have seen beach towels and bathing suits and underwear that show the US flag.  Why isn't it desecration to use the flag as a carpet or towel or clothing?"
"Because they will not be hated. Not hated enough to make a difference in the better life they will make here. Not hated enough to make a monetary difference in the income increase they will probably receive. Ever heard the saying ""Sticks and stones will break my bones but words can never hurt me!""\n\nActually I'm not sure where you heard that immigrants are hated. I find that strange, as a New Yorker.\n\nPerhaps if I lived in Texas I would feel the effects of immigrants from Mexico, but I doubt it. Even so, just cause Americans seem intolerant with their loud words and ""hatred"", they are pretty well behaved when it comes to violence.\n\nI bet a Chinese,Mexican or African Immigrant would have less of a chance of being injured in the United States by far, than in their home country. If they are white immigrants, they definitly will not have problems, except for maybe a couple of jokes at a bar.\n\nAmericans may be obnoxious and opiniated regarding immigration, but I think most people, like 99.9% of ""haters"" will not act on it. the others who do, would probably hurt anyone, regardless of race.\n\nAlso getting a Visa is a big deal, from what I hear. It's very difficult and time consuming."

I love the Queen and think she is grand, but having her as our head of state is a bit obsolete and I think we should become a republic.  That being said, it would require a major constitutional change.  This is what we had problems with when it came to the last referrendum on the subject.  Instead of asking if we wanted the republic or not, and THEN deciding the model, we were presented with a pretty wishy washy model and asked if we wanted that kind of republic or not.  All those who wanted the monachy to stay voted NO, but then a lot of us republican supporters also voted NO because that model was unacceptable to us.  I think there would have been a very different outcome if the question or the model was different, but then we won't have a chance to try  it again while our current government is in power.  For the time being, we need to go on with tradition.

"Insurance is a pool. When an accident happens, money is taken out of the pool. The reason why insurance rates go up is because people get into accidents.

There is no stock answer that will cover all situations and every jurisdiction.  Each state has it's own laws and procedures.  I advise that you check the web site of your own state, and with the legislature, you can find the laws.\n\nOtherwise, check with a prosecutor's office and they will advise the time period for your state and jurisdiction.  Remember, a judge most often has the prerogative to vary the actual time period of probation when it is offered.
Of course they do.  They lose them all.\n\nConsider the right to a fair and speedy trial, the writ of habeus corpus, the right to peaceably assemble or petition for redress of grievances all dead and gone if that happens.\n\nMore importantly, the right to keep and bear arms is almost certainly gone, so whatever they want to do to you they will do to you as long as they wish.\n\nMartial law, not a good thing.  If there is a massive breakdown in the social order, it might be deemed necessary.  But it is not a good thing.  \n\nSociety does not require government to exist, but most people believe in the illusion that it does.  Thus, if public services cease from a massive disaster or attack, it is likely that elements of society will suddenly go nuts and start rampaging like a pack of wild animals.  While simple posses or voluntary militia could deal with them fine, it is likely that the government will want to protect itself and its own assets, so they will roll in martial law.
I don't see anything racist there.   Immigrants must agree to abide by requirements set by the host nation,  or stay home.  Migrants are not citizens and should not be entitled to many of the things citizens are.   It only makes sense that migrants strive for citizenship, and learning the language and respecting the laws of the host country is a must.  \n\nNot,  its not being racist.  It's setting clear rules.  America should do the samething.
I have heard that too and that is crap.  I think you should have to pay to get it and be a citizen of the US to reap our benefits.  I don't know who's bright idea that was but I'm sure as soon as they let us know he will not be a very popular man.

It is part of the duty of citizenship to communicate with our elected officials to give them our opinion.  They may not take the advice (and they are doing for us as they consider proper) but sometimes maybe a constituent can provide information the official may need to help with a decision.  I agree the system is hurting.  The best answer for a third party (and I am interested in groups like  the Constitution Party) is to start with some local elections and build from there.  They don't have the juice to make it on the national stage yet, I fear.
"The criticism of the military on this site are from two different sources.  The first is from other Americans who are ignorant of how they are able to maintain the freedoms that they take for granted.  These are the same idiots that think all military personnel are murderers.  They will go on rants about how the president is a tyrant rather than making an informed intellectual argument.  They are not worth the time or energy because they don't have the intelligence to research a topic before running their mouths.  The second is from some foreigners that have had nothing but the extremely liberal media to use to gain an understanding of US policy.  Not all (nor even the majority of) foreigners are like this but you'll notice a lot of the critics on this site that are trashing our military are doing so in broken English.\n\nDon't waste your time worrying what either of these types of people say!  It is because of our military that they have the freedom to say it at all, but you are never going to get them to admit it!\n\n""AIRBORNE"""

No, I do not think that a majority of Americans go along with denying civil liberty's. This one falls directly on the Bush administration, I think that they should be tried as war criminals for this and other crimes against humanity. He has set himself up as a dictator and with a rubber stamp repuglican congress he will remain that way, that is one of the many reasons that we need to elect enough democrats this November to restore checks and balances to the government.
The govt. may take your property so long as it is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.  Increasing a tax base is a legitimate state interest.  Note however, that states may enact more stringent laws, not allowing the state govt to take property for private development, so if you don't like your state's rule then petition your state legislators.
Government that is elected by the people  and can be removed by the people.\n\nWe allow duly elected politicians an unfettered right to represent us during the tenure of a parliament.\n\nToo much, so called democracy, however, can create anarchy.\nThe BBC and other television media constantly invite viewers opinions on a whole range of issues. The problem is that they have their own agenda and will not tolerate opinions that do not conform to it. They seem to be setting themselves up as an alternative government, requiring democratically elected politicians to attend their studios to be held to account.\n\nSo, in my view, democracy does not include constantly referring back to the public for its opinions on every issue, particularly when Mr. and Mrs. Smith are not qualified to answer the questions. All you end up with is a committee comprising of every barrack room lawyer in the land. Reminds me of the UN.

there are 2 parts to this answer.  the first is that rich people are assholes.  they feel as if they are entitled to everything and are out of touch with reality.  they are idiots.  i worked at a country club with only semi-rich people and they were the biggest dick heads ive ever met.  im talking about MOUNTAIN LAKES NEW JERSEY i hope someone reads this.  the other is that immigrants come in and take poorly paying jobs and remain poor.
Yeah, I agree with above (to meet with a recruiter), but join the Army instead.  The Marines are overrated, and they end up using Army or Navy training schools anyway.  When you are a Marine, no one respects you except other Marines.  When you are in the Army, people from other forces respect you as a soldier.
it had nothing to do with the president's job.  Kenneth star could not get Clinton on anything else so he went after a sex scandal, knowing that he could get him to lie on the subject or embarrass him.  what he and Monica did in the oval office had nothing to do with the original investigation.\nthere have been plenty of politicians that have been adulterers and others that have laundered money and got away with it.  i do not believe anybody in Washington can really take a moral high ground on this.  there is plenty of shame to go around on both sides, democrat and republican.  \npart of power is that it corrupts.  i do not care who it is, there is the potential to act self righteous and lie about many issues, not just about if one had extra curricular activities in the oval office closet.\nas the general said to Joe McCarthy, sir, have you no shame?\nI say this to our current president and congress.
Technically, is not legal to take a person's picture if the picture identifies the person. ie: you can tell it is them in the picture. If the face is blurred or it is the backside of a person it is OK and legal.\n\nNow, if that person grants you the rights to their immage it is OK. Obviously, if they prohibit you from taking/using the picture, they do not grant rights of usage. \n\nThis is because a person's image is technically their coppyright. \n\nor at least these are the guidelines that I follow...
short answer, Yep. Royal Navy, Submarines. \nSeeing battered surface ships return to port. \nFriends on HMS Conquerer (which sunk the Belgrano) telling me that moments before, they were looking at Belgrano through the periscope, then, the Torpedoes hit Belgrano (3 World war 2 vintage torpedoes) Belgrano started to sink, great elation on board Conqueror. \nBUT.... within 5 mins there were grown men, in quiet corners of the submarine, sobbing...when they realised what they had done, and thought of the guys who had been killed, and thier families.\nEven tough guys have hearts.\nGeneral Submarine routine is leave harbour, 24 hours later, dive. Two months later, surface. 24 hours later, back in harbour.....any takers???

"Anti-american he is! And so are billions of other people that are sick and tired of american imperial interventions in their countries. The only threat to america is the current fascists and unthinking robtic reactionaries like yourself that are a real danger. You have been spoon fed a false image of what this country really is. Castro does not nearly have as much blood on his hands as the rulers of this country have. Do you remember the genocide in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos (3 million dead).  What about Chile and Guatemala? 40,000 and over 200,000 dead respectively. \n\nYour rhetoric on this question exposes your ignorance and i surely would hate to have your ideology and beliefs. You make it seem as if you care about poor people.   You said "" kill the commie bastard and throw out his regime and insititute a free democracy for those poor people over [there] just 90 miles from USA"". Well, the US has been toppling government to supposedly establish democracies. Some examples are Guatemala in 1954 and Iran in 1953. These were democratic goverments the the US toppled. In their place the US installed BRUTAL dictators that make Fidel Castro look like kindergarden Bully! Its as a result of the intervention in Iran in 1953 that today we have the problem we have today with that country, which by my standards has the moral and legal right under international law to defend itself. \n\nI will finish off here with a qoute from Geogre Orwells book 1984. A book applicable to the brutal regimes of Stalin, Hitler, and to this one! It is a qoute that perfectly describes drones like you!\n\n""Parsons was Winston's fellow employee at the Ministry of Truth. He was a fattish but active man of paralyzing stupidity, a mass of imbecile enthusiasms—one of those completely unquestioning, devoted drudges on whom, more even than on the thought police, the stability of the Party depended."" —pg 22\n\nMike\nInternational Relations Ph. D\nStanford Univeristy\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA response to RANDY's posting:\n\nRany behind your eloquent words is really a sense od misunderstanding of the whole problem with ""terrorism"". You are wrong onmany points and i will focus on 2 of them.\n\n1) You stated: ""The United States has been attacked multiple times by terrorists with increasing intensity. It is the job of the federal government to ensure that such attacks come to an end.""\n\n*You imply here that the US is the victim and that it needs to carry out its wars in Iraq & Afganistan both as a response to 911 (& other attacks) and as a way to prevent such attacks in the future. This is wrong. Attacking other countries will only inflames tensions and create more ""terrorism"". My claim is back by a CIA report to the Senate Foreign Relations Commitee last year in which the CIA itself has said that the war in Iraq has increased anymosity toward the US & increased the number of terror attack worldwide. In addtion, you have to realize that is was the US that created this problem in the first place. Starting in 1953 with the over throw of DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED Prime Minister Mohamed Mossadegh to install a BRUTAL dictator that killed, raped, and torutred Iranians. ALL IRAINIANS REMEMBER THIS.\nthe way to end terrorism is to get out of Iraq & Afganistan now and stop meedling in other countries affairs! \n\n2) You WRONGFULLY state: ""It has proceeded down this path with restraint. While other cultures have a moral foundation that allows, even dictates, targeting civilians, the United States doesn’t.""\n\n*Where have you been these last few years? Does your televsion only get FOX news? Do you only read the Weekly Srandard? My God!!!! Have you not heard about what happened in Haditha??? What about Abu Griab??? What about Islamyia??\nRestraint??? In Hadita, INNOCENT WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE DRAGGED FROM THEIR HOMES AND SHOT IN COLD BLOOD!!! YOU CALL TH"

James H is correct. Its a couple of minutes walk from Southend Victoria train Station and it is definitely not London Road.\n\nIf you are driving there are plenty of parking spaces scattered all over. On the side of the road of the building there are parking metres down a slip road or alternatively on the other side of the dual carriageway there is a small car park next to the library. Otherwise park in the town centre (3 minutes walk) and walk back.

You can claim for consequential losses, but you have a duty to mitigate your losses, so only those directly and consequentially which are forseeable as a direct result of any incident. 18 months is way to long to claim, at the most losses like 3 months or reasonable in the circumstances, if you could see losses happening, the law states that you have a duty to mitigate.\n\nI will give you an example, if someone crashes into your car, and renders it undrivable, the insurance company will pay your reasonable costs for travel, but if you hire a limo for the time you car is out, thats not reasonable, as you are not mitigating your losses.\n\nGive it a shot, a lawyer who tells you go ahead and claim is only interested in fleecing you.\n\nSecondly, you should try and get insurance, for costs, if the other side backs down, its doesn't mean you won, its means you settled, and trust me they won't pay your 18 month losses.
"What exactly is meant by the separation of church and state has always been controversial.  The founding fathers used a generic ""God"" with the idea that there were different religions but all believed in some kind of God.  Then atheists felt slighted.  And of course, there are so many different concepts of ""God"", that no matter what there's someone who'll disagree.  So, it goes back and forth and will continue to do so, as long as man thinks for himself and is not exactly like every other man.\n\nPersonally, the basic concept behind the 10 commandments- the message they convey- really isn't all that controversial.  All those things are covered by our laws, so what's the big deal about putting them in writing and posting them in your schools and courthouse....  Well, there wouldn't be any problem with it, if it didn't come from a religious text.  If it was written in a law book or our consitution, it would be accepted.  But because it's from a religious text, it defies the separation of church and state and can possibly offend people who worship using a different religious text."

This is a myth. The US government tends to be motivated by interests, not humanitarian principles. And those interests are actually interests of a few corporations.\n\nDenmark gives the most amount of its GDP (1.01%) to developing countries; Norway gives 0.91%; the Netherlands give 0.79% and so on until the end of list, where the USA sits. Yes, America ranks DEAD LAST in foreign aid at a pathetic 0.1% of its GDP, compared to the other 21 nations listed as developed nations. The idea that the US government is a heroic bunch that runs around the world helping the poor and the disempowered is not backed up by the evidence. We have one of the stingiest governments on earth. \n\nMost Americans believe the US spends 24% of its budget on aid to poor countries; the actual amount is well under a quarter of 1%. Our country also ranks #5 on asylum-seeker acceptance rates (#1 is Denmark and #2 is Canada).
"I suppose it depends on what the mission was.  If it was ""to end terror"", then no, as there have been terrorist attacks all over the world since then.  If it was to find ""Weapons of Mass Destruction"", remember that was the reason for the war, then no.  If it was to liberate Iraq, then I would have to say no way in hell.  If the mission was to get control of Iraqi oil, then he accomplished his mission. If the mission was to distract the American public, then I would personally say yes."
"Americans voted for Bush because they can be led by the nose to believe any lies any politician will tell. Now, they're beginning to see what an incompetent bozo this jerk really is, but there's nothing they can do about it until the next election. What will they do then? Vote for another incompetent bozo!\n\nOur flawed electoral process is corrupt, fraudulent, and rigged. Bush stole two elections using his money and influence with the Supreme Court and voting officials. Since then Bush has:\n\n1. Massacred tens of thousands of Iraqi citizens;\n2. Killed more than 2,500 U.S. soldiers;\n3. Forced this country into trillions of dollars of debt;\n4. Initiated failed economic policies that have benefited the rich and destroyed the financial security of all others;\n5. Disregarded the importance of environmental and ecological issues that will result in poorer qualities of life for future generations  of Americans;\n6. Neglected the needs of America's homeless, poor, aged, sick, disabled and other disadvantaged people;\n7. Favored the rich and powerful individuals, lobbyists, special interest groups and mammoth corporations - all of whom can make generous (if not illegal) contributions to help keep the G.O.P. in power;\n8. Tortured prisoners, totally disregarding the Geneva Convention;\n9. Turned America into a police state where citizens are assumed to be guilty until proven innocent;\n10. Threatened the world to a point that smaller countries feel they have no recourse except to build nuclear weapons with which to defend themselves against the Earth's new ""evil empire"", the United States of America.\n\nCheck out a new blog - BUSHWACKER!\nwww.blogger.com\nhttp://al-aback.blogspot.com\n\nBush, Cheney and Rumsfeld need to beimpeached or tried for high treason.

Not everybody praises people while they are running but there is so much hype with campaign promises and coventions that people just go a little crazy. \n\nBut yes there are always going to be critics and it is just human nature. No matter what a president/government does to help one group it will hurt another. So yeah America doesn't really have a trust issue but it does have a lot of pissed off people...they are angry..

Wow, I haven't seen that done in years, typically a M-1 (Vocational student or other nonacademic student) can adjust status within the United States with PRIOR approval of the BCIS. You would need to apply first for an adjustment of status and providing that there are no grounds for the adjustment being decline it should be approved and you will recieve your I-20 and new I-94.

All they are criminal Traitor and All mexicans lover \nvote this candidate Dick Mountjoy.\nhttp://www.betterimmigration.com/candidates/2006/ca.html\n\nQuietly but systematically, the Bush Administration is advancing the plan to build a huge NAFTA Super Highway, four football-fields-wide, through the heart of the U.S. along Interstate 35, from the Mexican border at Laredo, Tex., to the Canadian border north of Duluth, Minn. \n\n\nOnce complete, the new road will allow containers from the Far East to enter the United States through the Mexican port of Lazaro Cardenas, bypassing the Longshoreman’s Union in the process. The Mexican trucks, without the involvement of the Teamsters Union, will drive on what will be the nation’s most modern highway straight into the heart of America. The Mexican trucks will cross border in FAST lanes, checked only electronically by the new “SENTRI” system. The first customs stop will be a Mexican customs office in Kansas City, their new Smart Port complex, a facility being built for Mexico at a cost of $3 million to the U.S. taxpayers in Kansas City. \n\nAs incredible as this plan may seem to some readers, the first Trans-Texas Corridor segment of the NAFTA Super Highway is ready to begin construction next year. Various U.S. government agencies, dozens of state agencies, and scores of private NGOs (non-governmental organizations) have been working behind the scenes to create the NAFTA Super Highway, despite the lack of comment on the plan by President Bush. The American public is largely asleep to this key piece of the coming “North American Union” that government planners in the new trilateral region of United States, Canada and Mexico are about to drive into reality. \n\nhttp://libertypost.org/cgi-bin/readart.cgi?ArtNum=145907\n\nAll they are must be Insane ,we pay mexico superhightway with US taxpayer so wahta baout security ?Drug, smugler peoples..and Mexican drunk driver get VIP road

Being entitled to COBRA is based upon federal law that all employees for whatever reason having left a company where they had health insurance may opt to continue that coverage throught the employed by paying the monthly cost to the employer.\n\nReceiving COBRA is no indication that you didn't commit wilfull misconduct for unemployment purposes. \n\nWhat is the employer alleging? Have you applied and been denied? You have a right to appeal.\n\nAlways file for unemployment whether you were fired or quit and explain the situation and always appeal it if you were denied. Receiving severance pay may help your claim.\n\nGood luck...
No, it just doesn't work in some cultures. Look at the former USSR... the Communist Party is coming back stronger than ever and it's because Democracy in Russia has put so many people into the streets and the Russian mobsters have taken over just about everything over there including many top positions in Government. Many Russians have been protesting to have the Communist's put back into power. For the last year or so, Russians have had to do something they have not had to do before...They now have to pay their own utility bills. Now they have to pay for water, gas and electricity. \n\nI feel that Socialism and Democracy can work well together if implemented correctly. You can have a Socialist Government and still have Freedom. \n\nThat form of Government should be put into practice here in the USA. I don't know about you but I am tired of having 5% of the people here in the USA controling 95% of the wealth!\n\nPower should never be allowed to be in the hands of one person!\n\nMany Americans don't see it yet but in the last decade, we have been losing some of our freedoms! (Think about it).\n\nWomen should be treated as equals all over the world. I believe that day will come.\n\nBy the way, the Iran/Iraq War lasted from 1980 - 1988.
The most important part of a question is that it be understood, not that it be answered. \n\nTax itentification numbers are issued by the federal government, so contact the IRS.

Welcome to the new world order.\n\nWe (the People) have tried just about everything else we can think of to stop the horrendous acts of this administration. It's a shame that it has come to the suicides of those suffering the most as a next step.\n\nRight or wrong doesn't factor into anything this fascist tyrant we call a president does. If his abusses of power and people stopped there at Guantanamo it would be much easier to focus our attention on his disdain for the laws of man, but Guantanamo is just a drop in the bucket.\n\nAnd shame needs to be heaped on the Supreme court and the congress for letting this tyrant get away with the many abusses he has and is still perpetrating.\n\nI for one am ashamed of our government and how it has ignored all sense of the laws of man and become the enemy that it used to fight against when we were honorable.
No, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were well within range. \n\nSo also were Tokyo, Kobe, Nagoya, and Osaka -- the targets of firebombing campaigns.\n\nThe destruction of Tokyo was much worse than Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Over 16 square miles utterly destroyed.\n\nThis was war on a scale beyond any the world could have previously imagined.  World War Two spread across the continents of the world, save North America and Antarctica.  Over fifty-six million people died worldwide.\n\nYour inane talk of bombing Hiroshima as a revenge for Pearl Harbor speaks volumes of your ignorance and dishonors the memories of all those fifty-six million men, women and children, soldier and civilian, who died in the greatest, most terrible war of all time, and the countless millions more who left the best parts of their lives on the battlefields of Europe and Asia.\n\nYou sure as Hell don't know sh*t about history.\n\nRead a simple table of world casualties.  I think you can do that.  Then stop and think.  Just try to think. Fifty-six million dead, more than twice as many wounded. Read some reports from European battles. Read about the Holocaust. Try to really wrap your head around how more than eleven million innocent souls were murdered by the Nazi butchers.  Read about the Baatan Death March. Read about The Blitz -- the 57 days and nights of German bombs raining down on London. Read about the Allied firebombing of Dresden which killed more people than all those who perished in Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.  Read after action reports of US Army forces who fought so hard in the bitter cold of The Ardenne to hold back the German bulge.  Then, when it begins to sink in, when you begin to get a handle on what you so ignorantly disregarded, then maybe you'll want to come back and apologize to the Greatest Generation, who gave so much and without whose sacrifices you and I would very likely not be holding this discourse.\n\nWW2 Casualties, Axis and Ally, Military and Civilian:\nhttp://www.warchronicle.com/numbers/WWII/deaths.htm\n\nBaatan Death March:\nhttp://history.acusd.edu/gen/st/~ehimchak/death_march.html\n\nHolocaust Death Toll:\nhttp://www.holocaust-history.org/questions/numbers.shtml\n\nThe Blitz:\nhttp://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/blitz.htm\n\nDresden Firebombing:\nhttp://www.rense.com/general19/flame.htm\n\nAfter Action Reports, 134th Infantry, 3rd Army, Ardennes, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxemburg: (Note, these are in PDF):\nhttp://www.coulthart.com/134/aa-report-index.htm\n\nAND LAST BUT NOT LEAST-- to see it through the eyes of a soldier, I highly recommend the following.\n\nReflections of a Combat Infantryman -- A Soldier's Story of C.

Take the time to learn what you're talking about.  You owe it to yourselves, you owe it to your families, friends and countrymen, and most of all you owe it to those who went before you and gave so much so you can be here now preparing the way for those who will come after you.

A lot of the conspiracy theorists say that Pres. Bush wants a United States of North America, with no borders from Guatemala to the north pole. NAFTA has already given us that.  The NAFTA corridor runs from Laredo, Texas straight up Interstate 35 to north of Duluth, Minnesota. It's a real bad idea to give up the sovereignty of the United States of America to have some EU-type entity. If they want to see a lot of pissed off people, just let them try it.\n\nWell, I saw your addendum and checked out the SPP. Now I am definitely pissed off.

"Bush. At a time when we're supposed to be united, more and more people are becoming divided because of his choices and losing faith in him...and when you lose your faith in your country and those who are supposed to be taking care of us and leading us, it's making us lose sight about what America is REALLY supposed to be about and the ethics is was built upon. Bush isn't someone I would look up to or follow anywhere, and I wouldn't trust him with my life or my family's life..literally. That says a lot. I'm not saying he's a bad person, just a bad president. As for Clinton, he's a saint compared to Bush, I mean, at least nobody died during his cigar incident with Monica...I'm really not interested in ANY president's sexual behaviors, and if that's the WORST thing that Clinton did in the White House, it's better than anything Bush has put this country through in the past couple years. What seemed like such a big deal with Clinton's ""incident"" back then seems so petty now.\nJust because we're American's doesn't mean we have to agree with the way our leaders handle things, and that doesn't make us ""pathetic"". I think those who agree with the war so much should enlist themselves and head into Iraq because I know about 20 other people who would LOVE you to take their place so they could come home...including my fiance and a lot of other people he's enlisted with who think ending this is WAY more than overdue. Not just the people here are losing faith but so many men and woman in the war. I trust the military overseas and their judgement in all of this more than anyone because they are there, seeing it all first hand, and when they say it's time to come home and this is not something they believe in anymore, that's go to tell you something. But like I said, if you do believe in it, there's a lot of people who would love for you to take their place."

"The 2nd Amendment, along with the other Amendments from the Bill of Rights, were designed to overthrow the federal government if it became too oppressive. Look at the entire Bill of Rights...almost all of the Amendments would be ESSENTIAL to overthrow a Government.\n\nThe individuals responsible for the Bill of Rights were opposed to a federal government. They insisted that the Bill of Rights be attached before they would ratify the Constitution. They are usually referred to today as the ""Anti-Federalists"", and those who were for the federal government were known as the ""Federalists"". \n\nYou can find some of the writings of the Anti-Federalists online, and there are some books printed that have their collective writings in them. Read them and you'll understand their thoughts, fears, and reasonings behind the Bill of Rights. \n\nMost people today, including the ACLU, are IGNORANT about the Bill of Rights. They were not designed to be ""personal"" rights (so to speak), but designed to overthrow the government...long may they stand."
"Here;s an interesting point that no one has brought up yet involving this debate. It's called the 10th Amendment to the Constitution. Massachusetts has legalized gay marriage. For the government to write a law making gay marriage illegal, it would require an ammendment to the Constitution, because simply writing a law would violate the 10th amendment, states rights.\n\nI find it a bit hypocritical that, a year and a half ago, this man put his hand on the Holy Bible and swore to ""protect and defend the Constitution of the United States"", and now he's trying to re-write it.\n\nThe point is: Massachusetts, by taking the lead, made it an issue for individual states to decide, not the federal government."
"Here is the deal.  When a soldier is single and below a certain rank which varies depending on barracks availability they must maintain a barracks room.  This means that they will not be receiving a housing allowance but, if they are willing to pay out of their own money or have a friend that they can stay with, they can actually live off post.  If a soldier is married (as I am assuming your HUSBAND is) then he can request on-post housing or he can take the housing allowance and live off post.  Sometimes on-post housing has a waiting list so availability will different depending on what post you are looking at.  Technically the answer to your question is ""no"" because on post-housing for families are not referred to as barracks.  There are housing offices on each post that will have people who can answer your questions about the specific post you are going to.  He should be able to get their contact info when he in-processes or, if he is just new to be being married (rather than new to the post),  he can go to the welcome center and ask.  Good luck."

well, you have acccess to the internet-- look it up!

It means that the charges have a final action applied to them. Disposition comes from the same root word. It means that an outcome has been reached.
Check with labor laws in your state - they vary.  Generally speaking, if it is not the choice of the company to close down (as in this case with the government making the declaration), then the company would not be responsible for payment to workers.
No - there will be no war.  They play Cricket in South Africa - that means they are civilized!!

i'm sorry to tell you this, but i believe you are in for a hard ride.\n:(\nin St. Louis, it's likely the only jobs you are going to find are going to be low paying labor jobs, without benefits.\n\nthat is to say, you might be really lucky and find an employer who either knows you and wants to give you a chance or find a kindly soul who believes you just made a past mistake. \n\nbut the chances are slim.\n\nas someone who lives VERY near st. louis, MO, i know how scarce decent paying jobs are for anyone, and if you have things like a conviction on your record, your not going to be a very appealing choice.\n\nmy prayers are with you, stick with it and you might find a good one!
I agree with you. I have said it before in this forum. i think they are traitor and cowards. Running from your problems is no way to live. And then to come here and protest in our streets, waiving a Mexican flag is not tolerable. We have the right and duty to protect our country. Unfortunately, we live in a time when we can not be careful enough. The illegals must be returned to their home countries. maybe a guest worker program for those that actually want to work here, after they leave and apply to come back in, but we have to screen out the criminal element. There are far too many criminals for us to house. They should be turned over to Fox, and let him deal with them. And no amnesty, period.\nI also think that the idea of sending the governers emails etc. is workable. I email my state reps every week, just to let them know where i stand. Only one has even sent me a standard reply email. The other has lost all. Everyone should be email their reps, wether you are pro or anti Illegals. Its is your civic responsibility to do so. Be American!!!!
In most cases,where purses are taken , they want what is easy to take....cash. They then throw your purse in the ditch or dumpster to get it out of their possession. Since you had a cell phone it may have been used, need to have service cut off. As for you personal items you should contact each one and advise of theft. You should live a little wiser due to the fact you are worried about someone coming to your home, although it doesn't usually happen. Check with your homeowners insurance, theft is sometimes covered. Unless someone knows the suspect by his video picture,I doubt he will be caught.
You got it!  The IRS comes after YOU and not the illegal.  Besides, their SSNs are someone else's.
Damn right !!!!
First off, no, the comment is inane and offensive.\n\nSecond, to dispute other posts - asymmetrical warfare is what we face when we fight suicide bombers. They blow up a bomb and kill 50 people, we can't retaliate by killing 50 of the Jihadists, because we don't know who or where they are. We have to try to track them down one by one. This creates the asymmetry.
"Possibly he is a misspelling of the hero of Ayn Rand's novel, ""Atlas Shrugged"", John Galt. Alternatively, you may be referring to the hero in a parody of Rand's novel. See also: \nhttp://www.reason.com/hitandrun/2004/11/ayn_rand_and_th.shtml"
"I think the poor woman should have been allowed to die with dignity a long time ago.  I'm quite sure that she would not have liked all the drama attached to her situation as well as those ""home movies"" that were all over the news.  It was horrible to see someone made to stay alive like that when she was really not ""living"" at all.  If you polled a thousand people I don't think even one would say that they would have preferred to have their life prolonged when there was absolutely nothing to look forward to.  I feel horrible for her husband as well as her parents, but I'm happy for her that now she's in a better more peaceful place."
The bad always draws more attention, sells more papers, gets a bigger audience.\n\nI for one would really like to see the good news.  What is being done for the Iraqis that we can be proud of, really helped them, made their life better.\n\nI really become tired of constantly hearing how they hate us and wish we had never gotten rid of Saddam.  Just give us some indication that we are not sacrificing our troops for nothing and all this means something good to the Iraqis.  \n\nVietnam Vet - looking for some hope.
That is so funny.  I didn't hear the speech.  However, from what you say he is saying:\n\nWe will put Mexicans first!\nWe will put foreigners second!\nWe will make foreigners pay for Mexicans!\n\nVery consistent, and more than that, understandable from his point of view.  If we let them get away with it why shouldn't they want to do that?  It benefits them at our expense.\n\nIt is OUR government I can't understand.
people either dont know or pretend to forget, they think they are better and that America is their land, we have been here so long that we have become ignorant and selfcentered, people need to be reminded of where we came from
CALL LOCAL IMMIGRATION LET THEM TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM
Unfortunately in this day and age of greedy pig headed businesses, they think they can overtake anyone no matter who they are, or what they do. It's a complete disgrace, the total lack of human compassion.
They have pretty-much fully cooperated with US efforts. There have been moments that the US's sometimes clumsy actions have tested this alliance, though, such as when those civilians were accidentally bombed by that remote-controlled bomber airplane. I really wish the US would take better care of the nations that cooperate with it. These days friendships have been hard to come by. I used to be critical of Pakistan but they've been very friendly to our cause lately.

Of course not; how would the police ever catch anyone if they knew they had a warrant?
NO. It would be porn. (The 30 virgin sheep and all)
I think it is when it is executed correctly.  Today a lot of people are ignorant about the law and their rights so they usually get screwed with out knowing it.  My favorite example is watching cops,  any episode, half of the stuff the cops do is a violation of the 4th but people don't know it so they go along with whatever the cop says.  Every time the cop is questioning the person about the crime with out the suspect waiving his right to legal counsel is a violation and if you watch the show that is all they do.  i like to rant.
This phrase has been poll tested.\n\nIn fact the funniest thing about it is it had to be kept three words and under.\n\nAs you may remember before the war\n\n White House chief of staff Andrew Card or Rove told The New York Times  ``From a marketing point of view, you don't introduce new products in August.''\n\nThese are buisness people, they are marketing to the less intellectualy disearning. In my opinion only i have always believed that corpratist want a less educated popultaion because they make better consumers.\n\nThe war is a prouduct they must sell. \n\nIf they repeat the slogan long enough the need for real issue debate ends. \n\nThe debate is simple...logically we must pull our troops out one day....in the future....it has to happen. \notherwise the debate the Republican Party is running is simple.\n\nNever leave Iraq [r] vs. We have to leave sometime [d].
My own child because that child is my flesh and blood and I love both of my boys with all my heart.  My boys are my life and I would give up my life for theirs anyday.\n\nAnd I agree to what you said.  We really need to take care of our own before we let any more in.
Because there are none.
"Well, usaf security forces is 3P0x1 now. What would you like to know? We are more involved in combat operations now than ever before. Convoy security from Iraqi airports to the outlying areas. Lots of IEDS and ""spray and pray fire""."

I wish the UN was a joke, on the 4th of July the UN will begin discussion on how to disarm the public (small arms control) The UN already owns vast tracts of the United States via World Heritage cites. UN peace Keepers will be called in domestically in the US while our troops are busy occupying resource rich nations around the world in the event that the governments orchestrates another major terror attack upon US soil.\n\nThats why I am a firm believe of you can have my gun, after you pry it from my cold dead hands.
Seriously doubt it.\nCertainly hope not.
I guess we are too stupid.  I don't get your point.
"Using Australia:\n\nUnder s51 of the Australian Constitution, the Federal Parliament is give a list of powers in which they can pass law or amend laws over, known as exclusive. Other powers not listed there belong solely to the states, and are known as residual powers (s52). Sometimes, there are powers which overlap, and they are shared (Concurrent Powers), with Federal law prevailing over state when a conflict occurs between the two laws (s109). \n\nThe powers which Federal has are those which deals with money, external affairs, and other subjects which the whole of Australia is affected. The State powers are those ""closer to home,"" such as health or education, which can differ from state to state. \n\nOtherwise, both Parliaments exercise the same power (or close to), with both Parlt having two houses (Queensland Parliament has only one house) and can pass law anytime Parliament is sitting."

Iraq has no effective police force or army yet, and it is full of foreign insurgents, and a mix of ethnic groupings.\n\nIn actual fact Iraq didnt exist as a country until it was artificially formed by international treaty, led by the British and French in the 1930's. \n\nIts is actually made up of several very diverse and naturally hositle ethinc groupings such as the kurds, marsh arabs and mespotamians.\n\nTherefore the likelyhood is that the country would collapse into either civil or external war, or potentially a mixture of both.\n\nThe Kurds in the north would establish their own state as they have wanted since the beginning of the last century. The ramifications of that would be that not only a third of Iraq would disapear but there would also be border clashes with both Turkey and Iran, as what the Kurds belive to be their homeland straddles all three countries.\n\nThe Shi'ite Muslim Marsh Arabs in the south would want to split either into independance, or more likley join onto their neighbour and spiritual brother Iran.\n\nThis would leave a realtively narrow corridor across the middle where the population is predominantly Sunni Muslim in religion and Baathist politically as Iraq. This would have no economy as both oil regions are in either the Kurdish or Shi'ite controlled areas, therefore nothing to sustain an economy.  \n\nThis would end up as a third world drain on resources or more likely get overtaken and subsumed into one of its neighbours.
We must remember that this is not a communist planned economy, just because there are natural resources does not mean we can have them. The oil is only OURS so long as it remains in the ground. Once we the people have subsidized its extraction, it belongs to a multi-national corporation who may do whatever they wish with it.\n\nThe decision of which wells to extract oil from depends on how much money per barrel it costs to get the product, which will determine what the profit per barrel is, which determines if it is WORTH the corporation's time and effort to get it out of the ground. If it costs the corporation $20 per barrel to get oil from Texas and it costs $17 per barrel to get oil from Saudi Arabia, then that is what they will do.\n\nThe products made in factories are not OURS. The corporations own the means of production because they have the financial resources to operate them, and as such they can decide where they will spend their money. If we the people do not care where our products are manufactured, or what is done to the people who make them (and we do NOT care, we just want to save a few pennies because we are blindly greedy and are easy to manipulate!), then the corporations will obviously produce the items in an area where the costs are the lowest. I the corporation can save 80% on the costs of manufacture by enslaving people in China or Indonesia and give us a savings of 2%, we are THRILLED. After all, at its greatest extent only about 30% of the American population was working in manufacturing, so even if all of them were replaced with slaves that meant 70% of us were not badly affected by our neighbors being thrown out of work.
they're going to make us and our children and their children pay for it(taxes)
"Americans who complain that illegal aliens are ""taking"" our jobs are LAZY.  If you and an illegal alien applied for the same job, and the alien got it, he didn't take your job - you were underqualified, you lazy moron.  Homeless people don't take the jobs sometimes because they're too lazy, sometimes because they just can't because of their past, sometimes because they're too addicted to drugs or alcohol.  Lots of reasons."
"United States of America\nThe martial law concept in the U.S. is closely tied with the Writ of habeas corpus, which is in essence the right to a hearing on lawful imprisonment, or more broadly, the supervision of law enforcement by the judiciary. The ability to suspend habeas corpus is often equated with martial law. Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution states, ""The privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.""\n\nIn United States law, martial law is limited by several court decisions that were handed down between the American Civil War and World War II. In Ex Parte Milligan 71 US 2 1866, the Supreme Court of the United States held that martial law could not be instituted within the United States when its civilian courts are in operation. In 1878, Congress passed the Posse Comitatus Act, which forbids military involvement in domestic law enforcement without congressional approval. The National Guard is an exception, since unless federalized, they are under the control of state governors. [5]"

If it was a turn only lane and the green arrow was on, a friendly tap of the horn may have been okay, if he had been sitting there awhile.  But if it was one of those lanes where you can turn or go straight, and he didn't move cause he was going straight, then thats a different story.  And yes you can be cited for honking your horn within the city limits if you don't have a good reason to honk..I forget what it is called but it is a citeable offense.
"That depends on how you look at it and whether or not you believe it was over slavery.\n\nIf it was over slavery, which is the opinion of some, then the south started it because they did not want to give up there ""Right"" to own slaves.\n\nHowever, there is another opinion that may ring more true.  That is that the war actually started over the North wanting the south to give up it's seperate nation attitude and join the Union.  When they refused the North's request the North decided to force it.  So if that's the case then it was the North."

"If you are speaking in regards to the United States, then you will get many different answers.  I see a left wing trying to push us to a socialist government.  I like the one we have.  I see people making hero's and millionaires out of complete morons who can do nothing but dress well, or maybe dribble a ball.  I see hollyweird with their agenda that ""Everything should be allowed"" attitude.  I see young girls having babies out of wedlock at an alarming rate and to them its no big deal.  The government will just take care of it.  I see kids getting fatter by the day, of course their brains are much lighter.  I see more gang activity,and not enough family interaction. I'm really very tired of the whiners.  Everybody wants something, everyone wants attention.  That is why I have been extremely thankful for the conservative movement in this country.  I certainly don't want to go as far right as some, but it draws us away, out of the dredges of the left wing dependent whiners."

"Well let's see:\n\nOil Shale:\nPositives- Can extract a large amount of petroleum products from a source that is largely untapped.\nNegatives: The process is time consuming and requires the use of fossil fuels.\n\nEthanol:\nPositives: Burns more cleanly and isn't derived from a nonrenewable source.\nNegatives: There is not enough plant matter out there to satisfy all energy needs.\n\nCoal:\nPositives: With new clean coal technology, coal can satisfy much of the energy needs while polluting less.\nNegatives: Still dirty, still nonrenewable, and still dangerous to mine.\n\nNuclear:\nPositives: ""Clean"" since it does not technically produce ozone-depleting gases; fuel has the potential to provide nearly unlimited energy.\nNegatives: Nuclear waste is an environmental and political nightmare; most nuclear plants are not highly profitable given the cost of fuel, maintenance, safety and other considerations.\n\nSolar:\nPositives: Very clean, renewable and unlimited.\nNegatives: Equipment expense makes it cost-proibitive- for now. Solar plants generally do not generate sufficient power for large metropolitan areas.\n\nWind:\nPositives: Very clean and renewable.\nNegatives: Equipment, as with solar power, is expensive.\n\nHydroelectric:\nPositives: Clean and renewable. Can generate significant amount of power.\nNegatives: There aren't enough huge rivers, like the Colorado, Amazon, and Nile, to power a hydroelectric plant of large scale everywhere. Very costly.\n\nHydrogen fuel cells:\nPositives: Efficient and very clean- end product is water- and renewable. Has portability.\nNegatives: You must expend the same energy making the hydrogen (as from a hydrocarbon molecule) as you get out of it. Net: no energy gain. Usually fossil fuels are required to process hydrogen. Hydrogen is not readily available. Cost prohibitive for mass market as of now.\n\n\nTaken individually, neither one of these alternatives will replace our energy needs. One of the biggest problems which typical renewable energy sources have had (such as wind, solar, hydroelectric) is that they are not portable. That is, you can't simply strap on a huge solar panel to your car and start it up. While it is true that batteries can be recharged with energy from wind, solar, or hydroelectric, the conventional batteries we have today- the lead-acid types we see in cars- do not provide sufficient power (even if you add a bunch of them in series) for trips of long duration.\n\nHydrogen fuel cells solve the problem of portability and power: all you really need is a source of hydrogen. That hydrogen can be condensed so that there is a sufficient supply to last several hundred miles (researchers are working on improving this). But hydrogen itself is not readily available. In fact, we have very little of it on earth because it all tends to float up into outer space.(it being the lightest gas).\n\nOne way to solve this is to take a hydrocarbon molecule- such as methane- and remove the hydrogen. But removing the hydrogen requires energy. So even though hydrogen and oxygen combine in a fuel cell to yield energy, that energy is about the same as that required to displace the hydrogen from a hydrocarbon. So why would anyone want to have fuel cells if the net energy gain is zero?\n\nWell, because of that portability issue again. Say we have a solar, wind, hydroelectric, or even nuclear plant that produces electricity. While that electricity is not portable, we can use it to power up a hydrogen-generating power plant. We, in effect, transfer the energy from a renewable source into hydrogen, which we can then use at hydrogen ""gas"" stations. \n\nSome environmentalists claim that because hydrogen necessitates a hydrocarbon source, we're still using the nonrenewable hydrocarbons we were using with petrol. They further claim that this makes the whole process non-clean. These claims are valid only in the sense that today we are, indeed, using nonrenewable fuel "

If your friend has secured a rental lease agreement via fraudulent means, the complex management should take immediate steps to evict him, and there will be no problem for them to obtain an eviction order, regardless if he up to date with rental payments.\n\nI suspect that if there is no legal leaseholder name on the lease, who can personally oppose any action, such as power withholding, the management has no obligation to provide eletrical services.\n\nYour friend may be well advised to pay any outstanding amount owed to the apartment management by him and seek shelter elsewhere under his own identity.

You can defenitly adjust you status through her. Even if she only is a greencard holder which means she is a permanent resident. If she had a citizenship you can get your greencard wrthin 1 year of filing a adjustment of status form. I don't know how long the wait is if she is only a resident but i suppose it is longer. But while you wait for your Greencard you are given a worker's permit so you can legally work. With that you can get a driver's license. go to the link below for more info!!!

"You heard alot about it, because ""they"" are preparing you for it.  Who are they?  Well, the real leaders are the ones we don't see.  It won't be a good thing when this happens.  But it will happen.  They have been preparing us for it, and testing it out for a while now.  It is a power hunger thing, not a "" I care about the world thing"".  How can we have peace in a world that doesn't agree.  Simply answer, kill the ones who don't believe what you believe :)\n  Sounds crazy.  \n\nWatch out for ""CHIPS IMPLANTED INTO HUMANS"", so they can track you down easier, and identify you easier.  They can tract you down now, but if you don't use a cell phone or a credit card or a store card.  It is not easy.  Luckily for them, most of us do.  Cash is starting to be rare now adays.  But that was part of the whole plan.  Watch out for "" THE ONE CARD TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING"", it will sound like the easiest thing for you and me.  Because thats how they will promote it, with a positive outlook.  For your benefit of chorse.  \n\nWatch out:  When the Nuclear bomb drops, (and it will drop).  It will be to bring down the population to a more controlled level.  How can one take over the world if you have to many people on it.  It only makes sense.  The wars, they keep having, is so slow.  The dieases they throw out their, takes too long, the world of ""unhealthy eating, living habits"" are starting to take a turn.  People start to educate themselves.  This is a problem for them.\n\nWell, don't be a fool.  But some will unfortunately, that is what they want.  By the way, did you know that Hilter used FLORIDE on the Jews as a mind control.  Funny, how ""they put it in are water and they say its for our teeth"", so we drink floride, when it is not natural for our bodies for the reason of are teeths.  I thought their was floride in toothpaste.  I guess, they want to make if your kids don't sollow enough during brushing their teeth, they will get them another way.  If a tube of tooth paste will kill a 2 year old.  What will a small amount do?  Well, its not like they don't put the warning on the back of it.\n\nIn the end, the bible prophesys about a one world government, A False Jesus with many miracles before the real Jesus Comes Back.    So watch out.  It is the Last Days.  Only Jesus can save you.  I recommend you research for yourself, ""New World Order"", research what the bible has to say about it, and also the way the real Jesus will come back, so you are not confused when the fake one appears."

Marijuana actually has many helpful benefits toward diseases / sicknesses. Marijuana can reduce nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite caused by AIDS. It can Reduce interlobular pressure, which alleviates the pain and slowing and sometimes even stopping the progress of glaucoma. Common side effects of chemotherapy are nausea, loss of appetite, and vomiting, all of which marijuana would help. It can limit muscle pain and relieve tremor nad unsteadiness of gait for multiple sclerosis patients. Marijuana can help prevent epileptic seizures in some patients. It can also alleviate chronic, often debilitating pain caused by myriad disorders and injuries. Each one of these applications have been deemed legitimate by at least one United States court, legislature, and/or government agency.

Because the democratic system of New Zealand has not given the people an opportunity to vote on the issue yet. If it did, then it is altogether possible that our flag would be changed.\n\nAnother major issue is that many feel that taking the union jack off our flag would somehow affect our relationship with Britian, who colonised us, and in whos commenwealth sovereignty we are still a part of. \nWe could look to Canada though, as a good example of a commenwelath country that has changed their flag and achieved a whole new identity.\n\nThe site referenced below is not a source of mine, however you could take a look at some advocation for a new flag there.

You hear about bombing in Israel and Palestine almost weekly...that doesn't sound like they're tackling the problem to me. Terrorism is an idea and an action. It's hard to get rid of those two things...it's easier if it wes one specific person or group.
Hey, I am a Police Officer and have been for the last 19 years.\n\nPast drug usage will not stop you from becoming a Police Officer.  As long as you disclose your usage when asked, you will be fine.  If you have any in your past, they will find out during the background check.  So, just be honest.  If you have any further questions, e-mail me and I will help if I can.  \n\nGood luck.
Uganda became an independent nation in 1962, with Edward Mutesa II, the kabaka (king) of Buganda as the ceremonial president, and Milton Obote as executive Prime Minister. By 1966, Obote had overthrown the constitution and declared himself president, ushering in an era of coups and counter-coups which would last until the mid-1980s. 1971 saw Idi Amin take power, ruling the country with the military for the coming decade

"You are right, totally... It is an absolute disregard for the environment.\n\nThe Bush administration in 2003 effectively gutted the ‘no net loss’ of wetlands policy initiated during the administration of the elder Bush.  Wetlands help reduce the power of hurricanes and storm surges.  Wetlands were largely missing when Katrina struck, and contributed to the devastating effects of that so-called antural disaster...\n\nLets see - destroy the wetlands, don't fix the levees, duh... that is almost as obvious as - ""I think the memo said something like Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S""  \n\nWe need to change - \n\nWe must transform human social relations so that production (and the technology accompanying it) develops in a planned manner that takes into account human need and, by extension, the care of the natural environment upon which human needs depend.\n\nciao"

We invaded Iraq because Bush thought that Saddam was hiding the WMDs from the inspectors even though the UN and the Dolfer report (US sent own people) said that they didn't find any. Bush didn't believe the reports and went in. Simple as that.\nI see that a lot of people talk about pre-Iraq invasion and oil. I'll answer some of that. First, Saddam's rule was a dictatorship that oversaw massive killings, rape, torture, kidnaps, etc. (Did you know more Iraqis died under Saddam's reign than in the Iraq War?). Given that, I'm extremely happy that he's not in power anymore. And the reason I just mentioned was one reason for entering Iraq (which I believe). The current situation is that Iraq is a mess, and since we blew up their country, we need to stay to fix it (we broke their leg, we need to be their crutch until they heal). \nThe liberation of Iraq, to me, is a good reason for entering. Now the next thing you'll hear about is oil. Oil is not the reason why we entered because there is absolutely NO PROOF that we did. So that's out of the picture. In the beginning of the war, the American public was told that Iraq had WMDs (none found), Saddam would attack us (highly unlikely), and that Al-Qaeda and Hussein had connections (false). Those were the 3 main reasons that are PROVEN. The 4th reason, the liberation of Iraq, was given later in the war.\nAccording to the Washington Post (20 minutes ago), 500 weapons(nerve agents, sarin gas) were found in Iraq since 2003. The document containing this information was just declassified.

I already sent letters, I hope others do the same. We need strong controls on the borders in order to keep the demographics from going nutz. There's no way in HELL our economy's going to create jobs at the rate of expansion the Senate's advocating, so our representatives need to step and in one voice call 'BULLSHI%' on the whole mess, and spin up the Border Patrol to the level of effectiveness required to get the flippin' job done. Mexico needs reforms, and the only way they'll happen at this point is if they have a really POWERFUL, boot-like incentive for doing so. \n\nConflicts of interest in public office are part of the very history and fabric of the american political story. Another part of that fabric(the big patch that looks like it got put over a bunch of little holes and stuff) is where the voters have taken these guys to task by calling them out on their ethics.and dismissing/recalling those that have a demonstrated conflict of interest that is preventing them from doing their jobs effectively. \n\nIllegal immigration's a toughie, not a simple issue, and not solved by a signature on a piece of paper. You also have to get to the root cause of illegal immigration, which is partly our own businesses growing too enamored with high incomes, and partly abject poverty overseas in countries that've been on the american aid teat for too many decades without really standing up and tending to their own problems. There's no army in the world that can fight the consequences of that, so policy reforms are really important. If our own representatives can't see the light on that one, someone needs to give em new batteries for the flashlight, and the calculator, too. Failing that, a new job at Wendy's or something, where their first new task will be to learn SPANISH. Like the customers have to...
Because they dont have water filters to purify thier water. All thier waste gets dumped into local rivers, streams, or lakes, and without a pump or purification system they are forced to drink the water to survive even though the water is so contaminated with parasites, fungus, and hundreds of diseases. The contaminated water, in most 3rd world countries, also makes it almost impossible to find any food or animals around the water sources. So even if the people didnt drink the water, they would still be influenced due to the food and animals they eat.

Neoconservatism is the name for a new branch of conservative politics that supports extensive U.S. involvement in foreign affairs (as opposed to traditional conservatives such as Pat Buchanan who oppose foreign entanglements), its origins are largely based in the think tank Project for a New American Century (PNAC), whose founding members include Dick Cheney, Jeb Bush, Steve Forbes, Dan Quayle and Donald Rumsfeld. \n\nMost significantly, they have argued that America needs to control the flow of oil in the Middle East in order to check the growth of China as an economic power, and have advocated for the removal from power of Saddam Hussein since the mid-90s.
Present yourself in court. Depending on the circumstances(criminal history and facts presented)  the state attorney's office may pursue a lesser charge such as simple assault.

(It must pass by two-thirds of the members present in both houses.)     \n\nA bill can be re-introduced, at another time.

Vote. It is four letters. Vote. People can find time to eat, work, take a bath, date, go to the movies, go here, go there, go everywhere. FIND TIME to vote. What if I do not know how? Easy. Go to your local courthouse. Bring your identification. Tell them you want a voter's card. Get it in the mail. Look for the local elections. Find where the people in your neighborhood vote. Then vote. Vote. It is what we do in a DEMOCRACY. Vote.
It's a question of whether the person has the ability to understand what they are consenting to.  Society has decided generally to protect people that otherwise cannot protect themselves.  Young children and people who are mentally incapacitated for example.  Each state has drawn a line in the sand to say that as a matter of law, a person under age X is too young to understand what they are consenting to.  It is an obviously imperfect system, since people mature at different rates, but for manageability sake the states have drawn a line.
There are plenty of ways for men to be stylish, but it sounds to me like what you are really asking is why doesn't society approve of men adopting women's styles when women have adopted many men's styles.  I don't know the answer to that.  We readily accept a women in pants, but we ridicule a man in a dress.  We encourage young girls to push the boundaries and not be defined by traditional female roles, yet we offer no similar encouragement to young boys.  Perhaps it is because women have long been regarded as second class citizens (even though they are not) and many see women adopting men's styles and roles as some sort of perverse evolution.  The same people would probably view a man wanting to adopt more feminine styles and roles as some sort of backslider.  I don't know if this helps or it was the answer you were looking for, but I don't expect the situation is going to change anytime soon.  You'll either have to learn to live with it or flaunt convention.  Good Luck to you!!

That is so stupid. How can they let you have religious groups but not God bless you or let you pray or anything like that? I can't believe schools would do that to us. I would seriously like to give them what for. That is just so agravating I just can't stand it at all.
Interesting question.  Could be a floor plain.  If it is, you would need a permit, if it is your shoreline.  You would be best suited by contacting the county clerks office or another county or city office in your area
"I had this same problem.  Look if you want to know the answer you got, you need to play the game.  The game will be to act or if you really want, be interesting in joining the military.  You didnt take the ASVAB because you were not somewhat interested correct?  \n\nGo to the recruiters office of your choice and ask them.  They will have all the answers, and if not they will know where to find the answers.  Be prepared before you go. \n\nTHe recruiter has a job to do and that is to get you to join the military.  If you tell them you are not interested in joining, but only to know your score they will hit you up with lots of questions and what not.  If you tell them you are somewhat interested then they will give you the information you want.  \n\nJust a heads up, I wouldnt join any branch unless you score over 50, this will guarantee you that you can possibly get a job that you want.  Those who score less are at the mercy of the recruiter when it comes to lookign for jobs.  Imagine from ""Full Metal Jacket""  Private Pile probably scored a 25 or 30, that is why they said ""Pile 0-600 infantry, you made it!""  You dont want to be private Pile.  However dont let the recruiters mess with you, time is on your side and if you want to take the ASVAB 30 times, that is your right.  Just keep requesting to take it until you get the score you want.  Usually a 65-75 will guarantee you any job you want."

They do, for the most part, care what the people think, because the people are the ones that will keep them in office. However, when it comes to decision making votes, you must understand that we, the people, do not have all of the information on the issues that they do. \n\nAlot of the things that will influence their decisions are things that we are not allowed to know about because of security issues. That is why it is important that we elect people to office that we feel confident with. They need to be intelligent people who seem to think along the same lines that we do. After all, we are the ones that put them in office to begin with. \n\nAnd if you don't vote...don't complain! Frequently I have found that the people who complain about the government the most did not even vote in the last elections. We vote on everything, from the city level to the federal level. And those who do not express their opinions by their vote should have no reason to complain.
Carpet bombing has not been used in Iraq.  Generally it is a technique used in warfare where there are massed troops and that doesn’t meet needs in terrorists based wars.\n\nBunker bursting bombs are very different from carpet bombing.  They are part of the targeted bombing techniques and are used to get very specific sites or small groups of the enemy.  \n\nBoth carpet bombing and smart bombs are used to target military.\n\nNone of these bombing techniques are comparable to suicide bombing.  Suicide bombing is targeted at civilians and is used to terrorize a society. \n\nAll bombing has the common characteristic of killing and injuring those outside of the targeted area and group because that is the nature of bombing.  It is the intent of those doing the bombing which is important.  Do they intend to hit militants or do they target civilians.  Currently, it is the terrorists who intend to kill and harm civilians.

The Netherlands does not give citizenship based on place of birth, only by the nationality of the parents. If your mother was a dual Canadian and Dutch citizen, you would be a Dutch citizen automatically, but there are many ways you could lose it by staying out of the Kingdom for a long enough period of time. Regardless of all that, your mother's Canadian citizenship gives you Candian citizenship automatically. In either case, you do not need to apply for the additional citizenships, but provide proof of your claim citizenship when applying for something like a passport.

Privatization, when used with government, means taking a government run program and converting it to private industry.  In some countries, for example, the government owns and operates the railroads.  The government then sells the railroads to individuals or companies, who then own and operate the railroads.\nCommercialization, when used with government, means advertising something that the government once prohibited.  At one time, in the USA, lawyers were not allowed to advertise;  now they are.

I agree to some extent. But you can't have Eminem cussing his brains out on the radio with little kids listening. I listen to his music and love it, but I can buy the CD and listen to the cussing on my own with nobody else having to hear it if they don't want too.  I know, you could tell me, just turn the station if I don't want kids to hear it. But, we are not that naive to think that when parents are not around, that they will turn that station  on and hear a verbal assault of the f-WORD. My point is, that words like that do influence people. If music,movies, and video games had no influence on people, then why do companies spend billions of dollars in advertising?
Yes and then complain about them on Welfare in 15 years . How that for hypocrisy's ???
The truth is that whether you drop the charges or not, the prosecutor still makes the ultimate decision whether or not the state wants to press charges.  This may be totally out of your hands...particularly if he committed some of these offenses against others.

Excellent question.  From what I have seen, it's almost like Democrats are becoming Repulican and vice versa.\nI don't know why they just don't enforce the law as it stands.  I agree with what you say on the cheap labor issue also, which benefits the employers most.  It certainly is not cheap labor for the rest of us. I think what we need is a third party.  And I will vote for anyone who believes that illegal immigration is ruining this country.
No, this is false.  I suspect you may have heard that from a  Russian woman you met on the Internet.  It is common for the scammers to tell men that they must have cash to show the passport office, immigration official, travel agency, etc.  It is simply a way of getting money from you.
I think pot should be legal. That'd cut the legs off the illegal drug trade from Mexico as far, as marijuana is concerned, and let the DEA chase down the crack dealers. Crack is pure evil, so is meth. Even better yet would be pot-pops, where they do like with the nicotine candies they were working on before the FDA jumped up and down on em and put the active ingredient as a component in something else that won't kill you. \n\nThe moral of the story is that prohibition just creates more law enforcement jobs....

Marie,\nI WISH in the real world it were possible to have things the way you say.  But I think that even if people were all independent, that would not change how people feel about the two extreme worldviews of liberals/conservatives and this splits the parties more than anything.  The way that liberals in this country have gotten portrayed by conservatives (who support big business and are against most if not all social programs, except the ones for the war machine and business), is so distorted I don't even recognize them.  I've never in my 65 yrs. met a liberal like the misguided, simple-minded ones they discribe.  But I have met plenty of conservative, esp. Repubs (but Dems too) who are almost living stereotypes of a simple-minded, rigid anti-people (unless you're rich or aspiring ) conservatives.\n\nI think the way you're thinking is like being in a fantasy world.  It's a nice idea but people who are independents generally aren't in the fray.  I don't believe their voice is heard so they have little to no effect.  Females especially have been socialized to be peacemakers and I think more men should be and more women shouldn't be afraid to stand up and fight for things they care about.   Women's issues, peace, helping people who are disabled, poor, elderly instead of helping the rich get richer which has been happening in a terrible degree are moral values that I think are worth fighting for.\nSwitzerland was neutral in WWII and that was, almost everyone agrees, worth fighting in.  Being independent is like that.  I like what Mark Twain said.  He said he believed in the two-party system, that's why he was a Democrat, implying that at least two parties existed WITHIN the party.  If you study the parties, there ARE big differences in them and I think the DEMOCRATIC PARTY in spite of its craziness is a better representative of the best of AMERICA.
I agree. But it is very hard to legalize and tax something that can be grown at home, nearly everywhere in the country. The point I am trying to make is if it were to be legal, everyone would grown their own and the government wouldn't se much revenue. *Vote Libertarian*

"I've personally thought of this question a lot of times, and I've come to the conclusion that the reason for the unwillingness of the west to declare war on the barbaric states in the middle east, is that we are a country of having our cake and eating it too.\n\nConsider that in world war two America and it's allies hated those Nazi's, Japs and, well I don't know what my grandpa's generation called the Italians. Meatball huckers perhaps? But back to the point, today it would be impossible to declare outright war on a rogue nation like North Korea, unless they attacked us first. \n\nOne of the reasons for that is because of the liberal rule that has gripped our nation for the past 5 decades. Because of that liberal rule many good changes have come: Civil Rights for blacks and other minorities that has almost erased racism from our thoughts. And, I guess, the liberation of women. Unfortunately, the one thing that prevents us from ridding ourselves of the left-wing thought of mind that, war is the worst thing for man-kind, is Political Correctness. Why? because political correctness' change of Englishes lexicon limits our thought.\n\nIt is a sad state when many great ideas are broken down because they are deemed politically incorrect or backward. I read a story in my local paper about a school trustee who was forced to resign because of the use of the word, ""niggardly"" in a briefing letter to other trustees. As many of us know niggardly is a adjective that means sad, or a mopey way of actions. But of course some people thought that this trustee, who had held his job for some time, was a hate monger and didn't deserve the honorable position of school trustee. I don't think I have to explain to you why this is bad for civilization, but to get to my point, and the answer to your question, I will anyways.\n\nIf you've ever read George Orwell's book ""1984"" you many be familiar with ""Newspeak"", which was the government sanctioned changing of the English language into newspeak. They did that in the book because while speaking English, you could form thoughts against the totalitarian government in ""1984"". But in Newspeak, it was impossible to form a dissenting thought or as the book calls it, ""Thought Crime"". I hope as you are reading this you are drawing parallels between ""newspeak"" and Political correctness, because there are no differences. Political correctness is the Lefts way of limiting our thought and freedom of speech. Consider how mentally disabled people used to be called, ""retards"" or ""Mongoloids"" which is just a waste of time, but has been done anyway. The same thing happens in ""1984"", when in English you could say,"" all men are equal"" but in newspeak you cannot say that. If you did say all men are equal it wouldn't register as all men are equal in freedom, it would mean all men are equal in size. This is a startling comparison to the events of today's world and the Lefts control of our vocabulary.\n\nBut now I finally get to my point, we will never be able to declare war on the middle east, and it's most dangerous state, Persia, until we return to the thought of yesteryear, when you could say and do normal, orthodox things without fear of persecution. How do we get to this Utopian state? you get there by ridding ourselves of the cancer of politically correctness. The reason Islam has declared a holy war, or ""Jihad"" on the west is because they do not have the cancer of political correctness in their way of life. We cannot declare war on them because of the persecution of the liberals if we do. \n\nSo, in closing, we will probably never declare war on the middle east. That is unfortunate because the middle east and the Axis of evil consisting of Iran, Iraq and North Korea, is the most dangerous threat to out survival.\n\nIf you would like to know more on the dise"
Yes.  We should also boycott businesses that continue to hire illegals.
Yes, you really should think that through.\n\nAnd, if you're referring to Iraq, before the military dictatorships and the brutal oppression, they were a parliamentary democracy. The Iraqis want democracy.\n\nSo, basically, your theory falls flat on its face.\n\nDictatorship. Please. If that were so, Kennedy, Kerry, Clinton, Reid and Pelosi would all be burning in hell already.\n\nThis dictatorship crap is some of the most ignorant thinking I've ever seen. You probably are clueless as to how stupid such drivel makes the anti-Bush people look.
I don't try to. I have to rely on my experience and what I can find out. No one knows the entire truth and probably never will. Just like we just found out that the CIA did not believe their informer regarding WMDs, and that is all they had, pulled it out of Gen Powell's speech to the UN and it was put back in by another CIA official.\n\nWe had no direct knowledge of anything that led to the war in Iraq. All they had was Blix saying they could find no WMD's except some missiles that had to be destroyed, and were, and 1 person who was a known liar!\n\nI don't know about you, but I would never put our troops in harms way over that lack of evidence!
Wouldn't vote for him in the first place. Little thing called common sense.
"Article 4, Section 4 of the Constitution promised to every state in the union a republican form of government. Forces that opposed the concept still exist today in, I believe the ideology of the American left.\nSome speculate the work of Lincoln began the demise, others the 17th- amendment. My personal research indicates text books went from Constitutional republic and referred to America as a democracy in 1949. American Government, by Frank Magruder Ph.D.  published by Allyn and Bacon.\n\n""A pure democracy can admit no cure for the mischiefs of faction.

Definitly a liability. It causes them so many problems.
A president cannot declare war....only congress can pass a declaration of war
Personally, I try not to think about those two, as they rarely seem to do any thinking themselves and I despise those who spout ignorant opinion simply to advance their own flawed ideologies.\n\nBut it doesn't matter what I think, or what you or any of us think...they'll just keep bending us all over the table till we stand up and make 'em stop.\n\nThat is if We The People could ever get off our collective asses, turn off the TV, and actually DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!! \n\n...*sigh* a man can dream, right?

"Need more context, please.\n\nBest guess, it may have to do whether the name of the defendant is spelled the same on the summons and on the complaint, and whether it is spelled correctly.  \n\nLet's say you are suing a large hamburger chain and named it ""MacDonald's"" in your complaint, when the true name is ""McDonald's"".  McDonald's is likely to just file an answer and note the mistake."
"I seriously think no one considers them the reason we went to war. You know how hot of an issue this would be if they were really important. There would be a White House press conference, and the news would be used to vindicate Bush. \nBut, even on Fox, they are not using as the number one news topic.\nWhere is the crowing over at that news station? Hannity, O Reilly and others would be shouting it all over the airwaves, but they aren't because we didn't send 135000 soldiers and spend 290 million dollars looking for mustard gas.\nThink about, isn't the silence really coming from Fox News, who would benefit from having the ability to scream out "" WE WERE RIGHT""\nBut, strangely enough, the story isn't even on today's website, or if it is, it's way down below stories about wildfires in Arizona and the international hunt for the Reno shooter. Even Reese Witherspoon is featured, but no WMD story at Fox. WHY NOT?\n\nA far better question is : IF this is so important, Why is Fox News and the White House sooooo quiet today?"
"A few suggestions:\n\n1) Dismantle the employment magnet. Heavily fine and/or jail employers that hire illegals.\n\n2) Stop offering social services to illegals (free emergency medical care, welfare benefits, social security benefits, education, in-state college tuition).\n\n3) Stop the crazy anchor baby practice.\n\n4) Stop offering amnesty to people that are here illegally.  \n\n5) Do not offer any path to citizenship. Illegals must get in line and go through the process like everyone else. No special treatment. \n\n6) Enforce the border. Use whatever technology is necessary to keep illegals out.\n\n7) Develop a better system for verifying the status of an immigrant before he is hired.\n\n8) Send illegals back to where they came when they are caught.\n\nIf we stop coddling illegals and make life here less attractive, most will self-deport. \n\nI'm tired of hearing ""well, most illegals are good people, work hard, BLAH,BLAH, BLAH."" There are lots of good LEGAL immigrants and legitimate American citizens who work hard and whose resources are being stressed and lielihoods are being compromised by illegals who come to this country and have the nerve to start demanding rights.\n\nDo some research and see how the Senate's amnesty bill will affect population, the environment, social services, the economy, social security, etc. It is not good."
so why do they have 10 kids? they should plan and check if they can raise the kids or not.\n\nIf someone is poor, it's your fault first, then government's, no one can help you better than you.
Its dependent on the police departments rules and regulations.  I know that in my county most officers use a Glock .40 or .45.  A few officers in the Sheriff's office use a 9mm Beretta (mostly the detectives).\n\nSome departments require officers to use a specific type of firearm, my local department requires Glocks, my good good friend carries and XD from Springfield Armory (much like a Glock with a few extra features and its from Springfield, good brand)\n\nThe police academy trains with HK 9mm USP and Glock .40.  When I went through a 4 hour training down there it I used both the Glock and the HK 9mm and I have to say I prefer the HK, which the men found interesting.  Since than I have been able to shoot a HK .40 USP Tactical which is an AWESOME side arm, however the tactical is more for SWAT situations, it is a nice added gun to any collection or for the everyday officer who finds him or herself searching several buildings in checks.  We have an old abandoned school that we often get called out to check, so its a nice weapon fo that, easy accessory adapters.  The Glocks are alright, but I don't like them.  They kick a little bit more than the HK's, but most officers prefer them.\n\nSorry I have gotten WAY off base from your question.  Its all preference and whatever the department requires or allows.
Most likely, the Democrats will ignore the news and never comment.  That is the way they operate.  Facts are never as important as spin to the liberals.\n\nWe all knew it was true.  Saddam deserves the death sentence he will get.
All my people are worthy of respect. I just want the legal issues dealt with. Peace
well they smoke a lot of pot so I would think so.  Curious you are dumb.  Why do conservatives make more money than most liberals do dumbass?

No way hoe zay!\n\n\nWe have enough people who want to be in our armed forces and they just keep on coming!  Wonderful news for us..terrible news for those damned Arabs!
Aw you poor thing.  Sounds like you have bought into the whole ignorance and stupidity concept.  \n\nThere is little point in me trying to answer because I'm sure you get all your 'facts' from Faux News and fascist talk radio.  \n\nPolitics for intelligent people is all about considering what is right for each and every issue.  For idiots like you politics is like a football team.  You support a team and hate the other teams.  In politics you picked a side and now blindly support it.  I expect you still think Bush is doing a great job.  Maybe one day you will learn to think for yourself instead of acting like a sheep.
Bill Clinton has already been president twice. This question is pointless because he can't be president again.

I agree that we get ourselves in too many conflicts around the world, but as the only true superpower left in the world, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, and as one of the eight (possibly 9 or 10 if North Korea and Iran continue on their course of action) nuclear-capable countries it is the job of the United States to be polic-force of the world. nobody else has the tools to keep the peace. Look at Somalia before Black Hawk Down. We sent in 20,000 US Marines and order was restored. We left the Pakistani army in charge and left the country. All hell broke loose and we had to send the Rangers and Delta Force in to clean up the mess.\n\nIf the United States is not willing to stand up for other countries and be keepers of the peace, no one else will. Britain and Canada don't have the military strength, Russia doesn't have the money, France doesn't have the will power, and China doesn't really care. Who else has the tools, manpower, and money to tackle the job of world's policeman?
(Uyghur: ئۇيغۇر; Uighur Simplified Chinese: 维吾尔; Traditional Chinese: 維吾爾; pinyin: Wéiwú'ěr; Turkish: Uygur) are a Turkic people, forming one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People's Republic of China. In China, Uyghurs live primarily in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (also known as East Turkestan). Uyghurs live in Kazakhstan, Kirgizistan and Uzbekistan as a major minority ethnic group. There is a big Uyghur community in Turkey. A small community of Uyghurs also exists in Taoyuan County of Hunan province in South-central China. Uyghur neighborhoods also exist in major cities like Beijing an Shanghai.
Years ago when I was trampin', I went through probably several cases of beer and 2 or 3 oz. of pot a day, every day. When I was jammin', which was most of the time, I had a golden combination I loved. I'd drop about 5 reds, wait a half hour and drop 15 whites. I stayed wasted just jammin' down the highway from people handing me beer, wine, booze, you name it, out their windows to me as I'd pass. Being totally wasted all the time became part of my personality. People who new me couldn't even tell any more. I rode my scooter all over the country like that. Never  got busted, even when I'd get busted for assault. I got busted for assault all the time but no convictions cause it was always self defense. Anyway, yeah, shoot I can't say I wouldn't cause I did. Never had an accident either.
You can sue for just about anything ... but winning is a different story. You got me curious.  Do you have an example of an anti Jewish remark in an advertisement?

When you see other heads of government laughing when the twin towers were collapsing, what do you think a head of government will do? \n    America's richness in culture, economy, land and government are an envy to all countries. The brightess of the bright are here inventing products that would make life easier for the rest of the world.\n   America is a blessed nation. It will be blessed by God as long as it maintains justice for all and its families still governed by moral codes. It is still a blessed nation.\n    Russia, China, France, Germany, Canada, etc.did not go with the other willing nations to fight back terrorism because they have their own private agenda. Some are indirectly helping the cost of War on Terrorism while others do not. Others are against Pres Bush's plans because it has caused deaths among U.S. soldiers. But, this is war, we don't expect a 0 casualty.\n    The international community relies much on the U.S. As if, the U.S. is policing the world! The Holocaust, the Genocides of Idi Amin, Pol-pot Regime, the Gassing of the Kurds, the rein of Milosevic, why are there no other countries to take the first step? It is always the U.S. who is always willing to help. But, nobody comes into her on her own natural calamities? Where is Canada, France, Russia?

As a rule when they argue that the economy is good it is because of the increase in jobs.  Which there is an increase and a rather large one, unfortunately it is mainly in very low-paying jobs, jobs that quite a few are unwilling to take (very hard to work at McDonalds after practically any other job).  \n\nBush is arguing trickle-down economics.  The rich are making much more money, and it is assumed they will use this money to create more businesses to make themselves more money, but the natural side effect of the rich creating more businesses for themselves is that there should be more jobs for the rest of us (blue-collar workers).  We have yet to see it actually work out, and it didn't do so hot when Reagan gave it a shot, but the theory is a sound one.  I just don't think it will work in the end myself, but I'm not an economist.
Stay with the love of your life. I don't know about you, but I'd rather live somewhere else with the right person than in America with the wrong one.

Your refering to whats call the nigerian email scam also known as the 401 scam named after the law that it is classified under.The scam is also done out of other countries but more often out of nigeria.The OP is what you would classify as a racist using other acts of racism to justify more racism.What the postor has done is taken what is a crime and tryed to justify it.Crime is crime no matter who it is done too.\nMost con games are done sucessfully to people who succum to greed .They let their desire for personal gain allow them to get victimized.Occasionally though a person with good intentions does get caught up in the trap.These people are generally living in poverty if they are not the organizers or the criminal rings that are involved and see it as an only way out.They use this to try to justify thier crimes and generally blame the europeans and chinese or anyone else they can blame for there own woes but at the same time fail to recognize the people that risk their lives in the peace corps and other fine non profit organizations to help them.The criminal ring leaders use racism and poverty to profit by giving them computer access and hatred.

conservatives fear free thinkers ones they can't control. so they blame everything bad on liberals because they have no solutions of their own. it's the old blame game.
One thing I dislike about the Democratic party is its inability to properly organize itself and its issues.  Our population is majority democrat, but so many democrats cannot or choose not to vote.  I also think that a lot of liberals have holier than thou values about Christianity (they think that the only smart people out there are atheists), which are kind of hypocritical of liberal ideals. \n\nI like the patriotism of a lot of Republicans.  They're really into that heartwarming, feel good to be an American stuff.  Even like the president running around with that soldier who lost his legs in Iraq.  I think that's just a pretty cool thing to do.

"Perhaps there are other dynamics at play among the users of this category.  Your question and your responses have more of a moral approach, ie. you look for the positive; you wish to reason and extract some compassion because, after all, they (Mexicans) are from Planet Earth (humans).  \n\nUnfortunately, the responses from the general users of this forum resort to a stereotype of the Mexican population. We say Mexican, because we don't hear any other race being discussed here.   Do you honestly think they would stop labeling the Mexicans if their status is LEGAL? We think it's a great excuse to hide behind the ""we are not against Mexicans, we are against Illegal Mexicans.""  The focus is race, on prejudice, and aimed at how every American's tax dollars go to subsidize the illegals.  The truth is most of the kiddie generations on this post don't have a job; the truth is their IQ level is not emtionally suited to deal with the differences that makes the world go round.  What's more, the working population of America will pay their accountants to pay as little tax as possible.  Most of it is parroting what is in the news or what the kiddies hear  at home.    If the likes of the hadenoughs and sugarpies ran the world of International affairs, God help us all.   \n\n\nSo to answer your basic question, is there more to this?  Of course, it  is bigotry in denial!

Yes they can - under RICO laws, they can seize the property then use it or sell it, the Funds are then given to the law Enforcement agencys involved.  You can appeal to the Maricopia County attorneys office if the owner of the vehicle is unaware or had no way of knowing that the drugs were there.  Otherwise the vehicle is gone.  .  By the way, the police can seize any property that is involved in the of drugs such as you house, land , boat or whatever
"The US gov. is NOT a democracy and there is NO freedom here it is all a lie devised by a covert alien occupation to rule above us.\n\nWe as people have NO constituional rights, (a common and gov. ingrained misconception) the ""constitution"" is strictly a document outlining the powers and limitations of our so-called government. ""We the people"" ONLY have the Bill of Rights(a seperate document). \n\nAs you may be aware ALL officers of gov are sworn(literally on their lives) to ""uphold the constitution""(the power of gov) and not the Bill of Rights(show me an officer that on duty upheld the peoples rights and i'll show you a disgracfully terminated officer). THERE IS NO ONE SERVING AND PROTECTING THE PEOPLE, we are feed a crock of lies and left vulnerable to be exploited by the REAL CRIMINALS; our govs officers!  \n\nOnly when people wake-up and realize that gov. is the first, largest and most profitable criminal organization on the planet  can there ever be a chance for true freedom."
The Founders were wealthy, well-educated, land-owning white men, and their political and economic views reflect that. The constitution is essentially a prescription for keeping power in that select group, and looking at the world today, was very successful in its aim.\n\nProgressivism differed in that it sought to empower and protect people outside the select class, specifically poor people and immigrants. Of course, both groups--the progressives and the founders--sought to empower themselves. The difference is that the progressives were poor while the founders were rich.
I'm glad you went over that phase, I was starting to freak out. It's easier being pro-Amnesty, because you are basing your position out of objective reality, not self delusion.\n\nTo be against amnesty, you need to make the effort of using negative emotions like hate and racism to help you arrive to that stupid position, what is more difficult.
Yep,  that is called a person with no moral values!!!

"From the Texas Department of Labor website:\n\n\nBreaks are a common source of confusion for employers. As noted toward the beginning of this paper, the FLSA does not require employers to give breaks during the workday, but if breaks are given, certain rules apply. Rest or coffee breaks, defined as 20 minutes or less, are compensable hours worked under 29 C.F.R. 785.18, since they are regarded as being for the benefit of both the employer and the employee. Meal breaks, on the other hand, are not compensable, as long as they are at least 30 minutes in length and the employee is ""completely relieved from duty for the purpose of eating a regular meal"" (see 29 C.F.R. 785.19). Shorter meal breaks may be considered valid under special circumstances. The most frequent pitfall for employers is thinking that employees have true meal breaks if they are allowed to eat at their desks while answering phones, opening mail, sorting files, and so on. Such duties performed while trying to eat will render the time spent during the meal break compensable. Employers may control unauthorized work during meal breaks by the disciplinary process."
To be honest, all I know is what I have read in the papers.  I don't think I know enough about the actual people to make an educated decision.
Why, are they locked in the cabinet and can't get out?

It isn't just the western country economies dependent on it. One of the reason for gas price spikes have been a large increase in dependency from the biggest population countries, China and India. The problem is the entire world is dependent on a very limited supply of product.\nThe Western countries will never be come independent on their own supplies because they don't have enough supply to meet the demand. The only way that will change is if a new fuel supply comes along that is much cheaper and equal to or more efficient than fossil fuels, and it still requires us getting rid of the nearly 1 billion cars in the US currently.
u r a tenant, so complain to your land lord or local police.
You will not find any 'mercenary' group that will take 'computer' and 'political science' skills as pertinent to the occupation. That's left to the person or persons bankrolling the operations. To say you have 'hand to hand combat'  or 'firearm' experience, you MUST have to have been a soldier. No such thing as a non soldier with hand to hand combat experience. Any one can gain firearm experience as a civilian, but when comparing a small arms aficionado to a professional soldier who has years of experience around firearms, the civilian is gonna lose the pick.\n You can always join some rag tag militia in a third world country who will take anyone who is willing to pick up an AK-47 and get paid with heroin and call yourselves 'mercenaries', and that's if they allow you to live if you are Western.\n The ONLY possibility I can give you, is if you have expert medical schooling.  Basic medical knowlege might not do because most soldiers receive that during their years in service. If you are a doctor or surgeon, the chances are good you can go ANYWHERE in the world.\n  You also have the possibility of become a police officer trainer in foreign countries, much like we have in Iraq training their police. But, of course, you need to get that certification here in the states before applying for those positions. There are a few companies hiring police for this, most of the contracting companies in Iraq need them, so it's not hard to find. Halliburton, General Dynamics, PAECIVPOL...these are some who need officers to train foreign police. Hope this works for you.
I have mixed emotions about this. Two,or three years ago I lost a good friend because of an accident in town,in public. Bystanders at the scene reported trying to remove him from the vehicle which was on fire.All efforts were in vain.I had always supported the law up until this point,reasoning that in the event of an accident or loss of vehicular control you are more likely to regain control of your vehicle if you're not in the backseat.I am now of the opinion that any law which could possibly endanger life should be given a very hard second look.I wear mine but if I were the deciding factor in a nation-wide seatbelt law it would be left up to the individual.
Sometimes in certain situations where people are so opressed they need to fight for what they believe in and for the governmet to randomly kill innocent people because they voiced their opinion and how crazy is that?  The tigers consider themselves freedom fighters and the things that they have seen really shapes their view on governmet and out look on life.  What they saw made them passionate about there cause.   I would noway meet eye to eye with the people who want to kill me.  The governmet just take pictures of these who appear and  maybe take them into custody at the talk summit.  It is hard to establish trust when it is continually taken away.
I am afraid that is going to happen in Michigan governers race this year. Dick Devos (Amway) started to run TV adds two months ago. So far he has kept it clean but I look for him to buy himself a governers office. Sad part is he is another rich repuglican. I am afraid where Michigan will go with him in charge.
Uhhhhh.  I think he was elected according to the laws of the land, so it seems pretty simple to realize that he not only IS the President, he SHOULD BE the President.  God Bless you.
Sounds like you just answered your own question. Our country is full of the biggest crooks in the world, and the best hidden ones. It's being allowed because there is no one to stop it. People believe that they are bound by the vote. You know, that arcaic ritual that makes them feel patriotic (well, less than 50% of them anyways) every few years? The question is, what are you and I gonna do to stop it?
To answer you questions one by one - \nJudging from the postings here, most of them.  They all know that it was about everything else other than the official mumbo jumbo but refuse to acknowledge it  because obviously it would make them seem greedy  which doesnt fit to well with their Batman image which the've conjured up for themselves. Strangely enough many believe the fantasy that Iraq is a whooping success story.  Forget about the forty odd people who die a day, forget about the fact that the US supported Iraqi government doesnt control an inch of dust outside of its precious greenzone. Some will still harp on about the relationship between Saddam and Al-Qaeda even though its been clearly proven that no such relationship existed. Some will castigate you for believing what they call liberal media propoganda, the voice of the hippies for spelling out the truth before them. If they only knew that they themselves are the subjects of a more vicious  propoganda effort by there leaders whom they blindly follow. Others will castigate you in the name of freedom trying to convince you and their own conscience that this is all about dear freedom.    In anycase it doesnt matter who's money it is because no serious rebuilding was planned or intended in the first place. Do you really think that they give a damn about the welfare of the Iraqi people. Do you want to know the real reason for this butchery called Operation Iraqi Freedom. Read the second comment. Slowly the truth emerges.
Australia was initially declared Terra Nullius, meaning the land was empty and free for the UK to take. In 1992, the Mabo Case, the High Court overrulled this ruling and restated certain rights to aboriginies. \n\nGenerally speaking, Australia has one of the best benifit systems, with a semi-working Medicare system and Dole support scheme. \n\nBut when you look at reports from dentention centres for asylum seekers (illegal immigrants), there have been several cases where human rights seems to be non-existance. \n\nNevertheless, Australia has a good human right record, especially since we don't have a Bill of Rights.
"It's called Fascism..... it was huge in Europe in the 1940's.\n\nPersonally, I think it's best that Iran doesn't aquire nukes.....\n\nSome leaders will use them without thinking of the consequences.\n\nPS.\n\nThere seems to be a lot of people on here who are under the illusion that most of the anti-US feeling from other countries is unwaranted. Some of the hatred towards the US stems from US foreign policy and activites of the CIA but most of it begins with resentment towards the corporations like Coca-cola, McDonalds and the large financial and mineral corporations. Some countries are seriously affraid for their culture and their freedom.  They  have a very real concern about the ""infection"" of Americanisation in their society.\n\nThat is the reason why so many countries want to arm themselves with nukes. In the middle East there is growing resentment and hatred towards the US. Threats like "" The use of Military force has not been ruled out"" do not help to calm countries like Iran and Syria and  do not lead them to beleive the US to be friendly. \n\nIf you combine these factors with zealous, hateful teachings that bear no relationship to the teachings of the Qur'an being aggressively promoted by maniacs on a power trip. These feed off the fears of decent people and the change in them begins. \n\nIt's very easy for a lot of people to blame the US directly for their problems. A large ammount of problems in the third world ARE the fault of US corporations and Government. It comes down to the individual to not accept or indulge in the things on offer from the US.\n\nMy point is that the US is becoming an Empire and in doing so they are provoking very dangerous people. Empires grow and consume other other organisations and societies. They deplete their resources, violate their people and their culture and turn the people in to slaves. Would you want that done to your own country? How would it feel to have Taliban troops walking down your street kicking in the doors, needlessly violating, torturing and killing the occupants (you, you neighbours, your children)? Would that make you feel welcoming towards them or would you fight back? you would fight back becaause even the most peace loving among you would not be able to bear what you see.\n\nRealistically, people look for an answer in desperate times and that is most likely to involve religion - that is the same globally.\nAny religion in the world promotes peace. So when people adhere to a faith and something American starts to interfere with their faith...porn, Hollywood films, drugs, alcohol, western unmodest fashion etc. the psychological association is there that the US is evil, promoting all these obscene things to tempt people away from God and their faith. Anybody in that situation would be hostile. Add the fear of invasion and that's when terrorism begins. Those people believe they have a very realistic reason to seek WMD's. The problem is that they get carried away with the whole idea that they are good and the US is evil. They then forget to question whether their own actions are right or wrong. \n\nTheir countries are also run by politicians who are greedy liars just the same as all of our politicians are. They manipulate their people through the media as well. They promote the anti-US feeling to the people. Before you know it there is a very clear and present danger to the American way of life and that has to be preserved which may involve aggressive military action against a whole group of countries and organisations that are hostile to the US....which, to apply a catchy name to group the whole lot together with out actually directly blaming any of them: we could call them something like the Axis of Evil for example.\n\nSee at this point  a whole load of false ideas have destroyed peoples ability to think rationally on all sides. \n\nAt this point your Government seeks to eradicate any external threats and in fear of "
I do not believe in any kind of abortion. It is murder. What crime could be worse than killing your own offspring. I believe if you kill your baby you will go straight to Hell.\n\nIt is very sad thing for humans to do.\n:(

The numerical limit or cap for H-1B visas has already been hit for this Fiscal Year (2007). There is a chance that some H-1B visa numbers will be available after October 1, 2006, but this depends on how many visa numbers are left over from those alotted for citizens of Chile and Singapore.\n\nThere are still approximately 8,000 visa numbers available for individuals with a Master's degree or higher from a U.S. educational institution.\n\nYou may find more information on the H-1B visa cap at the USCIS website: http://www.uscis.gov/graphics/services/tempbenefits/cap.htm\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n \n\nBrian D.

Absolutely not. This is a personal choice and if the government started controlling how many children we can have they would be taking away my fredom of choice. When would it end? Would we be like China? They only allow a certain amount of children to be born in each family and girls are not allowed to be born or murdered just becauser they happen to be female. \nI am completly in favor of my freedom of choice. I would not give it up without a fight.

You idiots (the geniuses replying to this question like morganton & lancelot) need to wake up. You talk of the fight for freedom, that has been reduced since the war began!! You talk of terrorist attacks and how there have been none since the war began, only in th eus though, they have increased elsewhere\n\nYou get your information from newspapers that support whatever suits them, you don't expect them to tell the truth do you?\n\nYou know nothing of the government in the middle east and judge it by your narrow standards.\n\nThe us invades a country then leaves a power vacuum when it withdraws resulting in chaos for the inhabitants. You are not doing the locals a favour when you invade, you leave a country in disarray in which there are several factions fighting for control.\n\nYou may not have liked saddam, but the country operated well when he was running it.\n\nlancelot, morganton, pull your heads out of your @rses and have a look around, you might learn something.
Some of our states are bigger - and more populous - than some European countries. They have a lot more autonomy than shires and counties in the UK. They have different speed limits, different ages at which people can buy tobacco or alcohol, different ages at which people can drive automobiles. The death penalty is another example.
There are truths and there are truths.\nWhere you sit is most always where you stand.\nI will check out the website you recommended, but what I have gotten to know going through life is that none of us have the answers. We keep trying to come up with solutions that we think are new, but they all fail in the end. We need some new ideas.
Portugal was neutral through most of the war, entering on the side of the allies only about 1944. As such, Portugal like Spain was able to act as a conduit where the warring factions could pass diplomatic exchanges back and forth. As such, it was also the scene of a lot of mischief by various secret agents.

Canada and the US cooperate on protecting our mutual border in a way Mexico does not, so we feel more confident on that side of the nation.  However, even Canada has said recently that its amnesty grants have jumped proper checking for terrorist ties, and I understand they will be addressing that, going forward.\n\nI think we need to protect all of our borders.  However, I think we at least have a neighbor working in concert with us on this point on our northern side.

Why are Palastinians delibrately targeting and killing innocent Israelis?
it depends on which branch of the military and what their job is...as far as where they are stationed.\n\nfor example...my husband is a marine on an air station.\nthat means this military installation is made up of various units that work on aircraft and pilots, etc...everything to do with the air units.\nthe colonels here are basically the head guys, like the CEO of this individual company, to put it into civilian terms.\nbasically, they have to be involved in EVERYTHING.  they have to be sure people are doing their jobs, money is being spent properly, various committees are doing what they are meant to do...\n\nbasically, what i've learned, is that the military is set up like a business.  the higher you go the more paperwork and people managing you have to do.\nyou manage less people directly, but more people indirectly.\na colonel is pretty high up, so they are in charge of MANY people, but directly order a few people lower than them.\n\ni hope this helped!\ntake care.
The answer would depend on what type of reconciliation is made.  If they reconcile on the basis of unification, then it would depend on whether their choice is to follow communism, which does not appear to be working too well, Democracy, or any other autocratic, military dictatorship type of Government.  Either way, my bet is on civil war, as there are too many diehards brainwashed into thinking their way is the only way.\nNot to mention that the US will have to become involved, and do you think we need another war on our hands?
They can and  they will take any form of government payment to you.
Nothing is bad or good in its own stead. It is the way it is used, implemented and taken up which makes it bad or good. In India reservation was and is used to please some people and get quick votes, be it SC&ST provisions in constitution which was original for 15 years or implementation of Mandal commission after years of lying in bag. There are many aspects of reservation. It is fact there are some strata of society who need support to rise from their current status of poverty or backwardness.\n\nHowever there is opposition for reservation because the benefit of it are not going to actual people rather they are taken up by some people of these society who are already in up class are taking up these benefits whereas actual needy people are still at the same place. No one will object if a really needy get the benefit, You and all are furious since it is someone who is not needy who is reaping benefit.\n\nAs far as making economic condition as criteria is concerned, there is always good and bad of all thoughts. Good about this will be that this should be the correct way of deciding giving help however there are too many lacuna in this as getting certificate for economic background is very easy to get since no one file income tax return and there no proof of incomes for people other than salaried people so what will happen ultimately is again people who do not deserve the benefit will get it and needy will remain eluded with this.\nI agree that when it comes to job then what we need is competent people in jobs to provide proper service and let our country grow. It is wrong to say the people who need help to rise first time are not competent but what is required is that we bring them up and educate and train them so that they are competent enough to take up the challenges. Now if we talk about getting a doctor without enough skills. This is often repeated example but what we fail to understand that a person cannot be a doctor just by getting admission in medical college. S/he became doctor after passing out from the college. If we say that college examination system is such that they will pass person without knowledge then problem does not lie in reservation in admission but in examination system which required to be looked into. Having said that if education system is not good and it will allow person without skill to get the degree then what is guarantee that a person who has come by other route let us by paying higher fees or something and for that matter what is guarantee that a person who have scored 90+ marks is good in medical study. So then we are running risk of many doctors without skills operating on us. So this argument that if the person has come with reservation will be not competent doctor is not correct. If a person has passed MBBS (s/he can be anyone reserve one or other) and do not know how to use scalpel and then we should hung all the teachers who have taught them, people who have set the papers and all the examiners who has taken their practical exams and checker who checked their examination papers.\n\nSo mantra for anything to be good and successful is honest implementation of the same.
Law enforcement officers are, as their name suggests, people entrusted by the government to enforce the law that government lays down. The key word in this case is entrusted. Even today, with terrorism, high security everywhere and political unrest, every facet of society is becoming more distrusting of the general public, who they suspect want to blow them up (talk about pathological paranoid schitzophrenia hey?), and these are the people in high positions of power. Trust takes a long time to develop, and so a chain of command has been established whereby the more dangerous and the longer time you spend serving the government's interests, the better the departments of that government will treat you, including law enforcement. There are likewise stereotype offenders in the gen. pop. that police target, for the same reason: less service to the gov't = worse treatment.\nThe point of all this is to emphasize that a government is not going to allow a law to be amended, changed or repealed that takes responsibility away from the people the gov't trusts, so that the gen. pop. is a little more comfortable.\nSo my answer then, is if you want something done that a powerful force is against, you need to be more powerful that that force, or atleast a threat to their sense of power. This means building gen. pop. support for your cause, not by petition (these are ignored without the following), and not with a public rally in a park that affects noone, but with actions that undermine the power that government wields over the gen. pop. and sending that message up the chain of command that they are losing control and must yield to your demands. Always remember, you are not at war with the government, they are not your enemy! you are revolting (starting a revolution) that will benefit both you and them, and you are asking assertively for their help in justifying such change. Guns, violence, aggression and injury/death will not solve anything; infact it will make it worse, escalating out of control where all concerned forget the point and just try to stay alive and out of jail (how did I get myself into this mess?). This is not only about improving crime - anticrime interaction procedures, but about maintaining societal peace. It's about sending a big message of popular dissatisfaction and unrest, not with handcuffs and cellbars. Play smart, not hard!
"Go a long way back into history to figure this one out - it's a knot.   Shooting thirteen civilians on one day was not a good move by the British (""bloody sunday""), but lots more happened than that.  Prior to the marches that ended with bloody sunday there was institutional sectarianism that the brits tolerated, including the built-in majority for protestants in government across the province.  For the true story you have to go back at least as far as Cromwell, and possibly as far as Robert the Bruce, and you have to be completely dispassionate as you read it."

Yes and No.\n\nThe US Navy requires a six year commitment for all enlistments.  Most enlistments are for 4 years of active duty which would require two years of reserve duty.  The amount of active duty time depends on your choice of schooling and enlistment contract.  If your contract requires 4 years of active duty, you must remain on active duty for four years.

win or lose doesn't matter.... it was to maintain their super power status during that era. united states needed war before and united states need war in every 15 years. look into the history of modern wars... study how many wars happens in the mordern wars has US involvements, can you observe that most of the wars was actually created by US intelligence? its an accounting theory. war creates economy to US when the dollar value drops.

The reality of it is that liberal leadership is excatly what got us into this mess in the first place.  What people don't seem to understand is that muslim fundamentalism is the anthithesis of anything liberal at all.  They view liberalism as evil, and see the United States as a champion of liberalism, and is thus a champion of evil ideals.  \n\n\nI do not agree.  I believe everyone should be free to make their own choices.  Fundamental Islam, would strip us of all of our civil  liberties and have us praying to Allah, 7 times a day, covering our women up, killing gays, Jews, Christians, and Blacks, censoring our papers, strip us of freedom of speach and so on.  So while these are the rights we are fighting to protect, it is not the style of government that would win this war.  These people respond to an iron fist, not a bleading heart, that being the case we must pound them into the ground with our conservative iron fist, so that we and those that want it are free to make our own choices.

Is the personal name of God.  Later, some Christian translators mistakenly combined the vowels of “Adonay” with the consonants of “YHWH” producing the word “YaHoWaH.” When the Scriptures were translated into German during the Reformation, the word was transliterated into the German pronunciation, which pronounces “Y” as an English “J” and pronounces “W” as an English “V” — or “Jahovah.” Then in the early 17th century when the Scriptures were being translated into English with the help of some of the German translations, the word was again transliterated as “Jehovah,” and this this unfortunate accident has carried over into many modern English translations.\n\nHebrew YAHWEH

You answer a few questions, such as why you are changing your name, if you are doing so to evade creditors (which the answer has to be 'no'), etc. After the judge grants you the change, you have to send in for a change on your birth certificate, social security card, and whatever else. It is really easy, and for such a small change as your's, it will be even easier. Very few applications ask whether you have ever gone by another name. I work in healthcare so I had to disclose my other name once, but that was it. You know what? I changed my name back, a year later. I just decided to go back to my original name, and it was even easier than the first change. Hopefully, it is the same in your area, but laws do sometimes differ.

I think in addition to 'helping' mexico build things like schools and roads, we should also 'help' them build prisons, because they don't seem to be able to keep a handle on their own criminals. \nAmerica's not the world's dumping ground, and the people that come to the US and screw up are often screw-ups in their home country, too. Jails and prisons don't 'fix' that problem, they don't serve to rehabilitate, but they do separate such people from the mainstream so that the rest of us can walk down the street and not have to worry about imported violent offenders etc. Mexico's got social problems. Somehow the United States ended up in the unenviable position of being expected to 'help' Mexico with their social problems. Too bad Mexico won't 'help' itself, instead they'd rather keep 'helping' themselves to the american taxpayer's wallet....

They don't make it harder for Eastern Europeans than many other nations, but some few nations (including much of Western Europe) DO have an easier access.  This is based upon the risk of visa violations.  It is believed that residents of Norway, for example, are much less likely to overstay their visas than a resident of Bosnia, for example.  But it isn't specific to Eastern Europe.  Most of the world falls into the same category.
Hungary. We were called like that because a little economic and cultural reform was launched in the 1960s. The rules weren’t as tough as in other countries and we had a better standard of living than the others.
Strangely enough, parking in a blue badge parking space *without* a blue badge doesn't annoy me as much as people who use their family's blue badges to park there.  At least parking without a blue badge risks them getting a fine.  According to the most recent census, 1 in 5 people in the area I live in (a ward of NW London) are living on disability living allowance or income support.  If we pretend that is 1 in 10 people who are registered disabled then it explains why I see more abled than disabled people parking in these bays and not getting a ticket - they are able to 'borrow' a badge from people they know.\nThe public building I work in is next to a row of disabled bays and due to laziness (not lack of parking space), many either park in these bays with a family member's badge or they don't park, stop in the middle of the road, send their children (some as young as 4) across this dangerous road to collect something from the building for them.  Personally, I'd rather they'd park in the disabled bay than see a nervous 4 year old try to dodge the busy traffic again.\n\n(P.S. I don't drive so, no, I've never done it.)\n\nNote: We do have blue badges in the UK... in London at least... I think Scotland might have the orange badge... but I'm not sure.
no i don't like violence
I don't know about Boston but believe it or not, in many jurisdictions it is illegal to put money in strangers parking meters.
works for me brother
they had enough information to know that there was a good chance 9/11 would happen. they chose not to act. thats it.\n\n\nwhy is it so hard to believe theres a cover-up?\n\nthink about it. thousands of ppl dead. because of something the only thing protecting this country could prevent, but didnt?\n\nthats too scary. \n\nits much easier to say they're dumb, ya know, idiots. (despite the fact that Bush went to Yale and is,hello, president)\nor that some arab that hates freedom is attacking.\n\nto swallow the fact that the govt. doesnt give a fuck about you and would allow such an atrocity to take place. is too much for most ppl.
"I'm not saying that I know for sure who killed JFK, but here is something to think about. JFK' s dad was connected to organized crime during prohibition. He was a bootlegger. Now fast forward to when JFK was running for president. He reach out to his friend Frank Sinatra, who was friends with Sam Giancana (boss of the Chicago Outfit). Giancana ""pulled"" some strings and JFK got elected. After he was elected, Giancana figured JFK owned the mob a favor. JFK put his brother as Attorney General, and both of them went after the mob. \nNow fast forward again to the assination and the aftermath. Whether Oswald was just a fall guy or if he was one of the shooters (and yes I said one of the shooters, meaning more than one shooter), I don't know. But Giancana being boss of Chicago had ties to New Orleans boss Carlos Marcello, who had ties to Dallas, and I think you know where I am going with this. Jack Ruby was connected to the Dallas Family. He wasn't very important, but he still had ties."
Before we invaded Iraq,we had the support of the entire world. Nobody objected to our going after the Taliban in Afghanistan and we had a coalition of allies who were willing to support our cause.  Bush,Pearle,Rumsfeld,Wolfowitz,Cheney and Rice squandered that good will by deliberately lying to the American people and the world about phoney WMD's. They also told us that the war would pay for itself with Iraqi oil. Unfortunately what Bush has accomplished is something no one in history has been able to do,he has turned the entire Islamic world into our enemy. Instead of them hating the Jews in Israel they now hate us. This war will never be won by our troops because when you have people willing to blow their selves up for a cause any victory will only come when the last suicide bomber has died. The Middle east would have been a far more stable region had we not invaded and killed hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians including women and children.

No.  When your boyfriend, my husband, and the thousands of other soldiers signed the contract to enlist in the military they knew that defending our country was part of the job.  I do not like the fact that in the last 3 years my husband has been home only 15 months, but lets face it, it is his job.  \n\nAll we can do is pray for them when they are not here and love them like there is no tomorrow when they are home.  I knew what I was getting into when I married him and as much as I hate him being gone every other year, I have to live with it, that is the job of a military wife.\n\nGod Bless All Our Troops

For me its an issue of human rights. \n\nAnd, no, I am not a bleeding heart liberal.  I definately lean more to conservative.\n\nYes, they come here undocumented and inadvertently break the law.  For those who are just here to make a better life for there families, I don't see why people see this as evil.  They had the misfortune of being born in a corrupt third world country, not of their choosing.  \n\nWe don't have a choice where we are born and to this I say live and let live.  A birthright for me is merely a gift of grace and see it as gift from God, what make me so special that I deserve this birthright, that I was born in this country?  Nothing, so I feel compassion for people who don't have this birthright or privilege and who am I to decide if they can or cant live here.  \n\nI know you must think that we as citizens must obey our laws to promote order and I agree with you.  However, not all laws are reasonable and fair.  I don't really want open borders, but for those who risk their lives coming here for a better life, I say live and let live...

Every case is unique, but the general procedures are like any criminal trial.    The case is called, the charges are read and the defendant enters a plea.  A jury is empaneled unless the defendant waived the right to a jury trial.  Both sides present their opening statements.  The prosecution presents its case along with any witnesses.  The defense cross-examines the witnesses.  The defense presents its defense.  The prosecution crosses the defense witnesses.  Motions are dealt with as the matters arise.  Both sides present their closing arguments and it goes to the jury.  The jury deliberates and renders it's verdict.  The verdict is read and the defendant is either scheculed for sentencing if found guilty or released if found not guilty.\n\nA guardian ad-litem may be appointed by the court to protect the rights and interests of the minor.\n\nAttorneys involved in a case rarely take the stand, they're there to try the case or represent the defendant.  They're not witnesses.\n\nThe specific questions asked by either side depend upon the facts and circumstances.  Again, every case is unique.  The minor (victim) may or may not need to take the stand.
Israel is the most dangerous country in the area.  They have a nuclear arsenal and have been known to take the offensive against any threat to them.  They bombed an Iraqi nuclear development site 10-15 years ago because they felt threatened.  I wouldn't be surprised if they do the same to Iran!  They were attacked by many Islamic countries a few decades ago and they kicked all their buts...in about 4 days.  They are strong, have great intelligence and they have powerful weaponry that they aren't afraid to use in the defense of their country.  Iran is a threat to give/sell their nuclear knowledge to terrorists, but they couldn't even beat Iraq in their wars.  Look how fast Iraq fell to the US...Israel could have done it pretty much that fast!  Hope this helps.
This is, at times, a gladitorial arena. \nSure, there's hand grenades and flame throwers aplenty, but at times that is just the nature of the contest.\n\nTruly, I feel it gives people a place to vent their anger and frustration, among other things. \nIt's also a place where wit and humor come out.\n\nI enjoy reading the comments, the trading of accusations and insults, the raw feelings that come out from both sides, and its safe..\n\nFor my real meat and potatoes, I go to forums and discussions at Stanford University, which is near by. I also show up at fund raisers for our local politicians (we had an election here a few weeks ago).\n\nSometimes it does seem kinda crass and rough, but better to get these feelings out in a safe environment than to let them stew unabated.\n\nAnd one more thing; I HAVE heard some interesting remarks from the other side that have made me think. They have good people on their side, no doubt about it. \n\nAfter all, they are products of a great country. We all are.

"It's not illegal to buy the book, but perhaps the contents of the book may be controversial. I haven't read the book, but heres a summary of the ""Behold A Pale Horse"" from wikipedia.\n\nBehold a Pale Horse is a 1991 book by William Milton Cooper. (ISBN 0929385225)\n\nWritten after Cooper had been a member of the US Naval Intelligence Briefing Team of the Commander in Chief of the United States Pacific Fleet, the book details many of Cooper's claims about the alleged influence of UFOs on US government agencies, the New World Order, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the Apollo hoaxes and other topics.\n\nAnother claim made in the book pertains to his own death. William Cooper, seemingly paranoid, claimed that he would be shot to death on his own property. True to his ""fate,"" he was gunned down in precisely this manner years after publishing the book and settling down in Arizona. However, prior to his move, Cooper had confided to a neighbor of many years that he expressed a wish to be involved in a shootout with Federal employees in order to vent his anger about the government.\n\nThe title of the book alludes to a passage in the Bible, Revelation 6:8: ""And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him."""
Obviously he was an absent father...but what's worse is Laura was an absentee Mother as well!! Shame on them both!

Not sure, but welcome to the USA.
Some of the other answers have good points, but .... What actually started the Vietnam War will always be debateable.\n\nI've studied Vietnam and the Vietnam war for many years, and I continue to find more questions than answers about the war. One thing I can tell you for sure is the war was inevitable, however U.S. involvement was not. \n\nYou can trace reasons why the war started back into the mid-1800's when the French colonized Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos in creating what was then Indochina. Vietnam has a very long history (literally 1,000's of years) fighting against those who had tried to occupy or control their country. Sooner or later, the Vietnamese people would rise up to kick the French out of their country as they have with the Chinese, Japanese and Mongols in the past. \n\nWhen the French failed to keep their promise of independence to Vietnam after WWII, all hell broke loose to say the least. For lack of better words, the U.S. and it's coalition (yes, there were other countries that fought with the U.S. in  Vietnam) became involved to clean up France's mess. This snowballed into a much bigger conflict than the one that France was involved in. \n\nIt could be seen that the Iraq and Vietnam Wars are similar on the surface, but they're actually worlds apart in just about every aspect. To consider these war similar in any way other than coincidential would be due to ignorance and lack of knowledge of either conflict and the countries involved.
Wow, that's a tough one. I'd say that the town is responsible since they are the cause of the big mess but then again, it IS the state of MA and they will do anything to get around a legal loophole. I know, my dad used to work for the state! I'd say check with the city hall and see what they say. If that doesn't help, maybe think about getting a lawyer involved. Either way, I wish you lots of luck! :)
Talking with someone at the embassy would be your first step, but because of the patriot act it may not be all that simple anymore. Try the link below for some help.
We are all little people, without the power to effect the kinds of changes you are proposing.  I would suggest that you take each issue, one step at a time.  First of all, forget the district attorney.  What you would like to see happen will consume all your time and energy.  Put that behind you.  Just remember, what goes around comes around.\n\nThe fact that you have charges against you seems to be the most critical of all.  There is no way to avoid this, so you must have representation that you can trust and who will work for your best interests.  Know that attorneys in general take too many cases, have too many clients, let things go unintentionally, and clients are hurt.  The system is flawed right now.  So don't quit.  Keep looking till you find the right one who really will help you.
Every country is corrupted, no matter what type of government they have; but ours is the least corrupted...I think!!!
Yes, they have nukes. If Iran starts something and uses a nuke on Israel, I'm sure israel would respond with one. BUT, the USA, Russia, England and the UN  would get heavily involved before it ever came to that.

It depends where you live.  In the state of NJ, there is an unfair law that forces the non-custodial parent to pay for  90% of college tuition, whether they can afford to or not.  And they have no say in where the kid goes, if the kid demands an expensive school, the parent is told to just make it happen, even if it ruins their life.  And yes, even if the kid is not even living at home, the custodial parent still gets to soak the non-custodial one for child support, in addition to the college tuition.

They aren't giving you a hard time.  They have specific requirements that are probably spelled out in many of their publications and everyone applying for a license/photo ID needs to abide by the same rules.  Do you have a Voter Registration card?  Are you 18 at least?  Register to vote.  It's a free process and you sign your card and it is proof of residency.  You can pick up a Voter Registration application at most US Post Offices, libraries, or contact the voter registration office in your town.\n\nYou might think about applying for a US Passport.  You submit your passport application along with a copy of your birth certificate and 2 identical photographs.  A passport is a very valid form of ID and can give you that proof you need to get other forms of ID.  You will need 2 forms of ID when you are hired for jobs in the US, too.  Last time I had my passport renewed it was about $50 and it is good for 10 years but it can be used for ID even after it expires.  \n\nYou can pick up a passport application at many Post Office locations, or the process is probably available online by now.
contact the board of attorneys you could explain your case and even get his license revoked.  I would call info to get the number since it varies per state

"According to the information under ""refugee"" status at the www.uscis.gov site,  a refugee is...\n""Under U.S. law, a refugee is a person who has fled his or her country of origin because of past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution based upon race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or a membership in a particular social group. If the person is not in the United States, he or she may apply overseas for inclusion within the U.S. refugee program. If the person is already within the United States, he or she may apply for the U.S. asylum program.""\nYour boyfriend probably applied for refugee status while living in Kenya as a refugee from the war in Sudan.\n Since it sounds, from your comments, like most of his family is in Kenya and that is where he has spent most of the time, he may very likely not have any changes in his status. Per the USCIS site.....\n""Generally, refugees must be outside their homelands to be eligible for the U.S. refugee program, though the U.S. processes application from refugees in their home countries in a few places. (currently, the U.S. has such programs in Cuba, Vietnam, and the former Soviet Union).""   \nI think that a lot of the Cuban nationals living in the US under refugee or asylum categories, do not naturalize but do live here as legal alien residents. \n.  If your boyfriend has refugee status and also has school and work permits, then he has must also have temporary residency status under the label of refugee. I don't think that acquiring US citizenship is a necessity or requirement. In fact, on that same site, there is a section listing the steps and requirements for an\nAsylee or Refugee Seeking Lawful Permanent Residence (Form I-485). (There is also a processing timetable available.)\n  Also, regarding his ability to travel home for family emergency, \nhe hopefully filed a form I-131 (Application for Travel Document).\nPer the USCIS site, \n""While your I-485 is pending, you are permitted to travel outside the U.S.; however you must have a valid Refugee Travel Document to reenter the country.

The parents should have gotten a lecture on teaching their daughter. The daughter should have gotten a lecture on not running into the street. And the man should have gotten a lecture on smartening up in our lawsuit and sex-crime crazed society.

The answer is yes. Anything the president does from now until the end of his term will be pounced upon by his detractors in an effort to demoralize and discredit. Anything that happens in Iraq that either is negative or can be spun in a negative view, likewise.\n\nAs long we have to deal with the Ted Kennedys and Hillary Clintons of this world, people will continue to misunderstand the events going on around them, because they will be listening to campaigns of misinformation.\n\nOne example is the person who answered saying that the American people were told that the war would be over in less than a year. The truth is that major combat operations were over in far less than a year, but then terrorist, jihadist, anti-American insurgents began their campaign of murder and quasi-organized crime (such as kidnappings for ransom). See, people listen to the liberal, far-left media and other whining sources, and come to believe that Bush lied - instead of what really happened, which is that he was talking about major operations (force-on-force maneuvering at the division-element level), which really was over in less than a year.\n\nThe same people who spread the misinformation in the first place will be the first ones to blow the whistle when their nonsense doesn't pan out.

No. Besides the fact that, unfortunately, people who hate America are dispersed throughout the world, the earth's orbit is dependent on its momentum. Since momentum is mass x velocity and we are all part of that mass whether we're jumping or not, the momentum and therefore, the orbit, will not change.
When a government bans a terrorist organisation all the assets, and bank accounts of its recognised and known members are frozen by the particular government. This restricts the availability of cash to them and other countries too start banning them.
Yes, and if Americans don't find a way to deal with it, violence, and civil war are just around the corner, right here on American soil.
Global warming is the observed increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans in recent decades. (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/global%20warming ). It is mostly man-made and comes from everything from factories to cars. (http://www.epa.gov/ebtpages/airairpoglobalwarming.html )Almost every single real scientific study links global warming directly to humans.\n\nIt's only certain political figures that don't want to change for reasons easily guessable. That is why the whole developed world signed that Kyoto Treaty and why every single developed country is working to reduce their polluting of the air, water, and land. \n\nSee the new Gore movie, it has the backing of the scientific AND POLITICAL groups: \n\nScientific community: http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/200...\n\nGovernment Groups:\n\nNOAA (National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration) on why Peer-Reviewed Journals are the only real scientific studies to be believed: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/globalwar...\n\nThe EPA's site for KIDS: http://www.epa.gov/globalwarming/kids/in...\n\nFrom NASA:\nhttp://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/library...\n\nThe Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program is an important part of the U.S. Department of Energy's strategy to understand global climate change:\nhttp://education.arm.gov/studyhall/warmi...\n\nhttp://globalchange.gov/\nhttp://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/climate.s...\nhttp://marine.usgs.gov/cgi-bin/locator?s...\nhttp://www.usaid.gov/our_work/environmen...\nhttp://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/globalwarming.html\n\nAll of the above are .gov sites.\n\nEdit: \n\nNotice how the person below me offers no evidence what-so-ever.  That is exactly what is holding us back in taking real steps in fixing this very easily fixable problem.  All people like this due is try to poke holes in something that is already rock-solid in ALL REAL SCIENTIFIC (GOVERNMENT) COMMUNITIES. Hollywood, Gore, or anyone else who has made this up.  It is our own government organizations, working separately, that have all come to the same conclusion.  The people who don't believe offer nothing but opinions and fake studies done by non-governmental - or none-peer reviews - organizations.\n\nIt is a real problem that can be fixed with easy measures.

Under the Commercial Statutes adopted by most states (UCC) every good sold by a merchant includes an implied (not written) law of merchantability (unless validly disclaimed). This means that the car you bought should be fit for its ordinary purpose (driving on a day to day basis). This is a basis for replacement of the car in and of itself. \n\nOn top of that you have an express 3 year warranty that they must honor. If the dealer cannot fix the problem after three attempts (generally) this is the reasonable amount of attempts the dealership should have to fix the car before you force the manufacturer to honor the express warranty by replacing the car. It may take a demand letter or even a lawsuit filed by an attorney before they know you mean business about enforcing the express warranty.
I know they found only one passport at the WTC.About the rest of the passports I have no idea ...
i think president bush's administration  is under pressure of israel zionists.\nhamas is making decision on its own and it has won the heart of the people of the region.
I doubt that, there's people out there right now building the thing and they're doing it with their own sweat, own money(because Bush, 'the guy that can't say 'no', won't say 'no mas' to Mexico), but in fairness the southern states are taking matters into their own hands and getting with the program, too. The sooner people quit bitching and start pitching in to actually solve the problems we're currently having with Mexico, the sooner we can go back to having an open border, but not before. ...
"There is no such thing as an ""undocumented"" permanent legal resident.  All permanent legal residents are documented."
I'd like to think not, but I don't trust anything they do or say anymore.  I held off on believing it was actually Zarqawi until there was a ton of evidence.   \n\nIt's sad, but they've lied so many times that they're going to have to have a TON of evidence before I believe it was an honest threat.\n\nLet's face facts, Karl Rove is back, and suddenly, we're going to be attacked.  While he was in hiding over his treasonous acts, you'll note that nothing like this EVER came out.  He comes back, and here we go again!
I don't understand your question. But, the USA treasurer and president and congress say how much money should be printed. Just the other say, US dollars is worth the same as Canadian dollars. We are printing too much money.
It means that the editor of the Times showed his arrogance by ignoring the laws of the land.  He published information during a time of war that will aid enemies of this country.\n\nHe is an elitist as he believes that the press is above the law and can do whatever they want, regardless of the implications on us.\n\nThe left wing agenda is the propensity for this type of thing to happen again and again, led by the left-wing media of this country.
Of course he is a racist. Don't you know that he ordered the city of  New Orleans to be flooded in order to get all the black people out of the city? He knew that many of these people would have no place to go and that they would have no choice but to join the military, which is why he personally sent hundreds of Army recruiters to the Astrodome and other shelters around the US.  He figured he could kill two birds with one stone, get rid of the poor black people and keep his blood thirsty drive for world domination alive at the same  time!!  \nBy the way, is anybody interested in buying some prime ocean front real estate in Arizona or New Mexico??
Clinton was a  genius compared to GW.  He left his Presidency with such a high surplus....and Bush has pissed it all away + spent so much that your grandkids are going to pay for it....\n\n$500 TRILLION in Iraq....who's paying for it?
Mexican officials are no nore or less corrupt than American officials... they're just up front about it.
They have no legitimate argument, if we are talking about the Bush failures they blame it on Clinton, If we are talking about the criminal acts of Bush they mention Clinton, and when they run out of thing to blame on Clinton they then go to name calling and since unamerican is suppose to mean that we do not believe the conservatives are right then they use that. They probably think that Clinton was unamerican because he ran the country the way it should be run
We aren't in the least bit freindly with Cuba, but if you want em, you go get em. Traitor is right. Watch out for this guy, he insulted my family because they were in Vietnam. He was there too, but that doesn't matter to this ABUSER.

"i'd like to THINK intellectual, since my athletic skills are truly pathetic...  but, it's most likely NEITHER.  \n\ndoes ""nice guy"" count for anything?"
LexisNexis or WestLaw....they are both services you have to pay for. Otherwise, you can try FindLaw.... or you can go dig up the Florida case publishings. \n\nhttp://www.lexisnexis.com\nhttp://www.westlaw.com\nhttp://www.findlaw.com

There are good and bad cops..but all in all they are mostly good and we need them and I'm glad we have them..maybe if they weren't so underpaid we'd have more of them.

yes, and you also have the right to deport them.
no, it makes me not like them
Your question makes no sense.
When your driver's license comes up for renewal, correct the name to the new spelling. Then use that one change to justify changes on other government pieces of ID. Eventually you can have your nae legally changed on everything but the birth certificate.
"You raise a very good point. Part of the problem, IMHO, is that the Dems attempt to embrace a wider spectrum of the population than the Reps do (these days). Its hard to streamline so many interests.\n\nPart of the problem is that hard core elements dominate either party, which make them less appealing to ""moderates."" This is reflected in the mistaken rhetoric that one is either a conservative or a liberal. I have views that some consider ""liberal,"" but support the death penalty and own several firearms, for instance. \n\nIn the last election, the Democrats ran a Liberal senator from a Liberal state against a moron with whom enough red-necks and Bible thumpers connected to eke out a win. Bush could have been defeated. All the Dems needed was a candidate who actually came out and stood for something. I wanted to like Kerry, but he lacked charisma and he seemed to say whatever he thought was politically advantageous. Unfortunately, the neo-fascists, um, neo-cons, were able to seize on that indecisiveness as what the country doesn't need in a time of ""war"" (of Bushie's own making). Result: the guy who actually fought in a war was deemed a weakling/coward/liar; while the coke-snorting deserter was ""The War President"" (again, in a war of his own making). That the Democratic Party has allowed itself to be portrayed as God-less and soft on ""terrorism"" and national defense is a flat-out disgrace. They deserved to lose because they lacked the guts to run a candidate with strong convictions and a voting record to back them.\n\nRight now, Obama looks like a candidate who could appeal to a broad spectrum of our increasingly diverse population. But, unless the DemoCommunist extremists drop their efforts to disarm the populace (and thereby rendering us defenseless against enemies from within and without), and to make us a socialist nation by lavishing benefits upon everyone it'll be hard to vote for one."
"Laws are meant to establish social paradigms of conduct. Sociology states that it is impossible for every individual to behave according to standarts in a society. In simple words, there will always be someone who will break the law, or behave incorrectly. Marijuana, if used moderately and according to the ""correct"" standarts (medicine for example), is harmless, but since it is impossible for every individual to follow the same path of correct behavior, we conclude that there would always be misuses of marijuana...and there's where laws enter...to ensure that a majority behaves well. \n\nAlso...laws are always broken...if you abolish a law that is broken so often, you would only increase that illegal conduct."
The 23rd amendment.  It was first used in the 1964 election.
"George Bush illegally and unconstitutionally invaded another sovereign nation for only two resons: 1) He wanted to 'get even' with Saddam Husseing for humiliating his daddy during Desert Storm, and 2) Big Dick Cheney wants oil that oil that' swimming underneath Iraq's sands. Until he has a rock-solid, iron-clad arrangements in place, NO TROOPS WILL BE WITHDRAWN FROM IRAQ. After all, Cheney's buddies at Halliburton and Exxon-Mobil need to get richer and richer and richer.\n\nBush, Cheney and Rumsfeld are the most evil, corrupt, and incompetent morons ever to occupy the White House. The current U.S. Congress is the most evil, corrupt and incompetent body ever to occupy the Capitol Building.\n\nThese people all deserve to be impeached or tried for high treason. If convicted, tehy deserve to face a public firing squad.\n\nCheck out the new blog - BUSHWACKER!\nwww.blogger.com\nhttp://al-aback.blogspot.com\n\nCertainly Satan has reserved a special oil-soaked corner of Hell for Bush, Cheny and Rumsfeld where they can spend their eternal damnation blaming each other for destroying the Earth.\nBush has not done ONE productive thing since he stole the last two elections. However, he has:\n\n1. Massacred tens of thousands of Iraq's citizens and 2,500 U.S. soldiers;\n2. Turned America into a police state where his billion-dollar boondoggle, Homeland Security, considers everyone guilty until proven innocent;\n3. Tarnished America's reputation as a global leader and worldwide peacekeeper;\n4. Contributed to the demise of the Earth through failed environmental and ecological policies;\n5. Virtually eliminated the American middle class to a point where, within a generation, the U.S. will be a two-tiered society like Haiti and the Dominican Republic: there will be the very, very rich (Bush's buddies) and (the rest of us) the very, very poor;\n6. Put the USA trillions of dollars into debt, which will take generations to pay off (if it ever can);\n7. Neglected the poor, the sick, the aged, the disabled, the hungry and the disadvantaged in America;\n8. Greedily played ""Robin Hood in Reverse"" by taking from the poor and giving to his rich friends, special interest groups, lobbyists, and mega-corporations who in turn make generous (if not illegal) campaign contributions to the GOP;\n9. Given every other country in the world reason to fear us and a motivation to build their own nuclear weapons with which to protect themselves from the new ""evil empire"", the USA;\n10. Tortured ""prisoners"", most of whom are being held without legitimate charges, and most of whom are being tortured outside of the rules of the Geneva Convention.\n\nThomas Jefferson once said: 'The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants."" That time is way past due. It's time for a new American Revolution that will completely demolish the Republican and Democratic parties and eliminate the stranglehold these wicked power brokers have on American politics."
Gerald,\n\nThat's easy.  You!
