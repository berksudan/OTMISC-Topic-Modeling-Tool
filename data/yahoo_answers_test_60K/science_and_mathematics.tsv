Dogs don't think that way. You're projecting human thought patterns and behaviours onto animals, and that's simply not how their mind works. I read a great article about a month ago (I forget where) about an animal psychologist talking about this sort of thing, how a lot of problems with pets are caused by thinking about them in human terms. For example, one woman's dog started causing havok when she got a full-time job and left him home in the house. She thought he was angry at her, but that's not something dogs could even comprehend. No, it was rather that the dog was simply very confused and didn't understand what was going on, and figuring this out saved the dog from having to be put down (he almost bit someone).\n\nBasically, no. Chimpanzees and other such evolutionary cousins might, but your common house pets cannot think that way.
"Yes, the Universe is flat. It's a VERY difficult thing for most people to wrap their head around. You're Correct.\nJust because you see a round ball, does not necessitate the ball being round. I think the real question is...""Why can't we see it"" Einstein said that Reality is a thin, yet persistant veil. Good Luck."
Some cancers are more prone to metastasis to the bones than others.  Blood supply is an issue in transporting the cells, but the chemical environment of the bones also plays a part.  See the references below:
It's because sunlight striking air molecules is scattered in all directions.
It flows North (odd, huh?), so it empties into the Bering Sea.
According to the Theory of Relativity it depends on you point of reference.
The absorption minimum for water is at 420 nm, well within the blue range of the visual spectrum. This means that that is the wavelength of light that it reflects the most. It does not reflect it very much, so small amounts appear transparent.
Both murcery and jupiter are often mistaken for such an event.\n\nOn rare occasions during the clearnes of the night, saturn can be seen quite nicely and is oft mistaken by those using telescops.
Gas mileage is usually worse in the cold weather. In the cold weather your tire pressure is lower and causes more friction with the ground. \n\nAlso the type of gasoline you put in your car is different in the summer and winter. Summer fuel is required to have a lower RVP, to mitigate evaporative emissions caused by higher temperatures. It is literally heavier, with more chemical bonds in the fuel molecules... more bonds to break = higher energy content = better MPG.\n\nAnd finally your car also faces more friction driving through cold air because the colder the air is the more dense it is.
The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air.\n\nHowever, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue.
Contrary to popular belief, salt does not react with ice to make water. Instead, since salt can be soluble in water, it lowers the freezing point to about 0 degrees Farenheit. So as long as it is above 0 degrees outside, salt water won't freeze on the roads.
"Here's the issue:  The finite mind has no hope of apprehending the infinite.  We can define space ""\n\nMathematics. A set of elements or points satisfying specified geometric postulates: non-Euclidean space. \nThe infinite extension of the three-dimensional region in which all matter exists. \n\nThe expanse in which the solar system, stars, and galaxies exist; the universe. \nThe region of this expanse beyond Earth's atmosphere. \n\nAn extent or expanse of a surface or three-dimensional area: Water covered a large space at the end of the valley. \nA blank or empty area: the spaces between words. \nAn area provided for a particular purpose: a parking space. \nReserved or available accommodation on a public transportation vehicle. \n\nA period or interval of time. \nA little while: Let's rest for a space. \nSufficient freedom from external pressure to develop or explore one's needs, interests, and individuality: “The need for personal space inevitably asserts itself” (Maggie Scarf). \nMusic. One of the intervals between the lines of a staff. \nPrinting. One of the blank pieces of type or other means used for separating words or characters. \nOne of the intervals during the telegraphic transmission of a message when the key is open or not in contact. \nBlank sections in printed material or broadcast time available for use by advertisers.""\n\nThis is a defineable term because the finite mind percieves it as a finite entity with physical properties.  Space has a potential to either be filled or be empty.  Infinity cannot be bounded thus because it is unboundable and therefor indefineable.  If you were to ask is the universe infinite one could only, thoughtfully, respond ""No"".  This conclusion will be arrived at when the respondant considers that the universe has a definition applied to it and therefore a value that can be discussed and modeled.  You can discuss what is out side the universe, when the universe was created, etc.  Not so with infinity.  Infinity, as best I can discuss it (which is not very well as I am a finite being), is simultaneously all things existing and all things never existing.  The base problem with my definition is that ""things"" and ""existence"" are finite concepts fitting within the bounds of perception.  Infinity must be something other than that.  Are you beginning to see the issues with a discussion of infinity?  Try this one, ""Infinity is all unthings non-existing"".  that's the closest I can get.  Give it a shot.  But recognize that anything within the perceivable physical reality isn't infinite."
It actually depends on the animal!\n\nThe eye consists of Rods and Cones.  Rods handle detail.  They are the most sensitive. That is why cats can see intricate detail, such as the predicted direction of the jumping of a mouse due to muscle twitches, than to if the mouse is white, black or orange.  Cones handle colors.\n\nSee the source for better definition\n\nOn a side note... visible light is just a small part of the electomagnetic spectrum.  Some animals can see infrared, but are blind to purples, while others cant see red, but see ultraviolet light!
There are many carcinogens (cancer causing chemicals). The source below has a list. Besides chemicals, sun exposure, especially staying in the sun until burning is the leading cause of skin cancer. Chewing tobacco causes throat and mouth cancer. Exposure to radiation of a variety of sorts causes system-wide cancers. Human pappillomavirus causes cervical cancer.\n\nBeyond direct causes, there are many genetic predispositions that can make it more possible to have cancer. Basically, there are thousands of different things that can cause cancer. The site below has more information.
It is caused when you go from dim light to very bright light and your pupils are not able to reduce in time to cope with this extra light. In order that this light wont burn your retinas your body forces your eyes closed by making you sneeze. This commonly happens when you go from your reasonably dark lit house out onto a sunny street or if you turn on your beside lamp in the dark.
Earth has become an exothermal radio planet only a little over a century ago. Anyone who might listen in will take some time to make any sense of the increased radio activity, then could answer the same way. So far we can be fairly sure that noone within some 50 lightyears has answered.
Answer 3.\n\nThe number of x-ray events is directly dependent on the mA setting - each electron will cause an x-ray quant as it is decelerated.\n\nHigher kVp will make the x-rays more energetic, i.e. less likely to interact with light elements on their way to the film.\n\nLow atomic number means that only softer radiation can be absorbed by the atom, creating less of a white shadow on the film.
"The name Betelgeuse is a corruption of the Arabic ""yad al jauza,"" which means the ""hand of al-jauza,"" al-jauza the ancient Arabs' ""Central One,"" a mysterious woman.\nAnother theory is Betelguese and the related names derive from the Arabic phrase Ibt al Jauzah meaning ""The Armpit of the Central One"".  The designation Al Mankib means in Arabic ""The Shoulder"". \nSee second reference for diagram:"
There’s a New Minimum Efficiency Standard for 2006\nLike many consumer products that use energy, air conditioners and heat pumps are manufactured to meet or exceed minimum efficiency standards set by the U.S. Department of Energy. For nearly a decade, that minimum has been 10 SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio). On January 23, 2006, the minimum will jump to 13 SEER, a 30% increase over the current standard.
"ER docs get paid slightly above average in comparison to other doctors.  However, they work shorter hours than most physicians and generally do not have to take ""call"" (in other words, once they are off work, they are off work).  They do not have to know everything, if you are comparing to doctors in other fields.  (All physicians have to know a little about every field, but no doctor knows everything about every field).  They just need to know how to recognize a wide variety of conditions that present in the ER, and know when to refer a patient to a specialist.\n\nThis is not to downplay the level of knowledge that ER docs have in comparison to other physicians.  ER docs often do well in their medical school class.  But there are other fields that are more competitive and are generally paid more (such as neurosurgery, cardiothoracic surgery, and orthopedic surgery)\n\nIn general, doctors working in a hospital are not paid as well as doctors in private practice.  Many, many people are treated at the hospital without health insurance (it would be unethical to turn them away).  This leaves hospitals cramped for money, so other patients' bills go up and doctors salaries go down, despite what the general public may think.\n\nAlso, when people discuss physician salaries, they often forget to factor in malpractice insurance, which has bankrupt and put many doctors out of business.  ...and yet so many people still want to sue doctors because they think they earn a lot of money."

"There are, of course, different ways to define ""worst"". It could be the most property damage, most loss of life, most powerful at its focus (the actual origin of the quake), or most powerful at its epicenter (the place on the Earth directly above the focus).\n\nPrior to recent times, no one had accurate instruments to measure energy released in an earthquake, and no one kept accurate records of damage.

"I don't think so.\n\nFor one thing, even if one could transfer the genetic materials correctly, there is no way a human could have the ""proportional strength of a spider"" or ant or anything like that. The physical nature of muscules will not scale up like that. The strongest one could get is, well, as strong as the strongest human, whoever that is.\n\nThe web material seems fictional as well. For one thing, what sort of glad (or tiny device) could generate so much material without either (1) lots of refills, (2) a huge tank."
Vacuoles are membrane-bound sacs within the cytoplasm of a cell that function in several different ways. In mature plant cells, vacuoles tend to be very large and are extremely important in providing structural support, as well as serving functions such as storage, waste disposal, protection, and growth. Many plant cells have a large, single central vacuole that typically takes up most of the room in the cell (80 percent or more). Vacuoles in animal cells, however, tend to be much smaller, and are more commonly used to temporarily store materials or to transport substances.
Each gas has a unique set of spectral lines that serves as a spectroscopic fingerprint.  These lines, incidentally, are created through transitions of electrons from high energy states to low energy states; each transition has a unique amount of energy associated with it which translates to a photon of a particular wavelength.  Helium was discovered by subtracting out all the spectral absorption lines associated with known elements from the solar emmision spectrum, similar to the way an audio technician can enhance a vocal track by subtracting instrumental tracks one at a time.  Hope that helps!
The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through.

Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue. \nAs you look closer to the horizon, the sky appears much paler in color. To reach you, the scattered blue light must pass through more air. Some of it gets scattered away again in other directions. Less blue light reaches your eyes. The color of the sky near the horizon appears paler or white.
"I think that an advanced biotechnology might be able to copy the human model, but it would be a lot more complicated to genetically engineer and produce not only the humans but all the rest of the living organisms on earth.\n\nThink of it: if you wanted to colonize a planet, would you engineer a species like ours, or would you make adaptations to your own species?\n\nTerry Pratchett's novel ""Strata"" tells of world builders who create entire planets complete with faked pre-history. And spoofs the idea..."
The answer is simple: we travel through time constantly.  Is it possible to travel backwards?  Science does not currently know the answer. Travelling backwards would entail travel at speeds greater than c (the speed of light).  But it is a fact that to move any body from rest to that speed requires an infinite amount of energy, which does not exist.  So, the only option is to use a particle which ALWAYS travels faster than c.  This particle is called a tachyon, as predicted by M-Theory, but whether or not such a particle exists is currently speculative.  The tachyon has a negative mass, travels at velocities greater than c, and travels in the opposite direction of time as we do.
"The same reason nothing you ever observe is affected by the earth revolving.  It's moving at a constant velocity, meaning there is no acceleration and therefore no force (F=ma).  Force is what you feel, which is why you feel pushed toward the back seat of a car when you are accelerating (speeding up) but you don't feel it when you're moving constantly.  Like, in a vehicle, if you throw up a ball, it will come right straight down because if the car is moving at 50 mph, it, you, and the car are all moving at 50 mph.  The bird, us, the air, the tree, the worm.. everything's moving at the velocity of the earth so it is considered ""at rest"" because it is our frame of reference."

"The answer is that the Moon's period of revolution (one orbit around the Earth) is the same as the Moon's period or rotation (one spin around it's axis). The result is that the Moon always keeps on side facing the Earth.\n\nThis phenomena is called ""tidal locking"" and occurs because, while the Moon generates tides in the Earth, the Earth also generates a tide in the Moon (in the solid rock). The Moon's tidal budge moves as the Moon rotates. The energy for this, and the gravitational effects from the distortion, lead to a braking effect. The Moon slows down its rotation until it is such that the buldge is on one side always faces the Earth.  Now the tidal bulge is stationary (facing the Earth) and no more braking occurs. \n\nThis is also related to why there are lot more Lunar Mare on the near side than the far side. The Moon's core is shifted slightly towards the Earth, so it was easier for lava seas to form on the near side.\n\nMany other satellites are tidally locked to their planet. Mercury is almost tidally locked to the Sun."

"A black hole is a concentration of mass great enough that the force of gravity prevents anything from escaping it except through quantum tunneling behavior (known as Hawking Radiation). The gravitational field is so strong that the escape velocity near it exceeds the speed of light. This implies that nothing, not even light, can escape its gravity, hence the word ""black"". The term ""black hole"" is widespread, even though it does not refer to a hole in the usual sense, but rather a region of space from which nothing can return."

To incribe a regular quadrilateral (ie sqare) into a circle with only a compass and straight edge do the following:\n\n1. Draw a circle. Label the center A.\n\n2. Draw a diameter of the circle by placing your straight edge on the center of the circle. Label the points where the diameter intersects the circle as B and C.\n\n3. Set your compass to a wider amount than you used to draw your circle.\n\n4. Without adjusting your compass, draw a circle with B as the center.  \n\n5. Without adjusting your compass, draw another circle with C as the center. \n\n6. Your two new circles will intersect at two points. Use your straight edge to draw a line through these two points.\n\n7. This new line will intersect the original circle at two points. Label those points as D and E. \n\n8. B, C, D, and E are the corners of your inscribed square. You can use your straight edge to draw the edges of the square.\n\nReason this works:\n\nIn steps 4 through 6, you contructed the perpendicular bisector to the diameter of the original circle.\n \nThis means that segment DE is a diameter of the orignal circle (since it passes through the center of the circle). This also means segment BC and DE form a right angle. \n\nIf you look at triangles BAD and DAC; BA, AD, AC are all radii of the original circle (and thus the same length). Therefore the triangles are exact copies of each other and BD and DC are the same legth. This logic will show you that all the sides are the same length.\n\nAngle DBE inscribes one half of the original circle since DE is the diameter of the circle. This makes DBE a right angle. Similar logic will show you all angles of your square are right angles. \n\nSince your sqare has all equal sides and all equal angles, it is a square.
For goodness sakes, do a search before asking a question. This quesion has been asked and answered at least 70 times before. Don't believe me, look at the link below.
It is supposed to make perfect sense. Number of ways to arrange 0 things is 1, since there are only one way, doing nothing.\nNot only that, this works nicely when you work with combination. There is also a generalization of factorial in real numbers, and you can also get 0!=1 from the new definition of factorial in real numbers.
"the formulas it seems your looking for are:\n\np=mv=J=Ft  where p, v, and t actually have a the symbol delta in front of them meaning ""change in""\n\np is momentum which equals mass times the change in velocity and J is impulse which equals force x time.  Because the change in momentum is equal to the impulse, you can usually set mv=Ft.  You should be given the mass and velocity, and either force or the change in time(duration) in order to solve for the other one.  If the question is asking for both, then you probably have to find force first in some other way, then use that formula.  If you need to find the force in some other way, just think about all of Newton's laws and stuff that you've learned and use them with the rest of the information that the problem gives you, and you should be able to come up with something... if not, post the whole question here and ill try to help :)"

Crude oil is formed from accumulations of small organisms, mostly phytoplankton and zooplanton that are buried in sediments in both marine and lacustrine (fresh water) environments. Other organic material is mixed in such as spores, pollen, woody material, and other material such as fecal pellets from marine organisms. These materials often settle through the water into an organic-rich mud that is very low in oxygen (anaerobic) so there are few organisms to feed on the material  and it accumulates over long periods of time. Rivers contribute to this process by both delivering large quantities of organic matter, and also large amounts of sediment to bury this organic matter. \n\nOver time these clay-rich sediments are buried under thousands of feet of sediments, dewatered by pressure from the overlying sediment and become shale. As the shale is buried its temperature increases due to geothermal warming. When it reaches temperatures and pressures of 140 degrees F. (60 C) it begins to convert to oil. As temperature increases from continuing burial processes it reachs a temperature where it begins to form natural gas. Both the oil and the gas are gradually expelled from the shale. Typically shales are found in depostional settings where they may be interbedded with sandstones. Sandstones will have higher porosity (more and bigger holes) than shale and the oil and gas will displace salt water that is remaining in the sandstones. Eventually the oil and gas migrates upward through the water and if the overlying structure has formed some sort of a trapping configuration, (like a sandstone overlain by an impervious shale, or a fault that has created a seal against the sandstone, then this becomes an oil reservoir. \n\nA very similar process occurs in carbonate rocks, like limestone and dolomite, except the organic material originates within the carbonate rock in many instances. If the carbonate reef (for example) has been buried by an impervious layer of shale or carbonate mud of a sabkha, it  will become an oil reservoir.  In other instances, the source of the oil will be a shale that is below the carbonate rocks, and the oil will migrate upward into this reservoir.

I am going to assume you mean the distance between the Earth and Sun. The average distance is 92,955,807 miles or 1 AU(astronomical unit). \n\nThe earth orbit is not in a perfect circle it is an elliptical orbit so the sun varies in distance. On December 21 the sun will be apx 91,096,690 miles from the earth and on June 21 the sun will be at a distance of apx 94814923 miles from the earth.
35% of 35 active hives is 35 x 0.35 = 12.25 hives. So if the number of active hives have decreased by 12.25 hives, then the remaining number of active hives is 35 - 12.25 = 22.75 hives. \n\nIt may not be possible to have a partial number of hives, in which case we might say that most likely 23 hives remain (this corresponds to a 34.3% drop in bee population as opposed to 37.1% drop had the number of hives fallen to 22).
Sweet tastes good because sweetness in fruit is an indicator of ripeness, and ripe fruit is the most nutritious.  So, once upon a time, a sweet tooth was an evolutionary advantage -- those who enjoyed sweetness sought out the most ripe fruit and had the healthiest diets.  With healthier diets, they survived the longest and passed their genes on to the most offspring. \n\nIronic.  Our appreciation for sugar is actually rooted in good nutrition.\n\nToday, we have extracted sugar from fruit, and for a human being it is no longer conducive to a healthy diet.  In fact, our craving for sugar now has the opposite effect.

"It probably costs about 10 cents per kilowatt-hour to run a PC 24/7, depending where you live.  Most electronic gear is labeled with the power requirements in watts.  Just multiply that by 24 to get the watts per day and divide by 1,000 to get kilowatts.  For example, a 100 watt load times one hour equals 100 watt-hours and multiplied by 24 hours equals 2,400 watt-hours per day.  Dividing 2,400 watt-hours by 1,000 equals 2.4 KW-hours (kilowatt-hours) per day.  This would cost 2.4 time 10 cents or about 24 cents.  Of course, the PC and the monitor each need to be calculated separately.  Also, if the PC is not in constant use it may go into ""sleep mode"" reducing the power drain.  I read that some people never shut off their PC's because re-starting them may subject the chips to frequent power surges reducing chip life.

"SURFACE AREA\n\n\nSurface area is the area of a given surface. Roughly speaking, it is the ""amount"" of a surface (i.e., it is proportional to the amount of paint needed to cover it), and has units of distance squared. Surface area is commonly denoted  for a surface in three dimensions, or  for a region of the plane (in which case it is simply called ""the"" area). \n\n\n\n\nSurface area refers to the summation of the areas of the exposed sides of an object.\n\nUnits\nUnits for measuring surface area include:\n\nsquare metre = SI derived unit \nare = 100 square metres \nhectare = 10,000 square metres \nsquare kilometre = 1,000,000 square metres \nsquare megametre = 1012 square metres \nImperial units, as currently defined from the metre:\n\nsquare foot (plural square feet) = 0.09290304 square metres. \nsquare yard = 9 square feet = 0.83612736 square metres \nsquare perch = 30.25 square yards = 25.2928526 square metres \nacre = 160 square perches or 43,560 square feet = 4046.8564224 square metres \nsquare mile = 640 acres = 2.5899881103 square kilometres \nThe article Orders of magnitude links to lists of objects of comparable surface area.\n\n\nUseful formulae\nArea of a rectangle (and, in particular, a square): length × width \nArea of a triangle: ½ × base × height \nArea of a disk: π × r² \nArea of a sphere: 4 × π × r² \nTotal surface area of a right circular cylinder: 2 × π × r × (h + r) \nLateral surface area of a right circular cylinder: 2 × π × r × h \nTotal surface area of a right circular cone: π × r × (l + r) \nLateral surface area of a right circular cone: π × r × l"
Yes, there should be a weak connection between phases of the moon and earthquakes or volcanoes.  Both earthquakes and emerging volcanoes depend on growing stress within the earth.  The moon can raise tides both in the crust of the earth and the oceans, affecting weight of water over portions of the earth.  The moon tide can serve as the straw that breaks the camel's back causing an event to happen slightly sooner than it would anyway.  Of course phases of the moon deal with the reflection of the sun's light relative to the positions of the sun, moon and earth.  Because the ocean tides (and crustal tides) also depend on these same positions where the sun either works with or against the moon), the phase of the moon can slightly affect the weight of the straw that breaks the camel's back.

It's important to get this checked out by an eye doctor. Sometimes people get floaters and it's not big deal, sometimes they go away, sometimes not, and it's not harmful. Other times, it can be a sign of something more serious. If you see any flashes of light, go immediately to a doctor (might even be cause to go to an emergency room) because that is a sign of a detaching retina (which can make you blind). In other cases, the floaters can be caused by something called neovascularization, which means new blood vessels forming in the eye. This really shouldn't happen, and can be corrected with lasers. I'm told it's not very uncomfortable. If you are diabetic,  this is a risk.\n\nSome causes of floaters that I am aware of: neovascularization causing distortions because the new blood vessels may cause a blind spot on the retina (laser treatment is a possibility); a small bleed in the vitreous that casts a shadow on the retina (may resolve in time, but needs to be checked still); the vitrous can pull away from the retina as a person ages, sometimes leaving a bit of debris, more common in people who are myopic (may resolve in time, not much to be done about it, but needs to be checked to make sure there isn't traction pulling on the retina, which can cause a detached retina).\n\nIn any case, just get it checked out right away. If there is a problem, it can probably be treated before it gets worse. Better sooner than later. Good luck.

You know what you are asking here can't reallly be answered. The reason ATP is the main energy source is because that's what happened through the process of evolution. And, as you know, there is no way to determine WHY something happened when it comes to evolution -- despite what the intelligent design advocates will tell you. All you can say, based on the ubiquitious nature of ATP's usage as the main energy carrier throughout most living organisms, is that ATP became the preferred energy carrier very early on in evolutionary time. Probably going back as far as the last universal common ancestor (LUCA).

"""Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931) was an inventor and businessman who developed many important devices. ""The Wizard of Menlo Park"" was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production to the process of invention. Edison is considered the most prolific inventor, holding 1,093 patents in his name. Some of these inventions were not completely original but improvements of earlier patents (most famously the Light Bulb), and were actually works of his numerous employees. Edison was sometimes criticized for not sharing the credit, but it was understood by his experimenters that all work was the property of their employer. Nevertheless, Edison received patents worldwide, including the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Edison started the Motion Picture Patents Company, which was a conglomerate of nine major film studios (commonly known as the Edison Trust)."""

Sinclair was born in Baltimore, but his family moved to New York when he was a child. When he was a teenager he began writing brief bits for newspapers and magazines. The Jungle was his sixth novel, and its success made him nationally famous. An exposé of the Chicago meatpacking industry, the book helped change national regulations on food preparation and earned him enough money to establish the Helicon Home Colony, a socialist community in New Jersey. Although the community only lasted about a year (it burned down in 1907), Sinclair remained committed to social causes and to exposing the dangerous effects of capitalism in realistic fiction, essays and various other writings. In 1915 he moved to California, where he ran unsuccessfully for public office several times, including running for governor as a Democrat in 1934. In the 1940s Sinclair again had popular success with the ""Lanny Budd"" series of novels, beginning with World's End (1940) and including the Pulitzer Prize-winning Dragon's Teeth (1942). In 1953 Sinclair moved to Arizona, where he continued to write books, including working his 1932 autobiography, American Outpost, into The Autobiography of Upton Sinclair (1962).\n\nHe is not related to Canadian broadcaster Gordon Sinclair.\n\nFOUR GOOD LINKS\n\n    * Upton Sinclair\n      Good general summary of his career\n    * The California EPIC Movement, 1934\n      Historical pieces about Sinclair's bid for governor\n    * Upton Sinclair\n      Letters from Jack London and the text of The Jungle\n    * Upton Sinclair\n      Hyperlinked biographical essay"

"A Nonlinear Program (NLP) is a problem that can be put into the form\n\n    minimize   F(x)\n\n    subject to gi(x)  = 0    for i = 1, ..., m1       where m1 >= 0\n               hj(x) >= 0    for j = m1+1, ..., m     where m >= m1\n\nThat is, there is one scalar-valued function F, of several variables (x here is a vector), that we seek to minimize subject (perhaps) to one or more other such functions that serve to limit or define the values of these variables. F is called the ""objective function"", while the various other functions are called the ""constraints"". (If maximization is sought, it is trivial to do so, by multiplying F by -1.)\n\nBecause NLP is a difficult field, researchers have identified special cases for study. A particularly well studied case is the one where all the constraints g and h are linear. The name for such a problem, unsurprisingly, is ""linearly constrained optimization"". If, as well, the objective function is quadratic at most, this problem is called Quadratic Programming (QP). An even more special case of great importance is where the objective function and the constraints are entirely linear; this is called Linear Programming (LP) and is discussed in a separate FAQ list. Another important special case, called unconstrained optimization, is where there are no constraints at all.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges in NLP is that some problems exhibit ""local optima""; that is, spurious solutions that merely satisfy the requirements on the derivatives of the functions. Think of a near-sighted mountain climber in a terrain with multiple peaks, and you'll see the difficulty posed for an algorithm that tries to move from point to point only by climbing uphill. Algorithms that propose to overcome this difficulty are termed ""Global Optimization"".\n\nThe word ""Programming"" is used here in the sense of ""planning""; the necessary relationship to computer programming was incidental to the choice of name. Hence the phrase ""NLP program"" to refer to a piece of software is not a redundancy, although I tend to use the term ""code"" instead of ""program"" to avoid the possible ambiguity. \n\nThe sites below are quite good. If you want a career in Operations Research or Retailing Management, NLP is a gr8 plus to learn"
The dimensionless unit named the erlang is a statistical measure of telecommunications traffic used in telephony. It is named after the Danish telephone engineer A. K. Erlang, the originator of traffic engineering and queueing theory.\n\nIn the traffic calculation, one Erlang implies a single resource in continuous use (or two channels at fifty percent use, and so on, pro rata). For example, if a bank has two tellers and they are both busy the whole time, that would represent two erlang of traffic.\n\nThe traffic measured in erlang is used to determine if a system is over- or under-provisioned (has too many or too few resources allocated).\n\nThe traffic measured over many busy hours might be used for a T1 or E1 circuit group to determine how many voice lines are in use at the busiest hours. For example, if no more than 12 out of 24 channels are ever in use at any given time, the other 12 might be made available as data channels.\n\nTraffic measured in erlang is used to calculate grade of service (GoS) or quality of service (QoS).\n\nThere are a range of different Erlang formulae, including Erlang B, Extended Erlang B, Erlang C and a related Engset formula to calculate GoS

It is called Rayleigh Scattering, or Molecular scattering.  This is primarily caused by oxygen and nitrogen molecules, whose effective diameters are at least 0.1 times smaller than the effected wavelengths.  Rayleigh scattering is most influential at the alitudes above 4.5 km, occuring in what is called the pure atmosphere.  The amount of Rayleigh scattering is highly selective, being inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength.  Consequently, invisible ultraviolet radiation, at a wavelength of 0.3 micrometers, is scattered 16 times as readily as red wavelengths at 0.6 micrometers.  In the visible spectrum, blue wavelengths at 0.4 micrometers are scattered about five times as readily as red wavelengths at 0.6 micrometers.  The preferential scattering of blue wavelengths explains why the clear sky appears blue in daylight.  The blue wavelengths reach our eyes from all parts of the sky.

There is no definite answer to your question, since science has a limit to how small particles it can detect.  The basic theory in this area is that matter is just a standing wave.  A wave has no weight, but when encased in a sphere, it then has mass.  And mass requires weight.  This weight is so infinitesmally small it cannot be detected.  But these spheres, called photons, are held together with other photons making up quarks, which are held together by Glueon, which in turn makes up atoms, etc.  This is all based on the wave/particle duallity of light.

No. well, its absolutely impossible to travel at or faster then the speed of light, but lets pretend you can so i can actually give you an answer to the question. The speed of light is actually the ultimate speed limit to the universe, nothing can travel faster than light, so although you would expect the light to be going at twice the speed of light (you plus the speed of light)it can't because it is physically impossible for even light to travel faster than the speed of light so it would be going slower than you and not reach any path in front of you. Of course, if you turned on your headlights before you started moving, the light would be one step ahead of you.\n\nOf course, still, nothing can go faster then the speed of light because in the formula for time dialation(time slows down for an object moving close to the speed of light) t'=t/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2) where t' is the time passing for an outside observer, t is the time that passes for the object going at the high velocity, v is velocity, speed is the speed of light and ^2 is squared. (note: this formula is definately correct, it's part of einstein's theory of relativity and I've had to derive it myself for class in the past) so if v was bigger than c, you would have a number greater than one and therefore a negative number under a square root, which is impossible.

Perceptual control theory (PCT) is a psychological theory of animal and human behavior originated by William T. Powers.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_Control_Theory#History\n\nIn contrast with other theories of psychology and behavior, which assume that behavior is a function of perception — that perceptual inputs determine or cause behavior — PCT finds that an organism's behavior is a means of controlling its perceptions.\n\nPCT differs from engineering control theory in that the reference variable for each negative feedback control loop in a control hierarchy is set from within the system (the organism), rather than by a separate controller.\n\nThe Control Systems Group is a non-profit professional organization of individuals involved in research in and applications of perceptual control theory.
"Black ice\nBlack ice is a thin coating of ice on a surface, often a roadway. While not truly black, it is transparent, allowing the usually-black asphalt/Macadam roadway to be seen through it, hence the term.\n\nIt is usually deposited by freezing rain, mist, or fog. Because it contains relatively little entrained air in the form of bubbles, black ice is transparent and thus very difficult to see (as compared to snow, frozen slush, rime ice, or other typical roadway forms of ice). In addition, it often has a matte appearance rather than the expected gloss; and often is interleaved with wet pavement, which is identical in appearance. For this reason it is especially hazardous when driving or walking.\n\nBlack ice may form even when the ambient temperature is several degrees above the NTP freezing point of water. This occurs typically, and treacherously, when terrain contours and/or prevailing wind cause a local steep differential of atmospheric pressure and/or temperature or when the atmosphere has warmed up after a prolonged cold spell that leaves the temperature of the ground (and roadway!) well below the freezing point.\n\nBlack ice also refers to the slick layer that forms on roadways from a light rain after a period without any precipitation. The water mixes with the road dust and oil but doesn't wash away. This leaves the road surface as slick as ice, slicker than just being wet with water. This type of road hazard can occur any time of year, but especially in mostly dry summer months.\n\nIn either case, while definitely a real phenomenon, ""black ice"" may be cited as the cause of a car crash when, in fact, the real root cause may have been excessive speed, inattention, or some other fault on the part of the driver.\n                    & ALSO\n\nIt is a Top Selling Intrusion Detection!

"In chemistry, a hydrogen bond is a type of attractive intermolecular force that exists between two partial electric charges of opposite polarity. Although stronger than most other intermolecular forces, the typical hydrogen bond is much weaker than both the ionic bond and the covalent bond. Within macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids, it can exist between two parts of the same molecule, and figures as an important constraint on such molecules' overall shape.\n\nAs the name ""hydrogen bond"" implies, one part of the bond involves a hydrogen atom. The hydrogen must be attached to a strongly electronegative heteroatom, such as oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine, which is called the hydrogen-bond donor. This electronegative element attracts the electron cloud from around the hydrogen nucleus and, by decentralizing the cloud, leaves the atom with a positive partial charge. Because of the small size of hydrogen relative to other atoms and molecules, the resulting charge, though only partial, nevertheless represents a large charge density. A hydrogen bond results when this strong positive charge density attracts a lone pair of electrons on another heteroatom, which becomes the hydrogen-bond acceptor"

Do you REALLY want to know the answer to this question?\n\nThe answer to why chickens lay eggs is in reproduction. Just as women have monthly cycles of discarded eggs, so do chickens. The eggs you eat are the bi-product of the reproduction cycle in the form of an unfertilized egg. That red spot you might see on occasion, that's a fertilized egg and was the beginning of a chick but plucked from the nest before it had a chance to mature. In most commercial hen houses where chickens are housed in small cages, there are no roosters.\n\nI don't think chickens lay eggs every day and that is why you would usually need more than one if you want eggs on a daily basis, but chickens do lay often.
Freeze is a particularly cold spell of weather, a snow storm or an ice storm.  Frost, like snow, is the result of deposition of water vapor in saturated air.  Therefore, you can have a frost-free freezer inside your home.
One of two things. The atmosheric temperature is much warmer than the ground air temperature and thus the precipitation doesn't have time to crystalize and freeze. Or your thermometer is broken.

If you catch a ""fresh"" snowflake in the air with a glove, you can see that it really looks like the pictures of snowflakes - hexagonal, and symmetric.\n\nFor snow to change into ice, it has to melt first (getting rid of that crystalization), and then refreeze."

There is no 'past' space. Either it goes on forever or it comes to and end and that's it, nothing more.

The most accurate is a strontium atomic clock, 1,000 times more accurate than the caesium atomic clock. Caesium oscillates 9 billion times a second, but strontium vibrates at over 429 trillion times a second, allowing for even higher accuracy.
It all depends on their subspecialty. A neurologist who does EMG's or sleep studies makes more than someone who does cognitive or behavioural neurology, for instance. As a rule the more procedures one does, the more money one makes. It also varies quite a bit by location but just to give you an idea, a neurologist in a busy private practice can probably make 200-300 K per annum. In academic practice they make about 100 K less than that. These figures are for initial salaries.

"skyman,\n\nthis is kind of a big question since there are very very many different kinds of lasers that work very differently.  i'll try to answer it in a general way.\n\nLASER stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.  i'll get to exactly what that means in a minute.\n\nthe earliest laser was a rod of ruby crystal, with mirrors on both ends with the shiny faces pointing towards the crystal, and some very bright flashbulbs around the sides.  one of the mirrors was a perfect mirror - 100% of the light was reflected - and the other was not quite - 99% or so was reflected but about 1% passed through.\n\nthe way it worked was that you'd fire the flashbulbs, which would shine very brightly into the ruby crystal.  all the atoms in the ruby absorb some energy from the light and their electrons go to a higher-energy state - this is called a ""population inversion"" and is important to the operation of a laser.\n\nanyway, before long some of those atoms will start emitting photons and settling back down into their ground state.  some photons will be going the right direction so that they bounce back and forth between the mirrored ends of the rod, over and over.  \n\nevery time a photon goes past an excited atom, it causes the atom to radiate a photon too, in the same direction and in phase with the original photon.  this is the ""stimulated emission"" in LASER.  before long this cascades into a torrent of photons, all bouncing back and forth between the mirrors - about 1% of them leak out and you get a laser beam.\n\nthere are a lot of other designs for lasers, but they all work on the same fundamental principle.  you have some kind of material that can emit photons when it's in an excited state, and you put it between two mirrors in what is called an optical resonator or optical cavity.  of course there are a lot more technical details that i'm skipping over, but hopefully you get the basic idea."

Genius only refers to a person's IQ rating, which can be just about anywhere on the charts for anyone you meet.  Some people have no idea how to start a car, but they could quote to you how to solve algorithims in advanced physics by using pencil shavings.  Other people have a very strong practical knowledge (look at a leaky pipe and tell you how to better install plumbing through your house), but have trouble with non-practical knowledge (see the reference to physics above).  Everyone is stupid and smart in their own respective ways....that is what makes people so interesting.

Specular reflection returns the image unaltered, what the mirror is really doing is reversing front and back.  Imagine you are behind some object reflected in a mirror, the farthest point from you is the objects front, this same front is the closest point to you in the reflection.  Now if you think about it we define top and bottom in terms of a fundamental physical law, gravity, right and left on the other hand are not determined this way.  We assign them based on perspective, so when you reverse something in the direction of depth you have to reverse something in the horizontal direction as well.

"The ""white"" is caused because snow has a great many tiny interfaces, called ""phase boundaries,"" where air (a gas phase) meets ice (a solid phase).  Every time light encounters a phase transition, it is defracted.  If you've ever looked at a stick submerged partially, you've seen this--a straight stick will look like it has a bend in it right at the water's surface.  Well, with snow, the tiny ice crystals, and the many small bubbles in ice (water is a bent and polar molecule, so when it freezes, it expands, making small bubbles inside), and the places where individual ice crystals begin and end--all of this scatters light all around.  This makes it so that a big bunch of snow will look white.  If you look at a single snowflake under a microscope, though, you will see that the crystals individally are clear.\n\nWhen it melts, there is only one phase transition, right at the surface.  The light is defracted a bit, but only once--it doesn't scatter light all around like snow does.\n\nBut it can!  If you've ever seen a big fountain, where the water is splashing and tumbling about, it will also look white due to phase transition.  Likewise, if you make a whole bunch of tiny bubbles under water, you can scatter light and make it look white."

In simple words: string theory is the theory that everything is made up of extremley tiny strings. They vibrate in multiple different variations. The vibrations then create all the different particles such as electrons and protons. It gets a lot more complicated than that, but the is the basis.
Detergent is a wetting agent and allows water to wet and dissolve matter that ordinarily resists water such as oil and grease.  Soap is not only a wetting agent but once it surrounds a particle of dirt it forms a film with charged soap molecules aligned such that the entire particle (soap and all) seems like it has a single charge.  Since like charges repel, all particles repel each other and the surface being cleaned and easily rinse away.  Soap and detergent therefore differ in the way they work.  Of course, soap and detergent can be mixed together to do a better job.

A kangaroo is any of several large macropods (the marsupial family that also includes the wallabies, tree kangaroos, wallaroos, pademelons and the quokka: 45 species in all). The term kangaroo is sometimes used in a broader sense to refer to all members of the macropod family. Kangaroos are native to the continent of Australia, while a number of tree kangaroos are found in New Guinea.\n\nThe word kangaroo is said to derive from the Guugu Yimidhirr (an Australian Aboriginal language) word gangurru, referring to the Grey Kangaroo (see photo to the right). The name was first recorded as kangaru by Joseph Banks on James Cook's first voyage of exploration, when they were beached at the mouth of the Endeavour River in the harbour of modern Cooktown for almost 7 weeks repairing their ship which had been damaged on the Great Barrier Reef.

Every object (that has a temperature above absolute zero) emits radiation.  What form this radiation takes depends on the temperature of the object - the sun is hot and emits visible light, the earth is cooler and emits heat.  The heat that is emitted from earth would be radiated out into the space if it wasn't for the greenhouse gasses in our atmosphere.  They absorb the heat, and emit it later, so that the heat stays in our atmosphere, where we can benefit from it.\n\nGreenhouse gasses are not harmful to the earth.  Examples of greenhouse gasses are water vapor and carbon dioxide, and they keep up the temperature of earth.  With greenhouse gasses, the average temperature on earth is 15 degrees Celsius above zero (60 degrees Farenheit above zero).  If there were no greenhouse gasses, the average temperature would be 18 degrees Celsius below zero (zero degrees Farenheit).  Quite a difference!\n\nWhen people speak of greenhouse gasses being harmful to the earth, they (most likely) mean that an increase of greenhouse gasses could be harmful, because that would probably mean increasing temperatures, which could lead to a  change in the climate.
LEAP SECONDS\nCivil time is occasionally adjusted by one second increments to ensure that the difference between a uniform time scale defined by atomic clocks does not differ from the Earth's rotational time by more than 0.9 seconds. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), an atomic time, is the basis for civil time. \nHistorically, the second was defined in terms of the rotation of the Earth as 1/86,400 of a mean solar day.  In 1956, the International Committee for Weights and Measures, under the authority given it by the Tenth General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1954, defined the second in terms of the period of revolution of the Earth around the Sun for a particular epoch, because by then it had become recognized that the Earth's rotation was not sufficiently uniform as a standard of time.  The Earth's motion was described in Newcomb's Tables of the Sun, which provides a formula for the motion of the Sun at the epoch 1900 based on astronomical observations made during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  The ephemeris second thus defined is \n\nFor more click the source link.

There are essentially two parameters to look at when trying to determine the range of an RF Transmitter:\n\nTransmit Power\n\n    Transmit power refers to the amount of RF power that comes out of the antenna port of the radio. Transmit power is usually measured in Watts, milliwatts or dBm. (For conversion between watts and dB see below.)\n\nReceiver sensitivity\n\n    Receiver sensitivity refers to the minimum level signal the radio can demodulate. It is convenient to use an example with sound waves; Transmit power is how loud someone is yelling and receive sensitivity would be how soft a voice someone can hear. Transmit power and receive sensitivity together constitute what is know as “link budget”. The link budget is the total amount of signal attenuation you can have between the transmitter and receiver and still have communication occur.

"Nanotechnology comprises technological developments on the nanometer scale, usually 0.1 to 100 nm. (One nanometer equals one thousandth of a micrometre or one millionth of a millimetre.) The term has sometimes been applied to microscopic technology. \nNanotechnology is any technology which exploits phenomena and structures that can only occur at the nanometer scale, which is the scale of single atoms and small molecules. The following are the applications: \ncancer treatments that reallywork, clean energy, clear water, a restored environment, the key tospace exploration, future jobs, and new manufacturing capabilities. Nanosize"" powder particles (a few nanometres in diameter, also called nano-particles) are potentially important in ceramics, powder metallurgy, the achievement of uniform nanoporosity, and similar applications."
Water content in whiskey is too high. Even cask strength whiskey rarely exceeds 60%, while rubbing spirit will be 80%-95% alcohol.\n\nAlcohol acts as a lipophile (fat-loving) solvent only when there isn't too much water to emphasize its dipol nature. Permanent markers use lipophile solvents and don't solve in water.
Because strong acids are terrible bases (by definition), conjugate base will never deprotonate the alcohol.  However, because there is an electrophile in solution now (hydrogen ions) and lone pairs on the oxygen in the alcohol (nucleophile) the hydroxyl group (alcohol part) can be protonated to make a great leaving group---water.  Now you have a carbocation that will rapidly react with any close nucleophile in solution, or, more likely, it will form a double bond with another carbon and eliminate another hydrogen in the process.  This is most likely at high temperatures (>150C) and with near-concentrated acid.  Otherwise, there will simply be an equilibrium of the protonated alcohol leaving, and then an oxygen coming back.  \n\nThe reaction you are most likely (and most useful) looking for is an acid-catalyzed dehydration (E1) reaction.
"usually the terms ""countable"" and ""uncountable"" refer to a set with an infinite number of members.  in the context of an infinite number of elements, countable means ""you can put them in a well-defined order"".  mathematically this means you can define a one-to-one correspondence between the set's elements and the natural numbers.  \n\nso, the set of real numbers is uncountable, because if you go from 2.0 to 2.1, you have left out 2.05.. and if you instead go from 2.00 to 2.01, you have left out 2.005.. and  so on.\n\nanyway, rational numbers were shown to be countably infinite by georg cantor in 1891.  it was done so using his famous ""diagonal argument"".\n\nto do so, construct a table where you number the columns from left to right with the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, etc, and the rows from top to bottom the same way.  at each table element, write down a fraction where the numerator is the column number, and the denominator is the row number.  because this table has an infinite number of rows and an infinite number of columns, all of the rational numbers will be somewhere on it.\n\nnow, start in the upper left corner, which is 1/1.  take a step to the right (1/2), then down-left along the diagonal until you hit the edge (2/1).  go down (3/1), and then up-right along the diagonal (2/2, and then 1/3).  go right (1/4), and then down-left along the diagonal (2/3, 3/2, 4/1). go down.. and so on.  you keep zig-zagging along the diagonals and by doing so, you can hit every single rational number.  \n\nthe number of steps you have to take to get to a particular rational number defines its index, which means you can count them, which means the set is countably infinite.\n\nif it's hard to picture, you can see a diagram of what i'm talking about at the link below."
Ocean currents have a tempering effect on the climate of Boston, MA. In other words, the ocean is warmer than the land in the winter, and colder than the land in the summer. This has the effect of making both the summer and the winter more mild than they are more inland, although the effect is not as strong as on the west coast of the US, because the prevailing winds blow from west to east in the US.\n\nAlso, because the ocean currents hitting Boston, MA are coming from the Carribbean Ocean, hurricaines occasionally make their way to MA.

"From Wikipedia.org:\n\n""first devised in 1869 by the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev. Mendeleev intended the table to illustrate recurring (""periodic"") trends in the properties of the elements.""\n\n""The original table was created before the discovery of subatomic particles or the formulation of current quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure. If one orders the elements by atomic mass, and then plots certain other properties against atomic mass, one sees an undulation or periodicity to these properties as a function of atomic mass. The first to recognize these regularities was the German chemist Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner who, in 1829, noticed a number of triads of similar elements:\nSome triads Element Molar mass\n(g/mol) Density\n(g/cm³) Quotient\n(cm³/mol)\nchlorine 35.4527 0.003214 11030\nbromine 79.904 3.122 25.6\niodine 126.90447 4.93 25.7\n \ncalcium 40.078 1.54 26.0\nstrontium 87.62 2.64 33.2\nbarium 137.327 3.594 38.2\n\nThis was followed by the English chemist John Newlands, who noticed in 1865 that the elements of similar type recurred at intervals of eight, which he likened to the octaves of music, though his law of octaves was ridiculed by his contemporaries. Finally, in 1869, the German Julius Lothar Meyer and the Russian chemistry professor Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev almost simultaneously developed the first periodic table, arranging the elements by mass. However, Mendeleev plotted a few elements out of strict mass sequence in order to make a better match to the properties of their neighbours in the table, corrected mistakes in the values of several atomic masses, and predicted the existence and properties of a few new elements in the empty cells of his table. Mendeleev was later vindicated by the discovery of the electronic structure of the elements in the late 19th and early 20th century.\n\nIn the 1940s Glenn T. Seaborg identified the transuranic lanthanides and the actinides, which may be placed within the table, or below (as shown above)."""

Stars are formed when clouds of mainly hydrogen gas compress due to their gravitational attraction to the point where they are pushed so close together that nuclear fusion begins. Fusion progresses, turning hydrogen into helium, and eventually heavier elements, until fuel for the fusion is expended. At this point, the star collapses under its own weight, and can result in either a supernova or a black hole, depending on its mass.
not much information there. the only answer I can give you is that it depends on the size of the atoms attached to the carbons in the double bonds. The smaller the atoms attached the faster the addition reaction will take place.

The elliptical orbits are the result of Kepler's Law; the shape of a planet's orbit around a larger mass is a function of each planet's mass and the distance between the orbits.  One can derive the elliptical orbit path from Newton's Laws; when you start from Newton's Laws and perform this derivation, your result will be an equation in the form of an ellipse.\n\nSometimes orbits are not elliptical, but are circular.  Consider binary stars - when the masses of 2 binary stars is equal, the respective orbial path traced by each star is a cicrle in the complex plane, not an ellipse.\n\nBy the way, symmetry is one of the most natural phenomena observable.  To say that symmetry is not found in nature very often is an indication of lack of advanced physical and mathematical study.  Consider rings, field, and group theory.  Symmetric wavefunctions of identical particles and allowable energetic transition states in a molecule or, in some cases, an atom.  I could list 1000 different natural PERFECT symmetries based on solid foundations of laws of conservation and irrefutable mathematics, but only because I am limited as a human being in my knowledge of symmetrical processes.  There are many more than 1000 examples.  You get my point.

Organs - Small intestine \n \n \n \n       \n \n\nSystem: Digestive\n\nLocation: Abdomen\n\nPhysical description: A five metre long narrow tube that hangs in sausage-like coils\n\nFunction: Chemical digestion of food and absorption of nutrients into your blood\nLongest section of your digestive tract\n\nYour small intestine is around five metres long, making it the longest section of your digestive tract. Although it is longer than your large intestine it has a smaller diameter. This is why it's called the small intestine.\n\nChemical digestion\n\nAfter food is churned up in your stomach, a sphincter muscle at the end of your stomach opens to squirt small amounts of food into the top of your small intestine. This first section of the small intestine is called the duodenum.\n\nYour pancreas releases digestive juices through a duct into your duodenum. This fluid is rich in enzymes that break down fats, proteins and carbohydrates. It also contains sodium bicarbonate which neutralises acid produced in your stomach.\n\nYour gall bladder squeezes out bile down a duct into your duodenum. Bile helps break down fats in your food.\n\nPeristalsis\n\nDigesting food is pushed through the small intestine by peristalsis. Peristalsis is a muscular movement in which alternating waves of muscle contraction and relaxation cause food to be squeezed along the digestive tract.\n\nAbsorbing nutrients\n\nMost of the nutrients in the food you eat pass through the lining of your small intestine into your blood. The lining of the small intestine is covered in tiny microvilli. These are microscopic, finger-like protrusions which give the lining of the small intestine a massive surface area for absorption of nutrients to occur across. The microvilli give the inside of the intestine the look and feel of velvet.\n\nEach microvillus contains a minute blood capillary. When nutrients are absorbed into a microvillus, they enter its blood capillary. This is how nutrients from your food enter your blood.\n\nIndigestible food passes into the large intestine\n\nBy the time food leaves your small intestine all the nutrients in your food will have entered your bloodstream. All that remains is indigestible food which is passed from your small intestine to your large intestine for further processing.

"Protein does not come from an ""element."" It provides our body with most of its required nitrogen, which is an element. The source of protein can vary. For most people it comes from animal sources of course, such as meat, cheese, and eggs."

Well, on live elephants, they are used to show off superiority in the herd and get the largest harem. The alpha-male has the largest tusks generally. Also used for goring predators like lions.\n\nOn dead elephants, they are used for curios and artifacts. Banned in most countries, ivory trade is still quite lucrative and hence a lot of smuggling and poaching goes on in Africa and Asia.

"yes, it is possible.  however, you don't get turbulent flow in a fluid unless you consider the interaction forces on a particle of its neighbors.  these interactions are often nonlinear, and what comes out is so-called ""chaotic"" behavior.  \n\nchaotic behavior is characterized by the fact that a slight difference in initial conditions can lead to extremely different conditions down the line.\n\nbecause of this nonlinear behavior, the differential equations governing the motion of the particles are hard to solve analytically.  the best (only?) way to do it is to find numerical solutions.  there is an entire subfield of physics/engineering devoted to this, called ""computational fluid dynamics"".  \n\nost of the time the process is to divide the fluid up into a bunch of little regions, and calculate the forces on them based on what's happening in nearby regions.  do this for all of the regions, then advance the time by some small increment.  this is the basic idea behind most computational simulations.\n\nanyway, here you can probably learn some more about modelling turbulent flow, but keep in mind that this subject could be taught in a full-year graduate engineering course and still be only very-lightly touched on.  some people spend their lives studying this stuff:\nhttp://www.flow3d.com/Cfd-101/turb.htm\nhttp://www.ecs.umass.edu/mie/faculty/perot/modeling.htm"

Because actually at one time we had tails and some babies are actually still born with tails. But they are usual removed soon.
There are many proofs, for example via Boolean algebras or compact Hausdorff topological spaces or binary trees and probably more.\n\nFor example, consider the sequence S0, S1, S2, ..., of sets of truth assignments, such that:\n\n a) S0 is the set of all truth assignments\n b) S1 is a subset of S0, S2 is a subset of S1, S3 is a subset of S2, etc.\n c) For every finite subset E of A, every Sn contains at least one truth assignment that satisfies E\n\nNote that by assumption, S0 satisfies condition (c).\n\nEnumerate the propositional letters as p0, p1, p2, ...\n\nGiven that Sn satisfies (c), construct S{n+1} as follows:\n\n let Fn = { truth assignments in Sn such that the value assigned to letter pn is FALSE }\n let Tn = { truth assignments in Sn such that the value assigned to letter pn is TRUE  }\n\nClaim: at least one of Fn and Tn must satisfy clause (c).\n\nWhy?  Suppose that both E1 is a finite subset of A with no satisfying assignment in Fn and E2 is a finite subset of A with no satisfying assignment in Tn.  Then E1 union E2 is also a finite subset of A which can be seen to have no satifying assignment in Sn, contrary to our assumption about Sn.\n\nSo now we define\n\n S{n+1} = Fn if every finite subset of A has a satisfying assignment in Fn, otherwise S{n+1} = Tn\n\nThis way we define S0, S1, S2, ..., Sn, ... so that all Sn have property (c) and each S{n+1} is a proper subset of Sn.\n\nThere is one truth assignment in the intersection of all of the S0, S1, S2, ..., Sn, ....  Why? It is the assignment that assigns FALSE to pn if S{n+1} was Fn and TRUE to pn if S{n+1} was Tn.  It can be seen that both this truth assignment is in the common intersection of the Sn and that no other truth assignment can be.\n\nFinally, the one truth assignment in the common intersection of the Sn is a satifying truth assignment for all of the formulas in A.  I guess the easiest way to see this is that for any finite subset E of A (including the one-element subsets), all of the letters of the formulas in E are pi for 0 <= i < n.  Then since Sn already decides the FALSE or TRUE value of each pi, 0 <= i < n, we see that every truth assignment in Sn decides E the same way: all elements of Sn satify E or all elements of Sn do not satifsy E.  But at least one element of Sn must satisfy E -- so they all do, including the unique truth assignment in the common intersection of all of the Sn.\n\nSo A has at least one satisfying truth assignment.\n\n(You can find others by varying whether you pick Fn or Tn as the next S{n+1} whenever both have property (c)).\n\n\nUpdate: A few hours later I realized the above was essentially the same as saying:\n\nClaim: If A is a finitely satisfiable set of formulas and s is a formula, then at least one of A union { s }, A union { not s } is also finitely satisfiable.\n\nOtherwise there are finite subsets E1 and E2 of A such that neither E1 union { s ] nor E2 union { not s } can be satisfied, when clearly the finite subset E1 union E2 of A cannot be satisfied.\n\nSo in the above construction the sequence S0, S1, S2, ... corresponded to a sequence like for example\n\n A0 = A\n A1 = A0 union { not p0 } if that is finitely satisfiable, otherwise A0 union { p0 } (which then is, by the claim)\n A2 = A1 union { not p1 } if that is finitely satisfiable, otherwise A1 union { p1 } (which then is, by the claim)\n\n...where as before the propositional letters are p0, p1, p2, ....\n\nThen the union of all of the An is finitely satisfiable (because a finite subset would be contained in some finitely satisfiable An along the way) and in fact you can read off a satisfying truth assignment of the union of all of the An because for each letter the union contains either the letter (so assign it TRUE) or its negation (so assign it FALSE).\n\nSame proof, just a different way of looking at it.

"It is true you cannot preform any mental functions when you sneeze however when something is done so much that it becomes ""habitual"" such as walking it is not governed neccessarly by your mind.

Concentrated aqueous ammonia, Iodine, filter papers, spatula \nMethod -  In a beaker add some crystals of iodine to some of the ammonia solution and allow to react for a couple of minutes. \nRemove some of the precipitate to a piece of filter paper and spread evenly across paper.  Let dry in a sheltered place. \nOnce dry simple contact will cause it to explode \n \nSafety - Note that this substance is an explosive.  Make sure no large lumps are left to dry on the filter paper.  Don't make too much touch power in one batch, and don't try to store it for later use.  Avoid getting these chemicals on skin or in eyes. \nExplanation - The precipitate created is Nitrogen tri-iodide.  This compound is very unstable and is extremely sensitive to pressure, and will explode at the slightest provocation (much like grade 9 students!) \nNotes - The ingredients in this demo are reasonably easy to get hold, even outside of the laboratory,  of so I would suggest not being too forth coming about their exact nature.
"Once, when Albert Einstein stepped off of a plane, he was asked by a reporter to explain the theory of general relativity in one or two sentences.  Einstein said something like this: ""We used to think that if you took all of the matter and all of the energy out of the universe, all that would remain would be space and time.  Now we think that if you took all of the matter and all of the energy out of the universe, all of the space and all of the time would go with it"".  Space, time, matter and energy share such a deep interrelation that it's very likely that they're, somehow, all the same thing.  There isn't any new space... the space we have has only stretched like a balloon."

During the final stage of mitosis, telophase, the chromosomes decondense, becoming unorganized chromatin again. A nuclear membrane forms around each daughter set of chromosomes, and the spindle fibers disappear.

Time travel is completly possible. \n\nwhen Albert Einstein released his theory of special relativity, he laid the foundation for the theoretical possibility of time travel. As we all know, no one has successfully demonstrated time travel, but no one has been able to rule it out either. \n\nIf you travel at the speed of light, time stops for you, not for other people. So say you travel at the speed of ligt for a week in space, when you come back to earth youll find that its been maybe 100 years in the future.\n\nI also know a russian astronaught (<--- Spelling wrong) that traveled a fraction of a seconed in the future. This is because he was aboard the russian space station. If you travel fast enough for a long period of time its possible.\n\nThere is a scientist that is building this machine, its suppose to be able to send particles into the future or past i forgot, but when this person turns the time machine on, he could start getting messages from the future.\n\nBut yes time travel is possible.

A plant pathologist is a professional who specializes in plant health much as a physician specializes in human health or a veterinarian in animal health. Keeping plants healthy requires an understanding of the organisms and agents that cause disease as well as an understanding of how plants grow and are affected by disease. Through college courses in botany, microbiology, crop science, soil science, ecology, genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, and physiology, students receive the necessary background for exciting careers in the interdisciplinary science of plant pathology. Most specialize by taking advanced college training for master's and doctoral degrees. Plant pathologists are employed by colleges and universities, state and federal government agencies, industrial firms, international institutes, and as private practitioners.\nPlant Pathologists Strive To Keep\nPlants Healthy
I do and I'm a petroleum geologist. It will be impossible to determine when we actually hit peak until we go down the other side for a while. Most of the major oil companies are failing to replace their annual production with new discoveries, in some cases only replacing 60% of the year's production. As oil becomes more expensive there will be more and more nonconventional sources like oil-shale that come on line, but they will only make the back side of the curve a little more gentle. \n\nThe bigger problem may be the growing demand. World oil demand is at an all time high, over 80 million bbls a day, and shows no signs of demand deflation. \n\nNo, all our resources are not fossil fuels. We need to explore EVERY alternative, including nuclear, solar, wind, bio, tidal, geothermal, etc. Realize that the world's second and third largest oil companies are also the world's two largest manufacturers of solar cells. One of those oil companies is also one of the largest wind power operators in the world. The oil companies see the handwriting on the wall. We need to start saving oil for some of the products other than fuel for which oil is the raw material.
Proof by contradiction\nSuppose sqrt(7) is rational. Then it can be expressed and a fraction in reduced form, that is the numerator and denominator have no common factors.\n\nsqrt(7) = m/n.\n\nThus  7 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2\n\n7n^2 = m^2\n\nSince 7 divides both sides, 7 has to divide m^2, so 7 must be of the form m = 7k for some integer k.\n\n7n^2 = (7k)^2 so we can factor a 7 out of both sides\n\nn^2 = 7 k^2. We repeat the arguement, now n has to be divisible by 7 so n = 7q for some integer q.\n\nso n = 7q, m = 7k, that says m and k both have 7 as a common factor a contradiction since m/n was a reduced fraction.\n\nThere for the assumptin that sqrt(7) is rational must be false.
"Our everyday experience teaches us that an object must be ""pushed"" by a force in order to keep it moving. Otherwise, it will slow down and eventually stop. But this intuition is absolutely wrong. If an object is moving, then a force is required *to slow it down or stop it*, not to keep it moving. (Hence, ""Objects in motion tend to stay in motion. Objects at rest tend to stay at rest."") In our everyday experience, it's the force of friction that tends to stop Earth-bound objects from moving forever. But for the Earth rotating on its axis, there is no force working to counteract the rotation (except the tidal effect of the Moon, but that's working very slowly), so you don't need to have any input energy to keep it spinning."
Totipotency is the theory that all plants should be able to reproduce a plant from a single cell.  This isn't true.  It really depends on what species of plant you take the tissue from , and where on the plant you got that tissue.  For instance, chances are that if you took xylem from a plant and retied to get a tissue culture to form, you would be out of luck, whereas leaves are probably a little more likely to respond favorably.  Ultimately though it depends on the horomones that are present in your culture medium- usually a mixture of auxins and cytokinins at a certain ratio.

"Who told you there was no benefit?  A and B bloodtypes refer to the types of glycoproteins on the outsides of cells.  These gylocoproteins serve the function of acting as immunological recognition factors--they help the immune system differentiate ""self"" from ""non-self.""  Though the specific structure of such chemicals is largely arbitrary, it is not true to say that the existence of such glycoproteins is arbitrary.  As an analogy, there is no benefit to the *specific* combination of numbers that is in my social security number.  It's a random sequence, but a registry at the federal government allows the government to use that number to recognize my unique identity.  Hence the sequence of digits may be arbitrary, but the existence of the number is far from arbitrary.  I'd have a harder time getting through life in the US without one.\n\nLikewise, there may be not much evoultionary differences in today's society for the glycoproteins on a specific cell type, but if you had no such glycoproteins at all, you'd be unable to have a functioning immune system.  Evolutionary selective factors might not be so strong as to eliminate everyone with a particular cell left unlabeled by glycoproteins, but there is an evolutionarily important reason for having glycoproteins in general.\n\nMy blue eyes are such an anomaly comparable to the O blood type--the gene for making some modestly useful protein (likely more useful in the past than it is today) is not functional, hence a certain anamolous differnence exists between me and most people.  There is a slight advantage to having brown eyes, in that blue eyes are more sensitive to UV light (less important for my northern ancestors than for people from equatorial regions).  Likewise, it has been proposed (though not definitively concluded) that the A blood group had better chances of surviving the bubonic plague back in the times that it swept across Europe, leaving a greater prevalence of the A blood type in areas where the bubonic plague hit hardest."

"We like to say ""match the bug, with the drug"".  Penicillin was one of the first antibiotics.  It was widely prescribed and used.  With new and better technology, scientists have discovered other drugs that are more sophistocated to treat certain infections.  While yes it is true over prescription of antibiotics, not just penicillin, can cause tolerance, I believe in part the fact that technology has caught up with infections and we have the right medicine to treat them."
A copper calorimeter is a small solid block of pure copper in a vacuum that has thermocouple wires attached to it to measure the rise in temperature of the block with exposure of the block to controlled amounts of energy from a heat source. Thermal loss must be minimized, readings must be immediate, calibrations must be highly accurate, temperature variations within the block must be eliminated (hence the need for a small block).

"Here is the famous astronomer late. Dr. Carl Sagan's answer to similar question. I found it in Nova website. Below is the paragraph extracted from that website.\n\n""First of all, it might be that you can build a time machine to go into the future, but not into the past, and we don't know about it because we haven't yet invented that time machine. Secondly, it might be that time travel into the past is possible, but they haven't gotten to our time yet, they're very far in the future and the further back in time you go, the more expensive it is. Thirdly, maybe backward time travel is possible, but only up to the moment that time travel is invented. We haven't invented it yet, so they can't come to us. They can come to as far back as whatever it would be, say A.D. 2300, but not further back in time. \nThen there's the possibility that they're here alright, but we don't see them. They have perfect invisibility cloaks or something. If they have such highly developed technology, then why not? Then there's the possibility that they're here and we do see them, but we call them something else—UFOs or ghosts or hobgoblins or fairies or something like that. Finally, there's the possibility that time travel is perfectly possible, but it requires a great advance in our technology, and human civilization will destroy itself before time travelers invent it."" -Carl Sagan"
"American medicine before the invention of Penicillin was mainly nutrition.  Working at a hospital I see medicine pushed by drug reps.  Some of these medicines are based on the idea of the sugar pill.  If you believe it will work it will.  Here is a classic senario for you that happens all the time at the hospital.  A elderly patient comes in with a cold or a cough.  Instead of doing cultures and finding what is the best drug for them they give a broad spectrum antibiotic such as rocephin.  This knocks out their normal flora of bacteria in their intestines giving room for C. Diff. to become the predominate bacteria.  This causes diahreah and the patient comes back for dehydration and feeling really sick because of this bacteria.  Vancomyacin is then prescribed to knock out C. Diff.  It does to an extent but then your normal flora of E. Coli end up mutating to Vanc Resistant Ecoli.  This is not a neccessarily a bad thing since it is not a problem while it stays in the intestines.  But by this time the antibiotics have caused yeast infections such as thrush and what not and you are very sick.  The doctor ends up having the patient cathiterized and they develope an Urinary Tract infection with the VRE.  They then develope Sepsis and end up dying.  The catch 22 is that if they had not been prescribed the Rocephin this would not have happened, but the drug companies have come up with a ""List"" of drugs that should be given to any patient presenting to the hospital with any symptoms of pneumonia, such as a cough.  It is called ""core measures"".  If they don't prescribe these medicines they are looked down upon by the hospital AND drug companies even though these can ultimately end up killing the patient."

use Newton's second law of motion. F=ma. force on an object(the car) is equal to the mass(weight)of the car times the acceleration(or in the case of an accident the deceleration).\nIt's harder to determine the force on a passenger because the seatbelt is designed to minimize the impact of an accident. airbags do too!
Studies using xylitol as either a sugar substitute or a small dietary addition have demonstrated a dramatic reduction in new tooth decay, along with arrest and even some reversal of existing dental caries. Xylitol provides additional protection that enhances all existing prevention methods. This xylitol effect is long-lasting and possibly permanent. Low decay rates persist even years after the trials have been completed.

"Any ""egg"" must as a neccessity for procreation contain diversity. Any A-sexual being can only produce a duplicate of its own species, so in either case at least one chicken must have been present otherwise no Egg could have been produced. And also since I am not aware of any stage of evolution where a species has become a-sexual, two chickens must have been present.\nAnd that last note is important as chickens are far more advanced in current evolutionary theory than say single-cell amoebas, and are regarded to have begun well-after such a-sexual life dominated."

You will need to hire an experienced microbiologist to do this. \n\nIt will probably require an initial investment of 100,000 to a million dollars depending on your facilities. After the lab is set up you need to validate your equipment and compose a set of standard operating procedures. \n\nIt would probably be cheaper to outsource your micro testing. QA testing lab companies will have their own validated methods, a staff of microbiologists, and (in some cases) they'll even pick up your samples right from your processing facility.

"A black hole is a concentration of mass great enough that the force of gravity prevents anything from escaping from it except through quantum tunneling behavior. The gravitational field is so strong that the escape velocity near it exceeds the speed of light. This implies that nothing, not even light, can escape its gravity, hence the word ""black."" The term ""black hole"" is widespread, even though it does not refer to a hole in the usual sense, but rather a region of space from which nothing can return. Theoretically, black holes can have any size, from microscopic to near the size of the observable universe.\nBlack holes are predicted by general relativity. According to classical general relativity, neither matter nor information can flow from the interior of a black hole to an outside observer. For example, one cannot bring out any of its mass, or receive a reflection back by shining a light source such as a flashlight, or retrieve any information about the material that has entered the black hole. Quantum mechanical effects may allow matter and energy to radiate from black holes; however, it is thought that the nature of the radiation does not depend on what has fallen into the black hole in the past.

"During the American Revolution, John Paul Jones was an officer aboard the USS Alfred in 1776.  The USS Alfred was part of 6-vessel fleet that attacked English merchant vessels in New Providence.  Jones raised the first American flag over a U.S. Naval vessel aboard the Alfred.\n\nHis first command was the frigate USS Providence. Over a period of six weeks, his ship captured 16 enemy vessels along the coast of Nova Scotia.\n\nIn November of 1776, he proposed a mission plan to destroy the British coal fleet and free American prisoners held at Isle Royal.  He was assigned command of the USS Alfred and successfully completed this mission, including the capture of a British ship carrying winter clothing for British troops in Canada.  This is believed to have contributed to the success of the Continental Army at Trenton by providing them with fresh winter clothes.\n\nIn June of 1777, he was given command of the USS Ranger and was sent to France to help Benjamin Franklin and the American contingent there with strategic recommendations.  After France signed a treaty with America in 1778, the USS Ranger sailed for England and captured the British naval ship, HMS Drake.\n\nIn 1779, he assumed command of the USS Bonhomme Richard.  A five ship squadron, including the Bonhomme Richard, attacked a British merchant convoy off the coast of Yorkshire.  A pair of British vessels attacked the American squadron.  Two of the vessels fled while the Bonhomme Richard and two other naval ships attacked the British warships.  The HMS Serapis severely damaged the Bonhomme Richard, shooting off her flag during the attack.  The British commander, asked if Jones had struck his colors in surrender.  In response, Jones issued his famous quotation, ""I have not yet begun to fight.""  He then rammed his sinking ship into the Serapis, tied up to it, boarded and captured the ship."

Yes.  My exhusband and I were driving from Louisiana to Wisconsin.  We were on I-57 at night.  We were both prior military so we know what aircraft looks like.  Anyways, there was a vessile of some sort about 3-5 miles up parallelling us for about 20 miles or so.  No blinking lights but there was a light that we couldnt explain.  After about 20 miles, it was gone suddenly.  The sky was crystal clear and there were no airports around at all so we know it wasnt a plane.  Sure kept us awake the rest of the night.

Microwaves are waves that are part of the electromagnetical spectrum.  The measured distance from tip to tip of the crest of the waves is what makes it considered a 'micro' wave.\n\nMicrowaves are a shorter wavelength than the electromagnetic waves that carry radio signals, but longer than those waves that our eyes can detect in the 'visible' spectrum.\n\nNASA has a very good explanation of them at the Web site below:

"It would seem to be the case.  Wikipedia says that Nitrites react to form nitrosamines, which are carcinogens.  Also, the second link I give lists some really gruesome descriptions of what happens when you're exposed to nitrites (search for ""Summary of clinical effects"").  I don't know how soluble calcium nitrite is, but from what little chemistry I remember, calcium dissociates from compounds fairly easily.  So regardless of whether calcium nitrite would specifically kill you, it would probably dissociate into calcium and nitrite and the nitrite would kill you.\n\nMy mother (a biochemist) always says, ""The poison is in the dose.""

It's used for estimating fuel costs.\n\nEach town has an average number of heating degree days for the winter and average number of cooling degree days for the summer.\n\nWith those averages, you can calculate how long the air conditioner or heater will run for the year and then calculate the fuel costs.\n\n\n\nYou can calculate it from the average temperature each day.\n\nExample:\nAverage temperature for Jan. 1 is 30°F.\n65°F - 30°F = 35°F\n\nJan 1 is one day, so 35° difference * 1 day = 35 heating degree days\n\n\nAverage temperature for Jan. 2 is 35°F.\n65°F - 35°F = 30°F\n\nJan 2 is one day, so 30° difference * 1 day = 30 heating degree days\n\nYou do this for every of the year and add it up.\n\nJan 1 = 35 heating degree days\nJan 2 = 30 heating degree days\nJan 3 = \nJan 4 = \n\nAdd it all up and you get the number of heating degree days for the winter.

Because water is polar.  Polar molecules can create favorable interations (hydrogen bonds) where + and - charges match up, for an energetically favorable configuration.  Lipids (fats and oils) are non-polar, and do not forma favorable interactions with water and other polar solvents.  Hence, they keep to their own--polar and polar go well together, and nonpolar goes with nonpolar.  Hence, hydrophobic (water fearing) and lipophilic (fat loving) mean the same thing.

"The pressure inside each enclosed bubble will remain the same.  If the airline is pressurized, there's no effect (usually cargo planes are pressurized, except in extreme cases).  Physics dictates that the bubble would ""appear"" to EXPAND in the increasing altitude due to lower pressure outside/inside the plane; therefore if you are concerned about shipping something via altitude w/o pressurized cabin--- no worries.  It would take a trip outside of earth's atmosphere to pop... if no cabin pressurization.  Don't take it out scuba diving; water depth increases pressure exponentially, and would collapse them."
Capacitor, device for storing an electrical charge, sometimes called a condenser. In its simplest form a capacitor consists of two metal plates separated by a non-conducting layer called the dielectric. The dielectric may be air, plastic, waxed paper, or another substance such as the mineral mica. When one plate of a capacitor is charged using a battery or other source of direct current, the other plate becomes charged with the opposite sign; that is, positive if the original charge is negative, and negative if the original charge is positive\nThe electrical size of a capacitor is its capacitance, that is the amount of electric charge it can hold per unit potential difference across its plates—C = Q/V. The SI unit of capacitance is the farad (F). Because this is such a large unit, capacitors commonly have their size expressed in µF (1 microfarad = 10-6 F) or pF (1 picofarad = 10-9 F).
This is not a complete analysis, and I am not an expert in this area, and just the result of a few random thoughts. You can flesh this out as needed. \n\n\nLet f(n,x)=the nth application of function g to x. In your case g(x)=sin(x). In general, a function g(x) will have some values x at which f(n,x) converges to a fixed point, and some values x at which it does not, but diverges, or exhibits periodic or chaotic behavior (wanders around in some bounded region). \n\nFor the case of g(x)=sin(x), \n\nf(1e1,1)=.463\nf(1e2,1)=.1689\nf(1e3,1)=.0546\nf(1e4,1)=.0173\nf(1e5,1)=.0055\nf(1e6,1)=.0017\n\nPlotting log(f(1en,1)) versus n shows an approximately straight line, so that if a0=-1.1274 and a1=0.4303, then y(n)=a0*n+a1 is a reasonable approximation for log(f(1en,1)), and log(f(1en,1))-y(n) is \n\n(-0.0729, 0.0460, 0.0441, 0.0222, 0.0036, -0.0431) \n\nfor n=1,2,3,4,5,6 respectively. \n\nI notice that there appears to be some oscillatory behavior in this residual, which you might be able to model fairly accurately as well for more variance reduction in your convergence prediction. \n\nMaybe this will get you started and you can dig into this further, depending on how much depth you need.

Assumed: In the U.S.\n\nYour major makes no difference.  Many doctors, including surgeons majored in a field other than science such as business, philosophy, etc.  Having said that, the MCAT, which is a test required by virtually all U.S. medical schools, contains questions on both physical sciences as well as life sciences.  In addition, most medical schools require a list of basic coursework in sciences.  So while you do not need to MAJOR in a science, you will need to take a number of science courses.  \n\nFinally, your major in your undergraduate program will have no impact on what happens after medical school.  If you want to be a surgeon, you need to do well in Mmdical School and of course there are different areas of surgery that are more difficult to get into than others.\n\nSo worry about getting into medical school first: Good MCAT score, high GPA (3.5 or higher), and of course your unique and diverse persona.
yes, the magnetic fields are already getting weaker, that means Alaska will lose its aurora and the switch of poles can last a few hundred or few thousand years.\n\nThe cause is unknown but the majority of scientists believe that the poles switch not spontaneously but as a result of events that may disrupt the flow of the Earth's core.\n\nScientists read past reversals by the magnetisim of the solidified oceanic rock(at the bottom of the ocean) but to read further back in time they look at sandstone which may have suspended iron particles which can tell of the earth's magnetisim at the time the sandstone was formed

A magnet has a stronger field in the middle. The field lines can only be observed as they separate at the ends, and where the density of field lines in decreasing. The field strength at a given distance measured perpendicular to the axis of the magnet is always greater in the region opposite the middle than opposite the ends. This is the case for all fields that vary as the inverse square from point sources, magnetic, electric, and electromagnetic (from radioactive sources or light).
Hey, just bringing this old question up for a vote.
If your question is about how fast oil will come out of the ground, it varies. There are a very few oil reservoirs in the world where the oil is actually in hollow space, previously caverns, and these can be pumped out as fast as the pumps can go. Most oil comes out of the ground quite slowly, sometimes a well may only pump a few barrels a day. The most prolific wells can produce several thousand barrels a day. However, to get the most oil from the well, the daily production is often limited because allowing it to come out quickly will damage the reservoir and often result in only producing water from the well after a short period. \n\nIf your question is about how oil is created and how long it takes, the answer is millions of years. The real answer is related to how long it takes for the organic material in rock to reach a certain pressure and temperature by burial under other rock. An example is the Lower Miocene age rock near South Padre Island. The oil generation took place between 135 degrees Celsius and 175 degrees Celsius at depths between 3,600 meters and 4,600 meters, while natural gas was generated between 155 degrees to over 200 degrees Celsius and at depths of burial ranging from 4,000 meters to 5,000 meters and greater. This burial process is caused by rivers like the Mississippi River depositing sediment on river deltas. This is what takes millions of years.

There is one major problem. Electrolyzing the two elements (separating the H2 from O) requires more energy to separate it than it releases.  There is no cost effective way to break the bonds, currently.  The only plus about H2 for Fuel Cell cares is that it lasts longer than batteries (H2 does not die out), 1 L of compressed H2 takes you as far as 1 L of petrol, and it is clean burning.\n\nHowever, the only energy abundant enough to separate the bonds comes from coal, oil, and natural gas.  And since the 1st law of thermodynamics is correct we will be using more energy to make H2 to power our cars than we will at our homes.

Capillaries are extremely small vessels located within the tissues of the body that transport blood from the arteries to the veins. Capillary walls are thin and are composed of endothelium (a single layer of overlapping flat cells). Oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrients and wastes are exchanged through the thin walls of the capillaries. Capillaries are so small that red blood cells can only travel through them in single file.

A returning boomerang is a propeller. Though it is not a requirement that the boomerang be in its traditional shape, it is usually flat. A falling boomerang starts spinning and most then fall in a spiral. When the boomerang is thrown with high spin, the wings produce lift. Larger boomerangs are used in hunting, thus they drop on the ground after striking the target. Smaller ones are use in sport, and are the only boomerangs that return to the thrower. No one would think a spinning object flies a straight line, neither does the boomerang, it flies a turn or to be clearly: It flies on a circle. So it naturally returns to its starting point unless all spin is eaten up. Now in more detail:\n\nReturning boomerangs consist of two or more arms or wings, connected at an angle. Each wing is shaped as an airfoil, air travels faster over one surface of an airfoil than the other, as it follows the longer path, thus creating lift, along what is roughly a plane which intersects the airfoil at a near right angle along the long axis of the wing.\n\nThese wings are set so that the lift created by each wing opposes the lift of the other, but at an angle such that the flight pattern is constantly shifted as the forces of lift, drag, speed, rotational inertia etc. 'attempt' to reach equilibrium, see Boomerang engineer.\n\nThis is what makes the boomerang 'return gracefully to the hurler, fluttering to a stop in his hand'... when thrown correctly. This is also what makes the boomerang 'rocket straight up into the air before plunging to its shattered doom'... when thrown incorrectly. With the exception of long-distance boomerangs, they should not be thrown sidearm or like a frisbee, but rather almost vertically.\n\nFast Catch boomerangs usually have three symmetrical wings (in the planform view), whereas a Long Distance boomerang is most often shaped very similar to a question mark. Maximum Time Aloft boomerangs have one wing considerably longer than the other. This feature, along with carefully executed bends and twists in the wings, help to set up an 'auto-rotation' effect to maximize the boomerang's hover-time in descending from its highest point in the flight.\n\nProminent boomerang designer/builders include Bob Burwell and Tony Butz from Australia, Rusty Harding from the USA, Jerri Leu from Brazil and others.\n\nFollow the link for more information.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomerang#Design

The nucleus, present in eukaryotic cells, is a discrete structure containing chromosomes, the genetic blueprint of the cell. Separated from the cytoplasm of the cell by a double-layered membrane called the nuclear envelope, the nucleus contains a cellular material called nucleoplasm. Nuclear pores, around the circumference of the nuclear membrane, allow the exchange of cellular materials between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm.

This formula will not be used often but an example would be if you need to blend batches of product.  For example, if a batch is low in a particular ingredient then you can calculate at which rate to mix it in with 'good' product and still maintain the integrity or 'declaired' values on the product.

This is a classic question that puzzled people for centuries, known as Obler's Paradox. If there are so many stars in the sky, why is the night sky not lit up from all the stars? \n\nThere are several interesting aspects to this question: \n\n1. First, distant stars are receding from us at increasing speeds (Hubble's Law). The speed of these distant stars causes their light to be Doppler-shifted out of the visible range, so our eyes cannot see the light from these stars any more.\n\n2. The universe is full of dark matter, which does not shine, and probably absorbs light, so a lot of light gets absorbed this way. \n\n3. If a distant star is receding at close to the speed of light, its light might not ever reach us, or might take a very long time to reach us, so the light has not got here yet from some stars. \n\n4. There are black holes in the universe, that are objects so dense that photons are drawn in by the immense gravitational forces, and cannot escape. These also reduce the amount of light that we can receive. \n\n5. There are vast empty areas of space, so there are not an infinite number of stars available to produce light to brighten our nighttime sky. \n\nThere are probably some other considerations as well, but this at least gives you a starting point when considering this very interesting question.

Trigylcerides are composed of two types of molecules: glycerol and 3 fatty acids.\n\nPhospholipids are similar to triglycerides in that they contain glycerol and fatty acids, too. But, the big difference is that phospholipids are made up of 1 glycerol molecule and only 2 fatty acid molecules (not 3!)\n\nThis is a big difference because in place of the third fatty acid, phospholipids have a polar group attached to the glycerol molecule. Remember, triglycerides were entirely hydrophobic because all three positions on the glycerol molecule were taken up by nonpolar fatty acids. But, phospholipids have a polar group in one place on the glycerol molecule, making phospholipids partly hydrophilic; the polar group helps to form the polar head.  The two fatty acids, maintain a hydrophobic portion of the phospholipid, the tails.

It is an aircraft with modified swivel wings that does not require the aircraft to have a long runway for take off. Instead it raises the turbine wings and rises in a vertical manner from where it was parked, when aloft the wings will readjust to an angle and thus the aircraft will be flown in a forward motion. It is usually used by the military for operations in areas withour adequate landing space.
You can only make Vitamin D by sunlight exposure on the skin, so the more skin that's exposed, the more vitamin D you make.  Also, in the summer, the skin is higher in the sky - you can more sunlight concentration on the areas of the skin that is exposed.\n\n5 minutes of summer sun in shorts would give you ample Vitamin D. In winter, depending on where you live and on how bright and clear the sunshine is and the amount of skin you have exposed, you might need 20 or 30 minutes a day.
The coriolis force is just a fictitious force that comes from trying to describe a rotating noninertial frame as an inertial frame (the centrifugal force is another one). Anytime there is a rotating noninertial frame, the motion can be more easily analyzed using the coriolis paradigm. And of course, the universe is FULL of rotating noninertial frames; planets, stars, solar systems, galaxies, etc.

"Humans have the following blood types along with their respective antigens and antibodies:\n\n    * Individuals with type A blood have red blood cells with antigen A on their surface and produce antibodies against antigen B in their blood serum. Therefore an A-negative person can only receive blood from another A-negative person or from an O-negative person.\n    * Individuals with type B blood have the opposite arrangement, antigen B on their cells and produce antibodies against antigen A in their serum. Therefore, a B-negative person can only receive blood from another B-negative person or from an O-negative person.\n    * Individuals with type AB blood have red blood cells with both antigens A and B and do not produce antibodies against either antigen in their serum. Therefore, a person with type AB-positive blood can safely receive any ABO type blood and is called a ""universal receiver"". However an AB-positive person cannot donate blood except to another AB-positive person.\n    * Individuals with type O blood have red blood cells with neither antigen but produce antibodies against both types of antigens. Therefore, a person with type O-negative blood can safely donate to a person with any ABO blood type and is called a ""universal donor"". However an O-negative person can only receive blood from another O-negative person.\n\nOverall, the O blood type is the most common blood type in the world, although in some areas, such as Sweden and Norway, the A group dominates. The A antigen is overall more common than the B antigen. Since the AB blood type requires the presence of both A and B antigens, the AB blood type is the rarest of the ABO blood types. There are known racial and geographic distributions of the ABO blood types. \n\nThe precise reason why people develop antibodies against an antigen they have never been exposed to is unknown. It is believed that some bacterial antigens are similar enough to the A and B glycoproteins, and that antibodies created against the bacteria will react to ABO-incompatible blood cells.\n\nApart from red blood cells, the ABO antigen is also expressed on the glycoprotein von Willebrand factor (vWF), which participates in hemostasis (control of bleeding). In fact, blood type O predisposes very slightly to bleeding, as vWF is degraded more rapidly. ABO antigens are also present in many other tissues such as liver, kidneys and lungs\n\nThe H antigen:\nThe A & B antigens are derived from a common precursor known as the H antigen. The H antigen is a glycosphingolipid (sphingolipid with carbohydrates bonded to the ceramide moiety) which is modified to produce the A and B antigens. In type O blood, it remains unchanged and consists of a chain of glucose, galactose, N-acetyl galactosamine, and fucose attached to the ceramide. Since it lacks N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) it is referred to as a globoside, not a ganglioside. Type A has an extra N-acetyl galactosamine bonded to the galactose near the end, while type B has a third galactose bonded to that near-end galactose."

A probe going to another galaxy may indeed find life. It could also be inellegent. The only problem is that it would (with current and planned technology) take centuries for the probes to arrive.The fastest spacecraft we have today is the one heading for pluto. It will take ten years just to get there and that's in our own solar system. There may be life elsewhere even in our own galaxy. But there are literally billions of stars just in the Milky Way Galaxy. The cost of space flight will prohibit extensive exploration, at least for the forseeable future. As for the race of hypothetical beings, It is hard to imagine that with the randomness and sheer numbers of life on earth as an example, we'd find similar beings in terms of physical appearance.\nOne more issue would be the radiation damage a space probe would incur during a flight of this duration. Even a short time in space is damaging for complex and sensative objects (human and machine). Cosmic radiation floods space with sub-atomic particles traveling at or near the speed of light. Those particles pierce and pass through what ever it is they run into (except several very dense elements). The damage occurs to the probe on a microscopic level. The eletronics, computer chips and sensors begin to look like swiss cheese after enough exposure. There may be solutions to these problems in the future, but for now they are another prohibitive factor for extensive space exploration.
Studies performed at the University of Kentucky at Lexington have clocked the Tabanid fly at ~90mph.  This is the highest recorded speed for a flying insect with the exception of deer botfly, which was recorded at 800mph.  This 800mph record has been debunked since its publication due to the exposure of poor experimental practices that proved the research to be invalid.

i think you should do your own homework.\n\nbut, a good place to start is to understand the basic idea.  ultraviolet light is higher in energy than visible light, which means that it can cause damage to living cells.  this is why you get sunburned when you go out during a sunny day - sunlight also has some ultraviolet component and the damage done to your skin cells causes your skin to get red and tender.  \n\nsince you are a big organism, the UV won't kill you - unless you stay out in very, very bright sunlight for a long time.  then you'll get seriously burned and probably get sick and possibly die from an infection.  however, a small organism like bacteria is usually only a single cell!  so the UV will damage their tissue enough to kill the bacteria.\n\ngood luck!

Both materials are natural sedimentary rocks. As hardened ancient sediments that become hard resulting from time and burial.  Both limestone and sandstone tend to break into flat layers that can be further broken into squared-off chuncks.  That squared-off shape serves well for construction. Try building a wall with round stones.  Both sandstone and limestone also  last well in the face of the elements of weather.   Sandstone is a little better at lasting against the weather than limestone, but limestone is a little easier to work with for the stone worker, since the mineral calcite which it is composed of, is softer.  Students can go to look at dated burial stones with their dates to learn how these to material stand up to the weather.   They will see that dates on monuments made of limestone and marble (composed of the same mineral) tend to become more faint with time than dates on  sandstone monuments.  Even so both sandstone and limestone monuments last hundreds of years. In dry climates such as Egypt limestone building stone such as in the Pyramids lasts nearly as well as sandstone.\n\n In brief sandstone and limestone are abundant natural materials that are long-lasting and can be easily formed into a useful squared-off shape.
"From straightdope.com:\n\n""nobody really knows. Fact is, we don't know why people yawn, period.\n\nIt was long believed you yawned when there was too much carbon dioxide and not enough oxygen in your blood. A part of your brain called the brain stem detected this and triggered the yawn reflex. Your mouth stretched wide and you inhaled deeply, shooting a jolt of oxygen into the lungs and thence to the bloodstream.\n\nSubsequently, you exhaled a lot of CO2. Often you'd stretch while yawning, which seemed to temporarily improve circulation. You yawned and stretched a lot more when you got tired because your breathing slowed down.\n\nOr so people thought. In recent years, though, a few radicals have said the preceding is all malarkey. Who knows, they say, maybe we yawn because it's too warm in the room.\n\nCecil isn't about to settle the issue here, and he doesn't need to. We merely observe that whatever yawn-inducing conditions prevail for you also apply to your friends.\n\nIf you're out late in some crowded dive, you're probably all tired, all warm under the collar, and all breathing the same stale air. You're probably all on the verge of a yawn, too, and the power of suggestion from seeing one person do it is enough to push everybody else over the edge.\n\nAdults rarely catch a case of the yawns from a child or animal, which tends to corroborate this idea.\n\nChildren usually have different sleep schedules and respiration rates from adults, so you would expect them to yawn at different times. Animals, on the other hand, often yawn not for physiological reasons but as a display of hostility, to which humans are evidently unresponsive."""
"When an object (or disturbance) moves faster than the information about it can be propagated into the surrounding fluid, fluid near the disturbance cannot react or ""get out of the way"" before the disturbance arrives. In a shock wave the properties of the fluid(density, pressure, temperature, velocity, Mach number) change almost instantaneously. Measurements of the thickness of shock waves have resulted in values approximately one order of magnitude greater than the mean free path of the gas investigated.\n\nShock waves are not sound waves; a shock wave takes the form of a very sharp change in the gas properties on the order of micro-meters in thickness. Shock waves in air are heard as a loud ""crack"" or ""snap"" noise. Over time a shock wave can change from a nonlinear wave into a linear wave, degenerating into a conventional sound wave as it heats the air and loses energy. The sound wave is heard as the familiar ""thud"" or ""thump"" of a sonic boom, commonly created by the supersonic flight of aircraft.\n\nEveryone's familiar with the sonic boom from passing jets - that's a shock wave - but so is a balloon popping!  Interesting, huh?"
"yes, it will move.  the phenomenon responsible is known as the bernoulli effect,  and its most basic statement is that ""in a flowing fluid, an increase in flow rate causes a decrease in pressure"".  what you have constructed is essentially a kind of venturi tube, which is often used to illustrate the bernoulli effect.  here is a great page about venturis and the bernoulli effect:\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~mmc1919/venturi.html\n\nso anyway, when you stir the water in the glass, it moves faster.  if the orifice is underneath a region of quickly-moving water, the pressure above the orifice will be decreased.  this will cause the ball in the tube to move towards the lower-pressure area (that is, the glass you stir).  \n\nif the orifice is in the center of the glass, then the water will not be moving very quickly, and the pressure will be higher there.  towards the outer edge of the glass, the water will be moving fast, so this will cause a relative decrease in the hydrodynamic pressure.  so, i would reason that the closer the orifice is to the edge of the glass, the greater the movement of the ball."
Fire is an energy-releasing plasma.  I think it's more correct to call it a plasma because fire dies, but the energy it liberated remains, and the plasma--meaning the ionized gases--cease to exist once the fire is dead.
This has to do with what is called diffusion.  Molecules in a gas or liquid medium spread out so that they are dispersed evenly throughout the whole medium.  As molecules in the water move around, some escape into the air.  The moecules move slower when they are cold then when they are hot.  In addition, less molecules escape when the water is cold than when it is hot.  Anyway, when the cold water molecules escape into the air, they diffuse out.  When water is hot or boiling, steam is formed.  At this rate, more water molecules escape and the ones that do move faster because they contain added energy from the heat.  The cold water molecules are fewer and slower; therefore, they take longer to diffuse to the air in and around your nose.  The hot water molecules are more numerous and move more quickly; therefore, they are quicker to diffuse to the air in and around your nose.  I hope this helps.

"72 Degrees is the temperature at which our body heat is comfortably exchanged with our surrounding environment (air).\n\nIn cold weather, like 30-40 degrees Farenheit, notice that the heat from our bodies is lost very quickly, leaving us feeling very cold, very fast.   The quickness of the exchange is relatively uncomfortable because our body cannot generate heat as quickly as it is losing it.\n\nIn warmer weather, above 72 degrees F, the opposite will happen.  Our bodies generate the same amount of heat, but we can't cool off fast enough.   That's why we start to sweat (a body cooling method), pant like dogs, and start looking for shade and cool showers..  We are trying to get rid of that ""extra"" heat.   \n\nSo 72 is the ideal temp at which our bodies are in balance with our environment.   Not too hot, but not too cold either."

The simplest explanation:\n\nA seismograph is just basically a pen on a spring (although now days this is replaced by a sensor) It measures ground motion. Earthquakes, nuclear weapons tests, the impact of waves striking the coast, the rumble of trucks on a highway, volcanoes and many other things can result in ground motion that a seismograph can measure. Seismologists looking for oil can use vibrating trucks or underground explosions to send waves into the ground that seismographs can measure, and turn into pictures of what the earth looks like underground.  \n\nOf course, this can get far more complicated. Some seismographs can measure lower frequencies, even using superconductivity, etc. Seismographs really measure ground acceleration, which is the second derivative of ground displacement.
"Antimatter or contra-terrene matter is matter that is composed of the antiparticles of those that constitute normal matter. If a particle and its antiparticle come in contact with each other, the two annihilate and produce a burst of energy, which results in the production of other particles and antiparticles or electromagnetic radiation. In these reactions, rest mass is not conserved, although (as in any other reaction) energy (E=mc²) is conserved.\n\n\nIn 1928 Paul Dirac developed a relativistic equation for the electron, now known as the Dirac equation. Curiously, the equation was found to have negative energy solutions in addition to the normal positive ones. This presented a problem, as electrons tend toward the lowest possible energy level; energies of negative infinity are nonsensical. As a way of getting around this, Dirac proposed that the vacuum can be considered a ""sea"" of negative energy, the Dirac sea. Any electrons would therefore have to sit on top of the sea.\n\nThinking further, Dirac found that a ""hole"" in the sea would have a positive charge. At first he thought that this was the proton, but Hermann Weyl pointed out the hole should have the same mass as the electron. The existence of this particle, the positron, was confirmed experimentally in 1932 by Carl D. Anderson.\n\nToday's standard model shows that every particle has an antiparticle, for which each additive quantum number has the negative of the value it has for the normal matter particle. The sign reversal applies only to quantum numbers (properties) which are additive, such as charge, but not to mass, for example. The positron has the opposite charge but the same mass as the electron. An atom of antihydrogen is composed of a negatively-charged antiproton being orbited by a positively-charged positron .\nNotation\nPhysicists need a notation to distinguish particles from antiparticles. One way is to denote an antiparticle by adding a bar (or macron) over the symbol for the particle. For example, the proton and antiproton are denoted as  and , respectively.\n\nAnother convention is to distinguish particles by their electric charge. Thus, the electron and positron are denoted simply as e− and e+. Adding a bar over the e+ symbol would be redundant and is not done.\n\nAntimatter as fuel\nIn antimatter-matter collisions, the entire rest mass of the particles is converted to energy. The energy per unit mass is about 10 orders of magnitude greater than chemical energy, and about 2 orders of magnitude greater than nuclear energy that can be liberated today using chemical reactions or nuclear fission/fusion. The reaction of 1 kg of antimatter with 1 kg of matter would produce 1.8×1017 J (180 petajoules) of energy (by the equation E=mc²). In contrast, burning a kilogram of gasoline produces 4.2×107 J, and nuclear fusion of a kilogram of hydrogen would produce 2.6×1015 J. Not all of that energy can be utilized by any realistic technology, because as much as 50% of energy produced in reactions between nucleons and antinucleons is carried away by neutrinos, so, for all intents and purposes, it can be considered lost.[2]\n\nThe scarcity of antimatter means that it is not readily available to be used as fuel, although it could be used in antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion. Generating a single antiproton is immensely difficult and requires particle accelerators and vast amounts of energy—millions of times more than is released after it is annihilated with ordinary matter, due to inefficiencies in the process. Known methods of producing antimatter from energy also produce an equal amount of normal matter, so the theoretical limit is that half of the input energy is converted to antimatter. Counterbalancing this, when antimatter annihilates with ordinary matter, energy equal to twice the mass of the antimatter is liberated—so energy storage in the form of antimatter could (in theory) be 100% efficient. Antimatter production"
No one knows for certain why the human population is right-handed-dominant, but a number of theories have been proposed.\n\nBrain hemisphere division of labor is the most commonly accepted theory of handedness. The premise of this theory is that since both speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, having one hemisphere of the brain do both would be more efficient than having it divided up. And since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness would prevail. It also predicts that left-handed people would have a reversed brain division of labor. Lastly, since other primates do not have a spoken language (at least of the type we have) there would be no stimulus for right-handed preference among them, and that is true.\n\nObjections to this theory claim that it does not explain why the left hemisphere would always be the one controlling language. Why not 50% of the population left and 50% right? While 95% of right-handers do indeed use the left side of the brain for speaking, it is more variable for left-handers. Some do use the right for linguistic skills, some use the left hemisphere, and others use both. On the balance, it appears that this theory could well explain some left-handedness, but it has too many gaps to explain all left-handedness.\n\nThere are more than genetics involved in determining if a person is right- or left-handed Even when both parents are left-handed, there is only a 26% chance of their child being left-handed. Thus, it is clear that genetics is not the only cause. Handedness must also be influenced by some other causes.\n\nBirth stress is theory that states disturbs certain left-handed people, because its basic premise is that left-handedness is due to brain damage during the birth process. Nevertheless, some statistics do back this theory up.\n\nParental pressure theory explains right-handed dominance by claiming that since the parents who raised us are mostly right-handed, we came to be mostly right-handed and so on.
Numerology is the study of the purported mystical or esoteric relationship between numbers and the character or action of physical objects and living things.\n\nNumerology and numerological divination were popular among early mathematicians such as Pythagoras, but are no longer considered to be part of mathematics and are now regarded as pseudomathematics by most mathematicians. This is similar to the historical development of astronomy from astrology, and that of chemistry from alchemy.
Well... when a mommy elementry subject and a daddy elementry subject really love each other, they get some wine, and they drink it, and get under the covers, and then call the stork.
yes, it does.  \n\nhere's how evaporation works: the molecules of the water are bouncing around and colliding with each other, randomly changing direction and speed all the time.  when one molecule near the surface randomly gets a kick towards the surface (if it's moving fast enough to overcome the strength of hydrogen bonding) it will exit the condensed water and literally come shooting out of the liquid and into the air.  \n\nthe reverse process (condensation) happens at the same time - water molecules in the atmosphere will randomly go shooting into the surface of the liquid, where they are captured by water's hydrogen bonds.  if the air is humid enough, this will happen at the same rate as evaporation and the result will be called a dynamic equilibrium - water is evaporating and condensing in equal amounts and the water level will appear static.\n\nanyway, if you turn the temperature of the water up, the molecules move faster.  this is how we interpret the meaning of temperature on the microscopic level.  so, faster-moving molecules are more likely to overcome the hydrogen bonding, and therefore more often escape the water's surface, which results in faster evaporation.
the faster the streams velocity is, the quicker the erosion takes place.  this is caused by increased friction as velocity increases.\n\nit's sort of like falling from a plane.  you go faster and faster, and as your velocity increases, so does the friction.  soon, you'll hit terminal velocity, or the point where you are no longer accelerating.  the force of friction with the air eventually will equal out with the force of you falling, but still, as you get going faster there is more friction.\n\nthis friction causes the erosion and so the faster the velocity the more the rocks, soil, etc. erodes.

If you removed enzymes from the body, it would stop working and die! Enzymes are responsible for the functions of every organ. The body is a big efficient chemical factory and enzymes are needed for every chemical action and reaction.\n\nEvery gene's program is associated with the actions of enzymes. Even vitamins and nutrients can't be used effectively without enzymes.\n\nThe immune system's function is to fight off all foreign invaders in the body such as bacteria, viruses, carcinogens and other chemicals. It relies almost totally on enzymes to do its job. A weakened immune system has a diminished volume of enzymes which includes those that are defective or worn out. Enzymes have a limited life and must be replaced regularly.\n\nWhere do we get enzymes? Nine basic enzymes come from food, and the body takes these and changes them into over 3,000 varieties for various purposes.

It's exactly what it sound like. To make water pure.\n\nIt's important because the bacteria and chemicals in water can make you sick. Water from rivers and streams may look clean, but they are not.\n\nWater can be purified by several ways:\n- Filtering. Like the Brita or PuR water filters. Water goes through the filters while bacteria, dirt, and some chemicals get trapped in the filter.\n- Boiling. It kills most of the bacteria which can make you sick, but does not remove dirt or chemicals.\n- Distilling. Similar to boiling, but you take the steam from boiling water and turn it back into water. Best form of purification in my opinion, but takes a long time and requires special equipment.\n- Chemical purification. Used by the military. You add a chemical to the water. This chemical kills the bacteria and makes the other chemicals in the water harmless. The water may be safe to drink, but it will taste awful.

"If you're talking strictly telegraph, then it's just the tapping of metal on metal.\n\nEvery time the sender presses the key down, he closes an electrical circuit and when he releases the key, it breaks the circuit. It's similar to flipping the light switch on and off.\n\nIf the sender's key is down, it sends electricity through the telegraph wires to the receiver. The electricity energizes an electric-magnet, which pulls down a small hammer on the receiver's side. This results in a ""tap"" sound. When the sender releases the key, the electricity is shut off, cutting power to the electric-magnet. A spring then pulls the hammer back up to its starting position where it's ready to tap again when the sender presses the key."
The larger crystals in granite tell us that it formed deep underground.  Geologists call such rocks intrusive igneous rocks.  Insulated from the coolness of earth's surface, the molten rock (magma--molten rock underground) cooled slowly and the crystals had time to grow large.  Basalt flowed onto earth's surface as molten rock (lava--molten rock on earth's surface) and there it cooled quickly, so the crystals had little time to grow.  Geologists call such rocks extrusive igneous rocks.\n\nThere are other differences between granites and basalts, but I think speed of cooling, related to where the molten rock cooled, answers your question.

There are many ways to do this. \n\n1. Engineers pour the concrete into metal forms, and remove the forms when the concrete dries.\n\n2. Another way is to temporarily divert the whole river through a side channel or tunnel, but I think this is usually done only when they want to build a dam across it.\n\n3. They can put a temporary barrier across a part of the river to build the foundations there, then build another temporary barrier across a different part of the river to build the next foundations, and so on till all the foundations are build.  \n\n4. Some rivers flow seasonally, so they just wait till it is not flowing to build the bridge.
When viewed under a high-powered microscope, good bacteria and bad bacteria have distinctly visible markers.  Good bacteria are characterized by a little happy smiley-face, located on the front or even the top of each such organism.  On the other hand, bad bacteria have a tiny, mean frowny-face.  Don't be confused by the use of these highly technical terms; that's just how it is done by bacteria professionals.  \n\nNow you know.
In one year there are 365 days of 24 hours. Each hour has 60 minutes and each minute is 60 seconds long. So, 60s/min x 60min/hr x 24hr/day x 365days equals 31,536,000s. This many seconds is an even larger number than the number of miles light goes in one second! It would take you three years to get to number 31,536,000 if you could write one number per second for eight hours per day. This many miles means you could go back and forth across the United States over one thousand times! At 60 miles per hour it would take you 60 years! \n\nSo, we take these two very large numbers and multiply them together to see how many miles light can travel in one year. You can tell already that this is going to be huge! That number is 5,865,696,000,000. Working eight hours per day at a rate of one number per second it would take you two hundred thousand years to get to number 5,865,696,000,000! This gets you across the United States two billion times which at our average speed of 60 miles per hour, would take nine trillion years! \n\nNow that you know what the distance is that light travels in one year you can also know the distance between objects in the universe. The closest star to us is about four light years away. This means that it is 23,462,784,000,000 miles away. How about this: the edge of the universe is about 15 billion light years away from us! Can you even imagine how many miles away that is?

Mitosis  is the method used for cell division and reproduction in cells not involved in sexual reproduction. This process starts with one replication (copying of the chromosome material) and one division of the chromosome material.   This results in the chromosome numbers in the two cells produced being the same as in the parent cell. Sexual involves getting genetic material from 2 parent cells.Mitosis  is associated with asexual reproduction, as well as growth and repair in sexually reproducing organisms. The offspring of mitosis are clones of the parent cell.
Two people with type A blood cannot produce a child with type B blood, but they can produce a child with type O blood.\n\nIn blood type, A and B are co-dominant, and O is recessive.  You inherit a gene from each of your parents, and they must both be O in order for you to have type O blood.  The same is not true with A and B.  Those types show themselves if you only inherit one gene for either one.\n\nIn your example, both parents have type A blood.  The possible gene combinations (or genotypes) to produce type A blood are AA and AO.  If two people who are both AO have a child, and both parents donate the O to their offspring, the offspring will have type O blood.\n\nWhen it comes to rh factor (the + and -), + is dominant, and - is recessive.  An A+ and A- couple can produce an O- child if the A+ parent carries the - gene.\n\nOne thing to note is that if we're talking about a real life example, be very concerned about the rh factor of the mother and the child.  If the mother has a different rh factor from the child, there could be serious problems with the pregnancy.\n\nI hope that was not overly complicated for you.
Bone consists of a chemical mixture of inorganic salts (65 to 70 per cent) and various organic substances (30 to 35 per cent) and is both hard and elastic. Its hardness is derived from inorganic constituents, principally calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate, with small amounts of fluorides, sulphates, and chlorides; its elasticity is derived from such organic substances as gelatin, collagen, and traces of elastin, cellular material, and fats. Internal tubular structures called Haversian canals contain nerve tissues and blood vessels that provide bones with organic nourishment. Surrounding these canals is a somewhat porous tissue composed of thin plates, known as lamellae, and usually containing cavities filled with a network of connective tissue called marrow or myeloid tissue. Bone marrow accounts for from 2 to 5 per cent of the body weight of a person and consists of tissue of two types. Yellow bone marrow is made up principally of fat, and red bone marrow is tissue in which red and white blood cells and blood platelets originate. The external portions of bones, enclosing all the components mentioned above, include the compact and hardest of all bone tissue, which is in turn generally sheathed by a vascular, fibrous membrane known as the periosteum.

It is a way of using x-rays to see the structure of a crystal:\n\nCrystals are three dimensional ordered structures than can be described as a repetition of identical unit cells. The unit cell is made up of the smallest possible volume that when repeated, is representative of the entire crystal. \n\nUsing visible light, it will never be possible to see atoms under even the most powerful of microscopes. In order for an object to be seen, its size needs to be at least half the wavelength of the light being used to see it. Since visible light has a wavelength much longer that the distance between atoms it is useless to see molecules. In order to see molecules it is necessary to use a form of electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength on the order of bond lengths, such as X-rays.
"In formal scientific terms, a black hole is called a ""singularity.""  It is a point.  The spherical object often thought of as a black hole is the ""event horizon"" that is centered on the singularity.\n\nThe event horizon is the sphere within which the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light; nothing can exceed the speed of light, so nothing can get out of the event horizon.  \n\nHowever, black holes emit ""Hawking radiation,"" as follows.  ""Consider a virtual electron-positron pair produced just outside the event horizon. Once the pair is created, the intense curvature of spacetime of the black hole can put energy into the pair. Thus the pair can become non-virtual; the electron does not fall back into the hole. There are many possible fates for the pair. Consider one of them: the positron falls into the black hole and the electron escapes. According to Feynman's view we can describe this as follows:\nThe electron crosses the event horizon travelling backwards in time, scatters, and then radiates away from the black hole travelling forwards in time."" [see the fourth link]\n\nBlack holes loose mass by emitting Hawking radiation until all the mass has been radiated.  (Remember that mass can be converted to energy according to E = m x c^2.)  \n\nWhen you do the math, it turns out that each black hole will ""evaporate"" to nothing within a certain time that depends upon its mass, larger black holes having longer lifespans.\n\nA black hole that initially weighs 2 x 10^5 kg (200  metric tonnes) will live one second.  A black hole having a mass equal to the sun will live 10^67 years. (Assuming the Universe does not end before then!)\n\nSo, the short answer to your question is that the mass that falls into a black hole is converted to energy and radiated into space by the black hole."

"The use of ""da"" is for ""deka"" or ""deca"" meaning ten (10), so 1 daNm = 10 Nm. It was very common to use daN in engineering works as a daN is very close to a kg of force (in earth at least). 1 daNm = 0.980665 kgm. Just remember that this kg are force or weight, not mass."
If it is a battery powered radio you should be able to pull it out without getting shocked (unless it's using some pretty powerful batteries).

You'd have to hire a structural engineer to safely design a bridge for a car.  Also, you'd need to have an engineer assign a flow (Q) value for a given rain event based on the 200 acres.  The Q is a result of the type of landuse upstream.  Then given the dimentions of the channel you'll know how high the water elevation will be given a certain storm event, thus the high of the bridge.\n\nI'd contact the local municipality engineering department to find what the requirements (rain event, freeboard) are for flow and structures.  There might also be an easement on the ditch.  If that's the case, you might not be able to construct a thing.

"A Swiss clockmaker in the employ of the Duke of Hesse-Kassel, first conceived of logarithms. The method of natural logarithms was first propounded in 1614, in a book entitled Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio, by John Napier (c. 1550 - 1618; Latinized Neperus), Baron of Merchiston in Scotland, four years after the publication of his memorable invention. This method contributed to the advance of science, and especially of astronomy, by making some difficult calculations possible. Prior to the advent of calculators and computers, it was constantly used in surveying, navigation, and other branches of practical mathematics. It supplanted the more involved prosthaphaeresis, which relied on trigonometric identities, as a quick method of computing products. Besides their usefulness in computation, logarithms also fill an important place in the higher theoretical mathematics.\n\nAt first, Napier called logarithms ""artificial numbers"" and antilogarithms ""natural numbers"". Later, Napier formed the word logarithm, a portmanteau, to mean a number that indicates a ratio: λoγoς (logos) meaning ratio, and αριθμoς (arithmos) meaning number. Napier chose that because the difference of two logarithms determines the ratio of the numbers for which they stand, so that an arithmetic series of logarithms corresponds to a geometric series of numbers. The term antilogarithm was introduced in the 1800s and, while convenient, its use was never widespread."

In most respects, they're pretty close.  (Details of the 747 vary by model.)\n\nThe wingspan of the 747-400ER, a current model, is over 211 feet.  The wingspan of the Galaxy (C-5a) is about 223 feet.\n\nThe 747-400ER is about 232 feet long.  The Galaxy is about 247 feet long.\n\nThe heights are about the same, at almost 64 feet for the 747-400ER and about 65 feet for the Galaxy.\n\nThe maximum takeoff weight for the 747-400ER is 910,000 pounds; for the Galaxy, it's 840,000.\n\nBoeing has announced a bigger version of the 747, the 747-8.  It will have a wingspan of almost 225 feet, a length of as much as 250 feet, and a height between 63 and 64 feet.  The maximum takeoff weight will be 960,000 pounds.\n\nBut, even though the new 747 will be definitely bigger, it still won't have the cool front-and-rear cargo ramps and a cargo bay big enough to drive a tank through, like the Galaxy does.
Of those choices the most obvious answer would be D. Arson.  A Spectrograph is used for chemical analysis.  In this type of scenario, 1. Where did the fire originate.  2. In what pattern did the fire burn. 3. How was the fire started.  4. What accelerant or catalyst was used in the  starting/spreading of the burned area.  We could go into this much deeper but I think those are the basic questions that a Spectrograph is used to help answer.

A liquid is said to be in equlibrium when no net external force acts on it.But in equlibrium condition its molecule as always are in random motion.These hav some maas and hence momentum(mxv).If now we assume an imaginary surface in liquid.These molecule collide with the surface an hece momentum change.Rate of change of momentum is force.And force on that particular area is Pressure(F/A).This pressure is manifested as liquid as liquid pressure\nPascal law states that if external pressure is exerted on any part of liquid then it is equally transmitted throughout the liquid.suppose we consider 2 points at same depth(at same depth pressure is equal).Point 1 has surface area A and 2 has surface area B,then if F force acts on A(i.e.Pressure=F/A) then this pressure will be transmitted to 2.since area of 2 is B so force experienced be F'(pressure=F'/B).Now mathamatically \n            F/A=F'/B
A transformer usually has two windings denoted as HV(High Voltage) and LV(Low voltage) windings. The transformer is used to transfer the power fromn one voltage source to another. So the same transformer can be used as a Step Up / Step down transformer. For e.g , assume you have a transformer whose H.V winding is rated for 11 KV and L.V winding is rated for 6.6 KV. If you connect a 6.6 KV source to the L.V winding then you get a 11 KV output at the H.V winding - this is a step up application.\nSimilarly , if the source available was 11 KV , then by connecting it to the H.V winding you get a 6.6 KV output at the L.V winding - this is a step down application. \nHence, the same transformer can be used for step up / step down. It depends on the source/input voltage available at site.

To answer your question I really need to know more specifically what you are asking.\n \nDo you mean compromise acutely during the operation or chronically in the post-op setting? Do you mean compromise to all the tissues of the body or only those tissues at or distal to the operative site.\n\nIn general signs of inadequate oxygen (hypoxia) under anesthesia depend on the severity of the hypoxia. Lactic acidosis would be evident via blood gas analysis. As the hypoxia progressed changes in the EKG would begin to manifest ultimately leading to cardiac arrest. Signs of severe hypoxia that had occured in the operative setting include possible changes (temporary or permanent) to every organ system including:\n\nneuro:loss of mental capacity, seizures,blindness\nPulmonary: post hypoxic syndrome \nGI: bowel ischemia \nGU: renal failure, ATN\nHepatic: failure, elevated transaminases\nCardiac: EKG changes, muscle necrosis\n\nOngoing compromise of oxygen delivery in the post-op setting (in the absense of pulmonary disease) is of course a function of blood flow. The signs and symptoms of inadequate blood flow also depend on the severity of the same. If mild- delayed healing might manifest. If severe- changes in color, temperature, cap refill, and pulse volume would manifest as well as possible numbness or tingling distal to the site. \n\nThe problem is that most hip replacements occur in the senior population.

It is actually possible, but you really, really would not want it:\nThey can take a brain out of the casing, but think of it, they'd have to cut all nerval connections to the body: eyes, spine etc. \nThe brain might conceivable be kept alive, properly fixed to a machine that pumps oxygenated and nutrient-enriched blood to the brain, but what would you do then? This actually has been done to a few pitiful lab animals.\nYou would definitely need to hook the brain up to a body again, it would need hormonal regulation (we cannot completely reproduce the body in a lab) but how would you do that in any meaningful way? You would end up with a brain hooked up to the circulation system of a prone body without any sensory or muscular connection - we cannot yet get nerves to reconnect as we want them, else spinal cord injuries could be fixed. So you'd only end up with a terminally isolated brain without any sensory input and without any ability to communicate - sheer hell. For all practical purposes, you'd have a body and a brain worse than dead.

Now this is a tough question to answer without using a little physiology lingo. Unlike skeletal muscle, which is under voluntary control, the heart is an involuntary muscle. Most of us cannot just tell our heart to slow down or speed up. The beating frequency (heart rate) is controlled by the balance of stimulation coming from the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the Autonomic Nervous System. Both nervous imputs to the heart converge on a small area of tissue on the right atrium called the Sino-atrial node. Parasympathetic (rest and recover) stimulation tends to slow down the rate, while sympathetic (fight or flight) input increases the rate (and the force of contraction). Normally, there is a balance between the two inputs leaning toward the parasympathetic side. However, even without any nervous input, the heart will beat automatically due to some unique features of its membrane physiology. This intrinsic rate is quite slow however (about 20 bpm). A purely parasympathetic stimulation will result in a heart rate of about 30. So the average untrained person has a resting heart rate of about 70 as a result of some constant sympathetic stimulation. With training, the balance between parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation tends to shift in favour of the parasympathetic, resulting in a slower resting heart rate. Elite endurance athletes may have resting HRs of 35 to 40. \nThe part of the brain behind this and breathing is called the Medulla.\n\nIt is the caudal-most part of the brainstem and contains many sensory (ascending) and motor (descending) tracts. The pyramid is an example of the latter. Structures that are linked with the cerebellum and part of the reticular formation are also in the medulla.\n\nCertain groups of neurons in the reticular formation control respiration, and the cranial nerve important for maintaining an open airway and controlling heart rate is located here.\n\nThus, if the integrity of the medulla is compromised, vital functions are compromised and death often results.

From what I understood in your question is that you have two objects (two frames of references), S and S'.\n\nEach are side by side, the first object is moving at a constant velocity, u, along the +y axis.  Meanwhile, S' moves at a constant velocity, v, at some angle away away from the y axis in the +x direction such that S and S' stay parallel with eachother.\n\nDiagram:\n\nS------S'\nS----S'\nS---S'\nS--S'\nS-S'\nSS'\n\nYour question did not mention that either object was travelig anywhere near the speed of light, so we can use ordinary Newtonain relativity for this.\n\nIt is just common sense that since S' is moving at an angle away from S and yet stays parallel, it must be moving faster...but how much faster.\nWe know that the +y velocity is S (u) much eqaul the +y velocity of S' (v).  So we know that,\nv*cos(angle) = u\nor to rearrange,\ncos(angle) = u/v,\nso angle = cos^-1(u/v)

For motion with friction it is because static friction is almost always greater than kinetic friction.  A good example is a book on a table, it takes more force to cause it to move than to keep it in motion, try it!  This is the reason that force in motion is smaller than starting motion.

Do you know about intermolecular forces? \nThere are four types of intermolecular forces (how attached one molecule is to another molecule) that you have to worry about: \n1. London dispersion\n2. Dipole-dipole\n3. Hydrogen bonding\n4. Ion-Dipole\nThese four are listed in order of increasing strength.  \n\nNow, when intermolecular forces are high, the molecules are really stuck to each other.  Such is the case in water molecules, H2O. This molecule experiences hydrogen bonding, which is a strong intermolecular force.  That's why water exists as liquid under normal conditions.  \n\nHowever, CO2 molecules (carbon dioxide) only experience London dispersion, the weakest form of intermolecular forces.  This is why carbon dioxide is a gas.  \n\nNow, we can make liquid molecules like water break away from each other if we supply the molecules with enough energy to do so.  We can do this by heating water until it starts boiling, which is, by definition, when water becomes gas.
"From wikipedia:\n\n""Centrifugal force (from Latin centrum ""center"" and fugere ""to flee"") is a term which may refer to two different forces which are related to rotation. Both of them are oriented away from the axis of rotation, but the object on which they are exerted differs.\n\nThe reactive centrifugal force is the reaction to the the centripetal force. This is equal in magnitude to the centripetal force, directed away from the center of rotation, and is exerted by the rotating object upon the object which exerts the centripetal force. As it is an actual force, it is always present, independent of the choice of reference frame. ""\n\nIn terms of the earth's rotation about the sun, the magnitude of earth's centrifugal force is the gravitational attraction between the earth and sun.  Its direction is the vector from the middle of the sun to the middle of the earth (actually, from the center of gravity of each).\n\nIn terms of an object on the earth's surface or in orbit about the earth, the centrifugal force is, again, equal to the force of gravitational attraction between the earth and the object.  The direction of the force is from the earth's center through the object."

There are a few explainations.\n\n1.) Fly Ash is much cheaper than cement.  With the prices of natural gas and the fact that production of cement requires a rotary kiln that is heated by natural gas the cost of cement has gone through the roof.  From my understanding a ton of cement has increased in price by like 20% over the last year or so.\n\n2.) Fly Ash is a natural pozzulan and water reducer.  Fly ash lowers the water requirements of the concrete mix making for a much stronger concrete.  Fly ash slows early strength gains but increases late strength gains as well as increasing workability.  Think of it like this.  You put rocks in a jar and there's voids, then you fill in those voids with sand, water, and cement but there's still small voids so you use fly ash to fill those in.  You can still have voids and use other things to fill those in but that's for another question.\n\n3.) Fly Ash is a waste material (from coal fired power plants i believe don't quote me).  The federal government requires its use in some of its projects or at the very least recommends it.  It is considered a green material and i read an article in Concrete Construction magazine (Jan 2006 issue) about HVFA (high volume fly ash) mixes.  They will replace like 51% of the cement with Fly Ash in the mix and get tremendous late strengths out of the concrete.\n\nThese are three of the main reason's for the use of fly ash.  As sustainable building (green construction) continues to gain backing you'll probably find more use of fly ash in concrete.  Also with it being cheaper people will want it used.\n\nStrictly speaking Fly Ash DOES NOT increase the density of the concrete.  Fly Ash has a specific gravity of about 2.00 (meaning for a given volume it weighs 2 times the same volume of water), Cement has a specific gravity of about 3.15.  If you have 3 cubic feet of cement then it will weigh 589.68 pounds (3 x 62.4 x 3.15).  If you substitue 1.5 cubic feet of that for Fly Ash then you will have [(1.5 x 62.4 x 2.00)+(1.5 x 62.4 x 3.15)] or 187.2 + 294.84 = 482.04 lbs. (a cubic foot of water weighs 62.4 pounds i believe).  Fly ash actually lowers the unit weight of the concrete, because for a given volume it weighs 63.5% of what portland cement does.

"First, pour the eight quarts of water from the eight quart container into the radiator.  Then, pour the four quarts of anti-freeze from the four quart container into the ""now empty"" eight quart container.  Empty enough water from the radiator to continue filling the eight quart container, there will be four quarts left in the radiator, but the eight quart container will contain a 50% mixture.  Finally, empty the remaining four quarts of water from the radiator into the ""now empty"" four quart container, then pour the eight quarts of 50% mixture into the radiator.\n\nNow, you still need to put in four quarts of 50% mixture.  Pour the four quarts of water that is left into the eight quart container, then add another four quarts to make it a 50% mixture again, and mix well.  Pour half of that mixture into the radiator and you now have twelve quarts of 50% mixture in the radiator and four quarts of 50% mixture left over."

A Theory of Everything (TOE) is the name given to attempts to view the four fundamental forces of the universe: \n\n1. gravity\n2. electromagnetism\n3. the weak force (responsible for radioactivity)\n4. the strong force (keeps the atomic nucleus together) \n\nas just different aspects of the same thing. This was worked on by Einstein towards the end of his life for quite a few years. So far, forces 1&2 have been reliably unified (as electromagnetism was the theory resulting when electricity and magnetism were unified). The unification of 1,2 and 3 looks like it might have been done, but has not yet been verified completely. There are many theories to unify all 4 of the forces, including the recent varieties of string theory, but no one knows how to check these.
"Scolopendra gigantea, commonly identified to as ‘Peruvian giant yellowleg centipede’ or ‘Amazonian giant centipede’, is the world's largest representative of scolopendras which can reach lengths of up to 26 cm. The species inhabits the North and West regions of South America and the islands of Trinidad and Jamaica. It feeds on lizards, frogs and birds. The body consists of 21-23 segments which is ‘coppery red’ or maroon in color and comprises of up to 23 pairs of yellow-tinted legs (with one pair per body segment); the legs are adapted for fast walking (even running) and for holding tight the prey before poisoning and killing it.\n\nThe centipede has modified claws which curve around its head and can deliver venom into its prey to help the immobilization of it. The venom is toxic to humans (the poison contains acetylocholine, histamine, and serotonin) and causes a local sharp pain (similar to a hornet-sting), and severe swelling, chills, fever (up to 39º), weakness.\n\nS. gigantea is a popular pet among arthropod fanatics – however the centipede should not be handled without protective equipment given that even a trace of the venom coming in contact with skin can cause a reaction. The condition of having been poisoned by the venom of a centipede in the genus Scolopendra is called scolopendrism.\n\nFemale S. gigantea centipedes exhibit parental care, guarding and tending their nests of eggs. Juveniles are very dark red or black in color, and very thin with large spherical red heads. They molt several times before reaching adult size.\n\nRetrieved from ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scolopendra_gigantea"""

Like many other insects, the body of an army ant has a head, thorax and abdomen. The head has a mouth, eyes and antennae. The mouth has two jaws called mandibles that are like scissors. Still, army ants can only swallow liquids because the solids form a ball that the ant spits out. Unlike other ants, army ants do not have compound eyes, but instead have single eyes (but they are still blind). Army ants use their antennae to sense smell and touch. This is how they know which colony and nest they belong to. They use their antennae to communicate as well. The thorax is connected to the head by joints called nodes. The thorax is between the head and abdomen. It is connected to the abdomen by a narrow waist called the petiole. The abdomen is in the shape of an oval. That is where the stomach, large intestine, sting, etc. are located.
"This is a very interesting question. There are obviously many complicated processes going on in a living creature that can be described as physical and chemical processes, and we are slowly starting to understand them. \n\nHowever, is it possible to produce artificial life by just producing the correct machinery? Or is there something else involved? There is progress being made towards imitating the systems we observe in nature in the laboratory. Will they be alive in the same way? What about more advanced life forms? What is consciousness anyway? Does it come spontaneously with a certain structure or does it take something else?\n\nI do not think anyone really knows yet. However, there are probably strong theological arguments why the actual ""life spark"" or ""consciousness"" requires some sort of supernatural intervention. In the next few decades, we will probably get much closer to answering this question."

A Servo is a small device that has an output shaft. This shaft can be positioned to specific angular positions by sending the servo a coded signal. As long as the coded signal exists on the input line, the servo will maintain the angular position of the shaft. As the coded signal changes, the angular position of the shaft changes. In practice, servos are used in radio controlled airplanes to position control surfaces like the elevators and rudders. They are also used in radio controlled cars, puppets, and of course, robots.

"Hi. This question has already been asked here, both in the Science and in the Religion categories.  The best answer I can provide is the same I gave then.\n\nOh no, not this question again. Why doesn't anybody use the Search button?\nLet me address two separate issues (the first part is modified from another answer):\n1) The pattern of evolutionary processes that can be seen (in the fossil record and living species)can be of two types: \nIn _anagenetic_ (meaning ""that generate upward movement"") events, an entire population evolves in one direction and becomes so different that at some point the people who study it give it a different name. This is encountered in paleontological research and the decision to separate one from the other is ultimately arbitrary. \n_Cladogenetic_ (meaning ""that generates branches"") events entail a population that splits into different sub-groups; each of these then evolves independently from the others. We share A COMMON ANCESTOR with living apes, but we have not evolved from them directly. \nOur direct ancestors are fossil hominid species. \nAll the species that are living today have their separate evolution and history; also they all (including humans) share common ancestors from which they (we) have inherited our common traits. And apes have their own ancestors that are closer to them than to Homo sapiens; the fact that apes are our closest living relatives does not exclude the existence of more related _extinct_ relatives.\n\n2) What you're stating is one of the arguments that many creationist use, namely, that change within a species (adaptation, i.e. microevolution) is possible (they are astute in not denying this, because the proofs are overwhelming!), but a species cannot transform into another (macroevolution). \nThis is based on a mistaken concept of ""species"". Most people think in terms of the biological species concept, which is based on reproductive isolation. That is, individuals of each species cannot hybridize succesfully with individuals of other species. However, there is not a single path for the rise of the mechanisms for recognition or isolation that we perceive as the ""real boundaries"" of a species. What the taxonomist calls a species may respond to different species concepts (such as morphological, evolutionary, biological (isolation), paleontological, recognition, etc,), and there are many examples of populations in which speciation (total isolation) is on the way, and there's a thin line between ""subspecies"" or ""geographical races"" and valid species (just ask an expert in systematics, which I am not). \nEvolutionary processes are long-term phenomena, and it may seem that there are ""evolutionary leaps"" from one species to the other. But although there are particular cases of ""instantaneous speciation"", most of the ""leaps"" are due to the fragmentary nature of the fossil record. So many populations become extinct or become something else and their former existence is not recorded anywhere! But although the record is fragmentary, life is continuous.\n\nSorry for the lengthy answer, I hope you find it useful."

Atoms that burn in the solid state are usually in molecular state. When they are burnt, combustion process, it is breakage of molecular state: to release atomic state (free radicles or ions). Afree radicle is a neutral atom with unpaired electrons. Like ions free radicles are also unstable and radily combine with another atom or ion to form a stable molecule. In combustion CO2, CO and H2O are main products besides other. Natural gas and many other gases are few examples but for solid state coal and wood are two important examples. Then Oxygen atoms combine to the burning substance to give new substance. For Example:\ni-   Coal as C atoms\nii-  Molecular Oxygen as O2 converting to 2O\niii- C+2O----CO2
Comets are hard, compact bodies of ice and dust that orbit the sun. Commonly found on eliptical orbits that take anything from a few years to thousands of years to complete. As a comet gets nearer to the sun a tail of gas becomes visible and appears longer nearer the sun.\n\nThe best known is Halley's comet and Hale-Bopp. The latter being clearly visible in the night sky over Britain about 10 years ago. Comet Hale-Bopp is very unusual in that it has two tails instead of the normal one.\n\nComets are remnants of the formation of the universe billions of years ago. Most comets originate in an area of space known as the Oort Cloud.

Depends on whether you're talking about Physics or Philosophy. Physics says yes. Philosophy says no.
The position of the noon Sun varies throughout the year.  During the summer months it can be located as much as 23.5 degrees above (or north of ) the celestial equator and in winter the same angle below (or south of) the celestial equator.  \n\nFirst you have to know the latitude of each of these places to find out the position of the celestial equator in the sky.  \n\nLatitudes\nEquator = 0 degrees\nTropic of Cancer = 23.5 N\nTropic of Capricorn = 23.5 S \nDana Point, CA = about 34 N\n\nSo the altitudes of the celestial equator at these positions is 90 minus latitude.\n\nAltitude of celestial equators\nEquator = 90 degrees\nTropic of Cancer = 66.5 from south horizon\nTropic of Capricorn = 66.5 from north horizon \nDana Point, CA = about 56 degrees from south horizon\n\nOn the vernal and autumnal equinoxes the position of the noon Sun is on the celestial equator.  So just look at the above list to read off the altitude.\n\nOn the summer (winter) solstice the position of the noon Sun is 23.5 north (south) of the celstial equator.  So just add or subtract 23.5 degrees from the list above of altitudes.  For example Dana point:\n\nAltitude of noon Sun on the first day of \nSpring = 56 degress from south horizon\nSummer = 79.5 (56+23.5) degress from south horizon\nAutumn = 56 degress from south horizon\nWinter = 32.5 (56-23.5) degress from south horizon\n\nHope that was clear

Well, they go through sexual reproduction, and like the last guy said, they go into a mating ball.  However, its not always many males with females...that depends on the species. Sometimes its just one male and one female.  The male inserts his hemipene into the anal opening of the female and finding the vagina, releases sperm.

I agree.. It's so arrogant of us to think that there isn't life in other planets.
Relative humidity is the moisture content of air relative to the temperature. Warmer air can hold more moisture (measured in grains) than cold air. If you have 70 degree air at 90 percent humidity and the temperature suddenly dropped to 50 degrees, the humidity level would rise to 100 percent. This is called the saturation or dew point. when the humidity is at 100 percent the air can hold no more moisture and it begins to condensate (fog, dew, rain) until the relative humidity drops below 100 percent. When you wake up and it is foggy (air is at dewpoint) and in a while the sun warms the air and the fog clears, this is an example of a drop in relative humidity.
this question take us to the cause of gravitational force, acco0rding to Einstein the time-space cojunction is bended nearby mases, and of course it is bended more near the higher mases. so when ane body fall in the time-space bendind for another mass it will be forced to take certain tracks by time-space bending so it begin to rotate in an ecliptical tracks arround the other body (like earth orbiting the sun). the principle of equivalence says that also light is forced to take certain tracks too near by masses for the same reason, this principle was proofed in 1919 during a famous solar eclipse, they observed some stars in the day near the eclipted sun and found that its position was little shifted (indeed the comming light from these stars curved by the mass of the sun) and this causes a famous astronommical phenomena called Gravitational Lenses which you can find some photos and comments about it in Internet.\ni hope that i could give you the benefit, Regards.

Depends on where you live and how large an area the forecast covers.  Forecasts are for large areas and within those areas are microclimates determined by geography such as mountains, passes, large bodies of water (oceans, lakes, bays), altitude, et cetera.\n\nWhen I was a kid in Pennsylvania, the snow would always track north or south of where we lived so while other schools would get snow days, we'd only get an hour or two of snow delay.\n\nI watch the weather forecasts in the Northern California Sierras these days.  Just travelling up and down the mountain and in and out of town can change how much snow I see.  Sometimes the forecasters call for snow and we don't get as much.\n\nThe computer models can only provide a probability of snow and not forecast exact amounts in any given location.
"This is probably very hard to determine. You have to define the criteria for ""best"" first. Most famous graduates? Most successful graduates? Highest fraction of successful graduates? Biggest research grants? Most number of patents from faculty? Greatest number of publications per faculty member? \n\nInstitutions rise and fall with time. A very good school 100 years ago might not be so good now. And vice versa. And engineering is a broad discipline. What type of engineering? Some schools might be great in electrical engineering, and awful in mechanical engineering, or vice versa. And what exactly is engineering? Where is the boundary between engineering and chemistry, physics, applied mathematics, statistics, etc? Some schools might be great at practical engineering, but very weak in the theoretical aspects, and vice versa. The number of criteria one could consider could be very long, with hundreds or thousands of items. \n\nAnd even then, one would have a lot of disagreement. Even producing a list of the 100 best in the world would be quite challenging, and there would be lots of controversy."
Actually we can´t yet explain the existance of Uranus and Neptune.

I think U know the making of Infrared.\nBut I tell U\nWhen we heat any material, it's electrons gets exited to high energy levels by getting some energy and when they came back to their original orbit then they release this energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation.\nInfrared is one of the elecromagnetic radiation and when it falls at a material, it causes vibration to it. By this physical work the material gets heated.
A nice open question and so much to talk about! Where to begin???\n\nOk I'll talk about what happens when you drive away in a car. The acceleration needed for a car to move from standstill is proportional to the force applied (by the engine). While you have a force from the engine pushing the car forwards, there are always opposing forces - such as friction from the air, the axles and tyres. These reduce the amount by which the car accelerates away. When you pull away you start in 1st gear (usually). This is so that the car has enough power to pull away. A car could not pull away in its highest gear for example. This is because in a low gear, the input speed (from the engine) is converted into such a speed which allows the car to pull away. You can only go slowly in this gear, but at least you can pull away with plenty of power. For higher gears, your car will tend to be already in motion (i.e. it has momentum). It does not therefore require much power to allow an increase in speed. So high gears are good for high speeds, but the car finds it harder to pull away.\n\nWhen you are travelling at a constant speed, the forces are balanced, so the force that the engine applies is equal to the opposing forces such as friction. It is important to quote Newton's 1st law - a body will continue in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force. This applies in the above situation but friction complicates the matter. Say there was no friction, then for the car to travel at constant speed, no force would need to be applied (ever) once it had reached that constant speed.\n\nIf you need to use the brakes to come to a stop, these use friction to slow you down. Typically disc brakes are connected to the wheel and pads press on the discs to slow the wheels (and therefore the car) down. The brakes use a hydraulic system which only needs the driver to apply a small pressure on the pedal for the pads to exert a larger pressure on the discs. This happens because the freedom of movement in the brake pedal is long, whereas it is small in the brake pads. This difference allows a much larger pressure to be applied to the brake discs. Also note that road surface conditions and tyre conditions have a considerable effect on the braking distance - ice and water increase braking distance considerably. Some cars use an anti-lock braking system which works by releasing the tyres when skidding is detected so that the tyre will gain grip followed by more braking. This technique helps to decrease braking distances. \n\nI could go on but I must stop now!
"Salt actually lowers the freezing point of water.  So when it's 25 degrees out, at the usual temperature of 32, the water freezes.  But when you add the salt to the roads, the water's freezing point drops below 32 degrees and thus, the ice ""melts""."
3/18. Just multiply the numerator of one fraction by that of the other. Do the same with the denominator. 1x3=3 over 2x9=18. Since 3 and 18 are both divisible by 3, divide each by 3. The final answer: 1/6.

Plasmid containing pCMV-GFP was propagated in transformed Escherichia coli cells. E coli cells were grown in standard Luria Bertani medium at pH 7.0 to a cell density of ~3 to 4 × 109 cells/mL. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and the plasmid DNA was extracted and purified using a Qiagen Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) as per the manufacturer’s recommended protocols. In brief, the plasmid purification procedure involved alkaline hydrolysis of the cells and isolation of the plasmid by binding to an anion-exchange resin of proprietary composition. The concentration of the purified plasmid preparation was 0.87 µg/µL determined using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (SpectraMax Plus, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) using OD260 (optical density at wavelength 260 nm). The OD260/OD280 ratio was 1.964, indicating that the plasmid preparation was sufficiently pure and could be used for transfection purposes. Standard agarose gel electrophoresis on a 0.8% wt/wt agarose gel was conducted to investigate the plasmid structural integrity and revealed 2 major bands. The high-mobility band was attributed to the most compact or supercoiled form of plasmid DNA. The other band with low mobility indicated the overall nonsupercoil content in the plasmid preparation.\n\nFormation of DNA-Anionic Liposome Complexes\n\nFor a single transfection experiment, 225 ng of DNA was diluted into a liposome suspension equivalent to 40 µg lipid in a centrifuge tube. Anionic lipoplex formation was achieved by addition of calcium chloride solution. Ca2+ ions were introduced into the formulation using stock solution of a 2 M calcium chloride solution that had been previously filter sterilized through a 0.2-µm filter. The amount of plasmid DNA was identical in all experiments irrespective of the Ca2+ concentrations (~7 mM to 132 mM) introduced into each complexation tube. The final volume of the lipoplex suspension applied to the cells was 300 µL. The complexes were incubated for 25 minutes at room temperature.

"Democritus first suggested the existence of the atom but it took almost two millennia before the atom was placed on a solid foothold as a fundamental chemical object by John Dalton (1766-1844). Although two centuries old, Dalton's atomic theory remains valid in modern chemical thought.    Dalton's Atomic Theory:\n\n1) All matter is made of atoms. Atoms are indivisible and indestructible.\n\n2) All atoms of a given element are identical in mass and properties\n\n3) Compounds are formed by a combination of two or more different kinds of atoms.\n\n4) A chemical reaction is a rearrangement of atoms. \n \n\n\nModern atomic theory is, of course, a little more involved than Dalton's theory but the essence of Dalton's theory remains valid. Today we know that atoms can be destroyed via nuclear reactions but not by chemical reactions. Also, there are different kinds of atoms (differing by their masses) within an element that are known as ""isotopes"", but isotopes of an element have the same chemical properties.\n\nMany heretofore unexplained chemical phenomena were quickly explained by Dalton with his theory. Dalton's theory quickly became the theoretical foundation in chemistry."

The freezing point of a pure substance can be derived from a cooling curve plotting the temperature versus time.\n\nAs energy is taken out of a liquid, its temperature falls.  When the temperature reaches the freezing point of the substance, energy is taken out, but the temperature remains constant.  At this point, the cooling curve levels out this is quite evident when looking at the graph.\n\nThis leveling off effect is seen because in order for the substance to free, additional energy must be removed from the liquid, this is called the latent heat of fusion.  After the substance is frozen, the temperature of the solid can continue to drop.\n{this same effect can also be seen as something melt, boils, condenses, or sublimes}

The classical symptoms of meningitis are headache, neck stiffness and photophobia (intolerance of bright light); the trio is called meningism. Fever and chills are often present, along with myalgia. An altered state of consciousness or other neurological deficits may be present depending on the severity of the disease. In meningococcal meningitis or septicaemia, a petechial rash may appear. A lumbar puncture to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is usually indicated to determine the cause and direct appropriate treatment.\n\nConvulsions and hydrocephalus are known complications of meningitis. If symptoms occur see a doctor urgently as treatment needs to occur early to be effective.

hai,\nThis is a very simple question. The study of soil and it's components is called as soil science.Seed sowing is a method to grow plants.U can sow seeds and they'll sprout into seedlings. If this grows into a whole plant without any change in environment(u need'nt change it's soil or amount of water u supply to it) it is called a non=transplanting plant.If U are tranplanting a plant u should remove the seedling and plant it in a new environment.Ex. Paddy must be transplanted from a environment with more water to a environment with moderate water after 2-4 weeks of sowing. This is called as Transplantation.\nHope U satisfied with this short reply.
The positives can be stained, the others can't. The staining possibility is an advantage for further research under a microscope. There is even more to it because Gram-positive bacteria belong to a separate phylum different from the Gram negatives.  The stain becomes possible by a high amount of peptidoglycan in the cell wall, which typically, but not always lacks the secondary membrane and lipopolysaccharide layer found in Gram-negative bacteria
It doesn't really have a purpose in the since that a firefighter has a purpose, but there are consequences of its being there.\n\nThe moon formed when the proto-earth was hit by a Mars sized asteroid during the very early years of the solar system - about 4.5 to 5 billion years ago. The resulting collision knocked a bunch of stuff into orbit around the Earth. That stuff quickly accreted together and the moon was formed.\n\nBecause the Earth has a (relatively speaking) large satellite there are a couple of consequences. Tides are the obvious one. But more important is that the gravitational attraction between the Earth and the Moon provide a weak link, but enough of a link that the Moon stabilizes the Earth's rotation. Right now our axis of rotation is about 23.5 degress tilted with respect to our orbital plane. It has probably always been close to this. \n\nWithout a large Moon, the small gravitational tugs from the other planets can lead to an instability where the axis of rotation (relatively) suddenly shifts - maybe from 23 degress to 85 degrees. This sort of jump has probably happened on Mars.\n\nIt is quite possible - though this is speculative - that because the Earth has never had its axis shift a great deal that the climate has always been stable enough for animals and plants. \n\nIn other words, without the Moon, it is quite possible that only algae and other primitive creatures would exist on Earth.

"God. (cheating) This explanation is what everyone eventually resorts to when the other answers fail. Now, before I go any further, I should make clear that I'm not talking about any of the gods defined in various religions. Throughout all of human history, we've been trying to explain existence. But nobody has ever succeeded. And it's likely that nobody ever will. So we create the concept of God, whose only necessary property is being ""that which explains existence."" \n\nThis doesn't tell us much about god, though. It doesn't mean that any particular religion is correct. It merely defines god as something which answers The Question, because we have not been able to."

'There are two general types of reproduction, asexual and sexual. Asexual reproduction involves only one parent, the offspring of which have chromosomes identical to those of the parent. Sexual reproduction generally involves two parents, each of which contributes half the chromosomes to the offspring. In the normal body cells of diploid organisms the chromosomes occur in pairs – one set being derived from the male parent and the other from the female parent. The two chromosomes of a pair are called homologous chromosomes. Thus each body cell in humans contains 46 chromosomes – 22 matched pairs from either parent, and one pair of sex chromosomes. In most animals, including humans, there are two kinds of sex chromosomes: X chromosomes, which are similar in size to the other chromosomes, and the smaller Y chromosomes. A combination of two X chromosomes gives a female, while one X and one Y chromosome gives a male'.

Initially called a Dewar flask, it was created by placing one bottle inside another bottle and then fusing the two mouth together. The air trapped in between the two bottles is removed, creating a vacuum. You think air is a bad heat transferer, a vacuum is even worse. That solves heat convection. To beat heat radiation, the sides of the inner bottle are coated in a reflective surface (it looks like aluminum/glass to me). Last, heat conduction is stopped by using cork or rubber (also a bad conductor) for the cap.

I don't think it is a planet since it doesn't have much in common with the other eight planets.  However I don't feel it is an asteriod for the same reason.  I think that the best description is a Kuiper Belt object.  These are objects located on the outer edge of the solar system that resemble large comets but never get close to the Sun.  Pluto has much in common with these objects but just happens to be one the the largest and closest.
The links will give you more information. Here are two  brief overviews:\n\n   Sickle cell anemia is an inherited form of anemia — a condition in which there aren't enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout your body.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, your red blood cells are flexible and round, and they move easily through your blood vessels to carry oxygen to all parts of your body. In people with sickle cell anemia, the red blood cells become rigid and sticky and are shaped like sickles or crescent moons. These irregular-shaped blood cells die prematurely, resulting in a chronic shortage of red blood cells. Plus, they can get stuck when traveling through small blood vessels, which can slow or block blood flow and oxygen to certain parts of the body. This produces pain and can lead to serious complications.\n\nThere's no cure for most people with sickle cell anemia. However, treatments can relieve pain and prevent further problems.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nSickle cell anemia is an inherited blood disorder characterized primarily by chronic anemia and periodic episodes of pain. The underlying problem involves hemoglobin, a component of red blood cells. Hemoglobin molecules in each red blood cell carry oxygen from the lungs to body organs and tissues and bring carbon dioxide back to the lungs. \n\nIn sickle cell anemia, the hemoglobin is defective. After hemoglobin molecules give up their oxygen, some may cluster together and form long, rod-like structures. These structures cause red blood cells to become stiff and assume a sickle shape. \n\nUnlike normal red cells, which are usually smooth and donut-shaped, sickled red cells cannot squeeze through small blood vessels. Instead, they stack up and cause blockages that deprive organs and tissues of oxygen-carrying blood. This process produces periodic episodes of pain and ultimately can damage tissues and vital organs and lead to other serious medical problems. Normal red blood cells live about 120 days in the bloodstream, but sickled red cells die after about 10 to 20 days. Because they cannot be replaced fast enough, the blood is chronically short of red blood cells, a condition called anemia.

Lead(II) hydroxide\n\nPb is lead, the roman numeral II (2) indicates the charge of the lead, and OH is hydroxide.  Incidentally, everyone so far has missed the II, which is what distingishes Pb(OH)2 from Pb(OH)4 or lead (IV) hydroxide.\n\nPlumbous hydroxide is the old school name (sorry, but plumbium hydroxide is just plain wrong).  Plumbous comes from the latin word plumbium, meaning lead, which is also where that atomic symbol for lead (Pl) comes from.  Interestingly, Pb(OH)4 is commonly refered to by its old name, plumbic acid.\n\nRizza, lead carbonate would be PbCO3.

Respiratory rate is in part controlled by the person's overall metabolic rate.  All of the body metabolic processes impact each other.  Breathing can and does change if you body becomes acidic or basic.\n\nBoth breathing and metabolism slow with age as the body goes through normal changes. This is the same reason that a 20 year old can eat 3500 Calories of food and not gain weight.  The same person at age 45 would likely have a slower metabolism and if they could eat that much would likely gain a lot of weight.
The reasons for this are unclear; however, recent research suggests that yawning might be a herd instinct. Other theories suggest that the yawn serves to synchronize mood behavior among gregarious animals, similar to the howling of the wolf pack during a full moon. It signals tiredness to other members of the group in order to synchronize sleeping patterns and periods of activity. With humans the infectiousness of yawning might suggest that this is a behavioral pattern not deleted through evolution.

Well fertility has to do with how many babies, or new people, there are. Death lowers the amount of people we have. Migration is when people come to another place, affecting the amount of people there. Good environmental conditions can raise fertility, people like to move to nice areas, and crappy areas might cause death, if there is too much radiation, smog, etc.

Parabolae show up everywhere in the world around us. For example:\n\n1. The reflecting mirror at the back of a headlight is a parabola. \n\n2. Parabolae are used to describe the trajectories of projectiles. \n\n3. Satellite dishes are parabolae. \n\n4. The surface of a fluid that is being rotated is a parabola. \n\n5. The microphones used to pick up distant sounds, like those on a football field, have a parabolic reflector behind them. \n\n6. The equation for the stopping distance of a car as a function of speed is a parabola. \n\n7.

Not much.  Assuming of course that light and vision still worked the same at that level, you actually would see very little when you looked up.  Most of the atom is empty space.  It would be like standing in the middle of a football field trying to see a bb in the stands.
Surveying is the mapping of the land surface in three dimensions.  Usually a grid is set up in the area of interest.  A person with a surveying scope measures the distance to a target which the 2nd person in the surveying team is holding at a specific point on the grid.  They determine the distance between the points and the angle of elevation which can be used later to calculate the 3 D position of the point.  The very first point on the survey is the reference point, and all other measurements refer back to that one point.  They continue to take measurements at the intersection of the lines of the grid, and end up plotting these points with computer programs.  \n\nRoad surveying, however, may not focus on grid points, but be specific points on the road itself.  They may need to determine where the on ramp precisely intersects the higway, or where bridge pilings are, etc.  These intense feature-driven surveys are usually needed to scope out areas for new construction or modifications to existing construction.\n\nTopographical maps are 2 dimensional plots of points with different heights.  If you connect a dot between all the points with the same heights, you can visualize mountains and depressions on a 2D paper, and find out where flood zones are and which way water will flow.  \n\nCheck out the USGS for explanations of maps and cartography, etc.  The basics are a linear measuring tape, a surveying scope to determine angles of elevation, and a second person to hold the target.  Hope this helps!!
The least amount of time, would always be better. It would generally depend on the Physciatrist perscribing them. If you are referring to how long it takes to be effective, most take 6-8 weeks to get to a therapeutic level on the average...some take longer or quicker depending on the type and the person. Remember that antidepressants don't cure anything...they are a supplement to take, while you are working on your issues. You can actually improve chemical brain functioning by positive thinking!
I wouldn't use nuclear weapons.  Maybe nuclear power.  That depends though.  It might not be safe to use nuclear power or energy on certain planets due to the atmosphere.
Another question asked by a teacher who doesn't know the subject she is trying to teach. \n\nAll plants can hold water in their stem. Even rainforest plants commonly store water in their stems.\n\nSome of the most spectacular water holding plants are the tea trees of Tropical Australia.  These trees mostly grow seasonal wetlands in areas that are literally flooded for part of the year and receive little rain  for the rest of the year. The trees are capable of holding several hundred litres of water  in bulging hollows in their trunks. What makes this so spectacular is that water exists as free water. It simply sits in a hollow in the wood, and if the wood is cut the water gushes out.  Aboriginal people obtained water during the dry months by cutting holes in the stems to drain the water.\n\nCacti, boabs and a range of other plants can also store large amounts of water in their stems, but none store it as large masses of free water as the tea trees do. Instead the water is held in the cells or the  vessel elements\n\n\n>>>>How does it help the plant?\n\nIt allows the plant to survive through periods when water is scarce. Most plants only store enough water to last for a few days while desert plants or plants from seasonally dry environments like the tea trees can store sufficient water to see them through weeks or months.
some say that the universe exists alternately and simultaneously in 10 and 26 dimensions, with the extra dimensions being coiled up inside the vibrating strings, so small we can't see them. the reason for those numbers of dimensions is so the equations don't wind up dividing by zero and becoming useless.

human dead bodies are treated by a process called embalming in which 2-4% concentration formalin is used. this can either be injected into the blood vessels if the last rites of the body are to be performed otherwise the bodies are kept in containers filled with formalin if they are required for anatomical studies.since formalin is as aqueous solution of formaldehyde, the chemical formular for formaldehyde is HCOH a compound made commonly by oxidation of methyl alcohol.

"Well, simply put, crossing over is what happens when the pair of homologous chromosomes contact each other, their DNA strands (=arms) become attached and some bits of genetic information are exchanged. Then the homologous chromosomes separate; notice that each is slightly different than it was before, because of the new information.\nThis process does not occur in ordinary body cells (otherwise our genetic composition would be variable), but only during the production of gametes (=reproductive cells). After separating, those two ""changed"" chromosomes that formed a pair in the parental cell will each go to a different gamete.  Thus, instead of having the exact same composition as the parent's cells, some of the gametes will be different. When a gamete combines with another to form a new being, there can always be novel combinations.\nPrecisely one of the advantages of sexual reproduction is the production of variability.\n\nHomologous = matched because each comes from one of the parents (one was in the egg and the other in the spermatozoid) and they have information for the same traits\n\nChromosome =  discrete packages of DNA; they're not visible during most of the cell's life, they only become denser at cell reproduction.\n\nI think the best way to explain this process would be to build a model using kiddie dough with different colors. It doesn't have to be complex, see the illustration at the link."
As cells differentiate, certain genes are silenced.  This silencing is done by modifying the histones (a sort of protein spool about which DNA is wrapped) and making the DNA rather bunched up, and inaccessible to the transcrition factors and promoters that activate a gene.  The totipotent cell requires that none of its genes are thus silenced, while cells with a silenced gene will see the same silencing in its daughter cells.
logcfu refers to the number of colony forming units of a bacteria, to work out the g/ml you need to know the weight of the bacteria. As its the g/ml I guess you're looking at wet weight. The average weight of a bacteria is 9.5E-13 g [1]. Then you have to consider the size of the colony, it is normally assumed (for simplicity) that the bacteria have been diluted, so that they could be counted, to the extent that 1 bacteria = 1 cfu. Essentially this means that cfu*9.5E-13 = g/ml\n\nHope this helps

< i·o·dine (ī'ə-dīn', -dĭn, -dēn') \nn.\n(Symbol I)2 A lustrous, grayish-black, corrosive, poisonous halogen element having radioactive isotopes, especially I 131, used as a medical tracer and in thyroid disease diagnosis and therapy. Iodine compounds are used as germicides, antiseptics, and dyes. Atomic number 53; atomic weight 126.9045; melting point 113.5°C; boiling point 184.35°C; specific gravity (solid, at 20°C) 4.93; valence 1, 3, 5, 7. \nA liquid containing iodine dissolved in ethyl alcohol, used as an antiseptic for wounds.\n[French iode, iodine (from Greek ioeidēs, violet-colored : ion, violet + -oeidēs, -oid) + –INE2.]\n\n\niodine (ī'ədīn, –dĭn) [Gr.,=violet], nonmetallic chemical element; symbol I; at. no. 53; at. wt. 126.9045; m.p. 113.5°C; b.p. 184.35°C; sp. gr. 4.93 at 20°C; valence −1, +1, +3, +5, or +7. Iodine is a dark-gray to purple-black, lustrous, solid element with a rhombic crystalline structure. It is the least active of the halogens, which are found in group VIIa of the periodic table. It is normally diatomic, i.e., it has 2 iodine atoms in each molecule, in the solid, liquid, and vapor states. When heated it passes directly from the solid to the vapor state (sublimation), the vapor having an intense violet color and a characteristic irritating odor. Iodine is only slightly soluble in water but dissolves readily in a solution of sodium or potassium iodide. Tincture of iodine is a solution of iodine and potassium iodide in alcohol. Iodine also dissolves in carbon disulfide, carbon tetrachloride, and chloroform, giving a deep violet solution. Iodine forms many compounds. With hydrogen it forms hydrogen iodide, which in water solution becomes hydriodic acid. It forms compounds with certain nonmetals (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and oxygen) and with most metals. Iodine is displaced from its compounds by the other halogens. The element is obtained from salt deposits, as from the saltpeter beds in Chile, where it occurs in small quantities as an iodate, and from the salt brines associated with some oil wells in California and Louisiana. It is also found as an iodide in the ash of certain seaweeds. Iodine may be prepared by displacement from its compounds with chlorine. Treating an iodide with manganese dioxide and sulfuric acid sublimes the iodine. Iodine is important in medical treatment; tincture of iodine and iodoform are widely used. Iodine is employed in the preparation of certain drugs and in the manufacture of some dyes. Silver iodide, a yellow salt, is used in photography; it is water insoluble and turns black when exposed to light. Starch turns deep blue (almost black) in the presence of a small amount of iodine; this reaction serves as a test for either starch or iodine. Iodine in small amounts is essential to human nutrition; in the thyroid gland it becomes a part of the iodine-containing hormones. Goiter, a swelling of the thyroid, is often a symptom of inadequate iodine in the diet. Iodine has only one stable isotope, iodine–127; it is the only isotope of iodine occurring in nature, although 24 iodine isotopes are known. Iodine–131 is a radioactive isotope with a half-life of 8 days. It is used medically to diagnose abnormalities of the thyroid gland. It is also a component of fallout produced by nuclear explosions. Iodine was discovered in 1811 by Bernard Courtois.

<It depends on the species and age.The Leatherback is the largest, measuring six or seven feet (2 m) in length at maturity, and three to five feet (1 to 1.5 m) in width, weighing up to 1300 pounds (600 kg).

Friction occurs anytime there is resistance when two objects touch.  \n\nThe rougher the texture of an object, the more friction it can produce.  All the little tiny rough spots catch on each other (imagine running your hand over, say, a piece of sandpaper...you can feel the grains of sand catching at your hand; it's a lot different than running your hand over something smooth, like polished metal)  The rough surfaces catch at each other and stick together.  That's friction.\n\nFriction is the reason we can walk on the ground - otherwise, we'd slip and slide everywhere, as if we were on ice.  (Really, really slippery ice :p)\nFor another example, when you're driving down the road, friction between your tires and the road is what keeps your wheels rolling along.  \nIf you hit a patch of ice, and your wheels slip, it's because there's not enough friction to overcome the force of your wheels turning.  Ice is slippery - there's less friction between tires and ice than tires and the paved road.

1. At the neuromuscular juncture, ACh released by the synaptic terminal binds to receptors on the sarcolemma.\n\n2. The resulting change in the transmembrane potential of the muscle fiber leads to the production of action petential that spreads across the entire surface of the muscle fiber and along the T tubules.\n\n3.The sarcoplasmic reticulum releases stored calcium ions, increasing the calcium concentration of the sarcoplasm in and around the sarcomeres.\n\n4. Calcium ions bind to triponin, producing a change in the orientation of the troponin-tropomyosin complex that exposes active sites on the thin filaments (actin).  Cross-bridges form when myosin heads bind to the active sites on F actin.\n\n5. The contraction begins as repeated cycles of cross-bridge binding, pivoting, and detatchment occur, powered by the hydrolysis of ATP.  These events produce filament sliding, and the muscle fiber shortens.

I'm assuming that you are talking about two sequences a(sub n) and b(sub n) but are you talking about the sequence converging or the series converging.\n\nThe sequence does not necessarily converge. For example, let a = 1, b = -1, the a^2 = b^2 = 1 (for all n) but ab alternates between -1 and +1, so it doesn't converge.\n\nIf you are talking about the series where a(sub n)^2 is the nth term, then it goes like this:\n\nIf a^2 and b^2 both converge, then you can add the two series together, so (a^2 +b^2) converges, too.\n\n|ab| < max(a^2, b^2) < (a^2 + b^2) so ab converges.

Most vertebrates have their own internal milieu, that is, we maintain constant concentrations of ions and water that are different from those of the environment. This is achieved by means of the osmoregulatory system, which includes the kidneys but also, in the case of fishes, special excretory tissues in the gill area.\nSome fishes (cartilaginous ones) do indeed maintain a high internal concentration of salts as part of their osmoregulatory mechanism:  it's not sodium chloride, however, but urea, and therefore their meat is stronger-tasting and has a salty smell.

- Respect for the original plant cover. A native biome is there for a reason and usually represents the best balance between soil, climate and biotic factors.\n- Reforestation in case the original plant cover is removed. This may include planting trees, bushes or herbs, whatever is more adequate; also not removing the natural vegetation of ditches and irrigation channels, which prevents the soil from being carried away by the water.\n- Environmentally-friendly agricultural techniques (less heavy machinery, zero tillage, etc.)\n- Avoid heavy trampling (by machinery, vehicles, cattle, etc), because it causes soil compaction, inhibiting the growth of plant roots and thus exposing the soil to erosive factors.\n- Sustainable agriculture also implies healthy irrigation methods. Excessive or badly distributed irrigation may lead to salinization, desertization and increased vulnerability to wind and water erosion.\n- Care for the soil fauna and flora. The geobios (living organisms in the soil) are absolutely essential for normal soil fuctions. Interruption of their processes and cycles leads to faster degradation.\n- Hire engineers with common sense and provide thorough Environmental Impact Studies before building roads, bridges, channels, or anything else.  \n- Above all, respecting the limits for production in any given soil and being aware of the timescale necessary for normal soil functioning.

The earliest cars (and even wagons) used front-wheel steering and rear-wheel steering would have to have enough advantages to overcome that early start.  The mechanical steering mechanism is more direct for front-wheel steering even after adding power steering.  The vast literature and experience favors front wheel steering, including racing cars.  The interaction of steering, suspension, tire action, over and under-steering are not trivial effects.\n\nA huge ship uses a rudder for rear end steering and must move the stern all the way to port or starboard, the full length of the ship, to make a right-angle turn.  This might prove difficult for a car in traffic let alone a huge semi.  Of course long fire engine ladder trucks do use both front and rear steering to maneuver sharp corners, but not at maximum speeds.\n\nLastly, in most cars the heavy engine is up front and an important part of steering is to get that huge mass moving in a different direction.  The weight of the engine produces greater loads on the front tires that better grip for steering.\n\nAs with a ship, the shorter the car the more practical would be rear-wheel steering and a small car with two front tires and a rear engine and only one rear tire might do just fine.

The short reason: \n\nTo cool the ice cream and keep it from melting, because salt water and ice is cooler than ice or ice and water.   \n\n\nThe more detailed reason:\n\nSalt water has a lower freezing point than regular water.\n \nIce is never just one temperature, and the molecules of ice always have a distribution of speeds. The fastest molecules are the warmest ones, and the ones closest to melting. If the ice is in equilibrium with some water, the coldest water molecules will be freezing at the same rate as the fastest ice molecules are melting. \n\nNow introduce some salt. This upsets the equilibrium because now fewer water molecules will freeze, since the freezing point of salt water is lower. The ice will melt faster than the water will freeze. As ice melts, it absorbs energy from the environment (called the heat of fusion). So one is creating a system where heat is absorbed from the surroundings of the salt water and ice mixture. \n\nThis salt water and ice mixture can be used to cool the ice cream. Ice cream freezes at about 25 degrees F, so one needs more than just ice at 32 degrees F to make ice cream, and to keep it frozen. \n\nAn aside:\n\nA salt water and ice mixture will cool down to about 0 degrees F (-18 degrees C). At the time Fahrenheit devised his scale, was the coldest temperature that could be produced in the laboratory (that is why it became zero degrees). Fahrenheit also intended to make 100 degrees the temperature of a normal average healthy human body on his scale (it is really 98.6 degrees F), but he got it wrong (obviously).
Passive transport is a transport that doens't require energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). ex are diffusion, facilitated diffusion and osmosis.\n\nActive transport is the movement of substancecs across membranes, which requires energy in the form of ATP.

Ok. 'Biotic' comes from bio=life, living. \n'Action', I'm supposing you know what that is. \n'Inter' is a prefix that indicates, in this case, reciprocal.\nThe reciprocal interactions among living things are extremely diverse. For simplification purposes, ecologists tend to classify them in a few basic categories. For instance, what you're doing by coming to this board and trying to get an answer here is pretty much like _parasitism_. You're taking up our time, that is, it's a loss for us, a gain for you. If, on the other hand, you were willing to give some information in exchange for this one, we could reach a _mutualistic_ interaction. Both participants have a net gain. If somehow we found that we could not live without each other, that would be _obligate mutualism_, although some people call it _symbiosis_. \nIf a rare computer virus chose your computer to spread to the world and destroyed it in the meantime, that would be _parasitoidism_. \n\nI'm sure you can take it from here! Please look for biological examples, these ones won't work.\n\nPD: I'm actually gaining two points, so what type of biotic interaction would that be?

The sun supplies endless free energy.  People place solar collectors of roofs to collect it and heat water and use banks of photovoltaic cells on their roofs to generate electricity.  In some countries people use reflector ovens to collect solar energy and cook food.  The devices aren't free but the energy is.  Solar energy even warms the earth and oceans and lights the skies, except at night.  The earth is a huge light switch.  I guess that's a free energy device.

I would say an isotherm is a line connecting points having the same temperature.\n\nAnd the heat equator is the great circle lying just underneath the sun in a given short time period. To keep it thin, we'll pick one day and say the sun's rays are vertical at all points of the circle when it is noon at each of those points.\n\nThis equator would thus divide the earth into two equally heated halves over the given time period.\n\nDifference:  Temperatures not necessarily uniform along the heat equator, but are the same along an isotherm.\n\nBut I have not been through college, nor been trained with respect to these definitions, so I might be wrong.\n\nSometimes things can be arbitrary rather than appealing to some logical sense; however, that is less frequent in scientific disciplines.

Electromagnetic fields cause both ions and electrons to move about.  This can produce heat, damaging effects, or even severe injury depending on the strength and frequency of the EMFs.\n\nIons are very important to various physiological processes, same for electron transfer.  \n\nToo much heat damages cells.\n\nTime, distance, shielding and field intensity are important factors in limiting the damages.\n\nUnder certain circumstances EMF can slowly cook a person.\n\nThere are stories about Navy people using Target Acquisition (Fire Control) radars to cook seagulls in flight.\n\nNuclear radiation can affect the nuclei of atoms in addition to the effects for EMF.\n\nYes, EMF is a type of potentially harmful radiation.  Gamma rays and light are powerful varieties of EMF.\n\nEven weak or slow EMF at lower frequencies can sometimes produce headaches and disorientation.\n\nCows in pastures have been adversely affected from both overhead and underground power lines.\n\nDeath is possible.\n\nWe live in a sea of weak EMFs.  Strong exposures can occur from nearby antennas, especially those used for broadcasting or relaying communications via radio or microwave.\n\nThere are meters available for monitoring EMF intensities.\n\nThe ionosphere and ozone layers of the atmosphere protect us from damaging rays from space.\n\nTV cameras must be wrapped in aluminum foil in some bad EMF areas.\n\nI live in a mobile home, this affords some protection too.\n\nGenerally microwaves and other shorter, more powerful wavelengths are more damaging.\n\nSunburn is a form of EMF damage.  Similarly you can see in medical work burns from other types of EMF exposure.
The 3 4 5 rule is an easy way to mark a right angle in the field.  The ancients, even before Pythagorus, discovered that if you took a length of rope and knotted it so that one side was three of whatever units, the second side was four of whatever units, and the third side was five of whatever units, then you would get a right angle.  Devices using the 3 4 5 rule were used in ancient construction -- including the pyramids of Egypt.

Hypercomplex numbers, better known as Quaternions, were discovered by Hamilton in the nineteenth century. It had long been appreciated that the real numbers have a geometrical interpretation as points lying on a line, and that the complex numbers have a similar geometrical interpretation as points lying in a plane.\nAs Hamilton pointed out in a paper in 1833, the addition symbol used in the Cartesian representation of a complex number \n\na+ib,\n\nis somewhat misleading, since a real and purely imaginary number cannot be directly added together arithmetically. \nA more suitable representation might be as an ordered pair of real numbers \n\n(a,b),\n\ntogether with a set of manipulation rules that define how to perform operations like addition and multiplication of these pairs.
Your integumentary system plays a minimal role in homeostasis. Mainly it acts as a barrier preventing infection among other things. Sweat glands are contained in this system but are controlled by autonomic systems. I am not sure what you are asking, if it is temperature then the answer is that your vasculature is the main control point
There is a diurnal pattern since plants also have oxygen-consuming metabolism. The morning has the least available oxygen because there has been no production during the darkness, but there sure has been consumption. The afternoon has the highest diurnal oxygen levels (assuming evenly spread cloud cover), as the setting sun will reach fewer plant surfaces than the midday sun. Come the darkness, only consumption remains, except for buffering in highly productive water bodies (which may build up an oxygen concentration greater than equilibrium with the air, and slowly return to equilibrium over night).

It usually comes through the maternal line (the 'mother') in plants too. \n\nYou may not realise it but plant have mothers and fathers just like animals. The pollen represents the 'father' plant, the ovaries representing the mother plant are concealed within the flower. The seeds that give rise to new plants develop from a combination of the pollen and ovaries. Thus plants have fathers and mothers.\n\nThe idea that mitochondria come from the mother isn't entirely correct even for animals. Mitochondria usually come from the mother, but they sometimes come from the father, and occasionally from both parents. Plants are much the same, but it is even more common to find plants with paternal mitochondria.

"There is a rectangle, 6x8 inside of a larger rectangle.  The distance between the inner and outer is ""x"", and we're assuming it's uniform all the way around.\n\nSo the 6ft side of the rectangle has x on the left and x on the right, so the total side is 6 + 2x.  The 8ft side has x on top and x on bottom, or 8 + 2x total.\n\nArea is length * width, and you know total area, border and all, is 100.\n\n100 = (6+2x)(8+2x)\n\n100 = 48 + 28x + 4x^2 <--- you can divide through by 4 here\n\n25 = 12 + 7x + x^2; make the equation = 0 by subtracting 25 from both sides, and reorder a bit:\n\n0 = x^2 + 7x - 13\n\nNow use quadratic formula to solve for x; when ax^2 + bx + c = 0; x = [-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)]/2a\n\nso for x^2 + 7x - 13 = 0 a is 1; b is 7; and c is -13\n\nx = [-7 +/- sqrt(7^2 - (4)(1)(-13)]/2*1 \n\n= [-7 +/- sqrt(49 + 52)]/2\n\n= [-7 +/- sqrt(101)]/2 <-- you would only consider the plus, since -7 minus sqrt101 would give you a negative number, thus your answer\n\nx = [-7 + sqrt(101)]/2 = approx. 1.52 ft"
The simplest answer is that it is not infinite, but undefined.\n\nThis is due to a simple reason - 0/0 gives different answers depending on which direction you come from.\n\nConsider the expression x/x, if you make x really, really small (but still greater than zero), you will be getting very close to 0/0, and your answer is always one.\n\nOK, now look at 2x/x - if you again make x really, really small (but still greater than zero), you will still be getting very close to 0/0, but now your answer is always two!\n\nThe problem is in the *vicinity* of 0/0, the numbers jump all over the place, and don't make a pattern. Any other choice of numerator and/or denominator will always result in a vacinity where the values are all around a single value. Mathematicians deal with this sort of uncertainty by saying that it is undefined.

astronomy in particular deals with very large numbers, which can be difficult to handle. using exponents(scientific notation) makes that easier.\nfor example the average distance from the earth to the sun is 93,000,000 miles. converting to sci notation makes that number 9.3 x 10(7). The distance to the nearest star is 24 trillion miles. How much fun would it be to multiply those two numbers together? not much as real numbers but in scientific notation it is much easier.

1. At the neuromuscular juncture, ACh released by the synaptic terminal binds to receptors on the sarcolemma.\n\n2. The resulting change in the transmembrane potential of the muscle fiber leads to the production of action petential that spreads across the entire surface of the muscle fiber and along the T tubules.\n\n3.The sarcoplasmic reticulum releases stored calcium ions, increasing the calcium concentration of the sarcoplasm in and around the sarcomeres.\n\n4. Calcium ions bind to triponin, producing a change in the orientation of the troponin-tropomyosin complex that exposes active sites on the thin filaments (actin). Cross-bridges form when myosin heads bind to the active sites on F actin.\n\n5. The contraction begins as repeated cycles of cross-bridge binding, pivoting, and detatchment occur, powered by the hydrolysis of ATP. These events produce filament sliding, and the muscle fiber shortens.
I guess its a game where you can fix the amount of water, gases, radiation, some kinds of life, etc, in a ficticious planet and then see a simulation of what happens. I don't know really where can you find that, but you should just search in internet.
there are two reason's you are off base.  The really physicsy reason is that the second Law of Thermodynamics forbids any 100% efficient engine (in your case, the whole car is the engine).  Without going into too much detail, this is because energy is always conserved in the Universe, and any engine loses energy to heat, at least by friction.\n\nThe more understandable reason is this: taking your pinwheel windmill generators as an example, the work that they provide (to charge up the battery) does not come from wind, it comes from the car moving, which comes from the car's engine.  Therefore, all the energy going into the battery is extra work the car has to do.  \n\nYou can, however, save some energy when you slow down the car, you can return some of its moving energy (kinetic) into a battery.

Carbohydrates work by participating in the production of energy. There are many kinds of carbohydrates and the most important function is to participate in various oxidation reactions and there by producing ATP which are the molecular batteries on which every living form exists. These reactions occur in the presence of molecular oxygen and thats why oxygen is so important for us. Additionaly every 1 gram of carbohydrate produces about 4.8 Kcals. \n\nApart from energy production carbohydrates are important for many other functions of cell membranes ( Glycoproteins and Glycolipids)

Your brain's ability to solve problems depends on the practice in learning many techniques to solve different kinds of problems. In fact, the harder it is to pick up a new kind of problem solving technique, the better for your mental workout. No matter what field you go into or what kind of person you become, you will be better off for having trained your brain to think in many dimensions in finding solutions to problems. \n\nIt is a mistake to obsess over the fact that most people do not use trigonometry per se in their daily lives.

"Reptiles do not use body fat to generate heat, but they _do_ store energy as fat and use it when food supply is low, or, in the case of females, to provide nutritive substances for their eggs during the breeding season.

I love math. Now you stated that you have the highest class rank in your glass, which is impressive. Its a great thing that your intrested in college in your sophomore year. First things first, there are many professions that involve math, and majors. Since you seen to have good grades, I would start planing for the top technical schools. Mainly MIT. If teaching is not your thing, look into engineering. (that my major)\nAlso it dependes on the type of job you want. If your looking to be very wealthy, I would'nt recommend math as major, in comparsion to a career in medicine. \nHowever if you extremely love math, and don't care about becoming very wealthy (good for you!), then a math major at MIT is the plan for you. \nAnother thing is that 10th grade math, which for you (depends on your school) could be geometery or trig, is nothing compared to advance math. Such as Calculus. Entering advance Calculus, is like going into a new world. ie.. Differential Equations

The Earth's structure is the geologic and atmospheric structure of earth.\nContents\n[hide]\n\n    * 1 Shape\n    * 2 Structure\n    * 3 Interior\n          o 3.1 Interior heat\n          o 3.2 Structure\n    * 4 The core\n    * 5 Mantle\n    * 6 The Crust\n    * 7 Hydrosphere\n    * 8 Atmosphere\n    * 9 Historical development and alternative conceptions\n    * 10 See also\n\n[edit]\n\nShape\n\nThe Earth's shape is that of an oblate spheroid, with an average diameter of approximately 12,742 km. The rotation of the Earth causes the equator to bulge out slightly so that the equatorial diameter is 43 km larger than the pole to pole diameter. The largest local deviations in the rocky surface of the Earth are Mount Everest (8,850 m above local sea level) and the Mariana Trench (10,911 m below local sea level). Hence compared to a perfect ellipsoid, the Earth has a tolerance of about one part in about 584, or 0.17%. For perspective, this is a bit more than the 0.05% tolerance allowed in billiard balls. Due to the bulge, the feature farthest from the center of the Earth is actually Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador. The mass of the Earth is approximately 5980 yottagrams (5.98 x 1024 kg).\n[edit]\n\nStructure\n\nThe interior of the Earth, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is chemically divided into layers. The Earth has an outer silicate solid crust, a highly viscous mantle, a liquid outer core that is much less viscous than the mantle, and a solid inner core. The liquid outer core gives rise to a weak magnetic field due to the convection of its electrically conductive material.\n\nNew material constantly finds its way to the surface through volcanoes and cracks in the ocean floors (see seafloor spreading). Many of the rocks now making up the Earth's crust formed less than 100 million (1×108) years ago; however the oldest known mineral grains are 4.4 billion (4.4×109) years old, indicating that the Earth has had a solid crust for at least that long [1].\n\nTaken as a whole, the Earth's composition by mass [2] is:\n\n    iron: 35 .1 %\n    oxygen: 28 .2 %\n    silicon: 17 .2 %\n    magnesium: 15 .9 %\n    nickel: 1 .6 %\n    calcium: 1 .6 %\n    aluminium: 1 .5 %\n    sulfur: 0 .70 %\n    sodium: 0 .25 %\n    titanium: 0 .071 %\n    potassium: 0 .019  %\n    other elements:     0 .53 %\n\nInterior heat\n\n    Main article: geothermal (geology)\n\nThe interior of the Earth reaches temperatures of 5650 ± 600 kelvins [3] [4]. The planet's internal heat was originally generated during its accretion (see gravitational binding energy), and since then additional heat has continued to be generated by the decay of radioactive elements such as uranium, thorium, and potassium. The heat flow from the interior to the surface is only 1/20,000 as great as the energy received from the Sun.\n[edit]\n\nStructure\n\nEarth's composition (by depth below surface):\n\n    * 0 to 60 km - Lithosphere (locally varies 5-200 km)\n          o 0 to 35 km - Crust (locally varies 5-70 km)\n          o 35 to 60 km - Uppermost part of mantle\n    * 35 to 2890 km - Mantle\n          o 100 to 700 km - Asthenosphere\n    * 2890 to 5100 km - Outer Core\n    * 5100 to 6378 km - Inner Core\n\n[edit]\n\nThe core\n\nThe average density of the Earth is 5515 kg/m3, making it the densest planet in the Solar system. Since the average density of surface material is only around 3000 kg/m3, we must conclude that denser materials exist within the core of the Earth. Further evidence for the high density core comes from the study of seismology. Since iron is the heaviest element that can be created by a star's fusion, the core of the earth and the other planets must be iron. All heavier elements are rare or trace. In its earliest stages, about 4.5 billion (4.5×109) years ago, melting would have caused denser substances to sink toward the center in a process called planetary differentiation, while less-dense materials would have migrated to the crust.
3D structures with many interfaces can be very hard to just memorize. As the component complexity increases thats the only way to assure you have a complete configuration. This also allows others to examine the structure easier.

Sagittarius A* was determined to be the center of the Milky Way, about 26,000 light years from our Solar System. We know the center is a Black Hole from observations of nearby suns in very fast orbits around it, showing high gravitational attraction. In 1999, knowing that Sagittarius A* was the center of the Milky Way Galaxy allowed astronomer Mark Reid and associates at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics to calculate that our Solar System takes approximately 226 million years to revolve around the Galactic Center.

It angers me to read the level of intellect in these answers. The Earth is speeding at such a rate not felt by us (minute earthlings) on the surface. The wobble is caused by the fact that the earths rotation is still trying to balance out from it's original creation. Due to the fact that the Earths' mantle is still constantly moving under intense pressure, and made up of molten rock, the weight of the world is not level.

You would build a green roof the same way you build a orange, or purple roof.  However it is slightly different from a blue, red, or yellow roof.  \n\nIt depends on the square footage of the roof, the materials that you will use, and the restrictions for the open space under the roof to name a few.  If you have natural materials close to where the roof will be, then use them, like the trees, rocks, and vegetation.\n\nBut make sure that when you build it, OVER engineer it.  The weight from the roof, water, wind, and animals will add a force that needs to be addressed.
Starch doesn't taste sweet because stach IS NOT a sugar. (Take notes Mashira).\n\nStarch is composed of lots of sugar molecules strung together, but because they are strung together out tongues don't detect them as being sweet.\n\nBoiling a potato loosens the starch up and makes it digestible, but it doesn't change the primary chemical structure.

The tension in the rope is providing the upward force causing the accelerating.\n\nFirst you need to find the net force acting on the object.\nNet force = mass * acceleration.\nYou are given the acceleration and mass, so this is easy to find.\n\nBut the rope does not just need to apply the net force, it must also apply enough additional force to counteract the objects weight.  The weight of the object,\nWeight = mass * gravity\n\nThe overall tension in the rope,\nTension = mg + ma\nor the weight of the car + the net force acting on the car.
"The above answer is correct with respect to human anatomy. However, the shoulder girdle of most vertebrates has more bones. \nIn most vertebrates, there is one important bone dorsal to the glenoid cavity (the place where the humerus articulates), that's the scapula. \nThere's another important bone ventral to the glenoid cavity, the coracoid. \nFor instance, in an amphibian there are well developed scapulae (with a suprascapular cartilage) and coracoids; and claviculae (ventral, situated anterior to the coracoids). The claviculae and the coracoid connect the shoulder girdle with the sternum.\nReptiles have many variations including other bones (interclavicula, etc.)\nBirds have strong scapulae and coracoids, and the claviculae fused in a furcula.\nPrototherian mammals (platypus and echidnas) have a reptilian-like shoulder girdle; marsupials and eutherians only have scapula, because the coracoid has fused to it forming the ""coracoid apophysis"". The clavicle may be present or absent; it's usually well developed in animals that use their forelimbs for different movements (for instance climbing, manipulating food) and reduced or absent in others that are specialized for running."

The most logical way to play the lottery is to look at a sample of previous winners and identifying the 6 (or 5) least played numbers.  Logic dictates that those are the ones coming up.  OR, the 6 most played numbers, where logic dictates they will play again.  I think the lesson is that logic doesn't apply when playing the lottery.  Heck, I win $5 every week that I don't play.

That's because there are ceramic insulators that hold the wires/cables to the tower.  You will notice something that has a jagged-looking profile between the metal of the tower and the wire, that is the insulator.  Insulators are up to several feet in length, depending on the designed voltage potential in the wire.  The higher the voltage, the longer the insulator.\n\nHigh voltage transmission lines, the types you commonly see on metal towers are usually in the range of 115kV (kilovolts) to 320kV.  In air, it takes roughly 5000 volts per inch for an arc to develop.  At 320kV, you need an insulator over five feet long just to prevent the electricity from arcing to the tower and grounding out.   \nWith this in mind, you do not even need to touch a high voltage wire to get electrocuted, just close enough for the electricity to arc to you.

Yes, it's possible.  \n\nI believe red hair color is a dominant expression of the genes, which can contain either both dominant genes (RR) or one dominant and one recessive gene (Rr).  \n\nSo if both parents have the Rr gene, the the offspring would have 1/4 chances of getting the double recessive genes (rr), and thereby getting the ressive expression of a different (usually lighter) hair color.  \n\nObviously, this is an over-simplification of the human genetics.

"""Energetic Electrons (from:refernce listed below)\n \nPhotosystem II is the first link in the chain of photosynthesis. It captures photons and uses the energy to extract electrons from water molecules. These electrons are used in several ways. First, when the electrons are removed, the water molecule is broken into oxygen gas, which bubbles away, and hydrogen ions, which are used to power ATP synthesis. This is the source of all of the oxygen that we breathe. Second, the electrons are passed down a chain of electron-carrying proteins, getting an additional boost along the way from photosystem I. As these electrons flow down the chain, they are used to pump hydrogen ions across the membrane, providing even more power for ATP synthesis. Finally, the electrons are placed on a carrier molecule, NADPH, which delivers them to enzymes that build sugar from water and carbon dioxide."" \n\nIn a nutshell, these energized electrons provide the energy for anything in the cell that needs energy."

Although many jetliners can operate at very high altitudes in thin air they can not operate within the near perfect vacuum of space with no air (oxygen) at all.  Also, airplanes are propelled through air using wings (air foils) that give the airplane lift and control.

According to the modern concept about the structure of atom, the atom consists of shells with different energy levels, the farther from nucleus, the higher the energy. The electrons in the last shell are known as valence electrons. for eg. Sodium has the electronic configuration 1s2 2s1. So as valence shell is 2 therefore the no. of valence electron is 1. You should also study about the Quantum numbers for a better understanding.

After leaving the Presidency, Jefferson continued to be active in public affairs. He also became increasingly obsessed with founding a new institution of higher learning, specifically one free of church influences where one could specialize in many new areas not offered at other universities. A letter to Joseph Priestley, in January 1800, indicated that he had been planning the university for decades before its establishment.\n\nHis dream was realized in 1819, with the founding of the University of Virginia. Upon its opening in 1825, it was then the first university to offer a full slate of elective courses to its students. One of the largest construction projects to that time in North America, it was notable for being centered about a library, rather than a church. In fact, no campus chapel was included in his original plans.

>>>>>Why does the earth and other planets rotate, but not our moon?\n\nThe Moon does rotate, It has day length of just over 28 days. If the moon didn’t rotate then it would show different faces to the Earth as it orbits us, and there would be no ‘dark side’.\n\nThe Moon doesn’t appear to rotate to an observer on Earth because gravitational forces have forced the rotation of the Moon to synchronise with the Earth, the two bodies are tidally locked. As a result the moon rotates at exactly the same rate as it orbits the Earth. It orbits once a month and it rotates once a month. \n>>>>> But just why does the earth rotate anyway? \n\nIt’s called conservation of angular momentum. The Earth condensed out of a massive cloud of dust and rock billions of years ago.  That cloud was all spread out over billions of miles, it covered the entire circular orbit path we take around the Sun as well as stretching half way to Mars and halfway to Venus. It was big cloud. And it was spinning very slowly because of the way it was formed.\n\nThe cloud gradually condensed under the influence of gravity and became a small Earth. But when a spinning object gets smaller it can’t just stop keep spinning at the same speed,  it has to keep spinning faster. You can see this principle applied by ice skaters working up speed. They start spinning with their arms out to make themselves bug, but when they pull their arms in the get smaller and spin faster. The same thing happened with the Earth.  When all that spinning dust got pulled in from billions of miles away the Earth got smaller, and as a result it started spinning a lot faster. So fast in fact that it became noticeable to observers on Earth ( if there had been any) that the Earth spun around totally once a day.\n\nOf course it took another 2 or 3 billion years for life to arise, and another 4 billion years for life to get clever enough to figure out that the Erath did rotate and that the sun wasn’t whizzing around us.
There are MANY reasons, I can't really list all of them but here are a few. \n\nFirst off it depends on what type of bridge is needed. Some types can span longer distances but cost more to design and build while others are cheaper but can't reach as far.\n\nAlso, different materials have very different properties. Depending on what is needed Structural Engineers will choosee different materials. Steel for example is very strong in both tension AND compression, however it needs to be kept in good condition weights a lot and also may be hard to build with in some circumstances. Concrete for example has very strong compressive strength and very low tensile strength. This means that while concrete can stand a lot of pressure, if you pull on it, it can crack somewhat easily compared to other materials. Cost of these materials also play a factor.\n\nFor bridges steel and concrete are not the only materials used. I've seen some glass ones, ones made of stone, wood... a lot of different materials. Before you even get into other materials though there are MANY types of concrete and steel to begin with.

Temporal frequency is a scalar quantity, not a vector.\n\nHowever, spatial frequencies can be vectors. We usually do not deal with the vector spatial frequencies however, but the vector wavenumber K=(Kx,Ky,Kz), where the components Kx=1/Lx, Ky=1/Ly, Kz=1/Lz and Lx is the wavelength in the x direction, Ly is the wavelength in the y direction and Lz is the wavelength in the z direction. Unfortunately, there is an ambiguity in this definition, since some people mulitiply this definition of wavenumber by 2*pi (see reference).\n\nOf course, in a vacuum, the wavelength L=Lx=Ly=Lz (no anisotropy) and c=f*L, where c is the speed of light and L is wavelength, so c=f/k.

You need to plates and a dielectric.  The dielectric can be air, and a lot of variable capacitors use air and change the capacitance by moving the plates and thus changing the amount of area overlapped by the plates.\n\nIf you want to be able to store a lot of energy, you need to use different dielctrics and materials for the plates.  To increase the capacitance, you have to either increase the surface area of the plates or use a dielectric material with a high dielectric constant.  \n\nIn aluminum capacitors, the plates are made of aluminum and the surface area is increased by using solutions that cause tunnels to form inside aluminum foil. This can increase the surface area over 100 times.  The dielectric is formed by growing an oxide layer on top of the aluminum which is very thin (microns).  \n\nIn tantalum capacitor, one of the plates called the anode is formed from tantalum by taking tantalum powder, pressing it into a pellet, and sintering (or partially fusing) the tantalum particles together in a furnace.  This makes a solid pellet with a lot of pores, and so it has a very high suface area. A tantalum wire is either pressed with the pellet or welded later to form one of the terminations in the finished capacitor. Tantalum oxide can then be grown on to of the tantalum to form the dielectric.  The other plate, called the cathode, is formed by dipping this pellet into manganese dioxide solutions.  The manganese dioxide is able to penetrate the pores and cover much of the surface area on top of the dielectric.  It is then dipped into a carbon paint solution and cured, and the carbon layer efficiently contacts the manganese dioxide layer and protects the sensitive dielectic layer from the next layer, the silver layer which is also normally applied by dipping the pellet into a paint and curing.  The robustness of the silver layer and its excellent conductivity is needed beacause a second termination is attached to it.  This assembly is covered with epoxy to protect it from mechanical stresses, but the terminations remain partially exposed to allow for attaching to a circuit board.
If you insist on flushing your money down the toilet called the lottery, then you would be better off betting the same numbers all the time.\n\nFirst, when you see the winning numbers on TV or in the paper, you would recognize your numbers. Less chance of you missing out on your chance to collect another $5.\n\nSecond, if you always bet the same numbers, and if you save your old tickets, and if you had a winning ticket, and if you lost that ticket, there is precident for recognizing that you were indeed the one who bought that winning ticket.\n\nOther than that, if the game isn't rigged, every combination of numbers is as likely to come up as any other.\n\nOne further note, people tend to use their birthdays and the birthdays of their family members when they pick their numbers. If the winning combination has numbers below 31, the winner is more likely to share the pot with someone else.  People are also more likely to pick numbers that make a pattern on the application form, like picking the numbers that go down the diagonal. That leads to splitting the pot, too.
that depends on what the solvent is and what the solute that you are trying to get out is. with substances mixed with water you can dehydrate the solution to obtain the solute. the process of dehydration is one method there are others such as adjusting the pH of the solution. if you have an basic compound in a hydrocarbon liquid then you can lower the pH of the solution and cause the basic compound to form a salt and fall out of the solvent. maybe this will help
The speed of one photon seen by other photon is zero if the beam is perfectly coherant.But if the beam is incoherant then the speed varies accordingly. The speed of light is about 300 million metres per second. Two photons are said to be coherant if they travel in the same direction and vibrate in exactly the same way.
Supplementary angles have a sum of 180 degrees, but just because one angle is obtuse and another is acute doesn't mean they'll total 180 degrees. You might have a 120 degree angle and an 85 degree angle.\n\nFor more angle information:

Blood entering the interstitium in the vasa recta is\n300 mosmol/l. As with capillaries elsewhere, these capillaries are\npermeable to salt and water.\n\nAs blood flows, in the vasa recta, from the cortex to\nthe medulla, it equilibrates at each level with the\nsalt and water which is drawn in from the\ninterstitium by the net inward pressure (15mmHg).\n\nAs the blood returns to the cortex, the same\nprocess of equilibration occurs. As the blood leaves to enter the venules, its osmolarity is about 310 mosmol/l., just slightly\nhyper-osmotic with respect to plasma.\n\nThe vasa recta continuously take away a\nsmall amount of salt (osmolarity of 310 vs 300) and\nwater from the interstitium but do not dissipate\nthe gradient.
Silver cannot be turned into gold.  The laws of physics prevent it and the economy of the world depends on it.
I believe the values you are referring to are the Planck length (1.61624 × 10^-35 m) and Planck time (5.39121 × 10^-44 s).  They are basically the smallest values that quantum physics can make sense of.\n\nImagine a cashier.  You work with money all day, sometimes large values, sometimes small.  But you never deal in anything less than a penny, because that is the smallest amount out there.  You might imagine something smaller, but since there is no coin for it, you can only work with pennies or larger.\n\nThe Planck units are the pennies of the universe, at least according to current theory.  But don't worry, they are very, very small.  The earth is 1.2745 x 10^8 m in diameter.  The smallest atoms are about 2.5 x 10^-11 m, or 19 orders of magnitude smaller.  The Planck length is 24 orders smaller still, so the difference between the size of an atom and the Planck length is greater than that of an atom and the entire planet.

I don't know what a suborbital is, but an orbital is the region where an electron spends 90 percent of its time. In other words, it's the region where the electron has a .9 probability of being there. This is based on psi squared from the Schrodinger equation.\n\nAt each energy level, there exists orbitals. These orbitals are defined by a set of quantum numbers: n, l, ml, me

The Obstetricians day varies depending on how many women are ready to deliver. The doctor does rounds in the morning/afternoon/whenever he/she has time, sees patients in the clinic setting, goes to Labor and Deliver to take care of the expectant mothers, maybe there's a scheduled C-section to perform, follows up on women who have already delivered etc. One note Obstetricians don't necessarily take care of high risk pregnancies, physicians who have done a fellowship in Maternal Fetal Medicine (MFM) usually care for the high risk women...although doctors trained in OB/Gyn aren't precluded from doing so. So the answer is, there is no real typical day. Babies tend to come when they want to..

In plants, the light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts and use light energy to synthesize ATP and NADPH. The photons are captured in the antenna complexes of photosystem I and II by chlorophyll and accessory pigments (see diagram at right). When a chorophyll a molecule at a photosystem's reaction center absorbs energy, an electron is excited and transferred to an electron-acceptor molecule through a process called Photoinduced charge separation. These electrons are shuttled through an electron transport chain that initially functions to generate a chemiosmotic potential across the membrane, the so called Z-scheme shown in the diagram. An ATP synthase enzyme uses the chemiosmotic potential to make ATP during photophosphorylation while NADPH is a product of the terminal redox reaction in the Z-scheme.\n\n[edit]\nWater photolysis\nThe NADPH is the main reducing agent in chloroplasts, providing a source of energetic electrons to other reactions. Its production leaves chlorophyll with a deficit of electrons (oxidized), which must be obtained from some other reducing agent. The excited electrons lost from chlorophyll in photosystem I are replaced from the electron transport chain by plastocyanin. However, since photosystem II includes the first steps of the Z-scheme, an external source of electrons is required to reduce its oxidized chlorophyll a molecules. This role is played by water during a reaction known as photolysis and results in water being split to give electrons, oxygen and hydrogen ions. Photosystem II is the only known biological enzyme that carries out this oxidation of water. Initially, the hydrogen ions from photolysis contribute to the chemiosmotic potential but eventually they combine with the hydrogen carrier molecule NADP+ to form NADPH. Oxygen is a waste product of light-independent reaction, but oxygen is used in cellular respiration for a majority of organism on earth

< berkelium (bûr'klēəm) [from Berkeley], artificially produced radioactive chemical element; symbol Bk; at. no. 97; mass no. of most stable isotope 247; m.p. about 1,050°C; b.p. about 2,590°C; sp. gr. 14 (estimated); valence +3, +4. Berkelium is believed to be similar to the other members of the actinide series and to terbium, its homolog in the lanthanide series. It is found in group IIIb of the periodic table. The 10 isotopes of berkelium that are known are all radioactive; the element has not been found in the earth's crust. Berkelium-247, the most stable isotope (half-life about 1,400 years), is difficult to produce; berkelium-249 (half-life 314 days) is more easily produced in weighable quantities and is used in studies of berkelium chemistry. Berkelium metal exists in two crystal modifications (see allotropy) and is chemically reactive; the chloride, fluoride, sulfide, nitrate, sulfate, perchlorate, oxide, and dioxide have been produced. Berkelium was the fifth transuranium element to be synthesized. It was discovered late in 1949 by Glenn T. Seaborg, Stanley G. Thompson, and Albert Ghiorso, who produced it by bombarding americium-241 with alpha particles in the cyclotron of the Univ. of California at Berkeley. Weighable quantities of the pure element were first isolated by Thompson and B. B. Cunningham in 1958.
Grass is green because they contain a pigment\nknown as chlorophyll. The chlorophyll is used in the process of photosynthesis where a plant produces sugar in the presence of sunlight.\n\nBLUE SKY:  A clear cloudless day-time sky is blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light.
Proteins are not too large to enter and leave the cell, however, proteins must be broken down into amino acids to pass the gut wall and enter the blood stream.  This is probably what you heard, afterall if large proteins were passing the gut wall regularly people would have a lot of allergic reactions (the basis for not feeding infants younger than six months cows milk).  \n\nProteins that are transcribed in the cytosol are for use inside the cell.  Moving on, proteins that are manufactured on the RER (rough endoplasmic reticulum) are made for excretion from the cell.  These proteins are then modified in the Golgi Apparatus and then excreted by the cell via vesicles that fuse with the plasma membrane.  I mean think about it!  Do you really think we could survive without our cells being able to excrete large compounds from our cells.  For example, insulin is a protein that regulate glucose uptake by cells,  if our body wasn't able to excrete this protein from pancreatic cells we wouldn't be able to survive!\n\nHope this helps.

"Eddy currents traditionally can be strong enough to heat metal.  I believe the only way to cause a metal to combine with oxygen would require an electric or flame arc to vaporize the material and have enough oxygen present to ""burn metal."" \n\nON THE OTHER HAND, it was a widely used practice in the later WWII and cold war days to check radar operation by chucking welding rods in front of the radar beam and watch them flash into non-existence like a flashbulb.  The rod would be instantly changed to plasma and burn with the air.  I think if your definition of eddy current includes the current produced in a high energy RF electromagnetic field, then YES, it CAN burn metal.  Radar tubes back in the day could be in the thousands to 1 megawatt range, which would instanly destroy any metallic or RF conductive object (bird) if it got close enough to the emitter.  If you put a crinkled piece of aluminum foil in your microwave, the edges will flash and burn from the eddy currents induced by the conduction of the RF energy from the magnetron in the oven.  \n\nEddy currents, however, are usally NOT associated with arcs.  Eddy currents usually apply to tranformer and motor designs where electromagnets are formed with sheet steel and have windings which generate the magnetic field.  Transformer laminations are insulated from one another to PREVENT eddy currents which are very high amperage, low voltage currents induced in the armatures or cores of transformers when magnetic fields alternate in the core.  If a 60 Hz transformer, say for an old amplifier, were made of a solid block, it would waste a lot of power in the core itself because of the eddy currents.  If you construct the core with laminated sheets, the eddy currents cannot flow from sheet to sheet, so you make a more efficient design. \n\nI hope this helps."
Fiberglass is useful for a lot of different things including thermal insulation; acoustic insulation; fireproofing; reinforcement of plastics, cement, and textiles; gaskets and seals; etc.\n\nIt's danger stems from from its size, with a fiberglass filament commonly 3 microns in diameter and 20 or more microns in length.

Cirrhosis can lead to extra fluid retention due to decreased albumin and plasma protein production. This drops oncotic pressure and leads to fluid retention. If the lungs have extra fluid in them, and decreases pulmonary function, the body may increase respiratory rate in as a reaction. Thus carbon dioxide is blown off because of the increased respiratory rate and a respiratory alkalosis occurs. That's my best guess.
There is no way to measure the temperature at the Earth's core\ndirectly.  We know from mines and drill holes that, near\nthe surface of the Earth, the temperature increases by about\n1 degree Fahrenheit for every 60 feet in depth.  If this\ntemperature increase continued to the center of the Earth, the\nEarth's core would be 100,000 degrees Celsius!\n\nBut nobody believes the Earth is that hot; the temperature increase\nmust slow down with depth and the core is probably\nabout 3000 to 5000 degrees Celsius.\n\nThis estimate of the temperature is derived from theoretical\nmodeling and laboratory experiments.  This work is very\ndifficult (and speculative) since nobody can reproduce\nin a laboratory the high temperatures and pressures that\nexist in the core.  Also it is not known exactly what\nthe core is made of.

• The Law of Segregation: The two members of a gene pair (alleles) segregate (separate) from each other in the formation of gametes. Half the gametes carry one allele, and the other half carry the other allele.\n\n• The Law of Independent Assortment: Genes for different traits assort independently of one another in the formation of gametes.\n\nAfter research of first two laws scientists came up with: Some alleles are incompletely dominant, that some genes are sex-linked, and that some pairs of genes do not assort independently because they are physically linked on a chromosome.

"Yuri gagain first visited the space on 12th April 1961.\n\nhere is the full information :\n \n \n\n\n[Yuri Alekseevich Gagarin, from the Vostok 1, April 12, 1961.] \n\n\nHe was the first man in space. Imagine leaving Earth before anyone had done it before! Nobody could tell what would happen to him, nobody really knew how the brain would function in weightlessness, or how the body would adapt. \n\nOn March 9, 1934, a boy was born in the country-side west of Moscow. His name was Yuri Gagarin. He grew up on a collective farm, where his father worked as a carpenter. When Yuri was seven years old, the German armies invaded Russia. Yuris father joined the army, while his mother took him and his older brother and sister away from the fighting. \n\nIn high-school, Yuri decided to train as a technician, and attended a technical school on the outskirts of Moscow. He left school in 1951 as a trained metalworker and enrolled at an industrial college. While he was a student he became interested in aircraft and took lessons at a local flying school. Pretty soon, it became obvious that young Yuri had a natural talent for flying, and when he graduated from college in 1955, he joined the Soviet Airforce. It became evident that Gagarins abilities as a pilot were beyond normal, and he was taken of normal duties to work as a test-pilot, flying new and experimental aircraft. \n\nSoon Yuri went to his officers and volunteered to become a cosmonaut. His officers were stunned, since no-one had ever before volunteered for such a mission, and consequently there were no procedures for this. However, Gagarins name was passed on to the people in charge of the top-secret Soviet space-project, and after a while he was contacted by some representatives who wanted to test him. \n\nYuri Gagarin was selected among a special group of the Soviet Unions 20 best test-pilots. Later, due to economical restrictions, this group was limited to six pilots. These went on to further training, while the others returned to test-flying. During the very tough and difficult training-period, Yuri obtained top grades from the instructors. \n\nAmong other things Gagarin withstood 13 Gs in the centrifuge, and, as a part of the psychological training, sat in a soundless, lightless room for 24 hours. The instructors described him as a man who ""...submits useful suggestions at meetings. Always sure of his resources... very difficult, if not impossible to upset... Stands out among his colleagues thanks to his great scope of active attention, bright mind and quick reaction"". \n\nThe official announcement of Gagarin as pilot was made on April 11, but he was privately informed on April 9. \n1961, at the age of 27, Gagarin left the earth. It was April the 12th, 9.07 Moscow time (launch-site, Baikonur). 108 minutes later, he was back . The period of orbital revolution was 89:34 minutes (this figure was ""calculated by electronic computers""). The missions maximum flight altitude was 327 000 meters. The maximum speed reached was 28 260 kilometers per hour. \n\n""On the 12th of April, 1961, the Soviet spaceship-sputnik was put in orbit around the Earth with me on board"" ""...there was a good view of the Earth which had a very distinct and pretty blue halo. It had a smooth transition from pale blue, blue, dark blue, violet and absolutely black. It was a magnificent picture."" [Gagarin in his official statement after the flight, April 15, 1961.] \n\nThe vessel used was the Soviet spaceship/satellite Vostok 1, which was a small one-manned spherical descent module with a diameter of 2.3 meters. The module was mounted on top of an instrument module containing the engine system. Together these weighed less than five tonnes. The cosmonaut was strapped into an ejection seat, from which he would exit the descent module upon re-entry. \n\nThe Vostok 1 was mounted on a SL-3 variant of the SS-6 Sapwood rocket, which was 38.36 meters long and weighed 287.03 tonnes at la"

An electrical charge is an imbalance between an atom's positive and negative units (Protrons and electrons).  A discharge of electrical energy happens when electrons jump from one atom to on that is differently charged to bring the two atoms closer to a balance.  If an atom has more electrons that protons, it is negatively charged.  If it has more protons than electrons, then it is positively charged.  A charge is always changed by changing the number of electrons.  If you change the number of protons, it becomes a nuclear reacation since the change is happening in the nucleus of the atom.

Same reason that battle fatigues are in a variety of colors including browns - the striping is there to break up an outline, which it does admirably. Also, pattern recognition in many animals is for a specific form of predator/prey which gets obscured by the stripe pattern against a background. Color is actually of little interests since many animals don't see color.

hmm, not sure what you're looking for. A recombinant protein is characterised by amino-acid sequencing. This gives the primary structure. Futher analysis of secondary and tertiary structure can be made using x-ray diffraction and NMR. Predicitions of structure are made using computer programs which analyse the amino acid sequence and compare it with known structures, they then extrapolate this to impose an expected structure on the protein.
Probably not.\n\nAt the moment the laws of physics show the speed of light is an absolute barrier for matter. It is not like the speed of sound which was an engineering hurtle, crossing or attain the speed of light is impossible for anything with mass.\n\nIn a particle accelerators the electrons, protons and whatnot can be moved to speeds very close to that of light (like 99%), but they never reach the speed of light.\n\nIf you're in a rocket and turn up the motor you can get closer and closer to the speed of light...but never reach it.\n\nCertainly in the future we will have a better understanding of physics, but it is exceedingly unlikely that something as fundamental as the speed of light barrier will be shown to be wrong. (Just as when Einstein came out with General Relativity - which is essentially a theory of gravity - it did not show that Newton's Theory of Gravity was wrong so much as it only applied to (relatively) small masses.)\n\nAs for the galaxy, those above are correct that it is not expanding.

Meaning that that in the future the universe will expand faster. Eventually something bad will happen if that acceleration keeps going. But that's in 100 billion years or so, so I wouldn't worry.

"The milky way was first ""discovered"" (if you can call it that) by using NIR sensors to see through all the dust blocking it from view.

"a doctor of osteopathic medicine\n\nOsteopathy is a system of therapy founded in the 19th century based on the concept that the body can formulate its own remedies against diseases when the body is in a normal structural relationship, has a normal environment and enjoys good nutrition.\n\nAn MD (Medical Doctor) goes to a School of Medicine, and a DO (Doctor of Osteopathy) goes to an Osteopathic\nSchool of Medicine.\n\n\nFor a longer Answer:\n\nFrom Ohio State University's School of Medicine -\n\n""MD or DO - Is There A Difference?\nA medical doctor (MD) and a doctor of osteopathic medicine (DO) generally have the same educational background. Both are required to complete an undergraduate degree -- usually with an emphasis on science -- followed by four years of medical school, and then a residency program. The length of this residency program varies by the physician's specialty. All physicians must then pass state licensure requirements and examinations.\n\nIn regard to primary care, the basic difference between these two types of doctors is narrowing all the time. ""The biggest difference is that most DOs go into primary care"", according to Bryan Beggin, DO, of the OSU Family Practice Center at Gahanna. The philosophic difference is that the DO tends to treat the entire individual, rather than using\na disease-specific approach to treatment."""
Occlusion is a term indicating that the state of something, which is normally open, is now totally closed.\n\nIn medicine, the term is often used to refer to blood vessels, arteries or veins which have become totally blocked to any blood flow. For issues of artery occlusion, see stenosis, atheroma, and coronary catheterization.\n\nIn dentistry, the term is used to refer to the manner in which the teeth from upper and lower arches come together when the mouth is closed.\n\nIn computer graphics and image processing, occlusion is the effect of one object in space blocking another object from view.

I think it's safe to say that PPh2 is soft, considering it has a phosphorus central atom with 2 benzene rings. The defining characteristic is that the molecule has a diffuse electron cloud, caused by the delocalized pi system in the benzene rings as well as the size of the phosphorus electron cloud.\n\nAs to your reaction, I'm not sure.

"In chemistry, a salt is any ionic compound composed of positively charged cations and negatively charged anions, so that the product is neutral and without a net charge. These ions can be inorganic (Cl−) as well as organic (CH3−COO−) and monoatomic (F−) as well as polyatomic ions (SO42−).\n\nA metallic salt has a metal as the cation.\n\nNote that ""ionic compound"" means the bond is not covalent."
"The electromagnetic ""spectrum"" consists of all the different wavelengths and frequencies of electromagnetic waves. All electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light. Waves can be of high frequency and short wave-length, or of low frequency and long wave-length, or anywhere in between. The reference web site below has a nice sketch showing gamma rays as the highest frequency (shortest wave-length) waves in the spectrum, followed by x-rays with somewhat lower frequency (and somewhat longer wave-length), and ending all the way on the right wtih radio waves with the lowest frequency (and longest wave-length).\n\nIn the middle is the ""visible"" spectrum, for visible light is an electromagnetic wave, too. Within the visible spectrum, violet light has the highest frequency and the shortest wave-length, and red light has the lowest frequency and the longest wave-length. ""Ultra-violet"" has frequencies just a little higher than the highest visible violet frequencies, and ""infra-red"" has frequencies just a little lower than the lowest visible red."
So much is currently being learned from Genetics for current and future use. Prevention and risk assessment of hereditary diseases can be carried out using genetics; of course whether a doctor should pass such information to insurance companies is beyond the scope of this dicsussion. Bottom line, genetics can be used to see where illnesses have stemed from, whether hereditary or not, and also determine whether offsprings are prone to diseases. Not only assess, it can also be ised to treat these illnesses. There are many drugs under clinical trials at the moment.

The Helios Gene Gun is a new way for in vivo transformation of cells or organisms (i.e. gene therapy and genetic immunization (DNA vaccination)). This gun uses Biolistic ® particle bombardment where DNA- or RNA-coated gold particles are loaded into the gun and you pull the trigger. A low pressure helium pulse delivers the coated gold particles into virtually any target cell or tissue. The particles carry the DNA so that you do not have to remove cells from tissue in order to transform the cells.YOU CAN GO TO THE LISTED SOURCES TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE GENE GUN AND U CAN ALSO SEE A PICTURE
Depends on the location.  A hot spot at a continental rift will probably generate massive basalt floods; while not explosive, these can cover vast areas.  A hot spot on the ocean floor will probably generate mild, Hawaii-like eruptions.  A hot spot under the continental crust--like Yellowstone--will probably generate a combination of massive basalt floods and explosive eruptions.

Charles's Law states that the volume of a given amount of dry ideal gas is directly proportional to the Kelvin Temperature provided the amount of gas and the pressure remain fixed.\n\nV1 / T1 = V2 / T2\n\nWhen the three parameters, temperature, volume and pressure are not constant, you can use the relatio P1V1/T1=P2V2/T2 Whenever either of the parameters is constant, just cancel it out and you can get the relationship between the remaining variables.
All inks are not created equal.  From the base of the chemical composition to colorants and additives, there are many varying combinations used when ink formulas are composed.  Of the three chemical bases used to formulate inks, water and petrochemical solvents are most common.  The third and most atypical base used is oil, found mainly in wide-format commercial printers.\n\nThe colorant, or the substance used to give color to the ink, is either dye or pigmentation. Dye, consisting of small molecules, blends with the water-based solution.  A water-dye based ink tints or stains the paper on a molecular level.  Because the dye is composed of single molecules it lays flatter on the paper surface reflecting light more evenly and appearing more vivid. However, the smaller molecular structure of the dye-based ink also allows it to be damaged by UV light more rapidly that pigmented inks.\n\n            Pigmented colorant is insoluble. The pigment consists of much larger molecules than that of the dye, therefore the reflection of light received from a pigmented print does not appear as vibrant due to the scattering of the reflected light.  The larger molecules do allow a pigmented ink's print to last substantially longer than a dye-based ink's print.        \n\n            In recent years hybrid ink consisting of both dyes and pigmentation has been introduced to the market.  These inks are being used in the latest line of Epson printers.  The hybrid dye/pigment ink is also referred to as archival inks.  The company claims that their archival inks will last twice as long as pigmented ink, close to 200 years.\n\n In addition to the chemical base and colorant, inks also contain additives.  Additives may include buffering agents for control of the inks pH levels, resin for resilience, and humectants for the prevention of evaporation.  Other ingredients added to many types of ink may include fungicides, surfactants, and biocides.  Each ink formula has a unique formulation of each additive, again causing dramatic differences in the final outcome.  \nI hope this helps!

Corals are polyps; most are colonial but some are solitary. Their bodies comprise the typical polyp structures, plus an exoskeleton that has a base and vertical septa that grow and are left below the body as the colony grows and the animals die.\nThe individuals may be connected by means of stolons and also have different appearances that are related to different functions (feeding, reproduction, fixation). The skeleton of a single polyp is called corallite.\n\nThis is a schematic drawing of a coral polyp:\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/science/news/img/environment/coralA270705.jpg\nAnother good one:\nhttp://www.arkive.org/coral/Coral/illustrations/coral_structure.jpg\nMore detailed, showing several corallites:\nhttp://www.sbg.ac.at/ipk/avstudio/pierofun/png/scans/coralit2.jpg\nTypes of coral morphology:\nhttp://www.sbg.ac.at/ipk/avstudio/pierofun/png/scans/coralit3.jpg

Typhoid fever (a.k.a. Enteric fever) is an illness caused by the bacterium Salmonella typhi. Very common worldwide, it is transmitted by ingestion of food or water contaminated with feces from an infected person. The bacteria then multiply in the blood stream of the infected person and are absorbed into the digestive tract and eliminated with the waste.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nDiagnosis is made by blood, bone marrow or stool cultures and with the Widal test (demonstration of salmonella antibodies against antigens O-somatic and H-flagellar) or, in less affluent countries with the urine diazo test. In epidemics and less wealthy countries, after excluding malaria, dysentery or pneumonia, a therapeutic trial with chloramphenicol is generally undertaken while awaiting the results of Widal test and blood cultures.\n\nTreatment\n\nTyphoid fever can be fatal. Antibiotics, such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin, are commonly used to treat typhoid fever in developed countries. Prompt treatment of the disease with antibiotics reduces the mortality rate to approximately 1%. Usage of Ofloxacin along with Lactobacillus acidophilus is also recommended.\n\nWhen untreated, typhoid fever persists for three weeks to a month. Death occurs in between 10% and 30% of untreated cases. Vaccines for typhoid fever are available and are advised for persons traveling in regions where the disease is common (especially Asia, Africa and Latin America). Typhim Vi is an intramuscular killed-bacteria vaccination and Vivotif is an oral live bacteria vaccination, both of which protect against typhoid fever. Neither vaccine is 100% effective against typhoid fever and neither protects against unrelated typhus.\n\nTransmission\n\nWhile flying insects feeding on feces may occassionally transfer the bacteria to food being prepared for consumption, the disease is most commonly transmitted through poor hygiene habits and public sanitation conditions. Public education campaigns encouraging people to wash their hands after toileting and before handling food are an important component in controlling spread of the disease.\n\nA person may become an asymptomatic carrier of typhoid fever, suffering no symptoms, but capable of infecting others. According to the Centers for Disease Control approximately 5% of people who contract typhoid continue to carry the disease after they recover.\n\nThe most notorious carrier of typhoid fever, but by no means the most destructive, was Mary Mallon, also known as Typhoid Mary. In 1907 she became the first American carrier to be identified and traced. She was a cook in New York at the beginning of the 20th Century. Some believe she was the source of infection for several hundred people. She is closely associated with fifty cases and five deaths. Public health authorities told Mary to give up working as a cook or have her gall bladder removed. Mary quit her job, but returned later under a false name. She was detained and quarantined after another typhoid outbreak. She died of a stroke after 23 years in quarantine.\n\nAthens\n\nIn 430-426 B.C, a devastating plague, which some believe to have been typhoid fever, killed one third of the population of Athens, including their leader Pericles. The balance of power shifted from Athens to Sparta, ending the Golden Age of Pericles that had marked Athenian dominance in the ancient world. The cause of the plague had been unknown before a study in 2006 by Manolis Papagrigorakis of the University of Athens which detected DNA sequences similar to those of the bacterium responsible for typhoid fever. Ancient chronicler Thucydides also contracted the disease, but survived to tell about the plague.\n\n\nGO TO :\nhttp://www.geocities.com/avinash_abhyankar/history.htm

"Soap is polarized at one end, and non-polar at the other.\n\nYou know how water and oil don't mix?  That's because water is polar and oil is non-polar.  As a rule, ""Like dissolves like.""  So polar things dissolve in water, non polar things dissolve in oil.  We call polar things ""hydrophilic"" (""water-loving""), while non-polar things can be called either hydrophobic (""water-fearing"") or lipophilic (""oil-loving"").  Since oil and water don't dissolve well in one another, they tend to separate from eachother.\n\nSoap is special because it is hydrophilic at one end and hydrophobic at the other.  This makes it act as a bridge between the two.  Oil gets washed away with soap because the soap molecule will orient itself around little droplets of oil with the hydrophobic end in the oil, leaving the hydrophilic end facing the water.  This allows the water to carry away the small droplets of oil packaged in a coat of soap, and hence cleans you by removing things not normally soluble in water."
Precipitation, evaporation, and transpiration are all terms that sound familiar, yet may not mean much to you. They are all part of the water cycle, a complex process that not only gives us water to drink, fish to eat, but also weather patterns that help grow our crops.  \n\nWater is an integral part of life on this planet. It is an odorless, tasteless, substance that covers more than three-fourths of the Earth's surface. Most of the water on Earth, 97% to be exact, is salt water found in the oceans. We can not drink salt water or use it for crops because of the salt content. We can remove salt from ocean water, but the process is very expensive.\n\nOnly about 3% of Earth's water is fresh. Two percent of the Earth's water (about 66% of all fresh water) is in solid form, found in ice caps and glaciers. Because it is frozen and so far away, the fresh water in ice caps is not available for use by people or plants. That leaves about 1% of all the Earth's water in a form useable to humans and land animals. This fresh water is found in lakes, rivers, streams, ponds, and in the ground. (A small amount of water is found as vapor in the atmosphere.)

"There are a broad number of things which could happen when a thunderstorm crosses water. If the water is cool, yes it could weaken a thunderstorm.\n\nBut more often than not, if it reaches a body of warm water it will strengthen. If you've ever been in Florida in the summer, you know about ""pop-up"" thunderstorms which form in the Gulf and Atlantic.  And if the conditions are right in tropical or semi-tropical waters, a thunderstorm could turn into a hurricane(which technically isn't a thunderstorm since it draws its energy from the heat of condensation and not from two layers of contrasting temperature air."
How old is she? I'll try to keep it simple. :-)\n\nBirds don't have vocal chords like humans do. \nThe air they breathe goes through the trachea and the paired bronchi to the lungs. The trachea and bronchi are tubes supported by cartilaginous rings. At some point along the length of the trachea (usually at the place where it splits to form the bronchi), the walls of the tube are enlarged and modified, forming the syrinx (plural syringes). It is formed by modified cartilaginous rings associated with special muscles, and also two membranes at the base of each bronchus. Although the exact mechanism for sound production is controversial, it seems that these syringeal membranes vibrate, and the different sounds are produced by modulation of the vibrations by differential contraction of the special muscles. It's been also suggested that the vibrations are not produced in the membranes but in other parts of the syrinx. \nIn any case, the birds with greater number of syringeal muscles are the best singers. For instance, songbirds have 5-9 pairs of muscles, whereas parrots have 3 pairs; some birds such as storks, ostriches or vultures lack these muscles.

You can do this a couple ways.\n\n1.  One computer produces a constant tone and the other computer produces a tone that varies within a few Hz over a period of several seconds.  You will hear wa-wa-wa as the tones constructively and destructively interfere.\n\n2.  Set up two speakers 10 ft or so apart.  Both speakers produce a tone having a wavelength equal to the distance between speakers.  As you walk from one speaker to the other, the sound will increase and decrease as you move from the area of constructive to destructive interference.  If you change the wavelength of the sound to 1/2, 1/3, etc. of the distance between speakers, the sound will increase-decrease 2, 3, etc. times.

An observer next to the train, there will be no change (higher or lower) in the tone of the whistle. In fact, when the train comes by the station, the whistle tone when the train is next to you, is the tone an observer in the train (or when the train is just sitting still) hears. \n\nDoppler ultrasound for blood flow is much the same. The sensor is different (reflected high frequency sound) and the moving thing is different (fluid in tubes, ie, blood in arteries and veins), but the principle is the same. \n\nThere are of course, obvious differences. No one can stand right next to an artery and listen to the blood 'whistle' change tone up or down, and the moving thing (blood) is continuous, not a single thing like a locomotive, or even several of them.\n\nSo the ultrasound people have to do a slightly off line Doppler because they can't get right in line with the blood flow. It veers all over the place anyway as the arteries go from hither to thither. Look up one of those skeletal visible arteries human bodies and trace one of the arteries, say that big one on the inside of the thigh (it's the femoral artery). Not many rail straight stretches there.\n\nWhat is done instead is to look from the side at the artery, and calculate flow velocity from that measurement. More complex than the train whistle example, but it saves cutting into legs or whatever to get a sensor into 'in line' position. So what angle can be used?\n\nWell, neither 0 or 180 degrees are possible. Would have to dig in to get into position. And 90 degrees would be useless since it would look at blood flow from the side -- no relative motion toward or away to measure. Obviously, something in between (0 - 90 or 90 - 180 depending on your perspective) is the only practical choice. The actual path of the blood vessel being looked at (with respect to the skin surface where the ultrasound head will be) will affect the possible angles of the ultrasonic beam bounced off all that moving blood, but the favored angle you mention is probably dictated by the ultrasound machine (hardware or software) which may have limits of one sort or another. So for one machine the best angles may have to be between 45-60  degrees while another might range from 45-70 degrees. \n\nYou might want to check the manufacturer's web site, which might have a specification sheet or a user manual which would address the issue. A friendly physician or PA might be able to illuminate the issue, as might an ultrasound technician.

Hopkins, Johns, 1795—1873, American financier and philanthropist, founder of Johns Hopkins Univ., b. Anne Arundel co., Md. In 1819 he founded his own commission firm, later known as Hopkins Brothers, and also went into banking. He later had a large part in the growth of the Baltimore & Ohio RR, of which he became a director in 1847. His cognizance of Baltimore's lack of medical facilities in times of epidemic and his own scant education led him to bequeath, a few years before his death, $7 million for the founding of a free hospital and Johns Hopkins Univ.
That is a very broad question. There are several ways that A-fib can be treated, it depends on the severity of the A-fib and how the patient presents.  Sometimes it can be controlled with a mild medication, other times you need combinations of medications. Sometimes the patient may even need a pacemaker.  Each situation is different.  A physician should be consulted.
"Before the ""fingerprint"" analysis, the DNA must be sampled and stored properly. Even blood or semen that has soaked into a rug or dried in the sunlight can be a source for sample cells. An analysis can be done from as few as 100 cells but requires several steps:\n\n\nScientists extract DNA from the cells.\n\nRestriction enzymes cut the DNA into pieces of various sizes.\n\nGel electrophoresis separates pieces by size.\n\nSeparated pieces are transferred to a nylon membrane, and some sequences are labeled with a radioactive substance called a probe.\n\nX-ray film is exposed by the radioactive emissions of only the labeled sequences. The developed film, called an autorad, shows the familiar track pattern of a DNA profile. \n\n\nCheck OJ Simson case, DNA Fingerprinting was used"
See what bacteria are on your hands after you wash them with different kinds of soap versus just rinsing them with water.  The trick is getting the starting point to be the same.  I think what you'd need to do is wipe your hands down with alcohol and have a source of bacteria (a piece of raw chicken could work) that you rub your hands on each time.  I would imagine something like: rinse your hands with ethanol (to kill whatever is already there), touch the bacteria source, wipe your fingers on a control plate (if you don't have proper aguar plates, you can use chicken broth as per the experiment above), wash your hands with the soap to be tested, and wipe your hands on another plate.  Rinse your hands with enthanol again and repeat for other soaps and plain water.  Leave the samples to grow overnight (or longer) and compare the bacteria growth on the different plates.\n\n___________________\nI just thought of another experiment that could be really cool... Leave your plates (or chicken broth, or whatever) out in the air for a while, so they get both mold and bacteria growing on them.  Let them grow for a while, and observe the locations of bacteria in relation to mold.  That's how Alexander Flemming discovered penicillin!

This is simple algebra.  The rate thing 100 pgs / hr is a number as much as any number.  If we say X is the rate Marge types then Homer types at 2 * X and your equation is\n\n100 pgs/ 3 hrs = (2 * X) + X = 3 * X\n\nsolving for X we get Marge typing at 11.11 pgs/hr and Homer typing at 22.22 pgs/hr - So Marge will take 9 hours to do 100 pages on her own and Homer 3 hours.

No, you cannot have 24 pairs of chromosomes even with mutations. Having XXXX does not give you 24 pairs of chromosomes; you still have 23 pairs with 4 chromosomes in pair #23. Your total number of chromosomes increases in that case to 48 instead of the normal number 46.\nMutations will either add or decrease the total number of chromosomes by either adding or deleting a chromosome to one pair. Notice that more than one chromosome could be added to a pair.\nDown's syndrome is caused by an extra chromosome to pair #21, resulting in 47 chromosomes with of course 23 pairs. Klinefelter's results in an extra X with also 23 pairs. The individual has 47 chromosomes; the 23rd pair or sex chromosomes is XXY.
This is for service voltage...\n\nFor any specific nominal voltage, the operating voltages on a power system will differ from that nominal value due to voltage drop in the system as well as changes in the system’s operating condition. It is important that the design and operation of power systems and accompanying utilization equipment be coordinated with respect to these voltage variations so that the performance of customer equipment will be satisfactory throughout a range of the actual voltages encountered on the system.\n\n\nVoltage is divided into two ranges: A and B. Each voltage range is listed for two locations: service and utilization. Service voltage is measured at the point of delivery; utilization voltage is measured at the terminals of the utilizing equipment.\n\nYou know lot's of electrical devices have different voltage ranges in power systems such as transformers and in power electronics like convertors and sensors... so it actually depends on the specific type of voltage range you ask for..
"Sodas are carbonated, meaning that they have Carbon Dioxide gas dissolved in the liquid.  When a soda goes ""flat"", almost all the Carbon Dioxide has escaped.\n\nCarbon Dioxide is a gass at any normal pressure/temperature we would deal with soda at (refrigerator, store shelf, ...), and being a gas, its solubility in water depends greatly on two things, the temperature of the solution and the pressure above the solution.\nA lower temperature or higher pressure makes CO2 gas more soluble in water, thus it is always best to keep your botttles closes and in the refrigerator in order to keep the soda from going flat.\n\nThe carbon Dioxide gass dissolved in the water reaches an equilibrium with CO2 that has gotten out of solution and has become trapped inside the bottle above the liquid, when this happens, the amount of CO2 in solution is constant.  When you open the bottle and relieve the pressure above the liquid, the equilibrium is disturned and the gas dissolved in the liquid comes out of solution to try to re-establish the equilibrium.  That is why you see a bunch of bubbles when you open a soda bottle/can, it is the CO2 gas coming out of solution due to the decrease in pressure."

"The same people who invented the wheel five or six thousand years ago (the Mesopotamians) also fancied the number sixty, basing their entire number system on it. No one seems to know exactly why--it might even have been related to trade: for commercial purposes, it's helpful to use a number that has many factors, and sixty has twelve of them, more than any other manageable number.... Whatever the reason, the Babylonians picked the system up and passed it on to the Egyptians, who used it to divide the circle into 360 degrees (6 x 60) and who also gave us the symbol for degrees. The Egyptians divided spheres into 360 degrees as well, assigning the first latitude and longitude lines to the earth. This ancient system for dividing the circle has persisted to the present. Each degree of the circle is divided into 60 minutes (60') and each minute into 60 seconds (60"").\n\nFor more information about the origin of the system for dividing a circle into 360 degrees see also:\n\nBynum, W.

Several reasons:\n\n1) Radio waves go through the earth's atmosphere, so we can detect them and stay on the ground. This is also true for visible light, but is not true for UV, gamma, and other regions of the spectrum.\n\n2) Hydrogen has a particularly noticeable radio frequency and that helps us to make maps of where things are in the universe.\n\n3) It is relatively easy to do interferometry with radio waves, so more resultion can be obtained in some studies.\n\n4) Radio waves go through dust fairly easily, unlike visible light. THis allows us to 'see' things with radio that we could not see otherwise.
If you are in a dark place, I'd suggest 50mm. They collect more starlight and are able to bring out some more of the dimmer stars. The other main question is which magnification to use. Both 7x and 10x are pretty standard for astronomy, although the 10x are harder to keep steady if you are only holding them by hand (rather than using a mount). If you are in a city, 35mm may give as good as you can get simply because the light from the city will wash out anything interesting. :(\n\nAlso, check for multicoating on all the surfaces. This will dramatically increase the amount of light that gets through and is very worth it! (I have 7x50 and 10x70 myself)

The rivers are not salty because an important source of their water is rain, which does not have salt.  But the water that runs through the land picks up dissolved salts and carries it to the ocean, where it accumulates over time.  That is the water that evaporates off the surface and becomes the rain that falls on the land to feed the rivers.  The salt does not evaporate, and is left behind in the ocean to accumulate.  So the salt from the land is gradually transferred to the ocean by the rain and by rivers that run to the ocean, etc.
Supersonic means faster than the speed of sound.\n\nThe speed of sound varies with the density of the medium that it travels in, and so it varies with the altitude that an aircraft flies at. At sea level the speed of sound is 340 metres per second, which is 761 miles per hour.
Data is collected for various values of the experimental variable while the controlable variables are kept constant.\n\nIn chemical and some biological laboratory tests where one wishes to quantify a particular element or compound in a sample, the procedure calls for using a known standard and/or a control.

As HayHarbr said, it can take a long time to solve manually!\n\nFurther comments:\n\n1) If things do not simplify, we shall get a solution with reverse trigonometric function (ArcSin).\n\n2) What about the approximation \nR2 = SQRT[R1^2 + (R1^2)/4 + (R1^2)/16]\nR1 = radius of the field\nR2 = length of the rope\n\n3) Hope you allow considering that the field is FLAT, neglecting also the sphericity of the Earth.

"1) x^2 - 4  \nThis is a problem called the difference of squares. They are presented in the form of (a)^2 - (b)^2. A difference of squares problem always factors to (a+b)(a-b).\nIn this case, a = x and b^2 = 4. sqrt(4) = 2, so b=2.\nPlug it in to your algorithm, an you have (x+2)*(x-2)\n\n2) 4x^2 - 9\nAnother difference of squares. As a starter, sqrt(4x^2) = 2x, and sqrt(9) = 3. \n\n3) x^2 + 8x + 16\nNow for something completely different. The following is a true statement.\n(Ax + B)(Cx + D) = (AC)x^2 + (BC)x + (DA)x + (BD)\nSo, if this will factor, you need to find A, B, C, and D so that AC = 1, BD = 16, and BC+DA = 8. [The last one is true because of the distributive property of multiplication, in other words ""xz + yz = (x+y)z"" ] \nThe first assumption we are going to make is that because AC = 1; A = 1 and C = 1. This won't always be true, and if we can't find something to match the others, we can always go back and change that assumption. We do this because it's the easiest to work with. Since A=1 and C=1, then we can rewrite ""BC + DA = 8"" as ""B+D=8"".\nNow, go back to when you learned to multiply signed numbers. The only way you can have a positive number as a product is when both multipliers are the same sign. Now, go back farther to adding signed numbers and remember that a negative plus a negative is always going to be a negative. Since ""BD"" is positive and ""B+D"" is positive, then both B and D are positive. In fact, the only two numbers that fulfill both statements are B=4, D=4 (If that jump's too great for you, factor 16 and you get 2*2*2*2. That means your choices for pairs are 2,8 (adds to 10, so wrong); 1,16 (17); and 4,4 (8).)\nSo, when we plug our numbers back into that statement a few dozen lines ago, we get the factoring of \n(x+4)*(x+4), or (x+4)^2\n\n4) 4(x^2) + 4x + 1\nOK, this is the same deal. (ax+b)(cx+d)=ac(x^2)+adx+bcx+bd\nSo, ""bd=1"", ""ad+bc=4"", and ""ac=4""\nSince we have another product of 1; assume, for a minute, that ""b=1"", ""d=1"". That means ""a+c=4"" and ""ac=4"". Again, both product and sum are positive, so both ""a"" and ""c"" are positive. Factor 4, and you get 2*2. So your choices are 1,4 (sum of 5); and 2,2 (4). So, plug back in and you get\n(2x+1)(2x+1) or (2x+1)^2\n\n5) 2d^2 - 18.\nThis one is a tricky one. You can't do the difference of squares, because sqrt(2) and sqrt(18) are both irrational. But there is something you can factor out....\nRight, factor out a two and you have\n(2)(d^2-9) or (2)(d^2 - 3^2)\nNow, you have a difference of squares, and can easily get the answer.\n(2)(d+3)(d-3)"

No, philosophy is not a social science.  In college it is usually categorized as part of the Humanities and Arts section or department.  The difference between philosophy and social science is that philosophy is a belief system based on the use of reason and logic (Metaphysics), while the social sciences are a belief system based on empirical observation to find truth or SCIENCE.  Thus, a social science like sociology is based on the actual physical study of society to explain social phenomena, but a philosophy like ethics or existentialism is based on the the use of thought experiments and rational thinking to explain human behavior and society.

Antlia was named by Abbé Nicolas Louis de Lacaille. Originally it was called Antlia Pneumatica and Machine Pneumatique, and it was named after the air pump invented by Robert Boyle.\n\nthis constellation does not belong to the old, (in the north) long known ones. It belongs to the La Caille constellation family and is located in the southern hemisphere\n\nI believe it is formed by three stars. Difficult to figure out the likeness of an airpump with whatever you can sketch with three points, but that is it. \n\nFor further info:\n\nhttp://www.coldwater.k12.mi.us/lms/planetarium/myth/antlia.html

A = abc which means Absorbance is influenced by pathlength(cuvette size/test tube?), absorptivity(characteristic of the material)and concentration. Increasing any of these factors increases absorbance.
It is spherical because as all the planets were made gravity pulled in dust and particles from all directions so that's why we have spherical planets.
Yeah, what he said - almost. C. botulinum is a bacteria which produces the neurotoxin botulin. When we ingest this toxin, we get botulism. Its possible uses in biological warfare as a paralytic and death-causing agent are frightening. Interestingly, Botox is made from botulinum toxin A, one of the poisons made by these bacteria.

A quadratic function can have 0,1,or 2 x-intercepts. Put a negative parabola (opens downward) over the Cartesian plane and move it around. You'll see that 0 intercepts occur if the parabola is completely in the negative y part of the plane, 1 intercept occurs only in the special case where the vertex of the parabola is also a (double) root of the parabola, and two roots occur if any part of the parabola is positive.\nSo in other words, find out where your vertex is! For parabola y(x)=ax^2+bx+c, the vertex is at the point x=-b/(2a). Note that you can also complete the square to get the same information. A third route is to use the quadratic formula to see how many real roots the function has, which is how many times it touches the x-axis. Use whichever method seems easiest to you at the time.
In short, there is no real difference between a petroleum diesel vehicle and a biodiesel vehicle  (emphasis on biodiesel, not unprocessed vegetable/animal oils and fats).  You can burn biodiesel in a regular diesel car.**\n\nBiodiesel tends to be more solvent than petroluem diesel, so older systems that may have natural rubber components will need to have those replaced with synthetic rubber that won't break down.\n\nBiodiesel can be winterized just like petroleum diesel.\n\nBiodiesel is a definite benefit over petroluem in the sense that it is renewable.  It is also carbon neutral, meaning that the same amount of carbon dioxide emitted by burning it was absorbed by plants that went into producing it.  It is less toxic than petroleum diesel.  It reduces foreign dependence on oil while stimulating the domestic economy at the same time.\n\nThe drawback is that it is still just a little more expensive than petroleum diesel and its manufacturing is still not yet widespread.\n\n**Note: Due to the manufacturing standards currently in place for biodiesel, many diesel manufacturers will not warranty their engine running any concentration greater than 5% biodiesel (B-5).  So note that running a higher concentration of biodiesel, or straight biodiesel may void your engine warranty.\n\nAlso, because biodiesel is a solvent, it will clean the fuel system.  So, after the first couple of tankfuls, you will probably need to replace your fuel filter since the biodiesel will loosen up all of the gunk in your fuel tank and it will collect in the filter.

"The stars are different colours not only due to there size and mass, but due to an effect called the Doppler shift. Also remember what Einstein said, ""It is all relative to the observer"". A Red giant to us, would be a blue giant if viewed from a different angle elsewhere in the Universe. Now my question to you is, Where in the Universe would you have to be to see this Blue Giant? As to the colour temperature of the sun, take a Bunsen burner or propane burner that you find in any school lab class and play with the air fuel ratio and watch the colour of the flame change. If the ratio of gases that cause our sun to burn changes, it will effect the colour temperature in which it burns. Remember there is more to the universe than what the eye thinks it sees. I hope this answers your question."

Obviously if you walk in the same direction of the train in which you are, your speed seen from a person outside will be the sum of the train speed and you own speed related to the train. So you can travel faster than the train, at least for a while.\nMaybe, what they are trying to say, is that you and the train will get to destiny at the same time, unless you get out of the train, so your avarage speed will be finally the same as the train if you start and end in the same place (for example, your seat).\n\nA very differnt thing is when velocities are close to the speed of light. You cannot go faster than the speed of light, velocities don't sum without taking into account the relative times. But unless the train doesn't go at the speed of light, you can move a bit faster.

The solar wind is a continuous stream of ions (electrically charged particles) that are given off by the sun. Since the particles are emitted from the Sun as the Sun rotates, the solar wind blows in a pinwheel pattern through the solar system. It takes the solar wind about 5 days to reach Earth; it has a velocity of about 500 miles/hour (800 km/sec). The solar wind travels along vibrating magnetic waves which are propagated by the Sun
The reason our eyes are sensitive to the visible light spectrum that they are is because that is the same spectrum over which our star has the greatest output that our atmosphere doesn't absorb. There are more visible light photons (if I remember correctly at a range of ~400-750 nm) bouncing off and being absorbed by objects (to give them color) then any other natural form of radiation.\n\nI'm no botonist, but I believe that although plants may utilize other wavelengths of light (since all light travels at relatively the same speed, the wavelength is proportional to the frequency (frequency = constant/wavelength)) they are optimized to absorb visible light, which is why they appear green - they absorb blue and red light for photosynthesis. They use the same range for photosynthesis as we do to see because they reside under the same sun.

There are certain principles that apply to calculate the strength of intermolecular attraction particularly at surface of a liquid.\n\nAs much the electronegativity within a molecule, it forms stronger polar molecule.\n\nAs much the number of polar bonds in a molecule, it makes stronger polar molecule.\n\nAs much the polarity of a molecule, it forms stronger inter-molecular bonds (often H-bond).\n\nIn case of of water Oxygen forms two bonds with Hydrogen so its polarity is higher than ethanol where only one H-O bond is formed.\nThis makes water more polar than ethanol and so stronger inter-molecular bond exist in water.\n\nAt surface of a liquid the forces of inter-molecular forces are disbalanced because of absence of molecules on the upper side. \nThis equally applies in all liquids however it affects surface attraction (surface tension) as compaired to other molecules within the liquid that is why surface tension is separately referred.\n\nNote: If you do not follow in first reading please do it again and you will understand easily.

You are right, you can not completely remove all the ions from water.  The equilibrium of water would just form more H+ or OH- as soon as you remove them.\nDI water is a reference to the fact that it doesn't contain ions other than H+ and OH-.
The first step to solving these problems is knowing what Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures actually is.  The law states that the P(total)= P(1) + P(2) ... {with the items in parentheses in subscript}.\n\nFor #1, I know that the total pressure is 760.0 Torr.  I know that the water pressure at 25 degrees Celsius is 23.8 Torr.  So according to Dalton's Law, 760.0=23.8 + P(O2).  I know that P(O2) is the only pressure left because it is the only gas in the container.  So, with some subtraction, P(O2) = 736.  There are only 3 sig figs here, so don't add the .2.\n\nFor #2, I need to employ the theory of the mole fraction. The mole fraction is found for a particular substance in the container, and is found in the same ratio as partial pressures.  To find the mole fraction, take the number of moles of the substance and divide by the total number of moles in the container.  So, by knowing the mole fraction, I can then multiply that number by the total pressure to find the partial pressure.  I will do this for you for only H2.  The mole fraction for H2 is 2.00mol/14.0mol=.143.  .143*800= 114 Torr.\n\nFor #3, since the mole fraction is the same ration as the partial pressure fraction, take 300Torr/760Torr(1atm) = .395.  This is the mole fraction.\n\nThese problems become a lot easier when you remember Dalton's Law, and its applications through mole fractions.  Also, remember to keep the right number of sig figs.

Not having personally read the Copenhagen papers (the debate/dialog) I can't speak in great detail on the topic.  But basically Einstein and Bohr represented different ends of the philosophical spectrum. Einstein, a man of faith, was a determinist and Bohr a pragmatist. The debate which took place over the course of several science meetings revolved around a series of arguments Einstein presented to discredit Quantum Mechanics. Bohr, being a key player in the development of QM, took on the task of defending the this new theory. Such debates go on all the time in the sciences.\n\nWho was right and who was wrong is still up for grabs, though Bohr did an admirable job arguing his case, so much so QM is the working theory used by today's scientists.  There are however a few holes left unexplained such as the relationship between gravimetric forces and electromagnetic forces. A theory bridging these two elements could well lead to another set of debates as where the QM crowd will attack the presenters of the latest greatest theory.  This process is called a paradigm shift and is also a key step in the scientific process.

It depends on where you live.

Asteroids are celestial bodies that orbit the Sun much like the planets do. The reason that they are defined by some other term is simply because they are much smaller in size (generally, thought not all are small in size and some are definitely larger than Pluto).\n\nAsteroids orbit the Sun in elliptical orbits and are present in the area between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some of the orbits cross the Earth and hence can collide against Earth.
Hey! Thanks for mentioning the term KBO, I had very faint memories of the topic and your mention refreshed my memory. To again remind myself all about Kuiper Belt Objects, I went here-\nhttp://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?method=4&dsid=2222&dekey=Kuiper+belt&curtab=2222_1&linktext=Kuiper%20belt\n\nNow, I am back to answer your question loaded with my thoughts and ideas. Here is what I reckon-\nAccording to the recent observations, it has been proved without the shadow of doubt that Pluto is a KBO. But, it is still unclear that whether it is a large asteroid or a planet due to its smaller size. \n\nBut again, that is another thing because, a heavenly body can be a KBO and a planet at the same time. It can also be a satellite and a KBO at the same time. Consider the moon of Neptune which was a KBO and now is a satellite of Naptune.\n\nSo, we can say that although Pluto falls in the Kuiper belt. It doesn't have an effect on its being an asteroid or a planet although, if it were discovered right now, it is most likely that scientists won't call it a planet. But, Because, it is orbiting the sun even as a KBO and is no different from any body in the solar system. The main point of discussion regarding this is whether it is a Planet or an asteroid?

B/c global warming is heating the gulf of mexico. And a hurricane gets its power from warm water. SO when the hurricanes go thro the gulf it gets speed and power so it is more powerful than years before.
As your speed increases, the speed of time around you approaches infinity, if that makes any sense. So if you were traveling at 99% the speed of light, you might see many years pass by during the three years you are travelling. If you are actually at the speed of light though, time around you moves infinitely fast, according to the formula anyway. Not sure what that would really be like.

The answers about 1kg being 1kg no matter what the metal are correct.\n\nThe heaviest metal is Osmium which has a specifc gravity of approx 22 and a half - meaning that it weights 22 and a half times as much as water, to put it into context a bucket of water weighs about 10kg but a bucket of osmium would weigh nearly quarter of a ton.  It's about twice as heavy as lead.\n\nJust out of interest, if you had a lump of anti-matter about the size of a marble it would weight the same as the whole earth.

Vitamin C is a water-soluble nutrient essential for life, used by the human body for many purposes. It is one of a number of such key nutrients called vitamins.\n\nTo the best of scientific knowledge, all animals and plants synthesize their own vitamin C, except for humans and a small number of other animals, including, apes, guinea pigs, the red-vented bulbul, a fruit-eating bat and a species of trout. This has led a minority of scientists, most notably Linus Pauling to conclude that failure to produce the chemical by an animal species is a genetic defect and to hypothesize that if it were replaced in humans to the level found in animals better health would result.\n\nVitamin C was first isolated in 1928, and in 1932 it was proved to be the agent which prevents scurvy. In 1937 Albert Szent-Györgyi was awarded the Nobel Prize for this feat.\n\nVitamin C is a weak acid, called ascorbic acid or ascorbate (an L-enantiomer of ascorbic acid; an L-enantiomer is simply one of two mirror image forms of the same chemical molecular structure, see optical isomers). The active part of the substance is the ascorbate ion, which can express itself as either an acid or a salt of ascorbate that is neutral or slightly basic. Commercial vitamin C is often a mix of ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate and/or other ascorbates. Some supplements contain in part the D-enantiomer, which is useless but harmless. See the ascorbic acid article for a full description of the molecule's chemical properties.\n\nFunctions in the body\n\nAs a participant in hydroxylation, vitamin C is needed for the production of collagen in the connective tissue. These fibers are ubiquitous throughout the body; providing firm but flexible structure. Some tissues have a greater percentage of collagen, especially: skin, mucous membranes, teeth and bones. \n\nVitamin C is required for synthesis of dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline in the nervous system or in the adrenal glands. \n\nVitamin C is also needed to synthesize carnitine, important in the transfer of energy to the cell mitochondria. \n\nIt is a strong antioxidant. \n\nThe tissues with greatest percentage of vitamin C — over 100 times the level in blood plasma — are the adrenal glands, pituitary, thymus, corpus luteum, and retina. \nThe brain, spleen, lung, testicle, lymph nodes, liver, thyroid, small intestinal mucosa, leukocytes, pancreas, kidney and salivary glands usually have 10 to 50 times the concentration present in plasma. \n\nNo bodily organ stores ascorbate as a primary function, and so the body soon depletes itself of ascorbate if fresh supplies do not continue to arrive through the digestive system, eventually leading to death if unresolved.
According to the spontaneous theory, mold forms randomly\n\nLouis Pasteur showed molds and otehr such bacteria are airborne and always present.
activation energy \n  \n  \nin chemistry, minimum energy needed to cause a chemical reaction. A chemical reaction between two substances occurs only when an atom, ion, or molecule of one collides with an atom, ion, or molecule of the other. Only a fraction of the total collisions result in a reaction, because usually only a small percentage of the substances interacting have the minimum amount of kinetic energy a molecule must possess for it to react. When the reactants collide, they may form an intermediate product whose chemical energy is higher than the combined chemical energy of the reactants. In order for this transition state in the reaction to be achieved, some energy must enter into the reaction other than the chemical energy of the reactants. This energy is the activation energy. Once the intermediate product, or activated complex, is formed, the final products are formed from it. The path from reactants through the activated complex to the final products is known as the reaction mechanism. (Reaction mechanisms for complex reactions may involve several steps analogous to that described here.) Because the heat energy of a substance is not uniformly distributed among its atoms, ions, or molecules, some may carry enough heat energy to react while others do not. If the activation energy is low, a greater proportion of the collisions between reactants will result in reactions. If the temperature of the system is increased, the average heat energy is increased, a greater proportion of collisions between reactants result in reaction, and the reaction proceeds more rapidly. A catalyst increases the reaction rate by providing a reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy, so that a greater proportion of collisions result in reaction. The activation energy and rate of a reaction are related by the equation k=Aexp(-Ea/RT), where k is the rate constant, A is a temperature-independent constant (often called the frequency factor), exp is the function ex, Ea is the activation energy, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the temperature. This relationship was derived by Arrhenius in 1899. Because the relationship of reaction rate to activation energy and temperature is exponential, a small change in temperature or activation energy causes a large change in the rate of the reaction. Activation energies are usually determined experimentally by measuring the reaction rate k at different temperatures T, plotting the logarithm of k against 1/T on a graph, and determining the slope of the straight line that best fits the points.

Squinting utilizes the muscles that control the lens and your eye. By squinting you are chaging the focal length of the lens and the physical shape of your eyeball. The muscles are actively compensating for the defect in your vision. It is hard to maintain this level of visual acumen and it is very  tiring, hence the reason people wear glasses or contacts. But small defects can be overcome with squinting for brief periods. This is also the school of thoght behind the vision repair methodology. They claim to be able to teach you to use your muscles to correct vision deficiencies. While minor problems can be corrected with rertraining muscles, any substantial changes to the shape of the eye or the position of the lens is too straining for muscles alone and laser surgery, glasses or contacts are needed.

2 lines are parallel if and only if their slopes are equal.  To get the slope of the line 2y - 14 = 0, get its slope-intercept form:\n2y - 14 = 0\n2y = 14\ny = 7\n\nClearly, the slope is 0.\n\nSince you know the slope, m = 0, and it passes through (0,3/4), use the point-slope form of the equation of the line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\ny - 3/4 = 0(x - 0)\ny - 3/4 = 0\ny = 3/4 (slope-intercept form)\nor\n4y = 3 (standard form)\nor\n4y - 3 = 0 (general form)\n\nNote:\nThe point-slope form was derived from:\n\nm = rise/run\nm = change in y/change in x\nm = (y - y1)/(x - x1)\nm(x - x1) = y - y1\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nHope you like this ^_^

Most geologists view crude oil, like coal and natural gas, as the product of compression and heating of ancient vegetation over geologic time scales. According to this theory, it is formed from the decayed remains of prehistoric marine animals and terrestrial plants. Over many centuries this organic matter, mixed with dried mud, is buried under thick sedimentary layers of material. The resulting high levels of heat and pressure cause the remains to metamorphose, first into a waxy material known as kerogen, and then into liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons in a process known as catagenesis. These then migrate through adjacent rock layers until they become trapped underground in porous rocks called reservoirs, forming an oil field, from which the liquid can be extracted by drilling and pumping.

Platinum is extremely dense (heavy for its size).  Not only will it not float in water, it will sink faster than lead!  Its extremely difficult to measure the size of a small ring using the water test-I know, Ive tried it and I have access to a laboratory.  Platimun, like gold, is resistant to normal acids.  If your ring resists corrosion from hydrochloric or sulphuric acid, its platinum.
This a question which needs to be answered with lots of knowlegde. Whether they actually exist has never been explained by science but then there are so many things which science is yet to explain or bring out proofs. We got to understand one basic fact the Science means those things which we can understand. For ghosts and paranormal phenomenon we can find thousands of people who can give testimony of their own experiences. So unless science proves ghosts are not there we can never say there are no ghosts. Its upto ourselves to believe or not.

No, the swirling is caused by the direction that the water is shot into the basin.  It can be either clock-wise or counter clock-wise in either hemisphere.  The Coriolis effect does not come into play; it depends on how the toilet is designed.  In many toilets outside the U.S., the water is not shot in a swirling motion and no noticeable Coriolis swirling occurs.

A zymogram is a strip or band of electrophoretic medium showing the pattern of enzymes or isoenzymes after their separation by electrophoresis.\n\nZymography is an electrophoretic technique, based on SDS-PAGE, that includes a substrate copolymerised with the polyacrylamide gel, for the detection of enzyme activity. Samples are prepared in the standard SDS-PAGE treatment buffer but without boiling, and without a reducing agent. Following electrophoresis, the SDS is removed from the gel (or zymogram) by incubation in unbuffered Triton X-100, followed by incubation in an appropriate digestion buffer, for an optimised length of time at 37?C. The zymogram is subsequently stained (commonly with Amido Black or Coomassie Brilliant Blue), and areas of digestion appear as clear bands against a darkly stained background where the substrate has been degraded by the enzyme.

"sq. rt (x)= x^(1/2); 1/(sq.rt.(x)= x^(-1/2); So your expression is x^(1/2) + x^(-1/2) - 1. The first derivative of the sum of the three parts is the sum of the first derivatives of each part. d[x^(1/2)]/dx = 1/2*[x^(-1/2)]; d[x^(-1/2)]/dx = -1/2*[x^(-3/2)]; d(1)/dx = 0. Add the parts and you get: 1/2*[x^(-1/2)] - 1/2*[x^(-3/2)] + 0. If you want to collect terms you can factor out 1/2*[x^(-1/2)], and then you would have 1/2*[x^(-1/2)]*[1- (1/x)]. There are many ways to factor the derived expression, and all would be correct if you stay within the rules of mathematics.

Sorry, water vapour is lighter than dry air.\n\nIMAGINE.\nTake one cubic foot of dry air. On average, it consits of 78% Nitrogen molecules and 21% Oxygen molecules, and 1% of various other gases.\nNow, Each molecule of nitrogen has a molecular weight of 28. And each molecule of oxygen has a molecular weight of 32.\n\nAccording to the laws of nature, if u add watr molecules now to that cubic foot of dry air, either some nitrogen molecules or oxygen molecules would have to leave.\n\nBut, the water molecules, which would replace nitrogen or oxygen, have a molecular weight of 18. This is lighter than both nitrogen and oxygen. That is, replacing nitrogen or oxygen wid water vapour decreases its weight per cubic foot. That meens its density decreases. Read the source below for a more detailed explanation.
no actual scientific reason. its just true and they used it to derive all these laws and stuff. its like why does \n-1 x 1 = -1. it just does and its used to derive other stuff. (i couldnt think of a better example)

"Jayzzz ain't far off. Sound travels by pushing air particles. Best way to imagine it is by imagining a bunch of jerks standing in a line (kind of like this one jerk that answered one of my questions a while back). The first jerk pushes the next guy in line and he runs into and shoves the jerk in front of him and then pushes back on the jerk who pushed him. This continues through the line, so that jerks get compressed together and then push back and become separated. The distance from compacted jerks to separated jerks is one jerk wavelength.\n\nNow imagine a long line of people and there is only one jerk every millionth person. If that jerk shoves someone, they won't shove the person in front of them and they won't shove back on the jerk. This is how it is in space. The Earth is full of jerks, however.\n\nJerks actually refers to atomic matter and the ""shoving"" are particle ""collisions"" (actually they don't collide, the apparent collision is just Pauli Repulsion). In space there are lots, on Earth there are none. On earth, the compacted jerks corresponds to overpressure of air, and separated jerks corresponds to underpressure in air (or any other dense molecular medium like water). In space, there is only a single molecule per millions of area of vacuum, the pressure is actually negative, and sound can't transmit.\n\nIt is proposed that light also requires an ether-like medium to travel through space, due to problems with Hawking radiation that can only be solved if the quantum vacuum acts like a fluid. I'm going to cut it short at that however."
"It's possible. If the air is moving steadily and uniformly you have an easier time with it. This is typically the situation over ocean and away from the eye (ref.). If it's ""choppy"", with small-scale gusts and wind shear, it gets risky. You can encounter this as you penetrate the eye, where winds reach a maximum and then become very slow. A doppler radar might help you recognize such a situation before you fly into it."

The ammonia doesn't stay behind; it's a gas at room temperature.\nFractional distillation will do it, just like moonshinin' does to ethanol.  Heat the ammonia water and the dissolved ammonia gas will come out of solution at a greater concentration than the water vapor if you control the heat.  But if you're trying to make the water potable you must do many fractions; it's not worth it unless in extreme circumstances.

The Gulf Stream is right.  I've sailed across it several times.  It's like a river in the ocean.  There's a line where the water color suddenly changes to a deep electric blue and the water temperature goes up to 80 some degrees.  Benjamin Franklin was the first to make a useable chart of it.
That works, but you need to add the latent heat of fusion required to make the ice into water.  You can do the e=smt where e is the energy required (in J), s is the specific heat of ice(2100 J/kg per degree C), m is the mass of ice (kg), and t is the change in temp (C).\n\ne=(2100)(.1)(20)\ne=4200 J\n\nThen to make it into water, you need to do e=ml, there e is the energy required (J), m is the mass (kg), and l is the laternt heat of fusion (about 3.3 x 10^5 J/kg for water).\n\ne=(.1)(3.3 x 10^5)\ne=33000 J\n\nThen add the two e's together to ge a total\n\ne=37200 J

Just about everything in chemistry has to do with the outer valence shell.  This is no exception.\n\nThe metals in this row (period 6) basically bond with each other using their s and d orbitals.  As with everything else, this works best when you have 1 electron in each (e.g. H2) and worst when they're already full (e.g. He2).  Mercury has them all (it's in column 12 = 2s + 10d), and therefore VERY poor bonding.  In constrast, tungsten (W) has half of them, and exceptional bonding (MP-3422 C), which is why it's used as the filament in light bulbs.\n\nSo why are Cd and Zn solids if they're the same column as Hg?  It has to do mostly with the size (larger = further = weaker bonding), but is best described using band theory.  I'd recommend looking there.  \n\nP.S. Things wierd when there are this many electrons in one atom, like yellow gold.
the photo electric occurs when a light icidence on material , the electrons are attached to material nuclei by binding energy , the electrons will liberated out material if the intensity ( energy / unit area) of incident light is more than binding energy this is done by particular frequency called threshold frequency
Fire needs oxygen to burn, i would figure that adding just the right amount in this case 10% more of water made it burn better.
Is it supposed to say it is thrown from an initial height of 5 feet?  The path of the ball will be in the form of a parabola y=ax^2 + bx + c where\n\na = 1/2 the force of gravity (gravity is -32 feet/second^2, so -16 feet/second^2)\nx = time, so in this case 2\nb = the velocity\nc = the initial starting height\n\nSo just plug in your numbers and solve\n\n= -16*(2^2) + 35*2 + 5\n= -64 + 70 + 5\n= 11 feet\n\nOh, and the function would be h(t) = -16t^2 + 35t + 5

Your question is a bit vague. The study of limits is formalized by the epsilon-delta definition that one learns in introductory calculus, but limits aren't really found that way. Instead, one presupposes a limit using other methods and then proves that limit (or disproves it as may be the case) using the definition. Thus, a possible problem in learning limits may be inexperience with the behavior of functions and series/sequences, but that is easily overcome.\nIf, on the other hand, you're referring to problems that may occur when studying the limit of a function at a point, the largest problem is that limits at the point taken along different directions are not the same, and thus we say the limit of the function at that point does not exist. \nAnother problem is that the limit may exist at the point, but the value of the function at that point is not the same as the limit of the function at that point. When this occurs, we say that the function is not continuous at the point in question.\nThe only other problem is that the limit of the function may not exist due to the function diverging at that point (as one approaches the point from each direction, the value of the function increases or decreases without bound).

Do the matrix vector multiplication and demand AX=0. Then\n1x - 1y - 2z = 0 (eq.1)\n2x - 2y - 4z = 0 (eq.2)\n3x - 3y - 4z = 0\nThe first and last equations are identical. So you have only two equations.\nFrom (1) x = y + 2z  gives in (2)\n2(y + 2z) -2y - 4z = 0\nThis is true for all y and z.\nNow the solution is X = [y + 2z . y, z]\nin which y and z can be chosen as you like it.

"Depends on what you want to measure:\n*Pressure: a manometer is most commonly used to measure the pressure of gasses of a given temperature and quantity.  A manometer works by displacing mercury from a glass tube (measure mmHg - ""millimeters mercury""). \n*Volume: a simple way is to measure volume by displacement (i.e. a balloon of oxygen placed into a bucket of water - measuring the water that is displaced)\n*Weight: weight it.  Or you can go the hard way, multiply the volume of water by the molarity of water (I think it's 1.00M), and the answer by the molecular weight of water (in amu, from the periodic table).\n*Temperature: thermometers, perhaps..."

I'g got for a smooth aproximation method (like cubic splines) and then I'd calculate derivatives.\nIt's as simple as getting 4 points, calculating a third degree polynomial and that's it, if all you need is thhe derivative in one point.\nIf you need a complete derivative plot, then use that method for the first segment. Next, use two more points and add the restriction of the value of the 8third grade) polynomial as well as its first and second derivatives be same as from the left than from the right in the last point of the previous polynomial; repeat until you have covered all your points.\nThat way, your fucntion and its derivative will be continuous and smooth, which is nice.
"The answer is 1.\nSolution:\n5^n is alway something like: 5*5*5*....*5\nand can never be perfectly divisible by 2, since none of its prime factors is 2, so you know it´s not zero. Therefor, there will always be a remainder. This remainder must be necessarily less that 2, because if it were greater than or equal to 2, then you could ""fit in another 2"" into the quotient. It can then only be 1.\n \nAs a rule, any number that cannot be perfectly divided by 2 yield a remainder of one. Think about it this way, if you have a group of people and you wanna form several pairs, either you have a perfect match or you have 1 person left, if you had another person left, you´d pair them up."
"Ol Doinyo Lengai means ""Mountain of God"" in the language of the Maasai people. I do not speak that language, but I do know that it was a real bastard of a climb! I thank my young friend and onetime neighbor, Rob Anstey, for bringing me there to learn this firsthand. But we were not alone this time. Also along for the adventure were two of our best Tanzanian friends, Julius F. Koola and Ngaya A. Munuo, plus one of Ngaya's school friends named Lucas (or ""Parrot,"" since he had a reputation as a guy who talks a lot) and one of Rob's fellow Englishmen, a young man named John who was in Tanzania for a ""Gap"" year program. We began our climb at half past midnight on June 5, 2002, reaching the summit just before dawn, and returning to our rented Land Rover at 10:30 AM.\n\nTanzania's only active volcano, this mountain is ""only"" 9,400 ft (2,900 m) high, but it's basically a combination sand dune and slag heap, a cone with sides inclined at a 45-degree angle, and the ""trail,"" if you could call it that, takes you straight up it, with no switchbacks to speak of. Like most of my companions, I was half crawling half of the time, backsliding in loose sand and ash, grabbing hold of grass or roots or whatever I could get my hands on, including unreliable rocks which kept crumbling beneath my fingertips. We required frequent rest stops, during which our guide, a Maasai warrior on the downhill side of middle age by my estimate, would often nod off, betraying himself by snoring. There is not a single tree on the mountain, unfortunately, because that would have helped a lot. This is also why we had to make the climb in the middle of the night, because we would have roasted if we'd tried it in the daytime, in 90-degree desert heat with no shade or water to be found. I carried about a gallon of water on my back, and it was enough---barely. My mouth and throat got completely parched by inhaling all of the flying dust and ash kicked up by our passage. By the time we got close to the top, where we got onto some semisolid rock (much of which had a fine frosting of white ash which made me yearn for a powdered custard doughnut), I was hobbling along on my walking stick like an octogenarian. I wasn't the only one. I remember saying to Ngaya that now we know how his grandmother feels every time she takes her regular constitutional from their house to the gate of our school.\n\nEven getting to the mountain was an odyssey. Once we turned north off of the main safari road in Mto wa Mbu (an unfortunate little stopover for tourists on the way to Ngorongoro Crater, the name of the town means ""Mosquito River"") it was four-wheel-drive all the way. Since the dry season was just beginning, the myriad tracks through the bush had turned to dust. Our driver, Isaac, who was, shall I say, a bit too timid for our liking, insisted upon bringing along a friend of his from Mto wa Mbu who supposedly knew the way. Maybe this extra assistance helped, maybe he didn't; we didn't pay the guy anything, but he seemed to calm poor Isaac's nerves. There were several occasions when our vehicle nearly became mired in deep dust the color of butterscotch pudding, and many times when we kicked up such a cloud of the stuff that Isaac actually had to stop and wait for it to settle before he could see well enough to drive on. Of course, these old-school Landrovers are less than hermetically sealed off from the outside environment, so the car and occupants quickly became coated with a fine film of dust. And that was the easy part. The real fun began when we left our campsite at 11:30 PM to drive to the base of Ol Doinyo Lengai. We had added to our party our Maasai guide plus a local youth who just wanted the experience of climbing the mountain. This brought the number in our party to ten, too many to sit inside the Landrover, so Isaac's friend and the extra climber had to ride on the roof rack. It "

I wouldn't suggest trying it.\n\nI'm pretty sure there are both prezygotic and postzygotic barriers to this type of hybridization. That is to say, you probably couldn't get them to mate, and, even if you could, the sperm and egg would not recognize each other and fuse. And, if, by some miracle, you managed to pull this off, there are enough genetic differences (different genes, different chromosome organization, different number of chromosomes, etc) would be so many developmental problems that there is no chance it could survive to term.\n\nBird and dinosaur is even less likely; the last common ancestor between cats and dogs, Miacidae (or one of its relatives), lived 40 million years ago. In contrast, Archaeopteryx, which is thought to be one of the earliest birds, lived some 150 million years ago. If you add the time cats and dogs have been diverging from Miacidae together, it's still only about half the time since birds have been diverging from the relatives of their dinosaur ancestors.

Friction is when there is contact between two surfaces.  If you put your hand on a table and press down and forward, your hand will slide, but it won't slide as easily if your hand were greased with butter, for example.  Friction is what keeps your hand from sliding smoothly.\n\nIt has to do with gravity, because gravity pulls your hand down on the table (in addition to the pressure you put on it).\n\nIn more detail, friction is actually an opposing force.  Your hand wants to slide in the direction you're pushing it in, but it can't as easily because the force of friction is pushing it BACK AGAINST YOU.  The friction opposes (doesn't let it happen easily) your pushing.\n\nHope that helped.

"The name of the tenth planet is 90377 Sedna.  90377 Sedna is a trans-Neptunian object, discovered by Michael Brown (Caltech), Chad Trujillo (Gemini Observatory) and David Rabinowitz (Yale University) on November 14, 2003. At the time of its discovery it was the most distant observed natural solar system body, though this has now been exceeded by 2003 UB313 (a provisional name). \n\nThis particular scattered disc object, 2003 UB313, originally found in 2003 but confirmed two years later by Mike Brown (Caltech), David Rabinowitz (Yale University), and Chad Trujillo (Gemini Observatory), has renewed the old debate about what constitutes a planet since it is ~30% larger than Pluto with an estimated diameter of 1864 miles. It currently has no name, but has been given the provisional designation 2003 UB313, and has been nicknamed ""Xena"" by its discoverers, after the television character. It has many similarities with Pluto: its orbit is highly eccentric, with a perihelion of 38.2 AU (roughly Pluto's distance from the Sun) and an aphelion of 97.6 AU, and is steeply inclined to the ecliptic plane, at 44 degrees, more so than any known object in the solar system except the newly-discovered object 2004 XR190. Like Pluto, it is believed to consist largely of rock and ice, and has a moon. Whether it and the largest Kuiper belt objects should be considered planets or whether instead Pluto should be reclassified as a minor planet has not yet been resolved.\n\nSedna is described as a cold planetoid, perhaps as large as two-thirds the size of Pluto. Sedna, the newly discovered Pluto-like object with a gigantic, highly elliptical 10,500-year orbit that takes it from about 76 to 928 AU, has too distant a perihelion to be a scattered member of the Kuiper Belt and could be the first in an entirely new population. 2000 CR105 is also believed to be a member of this population."

They often have obsessive routines and may be preoccupied with a particular subject of interest. They have a great deal of difficulty reading nonverbal cues (body language) and very often the individual with AS has difficulty determining proper body space. Often overly sensitive to sounds, tastes, smells, and sights, the person with AS may prefer soft clothing, certain foods, and be bothered by sounds or lights no one else seems to hear or see. It's important to remember that the person with AS perceives the world very differently. Therefore, many behaviors that seem odd or unusual are due to those neurological differences and not the result of intentional rudeness or bad behavior...\nBy definition, those with AS have a normal IQ and many individuals (although not all), exhibit exceptional skill or talent in a specific area. Because of their high degree of functionality and their naiveté, those with AS are often viewed as eccentric or odd and can easily become victims of teasing and bullying. While language development seems, on the surface, normal, individuals with AS often have deficits in pragmatics... Vocabularies may be extraordinarily rich and some children sound like ""little professors."" However, persons with AS can be extremely literal and have difficulty using language in a social context."

If you are actually referring to the so called binomial distribution (0 or 1 with a pre-defined propability for each) then you need a sample of 25 where for all samples independently p(0)=0.8, p(1)=0.2. There are many ways to achieve this using excel, statistics packages or a dice.\n\nTry, for example, rolling a die and assuming:\n1 -> 1\n2-5 -> 0\n6 -> reroll\n\nThat will generate a sample from the Binomial distribution. \n\nIf you really want what you exactly described (ie arbitrary arrangement of 20 0s and 5 1s) then you need a random permutation. This, too, is relatively easy to do with a computer. You can even simulate it with the a die with the\nfollowing change:\n\nIf you roll\n1 -> 1\n2-5 -> 0\n6 -> reroll\nBUT If you get a total of 5 ones, stop rolling and consider all the rest to be zeros.\n\nNote that the permutations obtained this way are not uniformly distributed (i.e. some are more propable than others) but they are randomly distributed. \n\nFinally, here's an arbitrary list, generated in a pseudo-random manner (using a computer):\n 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A stop codon is a stop signal that terminates transcription. You might know that RNA polymerase transcribes DNA, for the purpose of protein synthesis. When the required gene is fully copied onto the RNA transcript, it recognizes a stop signal when it reads the stop codon. That is when the transcription stops and the mRNA transcript cuts off from the DNA. \nStop codon is very crucial because without a stop signal the whole DNA would be transcribed, which is a great waste of time and cell energy. \nI hope that helped....
"A lunar cycle:\n\nThis explanation can be a bit confusing, so have patience. The moon takes 27 1/3 days to orbit the earth once, but the number of days between one full moon and the next full moon is 29 1/2 days. Why are these two ""months"" not the same? The answer has to do with the Earth and moon relationship to the sun. If you chart the moon's position every night for a full month, you could compare its position with a bright star, and then wait to see how long it takes for the moon to come back to its position relative to that star. The answer would be about 27 1/3 days. But during this time, the earth has moved nearly 1/12 of the way in its orbit around the sun. So to get from one full moon to the next would take about two days longer, 29 1/2 days, because the moon would have to travel a little further around the earth to get to ""full"" again."

What is dicey is how you interpret the relationships it finds.\n\nBasically, you always have a possibility that the data collected, just by chance, will cause the null hypothesis of no relationship to reject: that's the alpha thing.  You select the chances of a false finding by setting your P-value for rejection.\n\nOn the other hand, ignoring the chances of missing a relationship (beta), the real problem is understanding what any relationship found might mean.  This has nothing to do with the reliability or validity of the test; it has everything to do with the clarity and rigorousness of thought of the person using it.\n\nA case in point, from my own history: ran one of those, and found an amazingly strong correlation between presence of one thing, and presense of another: doesn't matter what they were.  Bottom line: the correlation reflected the fact that both things were results of something else, that I hadn't actually recognized as being a significant variable...  until I revisited the data, years later.  Most embarassing.

"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) is a monoamine neurotransmitter synthesised in serotonergic neurons in the central nervous system and enterochromaffin cells in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nIn the central nervous system, serotonin is believed to play an important role in the regulation of mood, sleep, emesis (vomiting), sexuality and appetite. Serotonin has been thought to play a part in many disorders, notably as part of the biochemistry of depression, migraine, bipolar disorder and anxiety.\n\nThe name ""serotonin"" is something of a misnomer and reflects the circumstances of the compound's discovery. It was initially identified as a vasoconstrictor substance in blood serum - hence serotonin, a serum agent affecting vascular tone. This agent was later chemically identified as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and, as the broad range of physiological roles were elucidated, 5-HT became the preferred name in the pharmacological field."

When you wrap a coil of wire around an iron bar and pass an electrical current through the bar, you create an electromagnet that is capable of temporarily aligning the iron atoms in the bar.  Perhaps all the atoms are aligned a little.  By increasing the current or adding additional turns to the coil or both the strength (flux) of the electromagnet can be increased and the alignment of iron atoms also increased until saturation when maximum strength is obtained.  Rather than increasing penetration, this is likely more like increasing strength at depth (penetration).

first off, the nephron is a single long tube within the kidney.  your blood passes through a thing called the glomerulus which separates your red blood cells and your plasma (all the other stuff in your blood) thats how the chemical wastes get into the nephron. There are alot of nephrons in our body and when the wastes go through the nephron special protein channels take stuff we need from the plasma and put it back into our red blood cells.  the neprons are also permeable to water (in some areas) to allow water to come back into our blood.  i hope this is easy to understand when i first learned it, it was kinda confusing.

Post-vacation syndrome (PVS) is a real syndrome that involves emotional and psychological effects. While going off on vacation is fun and relaxing, dealing with the feelings of letdown after your vacation is stressful and depressing for most people. The following tips will help you overcome that letdown feeling before you go away.\n\n1. Prepare to return to a clean house.\n\n\nComing back to a clean and orderly house will keep your good feelings up. This doesn't necessarily mean that you have to do the work yourself, however. You can hire a maid to clean and organize your home 1-2 days before you leave or return.\n\n2. Set aside 15 minutes a day to read your e-mail.\n\n\nContrary to popular opinion, not responding to your e-mail is stressful during a vacation. Most of us dread the deluge of e-mails that we must face when we get back, particularly if you run a business or enterprise. The dread of having all that e-mail to respond to when you get back is overwhelming; taking a few minutes a day to do this will lessen the pressure and stress of having to do it all when you return. The key here is to take NO MORE than 15 minutes a day.\n\n3. Plan fun time into your first week back.\n\n\nWhether it's going to the movies, reading a book, or taking a hike, having an activity that you can look forward to will help ease the transition back into your everyday routine.\n\n4. Develop your photographs as soon as you get home.\n\n\nDeveloping your photos immediately will keep you in the spirit of the pleasurable vacation time longer.\n\n5. Plan your next vacation on your return trip home.\n\n\nAgain, this gives you something to look forward to and prolongs the relaxing effects of the wonderful time you just had.\n\n6. Plan to work only 1-2 extra hours/day upon your return.\n\n\nMost of us quickly undo the beneficial effects and feelings of our vacations by immersing ourselves in 12-15 hour days when we get back in order to catch up. Planning just an extra 1-2 hours keeps you on top of the workload without rapidly becoming exhausted.\n\n7. Adjust your client schedule.\n\n\nIf you're in a service industry (such as coaching), adjust your client schedule for that month so that you don't have to play catch-up for sessions missed. For example, if you usually coach clients 4 times/month, plan to coach only 3 times that month. Of course, this will entail adjustments on your fees as well but it is well worth the degree of stress you can eliminate from your routine.\n\n8. Play music reminders.\n\n\nPlaying the music of the place where you've been is a soothing reminder of your pleasant vacation and keeps the memories alive longer.\n\n9. Talk about your vacation.\n\n\nTalking to others about your vacation keeps it in the forefront of your mind longer.\n\n10. Stay in touch with people you've met.\n\n\nAs busy as that first week back to work and routine is, it's a good time to make that phone call to 1-2 people you've promised to stay in touch with. Staying in touch keeps the vacation going over time, and it gives you an opportunity to develop new friendships too.

The tiniest part of our lung is called alveolus (plural is alveoli). It is like an inflated balloon . The air in side this balloon is the fresh air we have inhaled.\n Now imagine your ten fingers covering an inflated balloon from all the sides. That is how the blood capillaries cover the alveoli . these blood capillaries have extremely thin wall through which the oxygen, which is at a higher concentration in the fresh air of the alveoli, diffuses in the blood capillary. It is immediately picked up by the hemoglobin in the Red blood cells forming oxyhemoglobin  . It is the source of oxygen to our body. This is then taken to different parts of the body and given to them.\nAt the same time , CO2 collected from the body parts and brought to the alveoli by those very capillaries diffuses in to the air of the alveoli because its concentration in the capillaries is greater. \nThe air in the alveoli is now stale air rich in CO2 and poor in O2. It is exhaled out.\nThus , the gaseous exchange can occur only on the surface of the alveoli . Their walls are as thin as the walls of a soap bubble, only that they are not fragile like soap bubble.

"""push to 7m"" or is that push through 7m\n\nif you are pushing against gravity  the force required is mass*acceleration due to gravity, which is 7*9.8 = 68.6 newtons\n\nHowever we are making two assumptions here, \n1. that acceleration due to gravity is constant at 9.8, which is only true at sea level at the equator, and is different everywhere else, 10m/s^2 at the poles for instance. Moreover g changes negligibily during the course of the movement through that 7 m also. \n2. resistance due to friction, air resistance are completely absent\n\nIt is also important to note that once a force slightly greater than 68.6 newtons is applied, the body starts moving upwards and keeps moving until an opposing force is applied. so to move through exactly 7m, u need to apply a force in the opposite direction to stop the object"

"I like ""builders rubble"" I don't think I can top that.\n\nBut I can tell you that as soon as you leave the universe, time stops (because you've left space time) and normal laws of physics break down. So as you headed outward, first you'd blow by the last bit of radiation into very high energy vacuum state that would probably rip every molecule in you to shreds, but if you could find someway to avoid that and acutally hit the end of space time you'd be unable to move because you can only change position along (x,y,z) over time. As soon as spacetime ended you'd come to a stop; the physics of movement would not work anymore. Within an imperceptible fragment of a second the edge of the universe would catch back up to you and you'd be sitting there wondering what happened (if you noticed anything at all). You could keep trying for an eternity but you'd never be able to leave or ""see"" anything because you're eyes and senses are biased to the physical stimuli of this universe, not the trans-dimensional stuff between universes. All you'd see is black."

"The second part of your question is a bit hard to decipher, but I'm going to take a shot. Why can't non-coding RNAs be knocked down by siRNA? siRNA prevents a messenger RNA from being expressed as a protein. A non-coding RNA, by definition, does not code for a protein. Knock down is at the protein level, and if there is no protein expected to be made, why would you expect to knock it down?\n\nIf you wanted to ask whether non-coding RNAs could be eliminated by a method similiar to siRNA...one difference between small interference RNAs and micro RNAs is how they affect the mRNA transcript, and I always mix these up, so I'll leave it to you to look it up if you're interested. One binds the mRNA and prevents its translation, but leaves the mRNA intact. The other causes it to be degraded. If you wanted to ""knock down"" non-coding transcripts, it seems like it could conceivably be done with the method that causes degradation of the transcript. But it woud have to be tested."

Out of orbit?  Not a chance.  (Remember that the moon, some thousands of miles away, is in earth's orbit.  So I'll assume that you mean out of the atmosphere.)\n\nThe thermosphere surrounding the earth is very hot. Imagine that a jet could go fast enough to break out of the atmosphere (Mach 5 or so would do it I think)- at this speed even the scattered particles of the thermosphere would generate enough heat to destroy all but the most resilient of vehicles.\n\nThe reason this incredible speed is needed is that once the jetplane leaves the dense atmosphere of earth it can no longer run its engines; they are out of air.  The jet could no longer generate forward movement, or lift, and would lose altitude.  Essentially for a jet to breach the atmosphere then it would have to fire itself into space like a bullet, requiring high speeds, which would likely result in its destruction in the thermosphere.

At your home, a water utility supply line into your home is typically only 1 inch in diameter.  This 1 inch pipe is split multiple time to route water to every watter connection in your home i.e toilet, shower, sink, outside faucet.

If the quartic is recognizable as being factorizable into lower degree polynomials then that is the best way to go. If it is not immediately recognizable, the next step is to use the Rational Roots Theorem to check for rational roots, and factor out the corresponding binomials by synthetic/long division if that is the case. \nIf there are no rational roots, then you're pretty much stuck with using the Ferrari's quartic formulas given on http://mathworld.wolfram.com/QuarticEquation.html (equations 36-39).
"Kinda depends on how patient you are and what solids you are talking about.  \n\nVery few substances have a surface which has not in some way interacted with the environment to form a different substance. For example, aluminum very quickly oxidizes in air to form aluminum oxide which is much different from pure aluminum.  If you take two very clean surfaces in a near vacuum, two metals surfaces can come so close together that they actually can swap electrons and weld together.  In normal earth environments, only serious pressure forcing the two together can get this kind of interaction.  \n\nIn all substances above 0 K, the motion of the particles make it possible for individual molecules/atoms to move enough to ""jump the gap"" if they are warm enough, close enough and have small enough differences between the forces that keep them together versus those that attract them to the other team."

this is a category mistake.\n\nADDED COMMENT:\nwell, the way i see it, there are two possible interpretations of your question: a) Does a beam of light ever run out of energy?, or b) Does a beam of light ever stop moving?\n\n(a) is a category mistake because light is energy.  it's not something that has energy.  it just IS energy.  so, the answer using this interpretation is simply no, because it's nonsensical to say that energy loses energy.\n\n(b) can be attacked similarly.  light is being treated as something moving, which seems okay on the face of it, but i don't think it's quite right to treat it that way.  i don't think i'm going to articulate this point successfully (i may be wrong on this anyway), so i'll give you a funny account of why (unimpeded) light will always continue to 'move'.\n\nThe key thing to note is that motion is a relation.  For there to be motion, there have to be at least two things: the thing 'moving' and the thing it is moving in relation to.  if there is only one thing, there is no way to know if it is moving.  if we are to say something is moving, we have to provide the frame of reference too.  e.g. driving in my car, i am moving in relation to the road.  in relation to my car, however, i am not moving.\n\nlight is different than moving objects, however.  einstein's theory of special relativity holds that light travels at the same speed in all frames of reference.  so, it's safe to say that from any possible vantage point (moving at any possible speed), light will always be 'moving' in relation to you, and at the same speed.  so, no, the beam (if unimpeded) will never stop moving.\n\ni hope this is clear enough to be of help.\nalso, if i didn't do your question justice, let me know.  i'd be willing to take another crack at it.
Sodium Hydroxide is the strongest type of principal chemical used in some chemical relaxers because it provides the most long lasting and dramatic effects. However, this same sodium hydroxide is found in drain cleaners which well demonstrates the strength of this chemical. It is what is used in products that are referred to as “lye” relaxers. The strength varies from a ph factor of 10 to 14. With higher ph, the faster the straightening solution will take hold, but the more potential the damage. \n\nGuanidine Hydroxide is the other common option of relaxer chemical used today. This is what is referred to as “no-lye” relaxers. This label can be misleading to some consumers. It does not imply that there aren't any strong chemicals used or that the chemicals used are somehow less potentially damaging. Some have mistakenly thought that with “no-lye” relaxers there are less steps and all the worry of chemical hair straightening is removed. Although this type of chemical hair relaxer can be less damaging than its counterpart, the hair and scalp should be in top condition before attempting treatment, and this type also requires special care when applied. \n\nAll relaxers require conditioning treatments before and after application. The decision to straighten the hair chemically requires much forethought and really a commitment to healthy haircare treatments over a long entire period of time.
I've wondered this myself, after being annoyed seeing polar bears and penguins together on a TV advertisement. As mentioned in previous posts, penguins would only be a seasonally-available food supply, although a good one when present. There are however, six species of seals in antarctic waters, at least one of them (Weddell Seals) maintain breathing holes in the ice throughout the southern winter. They have no experience with land predators, and with the amazing seal-hunting skills of the polar bear, they would be easy prey. I decided that polar bears just may have a chance surviving in the antarctic. Let's not try to find out though, as their presence would be devastating for the species mentioned above and the antarctic ecosystem as a whole. Fun to ponder though!
Maximum O3 concentration occurs near the base of the stratosphere, situated between 15 (or 17 or 19) and 30 (or 36-40) km from the surface of the Earth (exact distances vary according to sources), in the so called ozone layer.
Every element exists in space (exept for those humans have created) and oxygen is the third most abundant after hydrogen and helium. So there is ALOT of oxygen in the universe...\nMolecular oxygen is rare though. Empty space is a vacuum and hardly any matter can be found there let alone oxygen. (Stars like the sun have a significant amount of oxygen atoms in them.) Also oxygen is highly reactive so it forms compounds with other elements any chance it gets. Almost half the moon is oxygen only it is in the form of silicone and metallic oxides and silicates (SiO4- or simply rocks).\n\nFor molecular oxygen to exist something needs to be continously producing it. On earth life is doing the job. If we find molecular oxygen in the atmosphere of an alien planet it is a strong indicator that something strange, possibly life, is happening there. There are trace amounts of oxygen in the atmospheres of both venus and mars but that oxygen can be explained by photodisassociation of water molecules by interaction with the suns ultraviolet rays. Both venus and mars have lost (and are still losing) their water through this process where water vapor is split into hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The hydrogen reach escape velocity and is blasted off into space while the oxygen reacts with other atoms in the atmosphere or with the soil.\n\nWe have found traces of oxygen in interstellar molecular clouds by studying the light from stars that pass through them. With this technique we will soon be able to study the atmospheres of extrasolar planets.

I would suggest art classes (when time permits).  There are many tricks that a good art teacher can pass on to you.  I took adult art classes to improve my musicianship (trombone!).  Who knows more about shading, right?  I was amazed how you can create the illusion of a shadow for an apple (in less than 10 seconds).\n\nI found a book that showed how adults improve almost overnight by drawing up-side-down because you draw what you see and not what you expect to see (see link but it is not the book).  Most people's artistic skills were arrested at their last art class (third grade?) and need to break free of obsolete stick figures.  Also, when drawing a chair do you draw the legs or the spaces defined by the the legs.  Point is that drawing (rendering?) is a skill many have mastered and are willing to teach.  You might also discover a great hobby for relaxation from your career as an architect.  Good luck.
Plants do not germinate. Seeds do. Germination happens when a baby plant is growing. The plant is between the cotyledons. This is a seed. The seed is underground and is collecting nutrients.\n\nWhen a seed begins to grow, we say it germinates. The cotyledons store food for the baby plant inside the seed. When the seed starts to germinate, the first thing to come out is the main root. The skin starts to split and the tiny shoot straightens, carrying the cotyledon(s) with it. The main root gets bigger. Side roots appear and so do leaves. To grow, the seed's growing conditions usually have to be damp, warm, and dark, like springtime soil. A dry seed will stay dormant unless it soaks in some water. Then it will start to germinate.

Sirius is the brightest star in the sky excluding the sun. It has an apparent magnitude of -1.46 and is in the Canis Major constellation. Its name comes from the Greek word for searing or scorching. It is located 8.6 light years from Easth so it is one of the closest stars.
I have heard that there are other means for obtaining stem cells without taking them from fetus's. They need to concentrate their research on doing that instead of killing something. In other words the ends do not justify the means. Think about it this way, if they abort a child how do we know if that kid isn't going to grow up someday to develop a cure for cancer or HIV. Another thing that I don't understand is the same people who agree with abortions and fetal stem cell research are the same ones who cry everytime they use a monkey for medical research. So I guess they thinks its ok to kill a human being, but not an animal. That is very twisted.\nMy advice to you is get informed on the whole thing including the technical aspects and where they are with their research and then form your own opinion.

The speed of light is dependent on the medium in which it is traveling.  Light CAN be slowed down.\n\nIn a vacuum, light travels at exactly 299,792,458 m/s.  However, in other medius, like air or glass for example, light will slow down.  The more optically dense the medium , the more it slows down.  We can define a quanity, called the index of refraction (n), which will help us determine the speed of light in a substance.\nThe higher the index of refraction, the slower light travels.\n\nThe velocity at which light propigates (v) is inversely proportional to the index of refraction (n).\nv = c/n\nwhere c is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nIn a perfect vacuum, the index of refraction is exactly 1.  Air has an index of refraction of just slightly above 1, but often, since it is so close, we can just round it off to be 1.  Glass however (depending on the type) can have much higher indexies of refraction, (~1.3 - 1.5 roughly).\nWhen air moves from lower index of refraction to a higher index of refraction (or vice-versa) it is bent.  This bending of light is due to the fact that the light is slowing down as it enters the medium, which is the case in a prism.\nDifferent wavelengths of light have different indexies of refraction, all wavelengths do not slow down equally.  This is the reason why blue light is bent more easily than red light and appear at opposite ends of the spectrum.\n\nLigh DOES slow down as it enters a more optically dense medium.

"Of course. There are many ""faster-than-light"" proposals considered seriously in contemporary science. Note that none of them violate relativity theory; they either bypass spacetime (wormhole-type solutions and entanglement), or take spacetime along for the ride (space drive).\nSee the source for details. The only things lacking are the energy or scale necessary to make the ideas viable. Keep studying physics and maybe you will be the one to solve these problems."
Think.  \n\nStatic - put weighing scales on treadmill.  user stand on, measure the static force applied to the treadmill.  (which will be equal to the user's weight, so I can't see the point in that one....)\nDynamic - put the scales vertically in front of user, supported on a wall or similar.  The force exerted forwardly by the user pushing on the scales will be equal to the reaction force between feet and deck.\nYou could also mount strain gauges on the deck frame.  Check out readings for stationary and in-use times.

Wrong answer. The heat of fusion (transform ice to water) and heat of vaporization (water to steam) is different.\n\nThe heat of fusion for water is 334 J/g.\n\nThe heat of vaporization for water is 2260 J/g.\n\n\nTo calculate the heat needed:\n\nHeat required = 2260 J/g x 50 g = 113,000 J\n\n\nI never understood the significant figures crap. Maybe someone else can do that part.

Since the pigment within the membrane of the beets are colored red, it's good to test the stress caused on the membrane. The more damage to the membrane, the more color it gives off. Put the beet in the solution that you are going to test in.\n\nPersonally, I tested heat and acid. \nIn general, extreme heat will cause more stress on the membrane than extreme heat. This can be easily observed by the naked eye. \nAcetone has a greater ability to dissolve lipids than methanol, the acetone solvent will cause greater stress on the membrane
The speed of time is relative. You can define it to be what ever you like but it has to be referenced to a time standard at a National Physics Laboratory (Typically an atomic clock - cesium).\n\nGiven this, your speed of time could be 2 bananas with reference to the natural resonance frequency of the cesium atom (9,192,631,770 Hz), or the frequency used to define the second.

Einstein showed that the following is true:\n(m^2)(c^4) = e^2 - (p * c)^2\nwhere m is mass, e is energy, p is momentum, and c is the speed of light.  (It's possible to derive this, but not without a ton of explanation and math.)\n\nFor any particle that has no mass, m = 0.  This means that:\ne = (p*c)\n\nHe also showed that v = (p * c^2) / e, where v is velocity.\n(Again, it can be derived with pain.)\n\nSo, when e = pc, you get v = c.  What this means is that when all of a particle's energy is due to momentum (and none due to mass), the velocity the particle travels HAS to be c.  That's the mathematical explanation.

It depends on the wound. I'm going to assume its big. Using a clean cloth, place it over the injured area. Using a separate cloth wrap it around the limb and tie a knot over the injury. NOTE: Hold ONE finger under the knot when tying to apply the proper pressure. The knot will continue to apply pressure until the bleeding stops. If that doesn't work then you need to see a doc and get stitches. REMEMBER TO CHECK YOUR LIMBS FOR TEMPERATUE AND COLOR. Yo don't want to lose circulation to the rest of your limb. Good luck!
As you know, Fermat's principle states that light always travels the path between points that requires the least amount of time.  Before Fermat, people believed that light always travels the shortest distance between points (Hero's principle I believe).  Hero's principle explains the law of reflection...that the angle of incidence=the angle of reflection, but it doesn't explain refraction.  As you're probably aware, refraction is the bending of light that occurs when light travels into different substances.  If Hero's princple were true, you wouldn't expect the light's path to bend.  Fermat realized that since light traveled different speeds in different substances, the path of least time would necessarily be a bent path.  Thus he came up with the idea that light always travels the path of shortest time between two points.  If you like, Fermat's principle can also be thought of as a consequence of Hamilton's principle and the therory of relativity.  I personally like to think of Hamilton's principle as a Fermatlike principle governing the motion of physical objects.  When veiwed quantum mechanically, Fermat's principle is kind of interesting...hence the other people's reference to Feynmann.

Hypothermia is a dangerous drop in your body's core temperature. FROSTBITE is when your skin/tissue is damaged by cold. Basically, the water in your tissue freezes. Ice crystals damage/destroy tissue cells, and the cells die. If you get serious enough frostbite the skin turns black - meaning the tissue is dead. Which is why fingers and toes need to be amputated... to prevent the spread of gangrene.

A reduction reaction is only half of a reaction. It must occur with an oxidation reaction to be a full reaction, to be called a redox reaction. The reduction half-reaction is one where a species gains electrons, and the oxidation half-reaction is one where a species loses electrons.
ere are several competing versions of the story of how Fahrenheit came to devise his temperature scale. One states that Fahrenheit established the zero (0 °F) and 100 °F points on his scale by recording the lowest outdoor temperatures he could measure, and his own body temperature. He took as his zero point the lowest temperature he measured in the harsh winter of 1708 through 1709 in his home town of Gdańsk (Danzig) (−17.8 °C). (He was later able to reach this temperature under laboratory conditions using a mixture of ice, ammonium chloride and water.) Fahrenheit wanted to avoid the negative temperatures which Ole Rømer's scale had produced in everyday use. Fahrenheit fixed his own body temperature as 100 °F (normal body temperature is closer to 98.6 °F, suggesting that Fahrenheit was suffering a fever when he conducted his experiments or that his thermometer was not very accurate), and divided his original scale into twelve divisions; later dividing each of these into 8 equal subdivisions produced a scale of 96 degrees. Fahrenheit noted that his scale placed the freezing point of water at 32 °F and the boiling point at 212 °F, a neat 180 degrees apart.

Anders Celcius devised the scale orginally, though he had the temperatures running down from boiling instead up from freezing water.  Check out the Wikipedia page below for a more  detailed discussion.

Sound travels through air in longitudunal waves, it vibrates the air molecules as it moves.  It is these vibrations that vibrate your ear drum so you hear the sound.\n\nSpace is a vacuum (ie. no air), without any air there are no molecules to vibrate as so the sound cannot travel.  The more molecules there are per unit area, the faster sound can travel; this is why sound travels faster in water and even faster in a solid.
Physics is a pure science i.e. that which can be tested by experiment. This is therefore an invalid physics question.

a. The presence of a non-volatile solute causes a decrease in the vapor pressure of the solvent. The magnitude of the decrease is directly proportional to the concentration of solute, expressed as the mole fraction:\nΔPvap = Xsolute P°vap\nwhere P°vap is the vapor pressure of the pure solvent.\n\nb. The presence of a non-volatile solute causes the solvent to freeze at a lower temperature than normal. The magnitude of the freezing point depression is directly proportional to the molality of solute:\nΔTf = Kf*m\nKf  is called the freezing point depression constant of the solvent.\n\nc. Similarly, a non-volatile solute causes the solvent to boil at a higher temperature. The magnitude of the so-called boiling point elevation is directly proportional to the concentration of solute, expressed as the molality, m:\nΔTb = Kb*m\nKb is called the boiling point elevation constant of the solvent.\n\nHope this helps,\nUltimeaciax
"This sounds cool! I am in fact making My own RC lawnmower! I have the frame made it is a all electric (blade too!) here is my website for it: http://www.geocities.com/o7buster/rclawnmower.html I was going to do my wheels with out a speed controller, but after doing the math I figured out that it would go 10 MPH way to fast for mowing lawn(IF YOU WANT IT TO LOOK NICE!)that is why my wiring diagramn dosnt have a speed controller in it. What you need to do is connect the electronic speed controller to the battery and then to the throttle channel on the radio (if it is not electronic and it is manuel throttel type like from a scooter, just connect it with a servo to spin the throttle) from the controller you would split off to two center-off momentary switches controlled by servos (take a reversable cordlles screwdriver apart to see how to wire) you shouldnt have a problem with the conttroller wearing out from the starting current because if your conttroller is 50 amps your motors should only pull 2 to 5 amps and probably no more than 15 amps when starting. from the switches it would go to the motors. now with the conttroller you should have what is called a trim pot or trim nob it should say what channel each pot controlles, moving this should allow for the controller to stop in the middle position. EXPERIMENT with it! as for the controller ""BEC"" 3 v battery eliminator circuit, I think this may be a switch to turn the controller on and off, thats what mine do. Please tell me if this is helpfull!"

"There are a whole host of ways that heavy cast iron skillets may be better than (or worse) than using a lightweight skillet, but given that this is probably a question that wants you concentrate of physical properities of materials  I will limit my comments to that area.\n\nA heavy cast iron skillet has more MASS than a lightweight skillet of any kind. Therefore it will heat up more slowly and transfer changes in heat less rapidly. This may be an advantage when cooking foods that one wants evenly browned/seared, as those kinds of task require lots of even heat. This same ""slow to heat & cool"" property might be a disadvantage when trying to quickly boil or evaporate liquid. It would also be a disadavantage when trying cook delicate foods quickly, as in making candy, where precise temperatire control helps to prevent overcooking.\n\nFurther, uncoated cast iron is chemically reactive -- it will rapidly oxidize/rust and so must be coated with oil to prevent it from deteriorating. Even using it to cook foods that are acidic (such as tomatoes or vinegar) will also cause chemical interactions."

"Stalactites are formed from the deposition of calcium carbonate and other minerals, which is precipitated from mineralized water solutions. The corresponding formation on the floor underneath a stalactite is known as a stalagmite. Given enough time, these formations can meet, resulting in a formation known as a column or pillar.Every stalactite begins with a single mineral-laden drop of water. When the drop falls, it leaves behind the thinnest ring of calcite. Each subsequent drop that forms and falls deposits another calcite ring. Eventually, these rings form a very narrow (0.5 mm), hollow tube commonly known as a ""soda straw"" stalactite. Soda straws can grow quite long, but are very fragile. If they become plugged by debris, water begins flowing over the outside, depositing more calcite and creating the more familiar cone-shaped stalactite. The same water drops that fall from the tip of a stalactite deposit more calcite on the floor below, eventually resulting in a rounded or cone-shaped stalagmite. Unlike stalactites, stalagmites never start out as hollow ""soda straws."""
I understand your dilema.\n\nActivity produces heat; but the amount of cold 'gained' by moving around in extremely cold water is much much more than the little heat produced by the activity.\n\nLeading to faster reduction in temperature, leading to faster hypothermia.

Mutations is viral strains are highly exhibited when they are retroviruses such as HIV or the H5N1 strain. Such viruses do not have DNA initially, much simpler for them. An enzyme called Reverse Transcriptase transcribes DNA from RNA when these viruses invade host cells. However, these is a 'stupid' enzyme and it makes mistakes, and for every mistakes it makes, another strain is created due to mutation. For the influenza virus, this is such a trivial phenomenon. It happens almost all the time. But since viruses are relatively much less complicated than eukaryotes, an error usually does not prove fatal. For mammals, there is a smart enzyme called DNA polymerase which transcribes RNA from DNA and the error checking mechanisms are so intricate. \nThe other way can be the kind sort of mentioned by one of the other answerer's. This gene transfer is the so called Horizontal Gene Transfer and it can result in a modified viral strain but I think that is the case mainly for DNA viruses.
Our sun will never go supernova. Only the largest stars go supernova; ours is only about mid-sized. It has been around for about 5 billion years and has an estimated lifespan of 10 billion years. So, you've got another 5 billion years to relax before the sun's energy runs out.\n\nHaving said that, the Earth will not be habitable during that whole period. In about 2 billion years the sun will eject part of its core, becoming a red giant. It will grow dimmer but hotter. While the new outer limit of the sun will only reach out to about Venus's orbit, the extreme heat will incinerate all life on Earth.\n\nAfter the sun's lifespan is up, it will collapse back in on itself, forming a white dwarf. It will continue to emit a small amount of energy in this form as it cools down over the next few billion years. After it has cooled it will become a black dwarf, essentially a useless ball of matter.\n\nWe're actually lucky to have a mid-sized star. Blue giants only last about a billion years or so; they are bigger but burn through their fuel *much* faster. Smaller stars don't last long either; they aren't big enough to maintain a fusion reaction for very long.
The best way to figure this one out is to look at how much energy it takes to vaporize sweat into the gas phase (per gram of sweat, pretend it's pure water) and how much energy it would take to heat cold water to body temperature.  On a per gram basis, sweating would probably win.  On the other hand, you can drink more cold water than you can probably sweat.  It would certainly feel better drinking the water.
Your eye will be covered the day of surgery with a patch and a metal shield. Your glasses may not fit over the patch and shield, but your physician will probably remove the patch and shield the next day. You must then wear either your glasses or the shield while awake to protect your eye. You MUST wear the shield over your eye while sleeping. Do not rub your eye. You will see your physician in the clinic the day following surgery. You will then need to be checked periodically during the next 3 months. Your physician will determine how frequently you will need to return. Vision may be blurred in the operated eye right after surgery. It should gradually improve as healing progresses. Many patients see better within a few days. Between 4 and 12 weeks after surgery your physician will prescribe a new lens for your glasses.

"This planet will probably last until the sun runs out of hydrogen and expands (automatically, not in a quest for fuel) to engulf it in about 10,000,000,000 years.\n\nIf we take mainstream Christian theology literally, it seems likely that the Christian god is also that of every other sentient species in the universe like humans. There are probably billions of them, or more. \n\nOne can guess that, therefore, avatars are sent to each of those species, giving them a chance to be ""saved"".\n\nBut remember that what YOU are taught that God and Jesus want has been interpreted by a lot of corrupt religious leaders, and politically motivated translators.

Remember:\n\nE = hv\n\nThe energy of a wave is equal to the wave's frequency times planck's constant. So higher frequency waves have higher energy and this energy is transferred to whatever the wave hits. The energy transfer breaks chemical bonds, forms radicals, adjusts conformations of molecules and otherwise can disrupt biological activity. The more energy of the wave, the more bad things can happen.

I am not sure what you mean by preparation.  Basically lipids (fatty acids) are cleaved to produce long carbon chains which are then broken down (via lipolysis not via glycolysis).  Proteins are broken down via proteases and enter the cell as free amino acids or small peptides, which can be converted to energy.\n\nProteins and lipids can be converted to glucose (which is broken down via glycolysis) via gluconeogenesis, but they first have to be broken down.

Therapeutic cloning (also known as somatic cell nuclear transfer, cell nuclear replacement, research cloning, and embryo cloning) involves taking an egg (or oocyte) from which the nucleus has been removed, and replacing that nucleus with DNA from the cell of another organism. The result is a blastocyst (an early stage embryo with about 100 cells) with almost identical DNA to the original organism.\n\nThe procedure is controversial, and this is reflected in the language used to describe the blastocyst created. Some people believe it should not be called a blastocyst or embryo, since it has not been created by fertilisation, but others maintain that since, given the right conditions, it could still grow into a fetus and eventually a child, it doesn't seem misleading to call it an embryo.\nThe aim of carrying out this procedure is to obtain stem cells that are genetically matched to the donor organism. For example, if a person with Parkinson's disease donated their DNA, then it should be theoretically possible to generate embryonic stem cells that could be used to treat their condition without being rejected by the patient's immune system.

For the equation of a line?\n\nSlope is change in y divided by change in x, so subtract y coordinates and x coordinates of the given points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2): (y1-y2)/(x1-x2).  \n\nSlope on a line is constant, so if (x,y) is ANY point on the line, then the slope between it and a known point is the same as the slope between 2 known points, so\n\n(y-y1)/(x-x1) = (y1-y2)/(x1-x2)\n\nFinally, move the x term over to the right side:\n\n(y-y1) = (y1-y2)/(x1-x2) * (x-x1)
"I am guessing that you're wanting to know how blood samples are collected from a vein.  I will stick with that, no pun intended.  The techniques for arterial blood are somewhat similar, however.  Then there are fingersticks and cord-blood collection, which I won't discuss here.\n\nFirst, the phlebotomist or nurse (or veterinary technician)--the ""collector"" for this discussion-- places a rubber tourniquet around the arm or forelimb (standard, though other sites may be used as needed). The collector then palpates the site to locate a suitable vein.  The collector then cleans the site with alcohol or some other antiseptic.  The collector inserts a needle into the vein and gently withdraws the desired amount of blood, taking care to be GENTLE so as not to ""blow"" the vein (cause it to rupture or tear) or cause the red blood cells to break (hemolysis).  As soon as blood appears in the syringe or special vacuum-type collection tube, the tourniquet is loosened.  In veterinary medicine, we often use a syringe that has been treated with an anticoagulant such as heparin to keep it from clotting until the sample is put into the appropriate tubes (depending on the tests to be done).  Some vets and most human doctors use special tubes that provide a vacuum and allow the blood to be collected more quickly.  If we use vacuum tubes that have anticoagulants (substances that keep blood from clotting) or other substances, we keep the arm down while drawing to prevent backflow and accidental injection of these substances into the patient.  After the blood is drawn, the collector applies pressure to the venipuncture site with a bit of gauze or cotton to prevent bruising and stop bleeding.  For humans, a Band-aid with cotton or gauze is applied for a short time as a pressure bandage to ensure that the site doesn't begin bleeding again later.\n\nHope that helps."

The modern base ten system uses ten symbols (0, 1, 2, 3, ...,9)\nwith place values that are powers of ten. These symbols are commonly called\nHindu-Arabic numerals. Although a base ten system seems natural to those\nwho have ten Þngers, in times past people have used many different kinds of\nnumerals and various bases in addition to base ten.\nOther numeration systems that have existed historically used base Þve,\nbase twenty, and base sixty. In fact almost all societies have used a number\nsystem based on 5, 10, or 20. This is understandable because of human\nanatomy. Counting on the Þve Þngers of one hand, all ten Þngers, or all\ntwenty digits is natural and useful. The quinary system (base 5) or vigesimal\n(base 20) or a combination of these two were used by early societies in the\nAmericas including almost all Eskimo tribes, some native North American\nsocieties, and almost all peoples indigenous to Central and South America.\nAlthough the quinary and vigesimal systems were also found in some societies\nin northern Siberia and Africa the decimal system used today dominated\nhistory. However, with advent of computers in this century bases two, eight\nand sixteen have come into prominence. Computers count best using only\ntwo digits. It is interesting to note that certain Polish engineers built a\ncomputer in the late 1950s and early 1960s that used a base of negative 2.\nIn order to understand numeration systems it is important to know the\ndistinction between place value systems and additive systems. In additive\nsystems (Roman numerals, for example) a numeration symbol has the same\nmeaning no matter where it is placed in writing the number. So, for example,\nthe Roman numeral V means Þve whether it is placed before or after the\nnumeral X. Thus XV and VX both represent Þfteen in an additive system,\nalthough as we discover VX would certainly be non-standard. The values\nten (X) and Þve (V) are added to obtain Þfteen.\nThe position of each numeral is important in positional (place value)\nnumber systems, but not in additive systems. For example, in order to\nrepresent Þfty or Þve hundred in the base ten place value system, the symbol\n5 is moved over to the left one or two places (50 or 500), putting a zero\nin the empty places. However, in order to represent Þfty or Þve hundred in\nan additive system multiple copies of the ten or hundred need to be used\n(XXXXX or CCCCC) or new symbols need to be invented (L and D in\nRoman numerals).\nPlace value (or positional) systems can continue to use the same set of\nsymbols since the value of the symbol changes with repositioning. The value\nof each symbol is multiplied by a power of the systems base. For example, in\nbase ten (decimal) different positions of the numeral Þve will represent Þve,\nÞfty, and Þve hundred. Hence, the symbol 5 in each of the following numbers\nrepresents different quantities because of its position.\n in 215 the Þve represents Þve (5 × 100 )\n in 354 the Þve represents Þfty (5 × 101 )\n in 567 the Þve represents Þve hundred (5 × 103 )\nThe number one hundred twenty four is represented as 124 in the base ten\nsystem, where the 1 signiÞes one hundred, the 2 signiÞes two tens and the\n4 signiÞes four ones. This number is written in expanded form as follows:

"for a sample lab report see this link: http://faculty.coloradomtn.edu/jeschofnig/class/class_jeschof/ch2-srp1.htm\n\n\nif you mean ""how to write a Chemistry lab report ?"" here are the steps:\n\nUse the following design when writing formal lab reports. Although many lab reports will not be formal ones, you are expected to know the details of this design and to understand the logical sequence of ideas within it. \nTitle A concise statement of the problem \nIntroduction Optional in chemistry and physics; generally required in biology: A statement of objectives or a hypothesis may be necessary if the TITLE does not fully describe the problem being studied. The hypothesis is what you think will happen during the investigation. It differs from a guess in that it is based upon prior knowledge or evidence. It should be supported by previously developed evidence and/or concepts. \nMaterials Lists of materials used are generally required in our biology experiments. In chemistry and physics, include this section only if you have actively taken part in the design of the experiment and the selection of materials.  \nProcedure Write a procedure only if you have actively taken part in the process of designing the experiment, otherwise state the source of the procedure. Explain, with diagrams, what you did in order to collect the DATA. You should understand and be able to apply the principles involved in running a controlled experiment. You are encouraged to identify the assumptions upon which the experiment is based. \nQuantitative Data Evidence collected during the experiment; numbers read directly from laboratory instruments (clocks, rulers, balances, etc., but not calculators). Data should be well organized and tabulated when possible. Use care in scale reading and use significant figures when taking measurements. Develop a sense of how much data is desirable. Understand the need for carrying out multiple experiments and strive to get reproducible data when practical. Do not hide or eliminate suspected faulty data but present it. Later, in your CONCLUSIONS, you may explain why you have decided not to use suspected errors in your analysis. \nQualitative Data Other forms of evidence, qualitative in nature, that may be useful in the interpretation of QUANTITATIVE DATA; for example, something unexpected that happened during the carrying out of the PROCEDURE that may affect your CONCLUSIONS. In qualitative experiments which are frequently carried out in biology, these observations may be the only form of evidence collected. Then a RESULTS section may be unnecessary, and CONCLUSIONS will be based upon the QUALITATIVE DATA. \nCalculations Use illustrations (sample problems) to show how you converted DATA into RESULTS. You are encouraged to use calculators and computers. Computer programs or spreadsheets used in the analysis should appear in this section. Use significant figures in calculations involving measurements. Use units as well as numbers in all calculations. Use dimensional analysis to accomplish this. Write equations of any straight lines from graphs of experimental DATA or RESULTS. \nResults The final form in which the evidence is prepared. You perform CALCULATIONS on the DATA in order to develop RESULTS. Your CONCLUSIONS should be understandable by looking at your RESULTS. Tabulate results of primary variables in a meaningful order. Graph variables to detect general trends. When possible (if y=mx+b), supply equations of these graphs. Understand the gain in information and usefulness when results are converted into systematic tables, graphs, and finally equations.  \nConclusions Contain the answers to the problem stated in the TITLE and INTRODUCTION. Base your conclusions on your RESULTS, not despite them. Look for more than one conclusion to the problem, with suggestions for further work in order to differentiate these at a later date. It is not necessary to do the further work. Understand that conclusions from one experimen"
a)  Not sure how you 'show' this... it's kind of trivial.  Anything parallel to the x-axis is of the form y = constant, z = constant - and here the constants have to be b and c to go through the point, as there's no x dependence.\n\nb)  |a+b|^2 = |a|^2 + a.b + |b|^2\nSo for it to balance, a.b = 0; that is, a and b are orthogonal.\n\nc)  Let the vector be (x,y,z).  Then:\n\n(1,1,0).(x,y,z) = 0  => x + y = 0\n(0,1,1).(x,y,z) = 0  => y + z = 0\n\nSo x = z = -y, and the vector is parallel to (1,-1,1).  Normalising this to unit length gives:\n\n(1 / sqrt(3)) (1, -1, 1).

Absolute zero is the lowest temperature you can get at -273 Celsius anywhere in the universe. Almost all motion has stopped at that point. It is also the temperature at which no further energy can be extracted from a physical body, or the temperature at which the entropies of perfect crystals vanish, or the temperature at which the entropy change of an adiabatic process vanishes.\n\nIt was first proposed by  Guillaume Amontons in 1702 who was investigating the relationship between pressure and temperature in gases. He lacked precise thermometers to determine an exact point. In 1848, Lord Kelvin proposed an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale where absolute zero was the temperature at which no more temperature can be removed. Absolute zero has never been reached and may well never be. In the absolute depths of outer space, it reaches 3 Kelvin due to the remnants of the Big Bang. Laboratories have reached billionths of a degree above absolute zero in order to demonstrate Bose-Einstein condensation.
The recoil system uses the energy of the newtonian reaction to load and fire the next round, most automatic pistols use this method. Gas and blowback are one in the same. They use the pressure of the gas int the chamber to reload and fire. Most fully automatic weapons use this method. The more advanced and the first machine gun(gattling) use a mechanical powered drive sytem to reload and fire.

If you are referring to the role the study of genetics plays in your daily life, to be honest, that should not be the question, as the field is larger than someone's everyday life. Because genetics studies genes and their expression, inactivation, regulation and so on, you probably do not see any tangible effect of the studies everyday. However, you can ask what these genes and their expression present for any individual everyday. In that case, the question would be a plethora of survival means in short. Starting from metabolism, where the expression of a certain gene that allows the breakdown of glycogen into glucose in respiring tissues during starvation,to the synthesis of a an amino acid that is important for the functioning of a certain protein, genes and their expression play very big roles. Homeostatsis, keeping your inside environment constant, is due to gene expression and we probably would not be sitting here discussing the issue if it was not for these important events. So, wouldn't you say it is necessary to know why such complex systems work the way they do and fail the way they fail in people with illnesses so that in the unfortunate event that happens, correction can be carried out? Genetics does study these things and lends usable knowledge to gene therapy. I think all your questions regarding genetics are very good however, this one and the previous two.
It's a conversion equation. It allows you to convert mass into energy and energy into mass. Everything that has mass has energy stored in it. If you were able to convert it completely to pure energy (we can't do that yet), then you'd get the amount of energy shown in the equation. E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light squared.\n\nA raisin if completely converted can power all of New York City for a full day.\n\n>>the faster you go. the more mass you will have. ie if i threw a ball bearing at a piece of wood it would bounce off. if i fired it out of a gun it would go through it.<<\n\nThat's not E=mc^2. It's a different postulate by Einstein. And the ball gun comparison is completely wrong.

Hydrolysis is a chemical reaction or process in which a molecule is split into two parts by reacting with a molecule of water, which has the chemical formula H2O. One of the parts gets an OH from the water molecule and the other part gets an H from the water.\n\nWhen performed using electric current, the process is called electrolysis\n\nOne important use of electrolysis is to produce hydrogen. The reaction that occurs is\n\n    2H2O(aq) → 2H2(g) + O2(g)\n\nIn the future, this could play a central role in shifting our society over to a reliance on hydrogen as an energy carrier for powering electric motors and internal combustion engines. (See hydrogen economy.) Electrolysis of water can be achieved in a simple hands-on project, where electricity from a battery or low voltage DC power supply (eg computer power supply 5v rail) is run into a cup of water (in practice a saltwater solution or other electrolyte will need to be used otherwise no result will be observed). Using platinum electrodes, hydrogen gas will be seen to bubble up at the cathode, and oxygen will bubble at the anode. Using any other electrode for the anode however, the oxygen will react with the anode instead of being released as a gas. For example using iron electrodes in a sodium chloride solution electrolyte, iron oxide will be produced at the anode, which will react to form iron hydroxide. When producing large quantites of hydrogen, this can significantly gunge up the electrolytic cell - which is why iron is not used for commercial electrolysis.\n\nThe energy efficiency of water electrolysis varies widely. Some report 50–70%, while others report 80–94%. These values only refer to the efficiency of converting electrical energy into hydrogen's chemical energy. The energy lost in generating the electricity is not included. For instance, when considering a power plant that converts the heat of nuclear reactions into hydrogen via electrolysis, the total efficiency is more like 25–40%.
Calling your pharmacy for a question like this may or may not be very effective since most pharmacists have not committed generic drug tablet imprints to memory (they've got enough stuff to memorize, believe me).

So, this med is probably also ibuprofen.  However, I wouldn't take it or give it to anyone under the presumption that it is ibuprofen.  Judging from the fact that this  number didn't turn up, I would say it may have been discontinued and therefore it may be expired.  It may or may not be prescription since low dose ibuprofen (200 mg) is over-the-counter and high dose (>=400 mg) is prescription.
I don't know specifically for oxycodone but for most narcotics it is 2 days.  Since oxycodone stays in your body such a long time (assuming it is oxycontin), it may take even longer to leave.  It is partly related to half-life but also related to the sensitivity of the test being used.

Good question!\n\nBecause copper was so cheap in the U.S., it was not a big deal to use larger wires that are needed to carry the larger amperes of household circuits.  Remember Volt x Amp = Watt, so in order to carry a large watt appliance, you need more AMPS, (double the amount you need in European and other cities) and in order to carry larger AMP amounts you need bigger wire.\n\nAll appliances in the U.S. are maximum about 1600 WATTS, which when you plug into a 110-120 Volt, gives about a 15 AMP circuit.  It is too bad though, for in England for example, an ordinary TEA kettle (electric of course) heats SO much faster because it is about 3000 watts of heat!\nNot sure what you're asking in #2

The problem misleadingly suggests that the amount the three men paid ($27) and the amount the bellboy kept ($2) SHOULD add up to the original amount ($30).  Not so.  Actually, the $27 INCLUDES the $2.  In other words, of the $30 the three men originally had, $25 went to the motel and $2 went to the bellboy -- that's the $27; the remaining $3 went back to the men.\n\nImagine the same problem with different numbers.  Let's say the clerk discovers he overcharged the men by $27.  He gives the $27 to the bellboy; the bellboy gives each man $1, and keeps $24.  Obviously, the amount the men paid ($27) and the amount the bellboy kept ($24) don't add up to anything significant (and certainly not even close to $30).
Of course they can make water, where did you get the idea that they can't.\n\nMixing Hydrogen and Oxygen and allowing them to burn gives water vapor.  The trouble is the amount of energy necessary to extract elemental Hydrogen and Oxygen makes in uneconomical to produce water this way.  Desalination of sea water is another way but again it comes down to energy costs.

"Most mammals will produce tears in response to extreme pain or other stimuli, but crying as an emotional reaction is considered by many to be a uniquely human phenomenon, possibly due to humans' advanced self-awareness. Some studies suggest that elephants and gorillas may cry as well.\n\nIn nearly all cultures, crying is seen as a specific act associated with tears trickling down the cheeks and accompanied by characteristic sobbing sounds. Emotional triggers are most often anger and grief, but crying can also be triggered by sadness, joy, fear, humor, etc.\n\nIn many cultures, crying is associated with babies and children. Some cultures consider crying to be undignified and infantile, casting aspersion on those who cry publicly. In most western cultures, it is more socially acceptable for women to cry in public than men, but this is certainly not true for all human cultures.\n\nAn insincere display of grief or dishonest remorse is called crocodile tears, from the ancient anecdote that crocodiles would pretend to weep in order to lure prey [2].\n\nMany religions describe gods or prophets as crying:\n\nThe shortest verse in the Bible (in the King James Version of the Bible and some other English translations) is simply: ""Jesus wept."" \nJade is sometimes known as ""tears of the Buddha"". \nThe Qur'an describes Muhammad crying, and proclaiming: ""This is an expression of the tenderness and compassion, which the Lord hath put into the hearts of His servants."" \nThe Incas believed that silver was the ""tears of the moon"". \n\nMy readings"
Some research veterinarians work directly on animals. If they reach senior positions in industry or government, they supervise technicians and other veterinarians in studies of animals. The studies range from things such as the determination of the best feed ration to grown a chicken economically, to the prevention of disease in animals. The pay varies widely. With a doctorate in veterinary medicine, a researcher can make from $30,000 a year to $120,000 a year. The top end of the range is usually reserved to those who are in senior and supervisory roles.

">Trichoderma is not considered a bad fungi.\n\nUses of Trichoderma\nThese versatile fungi are used commercially in a variety of ways, including the following: \n\nFoods and textiles: \nTrichoderma spp. are highly efficient producers of many extracellular enzymes. They are used commercially for production of cellulases and other enzymes that degrade complex polysaccharides. They are frequently used in the food and textile industries for these purposes. For example, cellulases from these fungi are used in ""biostoning"" of denim fabrics to give rise to the soft, whitened fabric--stone-washed denim. The enzymes are also used in poultry feed to increase the digestibility of hemicelluloses from barley or other crops. \nBiocontrol agents: \nAs noted, these fungi are used, with or without legal registration, for the control of plant diseases. There are several reputable companies that manufacture government registered products. Some of these companies are listed at the end of this web page. This site will not knowingly list any nonregistered products or strains offered for sale in commercial agriculture even though these products are common and their sale is widely ignored by governmental regulatory agencies. \nPlant growth promotion: \nFor many years, the ability of these fungi to increase the rate of plant growth and development, including, especially, their ability to cause the production of more robust roots has been known. The mechanisms for these abilities are only just now becoming known. \nSome of these abilities are likely to be quite profound. Recently, we have found that one strain increases the numbers of even deep roots (at as much as a meter below the soil surface). These deep roots cause crops, such as corn, and ornamental plants, such as turfgrass, to become more resistant to drought. \n\nPerhaps even more importantly, our recent research indicates that corn whose roots are colonized by Trichoderma strain T-22 require about 40% less nitrogen fertilizer than corn whose roots lack the fungus. Since nitrogen fertilizer use is likely to be curtailed by federal mandate to minimize damage to estuaries and other oceanic environment (see http://www.epa.gov/msbasin/legis98.html; there are a number of other sites on the web dealing with this topic, search for sites dealing with the ‘dead zone’) the use of this organism may provide a method for farmers to retain high agricultural productivity while still meeting new regulations likely to be imposed.\n\nAs a source of transgenes. \nBiocontrol microbes, almost by definition, must contain a large number of genes that encode products that permit biocontrol to occur. Several genes have been cloned from Trichoderma spp. that offer great promise as transgenes to produce crops that are resistant to plant diseases. No such genes are yet commercially available, but a number are in development.

Lightning is one of the most beautiful displays in nature. It is also one of the most deadly natural phenomena known to man. With bolt temperatures hotter than the surface of the sun and shockwaves beaming out in all directions, lightning is a lesson in physical science and humility.\nBeyond its powerful beauty, lightning presents science with one of its greatest local mysteries: How does it work? It is common knowledge that lightning is generated in electrically charged storm systems, but the method of cloud charging still remains elusive.
"Electrons are made up from the same stuff as protons. \n--Protons are made up of quarks (like Neutrons).  Protons consist of 3 pair quarks, 2 up quarks and a down.\nElectrons are not made up of quarks, so there are not made up of the stuff protons are.\n\nEnergy is matter in motion/velocity.\n--There are many types of energy, not all of it is ""matter in motion"".  Potential energy is an example.\n\nNeutrons are a ghost image of the interaction between electrons and protons.\n--Well, kinda of yes, kind of no.\nIf you combine a proton and an electron, you will produce a neutron and a neutrino.  This is no easy to acheive but it does happen (in neutron stats).\n\nLight is made up of photons.\n--Yes, but light is BOTH a wave AND a particle.\n\nPhotons are matter at some velocity.\n--No, photons are not matter, thet do not have mass.\n\nAll matter is light from a certain point of view. \n--No.\nMatter can still exist in complete darkness.\n\nMathematics combined with the periodic table is the explanation of why chemical reactions happen.\nChemical attraction and repultion can be explained via matematics and the periodic table. \n--I prefer the Physics way of thinking of it, but if you want to call it math, thats OK too.\n\nEverything that is, everything that we see, is either here or not. On or off, yes or no, matter or not matter; That is the question! \n--Now your thinking like a computer."
Well, all I got was a 5% eclipse here in Wales, but if I remember correctly from 1999 in the South West of England there was a sudden jump downwards in the amount of solar radiation being recorded by a BBC team about 5-10 mins before totality.

WHY IS THE OCEAN BLUE?\nSunlight is made up of all the colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Some of the sunlight is reflected off the surface of the water, reflecting the color of the sky. Some of the sunlight penetrates the water and is scattered by ripples and particles in the water (this tinges the appearance of the ocean with the color of the particles). In deep water, much of the sunlight is scattered by the oxygen in the water, and this scatters more of the blue light. \n\nWater absorbs more of the red light in sunlight; the water also enhances the scattering of blue light. Sir Chandrasekhar Venkata Raman (an Indian physicist) won the Nobel prize in 1930 for his work on light. \n\n\nSome Oddly-Colored Seas:\nThe Red Sea often looks red because of red algae that live in this sea. \nThe Black Sea looks almost black because it has a high concentration of hydrogen sulfide (which appears black).
Lets express the number we start with as x and y\n\nx = the number before the 5 (e.g. 7)\ny always = 5\n\nSo to make 75, you have 10 * x + y ... (10*7)=70 + 5 = 75\nIf you square this equation you have (10x+y)^2 \n\n= 100x^2 + 10xy + 10xy + y^2\n= 100x^2 + 20xy + y^2\n= 100x^2 + 100x + y^2 ... (because y always = 5)\n\n---------\n\nNow we look at the other method.\n\nProduct of number without the 5 is:\n\nx(x+1) = x^2 + x\n\nYou're then putting 25 on the end. To do this, you're multiplying by 100 and adding y^2\n\n100(x^2 + x) + y^2\n= 100x^2 + 100x + y^2\n\nThere we have the same result as before.

Moving and terraforming Venus would be a substantial undertaking, I suspect. It would be easier to terraform Mars, even in its current orbit. \n\nThere is a surprising amount of professional activity and speculation about what it would take to terraform Mars. I have attached a tiny sample of what is available on the internet. Terraforming Mars would still be extremely challenging, and would take hundreds, if not thousands or millions of years. \n\nIt would be definitely far easier to make sure we are better stewards of our own planet. One of the first things we need to do is limit our population growth. We should think about sustainable agriculture, and better energy sources. It is not a particularly viable solution, at least yet, to despoil our planet and then go move to another one after we have ruined this one.

Can people live forever? If not, then why are we doing medical research?
Sorry, there is no official or standard way of listing measurements of any kind. The best we get are requirements from the publishers that manuscripts comply with some set of rules for their periodicals. Scientists are too varied in their origin, education, and habits to ever get them to agree on a standard. However, there is a general agreement on which units of mass, length, and time are internationally used (MKS), but even that is often violated by minor publishers.
Yes, part of NYC is on Long Island.\nNew York City is made up of 5 different 'boroughs' or neighborhoods - Manhatten, Queens, the Bronx, Brooklyn & Staten Island.\nManhatten is an island in itself, as is Staten Island. The Bronx is north of Manhatten and is considered to be 'mainland'. The last two, Queens and Brooklyn are east of Manhatten on the farthest west tip of Long Island. \nLong Island is enormous compared to the the other two islands and it take hours (not sure exactly how long) to drive from end to end. The farthest east point on Long Island features Montauk - a real husker du town.

"A retiring pChem (Physical Chemistry) professor was composing his last exam for a graduate course in statistical thermodynamics. Being a bit bored, and with a well kept and wry sense of humor, he set a single question on the sheet:\n\n""Is Hell endothermic or exothermic? Support your answer with a proof.""\nHe had little idea what to expect, or how to grade the results, but decided to reward any student who was able to come up with a reasonable and consistent reply to this query.\n\n\nOne ""A"" was awarded.\nMost of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law or some variant. The top student, however, wrote the following:\n\n""First, we postulate that if souls exist, then they must have some mass. If they do, then a mole of souls can also have a mass. So, at what rate are souls moving into hell and at what rate are souls leaving? I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for souls entering hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and people do not belong to more than one religion on average, we can predict that all people and all souls go to hell on average. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change in volume in hell. Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay the same, the ratio of the mass of souls and volume needs to stay constant. Thus, there are two possible conditions:\n\n) If hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter hell, than the temperature and pressure in hell will increase exponentially until all hell breaks loose.\n\n-OR-\n\n) If hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until hell freezes over.\nWe can solve this (de)lemma with the 1990 postulation of Ms. Theresa LeClair, the woman who lived across the hall from me in first year residence. Since I have still not been successful in obtaining sexual relations with her, I know that condition two has not been met, and thus it can be concluded that condition one is true, and therefore that hell is exothermic."""

probability: for equally likely outcomes, the number of favourable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes of an experiment.\n\nlikelihood: Losses may be characterised by the probability or frequency with which they are likely to occur (in a particular environment). This probability or frequency is the likelihood of the loss. Likelihoods may be expressed qualitatively (on a scale from Frequent to Incredible, for example) or quantitatively (as a probability of occurrence within a specified interval, as a mean time between occurrences, or as a number of occurrences expected in a specified interval).

Yeah, and why doesn't blue laundry detergent stain your clothes? I'm not sure of the answers, but I'll bet it's a chemistry issue. Never put a Chlorine toilet bowl cleaner into the water tank. Yeah, it helps keep the bowl clean but it destroys the rubber plumbing fixtures inside the tank which leads to leaks and huge water bills.  Just scrub the toilet manually every six to eight months.

You can't trisect with an unmarked straightedge and compass. It *can* be done with a marked straightedge and compass. The key is being able to *slide* the marked straightedge. Here's how it goes:\n\nStep I: Draw a circle with radius equal to the length of the mark on the straightedge and with center the corner, O, of the angle you want to trisect. Let the sides of the angle meet the circle at A and B.\n\nStep II: Extend the line OA through the other side of the circle.\n\nStep III: Place the straightedge so that one mark is on the extended line OA, one mark is on the circle and so that the edge goes through the point B. This is the step that is impossible without the marks on the straightedge. Let the intersection with the extended line OA be at the point C.\n\nThen the angle ACB will trisect the angle AOB.
Even if you mean by - Same location, the exact position in latitude, longitude and altitude, still then No, sun does not rises and sets at the same time, every year for a given date & location. In currently applicable calender, we have to add 1 day (24 hrs) every 4 years, i.e difference of 6:30 hrs every year. Hence if you go by calender and watch, it does not rises and sets at same time. But, if you go by earths rotation, then on completion of one rotation, sun rises and sets as per fixed earth's rotation speed.\n\nIf you want further accuracy, eath's rotation speed is also reducing ( 1 sec in approx 100 years).\n\nSo you can deduce from above the accuracy level you want, to decide.

Actually there is no superconductor at room temperature(at least at this time being).\n\nhave u ever heard about Ohm's law\nohm's law stated that the voltage(V) is equal to electric  current(I) and resistance(R)\n                 V=IR\nif we manipulate the law, we get\n                 R=V/I\n\nIt means that we cannot have voltage and current without having resistance.\n\nWe don't want the resistance bcoz we didn't want to waste the voltage. in other word, material with high resistance is called insulator and the ones with low resistance is called conductor. we know electric can't pass trough insulator becoz it dont conduct electric. Unfortunately, all material in the universe have resistance. Wood n plastic have resistance so they cannot conduct electric. Metals such as cuprum, iron n so on also have resistance but in lower scale. therefore it can conduct electric but it also waste electric in form of heat. so everyday when we use elecrical gadjets we waste some electric.\n\nSuperconductor is the material that has 0 or as low as achievable resistance. Scientists find out that the lower the temperature the lower the resistance. so we can have 0 resistance at 0 kelvin or -273.15 centrigate.\n\nScientists have managed to find a combination of materials that can act as superconductor above 0 kelvin(or above -273.15 centrigate). i'm not remember but i think it is -100 something, centrigate. But until right now, no one has manage to find the right combination of materials to make superconductor at room temperature.\n\n\nShould we manage to make one, the whole world will get the benefits from it. Imagine a world without elecrical power crisis and computer that can process much much faster than today n the elecric gadjets that use low power, lower than \nany weakest battery in the world today. What it would be?\n\nUntil then, we can only use slow computer to log on to Yahoo!Answer.. haha..

Yes i do believe in dragons.\n\nDragons probably originated as one of many branches of the reptiles, no later than 200,000,000 years ago in the late Triassic. This was a period of great reptile diversification, during which emerged some of the most successful reptile groups, in terms of both abundance and diversification. Dragon evolution echoes the evolution of the archosaurs of the time. Dragons took to the air, as did the pterosaurs, and became aquatic, like the plesiosaurs.\n\nPlease check the site it may be of help to you.
the change in pH from the acid would wreak havoc on the cell walls in the plant starting with the roots.  Also the high amount of sugar may cause the water in the plant to go into the soda and cause a loss of turgor pressure.
Light is a form of energy. It has both the properties of wave as well as particle. A body becomes visible when light is emitted by or reflected from it and this light on entering our eyes enabled us to see the objects. But light itself  is invisible. It's the fastest thing in universe. There is no need of any material medium for the transmission of light.
When salt NaCl dissolves in water H2O what happens is that the Na dissasociates from the Cl and we get Na+ surrounded by OH- ions, and H+ surounded by Cl- ions. \n\nSo essentially we have a lot of ions that are free to move, and where there are free ions there are free electron, and where there are free electrons there is high conductivity.

Many things. To throw, to vomit, a nickname for charlie, to cut wood (as in how much wood could a wood chuck chuck).
Glass is a combination of sand, flint, spar, or some other silicious substances, with one or other of the fixed alkalies, and in some cases with a metallic oxide. Of the alkalies, soda is commonly preferred; and of the silicious substances, white sand is most in repute at present, as it requires no preparation for coarse goods, while mere washing in water is sufficient for those of a finer quality. The metallic oxide usually employed, is litharge, or some other preparation of lead. Iron is used in bottle-glass. \n\nThe silicious matter should be fused in contact with something called a flux. The substances proper for this purpose are lead, borax, arsenic, nitre, or any alkaline matter. The lead is used in the state of red-lead; and the alkalies are soda, pearlash, sea-salt, and wood-ashes. When red-lead is used alone, it gives the glass a yellow cast and requires the addition of nitre to correct it. Arsenic, in the same manner, if used in excess, is apt to render the glass milky. For a perfectly transparent glass, the pearlash is found much superior to lead; perhaps better than any other flux, except it be borax, which is too expensive to be used, except for experiments, or for the best looking-glasses. \n\nThe materials for making glass must first be reduced to powder, which is done in mortars or by horse mills. After sifting out the coarse parts, the proper proportions of silex and flux are mixed together, and put into the calcining furnace, where they are kept in a moderate heat for 5 or 6 hours, being frequently stirred about during the process. When taken out the matter is called frit. Frit is easily converted into glass by only pounding it, and vitrifying it in the melting pots of the glass furnace; but in making fine glass, it will sometimes require a small addition of flux to the frit to correct any fault. For, as the flux is the most expensive article, the manufacturer will rather put too little at first than otherwise, as he can remedy this defect in the melting pot. The heat in the furnace must be kept up until the glass is brought to a state of perfect fusion; and during this process any scum which arises must be removed by ladles. When the glass is perfectly melted, the glass-blowers commence their operations.

"""One legend says the Bootes, whose name comes from the Greek word for ""ox-driver"" or ""herdsman"", was the son of Demeter (Roman: Ceres), the goddess of agriculture. The constellation of Bootes was once also know as Arcturus. Bootes is credited with inventing the plow and was placed in the sky to honor his invention, of such immense importance to civilization.\nIn another myth, Bootes was the son of Zeus and Callisto. Callisto, transformed into a bear by Zeus’s jealous wife, Hera, was in danger if being killed by her son Bootes, who was out hunting, until she was rescued by Zeus, who took her into the heavens. There Callisto became the constellation of Ursa Major, the Great Bear."""

Not sure what you're asking here - 2% incline means that the height you go up is 2% of the horizontal distance (not the slope distance) travelled.\n\nSo 2% will mean for every 100m horizontal you travel - you will go up 2m.\n\nSo are you saying you have travelled 1 mile horizontally - in which case you will move up 0.02 miles (or using pythagoras' theorem you could get the actual slope distance travelled d² = 1² + 0.02², which gives 1.0002 miles)\n\nOr are you saying you have travelled 1 mile vertically - in which case you will have moved 50 miles horizontally (since there are 50 2%'s in 100%) (or do you want the actual slope distance travelled, d² = 1² + 50², which gives 50.01 miles)\n\nOr are you saying you have travelled 1 mile up a 2% slope.  In which case we need to use pythagoras' theorem backwards to get the horizontal and vertical parts.  The horizontal we can call x and the vertical is 2% of this, ie 0.02x.\n\nSo we get:  1² = x² + (0.02x)²\n\n1 = x² + 0.0004x²\n1 = 1.0004x²\nx² = 1/1.0004 - 0.99960\nx = 0.9998\n\nSo we will have travelled 0.998 miles horizontally and 2% of this (which is 0.019996 miles) vertically.

Because heat only flows from hot to cold, not the other way around, so, there's no way to make it go backwards without adding more energy into the system.
without friction , a car can't cahange direction. car wheels are similar to sneaker soles, think about trying to change direction when on ice. with low friction, it is easy to maintain constant velocity, but aceleration requires force, and the only forces in a car are friction between the tires and the road. if you want to go fast in a straight line, low friction is good once you are going fast, but you couldn't even get any speed without friction.\nin a winding road, you need to keep changing direction, so you need to accelerate in different directions.

All things being equal, the higher the frequency,the more energetic the effect- So, a laser with a frequency in the yellow range, for example, would have less effect than one in the blue range, which has a higher frequency.  The ultimate would likely be an ultraviolet laser, which is very high energy and slightly penetrating as well.  Theoretically, and X-ray laser would be the most devastating, because of the penetration, but as far as I know, that is still a long ways off.

The  Locust can increase extremely rapidly in numbers with the possibility of four generations through spring, summer, and autumn. It can form into dense aggregations (bands containing up to several thousand hoppers per square metre) as hoppers (the young locust before it can fly).The adults can form into swarms covering large areas and with upwards of 50 adults per square metre. They are formidable eating machines that can rapidly devastate crops. Their preferred food source is green grass or clover or lucerne but they have been recorded eating green leaves from many different plants.The highly mobile nature of swarms and their ability to migrate over large distances means that virtually all agricultural areas are at risk from damage.

"You are, always a different one.\n\nEvery time a decision is made somewhere, the universe divides into the number of possible outcomes. Since the universe is infinite, then an infinite number of decisions are made, and therefore there are infinite numbers of alternate universes forming every second. Our consciousness as we experience it follows its own course determined by the decisions we make. Thus, we are always and will always be unaware of passage through these universes.\n\nAlso, think of it this way:  in an alternate universe Hitler won World War II. Do you think you exist there? How different do you think you are? Our present ""universe"" and that one have diverged, probably far."
"The Bermuda Triangle is Bullsiht.  To quote the Skeptic's Dictionary:\n\n""There are some skeptics who argue that the facts do not support the legend, that there is no mystery to be solved, and nothing that needs explaining.The number of wrecks in this area is not extraordinary, given its size, location and the amount of traffic it receives. Many of the ships and planes that have been identified as having disappeared mysteriously in the Bermuda Triangle were not in the Bermuda Triangle at all. Investigations to date have not produced scientific evidence of any unusual phenomena involved in the disappearances. Thus, any explanation, including so-called scientific ones in terms of methane gas being released from the ocean floor, magnetic disturbances, etc., are not needed. The real mystery is how the Bermuda Triangle became a mystery at all."""

"There are several theories put forward by which a local anesthetic  agent works. The commonly accepted theory is the ""Specific Receptor Theory"".. The local anesthetic agent binds to certain receptors on the cell membrane and exert their action.The sequence of action are as follows:\n * Displacement of calcium ions from nerve receptor site..\n * Binding of local anesthetic molecule to this receptor site..\n * Blockade of sodium channel.\n * Decrease in sodium conduction.\n * Depression of rate of electrical depolarization.\n * Failure to achieve threshold potential level.\n * Lack of development of propagated action potential.\n * Conduction blockade.\n  \n   As for as the routes are concerned, LA can be given as:\n * topical application.\n * infiltration under the skin or mucous membrane to block peripheral nerves.\n * intramuscular to block a nerve, e.g. mandibular nerve   block for extraction of lower molars.\n * intrathecal ( into the spinal cavity), e.g.as in cesarean section."

An atomic bomb is usualy what we call a fission bomb where the extream ammounts of energy that is created is from the splitting of atoms (usualy uranium plutonium or thorium.  All very heavy atoms)\n\nOn the other hand a hydrogen bomb work on the principle of fussion.  It combines hydrogen atoms together to make helium atoms.  This two realeases enengy ( It is a bit counter intuitive, but it takes less energy to hold together an atom of helium than it does to hold towgether two atoms of hydrogen.)  \n\nThis is done in two ways, either using liquid hydrogen(which means it has to be cooled to very low temps, and the cooling mechanism is about the size of a boxcar. Those are the bombs that you see in Dr. Strangelove.)\nOr by using deuterium and tritium. they are isotopes of hydrogen but with one and two neutrons respectivly.  This can be kept at much higher temperatures and thus the bomb can be about the size of a keg of beer.  these are used much more often and can be put on the end of cruise missle and ICBMs (intercontinetal balistic missles)\n\noh yea... and Fussion bombs are about 100 to 1000 times as powerful as fission bombs.

However, did you know that you can make them right in your own home. This project will help you to make your own salt crystals.\nWith few instructions and materials, you can make sparkling salt crystals in your home.\n  \n \n  \n Material and step by step instructions: \nSalt is one of the materials that can form crystals. Crystallization is also a method of separation and purification of salt. You can use rock salt to make clear and pure salt crystals.  \n\nFormation and growth of crystals is a slow process. Formation of large salt crystals takes weeks or even months; however, small crystals can be formed in just a few days. In this project you may make different crystals and use them as a part of your display. In your report write what conditions makes a larger crystal.   \nYou may also use salt crystals to construct varieties of different decorative objects. The picture on the right show two different candle lamps made of crystals.\n \n \n \nDetails of this project\nMore details or support on this project is available for the members of ScienceProject.com.

"In 1481, being discontented with his progress in Florence, he left for Milan.\nAgain came the thrust of war and again Leonardo's inventions poured from his fertile brain.\nIn a letter to the Duke of Milan he said he would build him ""safe"" unassailable covered wagons with artillery"". Tank warfare to be ""invented"" in the 1914-1918 war had been invented. \nHe also invented for the Duke's use an explosive shell - shrapnel - poison gas and a protective gas mask, but once again was laughed at.\nAfter the war had receded Leonardo also invented a spinning machine, a look, a needle-sharpening machine and a metal rolling mill but his patron the Duke had no interest in machinery. He gave Leonardo a commission to paint a picture on one of the bare while walls of the refectory of the Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie. When it was finished it was the immortal ""Last Supper"".\nIn 1499 the French King Louis XII conquered Milan and Leonardo left for Venice. He arrived just as the Turks had defeated the Venetians at Lepanto and Turkish warships were threatening the city itself.\nThe council of Venice, having heard of Leonardo's ideas of military weapons consulted him about the defence of the city and almost overnight this ever amazing genius invented the submarine and the diving suit.\nThen, for some reason which has never been explained, Leonardo left Venice before either of his inventions could be used and returned to Florence.\nAgain came war, for Cesare Borgia, Prince of Romagna, decided to enlarge his principality by the simple expedient of absorbing his neighbouring states. To this end he invited Leonardo to become his military engineer, giving him the rank of a general.\nAfter two years, however, Leonardo returned to Florence which had become involved in war with Pisa.\nHe was again consulted and this time his mighty brain envisaged a scheme which was as fantastic as was devastating. \n\nThere's a whole lot more on the site"

"Theoretically, YES, but practically NO. sound propagation can only hapen through particles.. atoms or molecules to pass on the vibrations/energy by hitting each other.

But wait a second, what is that dark stuff that separates all the stars? If you said it is space then you are partially correct. Outer space is divided into many levels and the one that separates the stars is called interstellar space.\n\nIt is often a misconception that space is a vacuum or simply empty. Space is a nearly perfect vacuum, even better than the best ones made in labs on earth, but it is not devoid of everything. The fact is that space is filled with tiny particles called cosmic dust and elements like hydrogen and helium. This applies for interstellar space also and all the previously mention particles make up what is known as the interstellar medium.\n\nThe interstellar medium is mainly made of lone hydrogen atoms.

The deepest parts of the ocean are found in arc-shaped depressions in the ocean floor known as trenches. These trenches form at convergent plate boundaries when one plate is subducted beneath another. The arc shape results from the geometry of plate movement across the spherical earth, and the convex side of the arc points toward the open ocean. These trenches, because of the tectonic and volcanic behavior associated with them, are often accompanied by arc-shaped bands of islands.
"The idea of some particle having a negative charge was needed to properly explain the results of experiments performed by scientists like Thompson, Rutherford, and Bohr.

When you are studying microbiology (the biology of microbes) you need to understand the processes that make these little critters tick. if you are studying a one-celled organism, then his life is guided not by large systems like humas have (circulatory systems, respiratory systems, digestive systems, etc.) but by small sale biochemical processes. A bacteria cell, for example, absorbes nutrients through it's cell wall. This happens throgh complex biochemical means (chemical reactions between the proteins in the cell wall and other substances external to the cell.) \n\nSo, the study of microbiology is inherently the study of biochemical processes. The way to determine the nature of certain microbiological processes is therefore to do lots of biochemical tests and experiments. \n\nIt's a challenging subject, but very interesting.
"This is being done to a limited extent in vision research-People have had microelectrode arrays implanted on the surface of the visual cortex of the brain, connected to a video camera.  The signal from the video camera activates the visual cortex, and these people, many of who have no eyes at all, or totally destroyed optic nerves, are able to ""see"" simple objects.  Thus, it is a proven concept that electrical signal can feed in meaningful information, and that information can lead to behaviour changes.  For many years, simple electrodes have been used to elicit specific tastes, memories, musclular twitches, etc.  As to your specific question-in order to control people's behaviour..in other words to overcome their will and wishes, and make them do things, or think things, that the operator of the machine wishes, would require a very good understanding of what controls our actions, emotions, and thoughts.  It's very unlikely that we will be at that state in 10-20 years.  Perhaps in 50 years we will have a very basic understanding, and in 100 years a fairly good understanding.  At any rate, when we do understand that, then it would be a relatively simple step to control it electronically (since electronics is simpler than the brain, and would also be advancing over that 100 years)."

Some salts are insoluble in water. For example BaS2 is insoluble. You can make it by adding two soluble salts solutions togeter. ie: BaCl2 (aq.) + Na2S (aq.) --> BaS2 (ppt.) + Na+(aq.) + Cl- (aq.). The (aq.) means dissolved in water, (ppt.) means precipitate or solid formed. Good luck!

Not sure of the exact specs, they would depend on the concentration of ammonia in air and how much total ammonia you expect to scrub before recharging the scrubber.\n\nAmmonia is very soluble in water, more so in acid.  Dissolve an acid in water (doesn't really matter which one, cheap HCl, sulfuric, acetic, all work--don't use nitric, ammonium nitrate can be explosive).  Put the aqueous acid in a flask.  Run the air to be scrubbed through a tube into the water.  The air should come out pretty clean of ammonia.\n\nThe acid helps keeps the ammonia from re-volatilizing from the solution.
It is not so much a chemical reaction as much as it is a conservation of momentum. A number of interesting things can follow from this, including discussions of pressure, vapor pressure, phase diagrams, etc. \nBut in general, the idea is that in order for something to boil, enough energy must be absorbed by it to cause vibrations large enough to enhance the kinetic energy of each molecule to the point where they break away from the coulombic forces that hold them together in the original liquid. \n\nWhen a more massive solid is dissolved into such a liquid, the energy goes into not only exciting each water molecule to a higher kinetic energy but also each salt molecule to a higher kinetic energy. The more massive salt molecules themselves need a larger contribution of energy in order to excite them. This takes away from the contribution to the water molecules. The increased density ends up requiring more energy for the same amount of excitation that would lead to the boiling of the water. \n\nPut another way, the salt molecules weigh down the water molecules and restrict their movement. This perhaps is easier to visualize. \n\nUsing the same logic, you may be able to see that the salt will lower the freezing point as well. And this is why salt (or even better, calcium chloride, an even heavier compound) is used on snow or ice to force it from a solid state back into a liquid state. The salt is an additional impediment to the water molecules' easy organization, so just a small amount of energy is needed to break that solid crystal organization up. \n\nI hope this helps...\n\nDon

"Psychology is an academic and applied field involving the study of the mind, brain, and behavior, both human and nonhuman. Psychology also refers to the application of such knowledge to various spheres of human activity, including problems of individuals' daily lives and the treatment of mental illness. \nPsychology differs from sociology, anthropology, economics, and political science in part because it involves studying the mental processes and behavior of individuals (alone or in groups) rather than the behavior of the groups or aggregates themselves. Psychology differs from biology and neuroscience in that it is primarily concerned with the interaction of mental processes and behavior and of the overall processes of a system, and not simply the biological or neural processes themselves, though the subfield of neuropsychology combines the study of the actual neural processes with the study of the mental effects they subjectively produce.\n\n\nPhilosophy is a field of study that includes diverse subfields such as aesthetics, epistemology, ethics, logic, and metaphysics, in which people ask questions such as whether God exists, whether knowledge is possible, and what makes actions right or wrong. The fundamental method of philosophy is the use of reasoning to evaluate arguments concerning these questions. However, the exact scope and methodology of philosophy is not rigid. What counts as philosophy is itself debated, and it varies across philosophical traditions.\n\nThe term philosophy comes from the Greek word ""Φιλοσοφία"" (philo-sophia), which means ""love of wisdom"". The term is notoriously difficult to define (see definition of philosophy) because of the diverse range of ideas that have been labeled as a philosophy. The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy defines it as the study of ""the most fundamental and general concepts and principles involved in thought, action, and reality"". The Penguin Encyclopedia says that philosophy differs from science in that philosophy's questions cannot be answered empirically, and from religion in that philosophy allows no place for faith or revelation. However, these points are called into question by the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, which states: ""the late 20th-century... prefers to see philosophical reflection as continuous with the best practice of any field of intellectual enquiry."" Indeed, many of the speculations of early philosophers in the field of natural philosophy eventually formed the basis for modern scientific explanations on a variety of subjects.\n\nInformally, a ""philosophy"" may refer to a general world view or to a specific ethic or belief"

Carbon-14 radioisotopic dating is only good for a range backward about 60,000 years, +/- 5,000 years.

For beyond 60,000 years, either Potassium-40 or Uraniums' -238 and -235 are used.

Nobody would buy my stock.\n\nOTPH if I used a y-axis of ""100-105"" AND only showed the last 3 years, it would be a nice steep slope.\n\nThe most common trick is to flip percentages and values for your own benefit.\n\nE.g. if you're doing 30.1 in a 20 mile per hour zone, you are:\n\n1) exceeding the speed limit by 10.1 mph (doesn't sound bad...)\n\n2) Exceeding the speed limit by MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT (oops, that sounds worse).\n\n3) more than DOUBLING your kinetic energy (sounds even worse)\n\nand so on..."

"I'm assuming you're speaking of in situ (ie; within the organism).  \n\nThink of DNA as the blueprint for each cell.  The blueprint is ""read"" by an enzyme/protein and transcribes it into RNA.  Think of RNA as a workorder that's produced from the DNA blueprint.  The RNA is then ""read"" by another enzyme/protein which produces the final product (a protein).  \n\nWhen cells divide, the DNA (blueprint) is replicated (copied) by a different protein.  Thus the new cell contains an exact duplicate of the original DNA (that is, in most cases...errors do occur which result in mutations).\n\nIf you're not speaking of cellular terms, but rather your question refers to the human genome project, the answer is yes.  Sequencing of limited segments of the DNA is performed.  The sequences are then read, and assembled by matching overlapping reagions employing supercomputers.  All potential gene coding regions are then determined by codon signals and homology with known sequences.\n\nHope this answers your question"

The main similaritiy between the two is that they are both located salt water tidal zones. Salt marshes are collections of a variety of marsh grasses and plants, while mangroves are small woody trees/shrubs with tangles of large, extensive root systems. Salt marshes can exist in a variety of temperate areas, but mangroves only exist where water temperatures exceed 75 degree F in the summer. \n\nThe rise and fall of the tides is the important ecological feature that allows the creation and sustainance of these unique habitats. If the grasses/mangroves were constantly submerged, they would suffocate and die. if they never were submerged, they would not receive the constant replenishment of nutrients carried in by the rising water. There are also important chemical processes that are triggered in these tidal zones (usually related to the cycle of conditions where oxygen is available (low tide) and not available (high tide.)\n\nBoth salt marshes and mangrove swamps are important habitats for fish, crabs, shore and wading birds, and other animals. However, the animals that inhabit the two may be different.

"Monopoles?\n\nWill edit later just need some info first\n\nEDIT\nYou can't find magnetic monopoles they are hypothetical\n\nIn physics, a magnetic monopole is a hypothetical particle that may be loosely described as ""a magnet with only one pole"" (see electromagnetic theory for more on magnetic poles). In more accurate terms, it would have net magnetic charge. Interest in the concept stems from particle theories, notably Grand Unified Theories and superstring theories that predict either the existence or the possibility of magnetic monopoles."

...that something like salt will dissolve faster in hot water vs cold water? that 'hot molecules' have more 'energy' than cold molecules?
First you need a parcel of warm moist air. Since warm air is less dense than cold it will rise.\n\nWhen it rises through the troposphere, the air will cool due to something called the adiabatic cooling process. This just means that as air pressure is reduced, the air particles will not be compressed any longer & will cool. \n\nThink of adiabatic temperature change like a bicycle pump. If you keep pumping it, what happens to the cylinder? It gets much warmer. This is b/c you are compressing the air. In the opposite way, w/ certain types of aerosol cans, continuously holding down the nozzle causes the can to cool. This is b/c you are allowing the trapped gases to expand.\n\nWhen the moisture laden air parcel cools to the dew point, water vapor will condense on tiny particulates suspended in the atmosphere. These particles are referred to as condensation nuclei or aerosols. These are usually one of the following: pollen, dust, ash, pollution, salts, etc.\n\nA good way to think of this is an ice cold cola can. On a hot day, moisture from the air surrounding the can will condense on the outside. This is b/c the cold drink inside the can allows the air on the outside to reach the dew point.\n\nOnce condensed on these particles, you have the makings of a cloud!

CH3CH2CH2NH2 has hydrogen bonding at the nitrogen, whereas N(CH3)3 does not. Since nitrogen is more electronegative than carbon, an nitrogen bonded to a hydrogen is a very polar bond with the positive end of the dipole at the hydrogen. So the positive hydrogen of one molecule will be attracted to the negative nitrogen of another. This makes it harder to separate molecules of CH3CH2CH2NH2 into the vapor phase, so the boiling point is higher.
If you use the astral body you can travel at the speed of thought. Just think of where you want to go and you are there instantly.
Yes. But more technically, it is diffraction. Gamma rays are high frequency light and will diffract, simmilar to ordinary light, except that you need to use a diffraction grating with a short enough spacing.  Compton scattering is an example.  Most physicists will say it is the wave-function that determines where the 'photon' goes.  It turns out that Schrodinger and Compton did a wave derivation of the Compton effect.  The other issue is to show the distinction between the photon model and a good alternative.  It is called the loading theory.  In my experiments, I have made the gamma ray go two ways at once, like a beam-splitter.  Quantum mechanics says the photon should go one way or antother.  The experiment also works with what they call atoms.  I have made the helium ion wave function go both ways defying QM.  I think it is possible to refract gamma, but have not done it, but fundamentally it should, and perhaps can be seen in astronomy.
I don't have a calculator handy, but I'll help where I can.\n\nEvaporation is endothermic, meaning that it takes in heat.  The amount of heat taken in when one mole of water evaporates is its molar enthalpy of vaporization.\n\nSo, first, find out how much of the water evaporated.  Assuming standard conditions, 1 mL of water weighs 1g.  So that means that 16g of water evaporated. (With me so far?)  Now use that to find out that you have a bit less than on mole of water vapor.\n\nWhere did the energy that the evaporating water use come from?  The other molecules of water.  You know that the amount of energy released when 284g of water decreases temperature is related in the formula q=mC(Tfinal-Tinitial).  (Only the other 284g of water decreased temp...the other 16g gained temp.)  Now you can figure out how much energy the water vapor absorbed when it changed into a gas.\n\nTake the energy # and divide by the # of moles... and you are set.\n\n\nOh side note: since you are dropping the pressure, you do not need to worry about heating the water up inorder to make it boil.

It has something to do with our species. I say that because most humans are self-aware, conscious, and/or sentient. So it must have something to do with how our anscestors developed in the path that led up to us. Being sentient must have helped us to survive or survive better, been an advantage that helped us prosper. Our species got genetically 'trained' to be this way, is a theory I think holds some water. Yes, it is one of the most confounding scientific problems today. A consciousness studies teacher commented, on a very similar question, that we are only at the most basic understanding about sentience and self-awareness. He compared our knowledge about consciousness to a chimp's understanding of computer programming. Being forced to adapt to several different diverse environments is a stimulation that I think could have contributed to our anscestors gradual development of consciousness. Once we were not in a comfortable niche, but had to try to survive with no engrained methods of doing so, we might have had to develop a capacity for greater abstract thinking in order to find successful survival strategies. I think that dolphins are in this category too. They seem to be able to reason beyond survival needs, but lack the opposable thumb that allowed us to develop tools.

Others before me said air pressure is used. That is correct.\n\nAir pressure decreases at a steady rate as you go up in altitude. Using this fact, along w/ an instrument that measures air pressure, height above sea level can be determined.\n\nAltimeters are commonly used on airplanes to give them altitude readings; although they do have to reset to zero according to current elevation to give them correct readings. This instrument is also used to find elevation.\n\nMean (average) sea level is used as a starting point for 0 feet elevation.

Interordinal mammalian relationships: Evidence for paenungulate monophyly is provided by complete mitochondrial 125 rRNA sequences \nLavergne A, Douzery E, Stichler T, Catzeflis FM, Springer MS \nMOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION 6 (2): 245-258 OCT 1996 \nCited References: 66      Times Cited: 37        \nAbstract: The complete mitochondrial 125 rRNA sequences of 5 placental mammals belonging to the 3 orders Sirenia (Sea Cow), Proboscidea (Elephant), and Hyracoidea (Hyrax) are reported together with phylogenetic analyses (distance and parsimony) of a total of 51 mammalian orthologues. This 12S rRNA database now includes the 2 extant proboscideans (the African and Asiatic elephants Loxodonta africana and Elephas maximus), 2 of the 3 extant sirenian genera (the sea cow Dugong dugon and the West Indian manatee Trichechus manatus), and 2 of the 3 extant hyracoid genera (the rock and tree hyraxes Procavia capensis and Dendrohyrax dorsalis). The monophyly (close relatedness) of the 3 orders Sirenia, Proboscidea, and Hyracoidea is supported by all kinds of analysis. There are 23 and 3 diagnostic subsitutions shared by the 2 proboscideans and the 2 hyracoids, respectively, but none by the 2 sirenians. The 2 proboscideans exhibit the fastest rates of 12S rRNA evolution among the 11 placental orders studied. Based on various taxonomic sampling methods among eutherian orders and marsupial outgroups, the most strongly supported clade in our comparisons clusters together the 3 orders Sirenia, Proboscidea, and Hyracoidea in the superorder Paenungulata. Within paenungulates, the grouping of sirenians and proboscideans within the mirorder Tethytheria is observed. This branching pattern is supported by all analyses by high bootstrap percentages (BPs) and decay indices. When only one species is selected per order or suborder, the taxonomic sampling leads to a relative variation in bootstrap support of 53% for Tethytheria (BPs ranging from 44 to 93%) and 7% for Paernungulata (92-99%). When each order or suborder is represented by two species, this relative variation decreased to 10% for Tethytheria (78-87%) and 3% for Paenungulata (96-99%). Two nearly exclusive synapomorphies for paenungulates are identified in the form of one transitional compensatory change, but none were detected for tethytherians. Such a robust and reliable resolution of the paenungulate node implies a long history of the common ancestors, allowing time for synapomorphies to accumulate. This observation suggests a Late Cretaceous/Early Paleocene origin for the Paenungulata.

Migrating birds tend to stop on their journey on local lakes and water reservoirs where if they have with them a bird flue virus then they may contaminate the local surroundings and local animals and birds with that virus which in turn can be transmitted to poultry farms where it may infect the poultry birds. When a human being consumes a bird flu virus infected Bird then he may get infected bird Flu.However if the Chicken is cooked above 80 degree Celsius temperature the virus is unable to sustain after  that temperature so even if you eat a bird flu infected bird but yet cook above 80 degree Celsius you will not catch Bird Flu.

I think it's 9 and 11.\n\nIf you take every second number, eg. 7, 3, 13 and 19, you can see that to get from 7 to 3 you minus 4, to get from 3 to 13 you add 10 and to get from 13 to 19 you add four therefore the for the next number you minus 10. So 19 minus 10 equals 9.\nFor the numbers 11, 8, 15 and 18, you minus 3 from 11 to get 8, you add 7 to 8 to get 15 then you add 3 to get 18. For the next one you would have to minus 7. So 18 minus 7 equals 11.\n\nThe sequence would be: 7, 11, 3, 8, 13, 15, 19, 18, 9, 11

"the current policy of the DOT (department of Transportation) is to ""allow"" transportation of radio active waste or ""spent"" radioactive fuel in DOT approved tanks by rail or truck only. State policy also requires that such storage or transportation be escorted by police or private security and in the the case of crossing state line more than likely a military escort. Of course this would also be approved by all the counties that the transportation would enter. The best and safest way would be to let the military handle all handling of, storage and transportation.

"As with most primates, yes. I'm not too familiar with their ""social"" structure... but I can try and give a few examples, but I suggest you check them out first because I'm doing this all from memory.\nColobus monkeys are primarily fruit and leaf-eaters. Because they live in environments with lots of trees, and because they are small, there is very limited competition between the monkeys. Therefore, they can live in very large groups. They share land with chimps (Pan troglodytes I think... I don't know about Pan paniscus), who hunt them. Their large group sizes aids in protecting them because they have more of a chance of being able to see the chimps and warn the others before they are attacked."

Are you talking about dissociation and Ionization?  Dissociation is when an ionic substance breaks into positive and negative ions in water or some other substance and are carried throughout the solution due to dissolution.  (also known as dissolving)  The other is ionization when a covalent acid ionizes and forms a positively charged hydronium ion and and a negative ion and is also carried throughout a solution due to dissolution.  They are both processes of dissolving
A problem is assigned to the NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) class if it is solvable in polynomial time by a nondeterministic Turing machine.A P-problem (whose solution time is bounded by a polynomial) is always also NP. If a problem is known to be NP, and a solution to the problem is somehow known, then demonstrating the correctness of the solution can always be reduced to a single P  (polynomial time) verification. If P and NP are not equivalent, then the solution of NP-problems requires (in the worst case) an exhaustive search.\n\n\n\nA problem is said to be NP-hard if an algorithm for solving it can be translated into one for solving any other NP-problem. It is much easier to show that a problem is NP than to show that it is NP-hard. A problem which is both NP and NP-hard is called an NP-complete problem.

The heated sands warms up their overhead air, causing the reflection factor of it to be different from upper layers which is much colder. Therefore, the low-angle light rays (e.g. 10 to 20 degrees to horizon) may reflect horizontally or with a slight up-angle and reaches the eyes. Now, what our brain may imagine by this signal is a decisive image: human used to see the sky in the water, therefore if he/she sees these light rays then thinks that there is a water next to horizon which reflects back the sky light-rays.

"Industrialization sure contributes to the phenomenon known as global warming. But, if I am to understand correctly, then, according to a scientist featured in a program I once came across on the Discovery Channel (Canada), a couple of hundred million years ago, a most unique event occurred, one most rare and that never before occurred in earth's history.\n\nThere are 4 things that can and do dramatically affect the earth's temperature, besides the heat generated by its core. These are volcanic eruptions, especially gigantice ones such as the 1883 eruption of Mount Krakatoa in Indonesia, comet, asteroid and meteroic impacts, what phase the earth is in during its orbit around the sun and, finally, how far towards or away from the sun the axis it revolves around is tilting.\n\nAny one of these can reduce the earth's overall temperature and make for a harsher and/or longer winter. Two of these create truly severe conditions. But a couple of hundred million years ago, the incredible happened. The earth was in the long and most distant portion of its orbit around the sun, the portion we associate with winter, its axis was at its furthest possible tilt from the sun and it suffered a collision with a space object (though it's not clear yet whether this was a comet or an asteroid).\n\nThe fact that it was during its long, winter phase meant that the earth would be cold to begin with and would receive less light and heat from the sun than usual. The fact that its axis was at its furthest point from the sun meant that the winter season would be that much harsher and would last that much longer than usual. But the combined effect of all 3 factors created a vicious cycle.\n\nThe winter season meant that temperatures were cold to begin with and that there was snow and ice on the ground already. The distantly pointing axis and the particulates from the collision kept temperatures cold and reduced them further. This meant that come spring and summer, much less snow and ice melted than usual and at a much slower rate. This in turn meant that by the time the next winter season came, the precipitation (snow and ice) of the last one was still for the most part on the ground. This created a larger mass of ice and snow, which froze into ice. This larger mass further sucked even more heat from the air around it and the ground below it. That further reduced temperatures, which caused even more precipitation to fall and accumulate, resulting in an even larger mass of ice and snow. This created permanent glaciars and permitted the creation and growth of pernanent icecaps at the 2 poles. These events have since locked the earth in an ice age. An ice age has two periods, a warming period and a cooling period. \n\nSo what does this have to do with global warming you ask? Until such time as at least some scientists became convinced of the phenomenon you know as global warming, the earth was in a warming period. It is my opinion and belief, given the available data, that, just as the earth experienced the simultaneous occurrance of 3 factors that allowed the creation of permanent glaciars and polar ice-caps, it can also experience the simultaneous occurrance of factors at the other end of the spectrum and that that is what the earth is experiencing right now. So I believe that the phenomenon of global warming is natural, and thus I support it, but that is aggravated by industrialization (mostly the various forms of pollution and environmental degredation), which I do not support.\n\nWhatever your goals and intentions, the best thing you can do is to gather the maximum amount of available information, and understand what theories are being expounded and how many acknowledged figures support them, so as to be able to accurately and fairly perceive the situation as it truly is and form an informed and educated opinion about it. Finally, not to be selective or act as a form of propaganda, I highly recommend ""State of Fear"" by Mr. Micha"

"Memories don't last forever, some disappear on their own.  It's a commonly held myth that every sensory experience you've ever had, every thought scent dream touch etc . . . is stored somewhere in your brain - research on memory suggests the opposite.  We filter most of the incoming information out and erase old experiences to make way for new info.  Memory is not infallible either - crime victims often get important and obvious details wrong, and memories can be ""created"" through suggestion (look up ""repressed memories"" and ""exonerated child molesters""!)\n\nThe memories that people want erased, however, are typically the ones that don't go away.  A characteristic of a traumatic experience is that it gets so firmly written into a person's brain that it just doesn't go away, and the experience keeps coming back, over and over again, because the brain has somehow determined that this is an important memory that can't be ignored or written over, and that's not always a good thing (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder).  Though memories like that can be lessened over time and with the proper therapies."

Then you add a solvent (like ethanol) which will dissolve the oils but which can be removed by distillation or extraction with a polar solvent (such as water).\n\nRather than filtering the extract, you might want to place the extractable powder (or mush) in a filter that you can hang into the solvent (like a one-use tea-filter or an old towel). You heat the solvent carefully (don't boil it off yet) and take care that the material you want to extract has constant supply of ""fresh"" solvent.\n\nNext you get rid of the solvent. Carefully - many solvent fumes are flamable. In case of ethanol, you might want to add nearly boiling water to the liquid resulting from your extraction. Some of the alcohol will mix with the water, another part will boil away, leaving droplets of the oil swimming on the water. A foam ladle oon might suffice to fish the oil droplets from the water surface.\n\n\nMake sure you use edible ethanol if you are after edible stuff or ""aroma oils"" (which often are low-boiling esters rather than fats)."

The assassin bug has been known to bite humans when not handled carefully. For some species the bite is known to be very painful, sometimes with effects lasting up to four months, at times causing allergic reactions. Repeated bites can cause increasingly bad reactions in humans including shock and death.\n\n\nSome blood-sucking reduviidae, particularly Triatoma spp. and other members of the subfamily Triatominae, are also known as kissing bugs due to the most common location of bites on humans being near the soft tissue of the lips and eyes; about half of these [haematophageous] species, located in Central and South America are able to transmit a fatal trypanosome disease known as Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis).\n\n=====\n\nBITES FROM WHEEL BUGS\nSome assassin bugs, most notably the wheel bug, will bite if picked up and handled carelessly.  The bite of the wheel bug is immediately and intensely painful.  Persons who are bitten should wash and apply antiseptic to the site of the bite.  Oral analgesics, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, may be useful to reduce the pain.  Treatment by a physician is not usually needed, though Caladryl® or topical corticosteroids may help reduce swelling or itching at the site of the bite.  As with any insect sting or bite, the victim should seek medical attention immediately if there is any sign of anaphylactic reaction, such as generalized swelling, itching, hives or difficulty breathing.

every object has a definite frequency with which it can oscillate. When the soldiers march they march with a definite frequency. If it so happens that this frequency of marching is same as that of the intrinsic fequency of the bridge then the bridge picks up the motion of the marching soldiers, ie.e it starts oscillating and eventually breaks. this is called RESONANCE. So generally soldiers are asked to break their steps when crossing a bridge.
This is a news story about a simulation of just such a collision.
"Lucid dreams give us the ability to control our own dreams and steer them toward the direction we want.  In the lucid state, we are more willing to confront threats and as a result, become more self confident. When we achieve lucidity, we can use it as a tool to improve our sports game, to rehearse a speech, to fulfill our fantasies, or to solve a problem in our waking life. In fact, some athletes utilize their lucid dreams to practice their tennis serve, golf stroke or bat swing. Even in our day to day life, we can use lucid dreams to ask  the boss for a raise, prepare for a first date, overcome phobias,  get over  writer's block, etc. The application of lucid dreams is limited only to your imagination.  Lucid dreams can help us visualize and rehearse the event in our minds before it actually occurs. \n\nBecause brain activity during the dream state is the same as during a real life event, what you ""learn"" or ""practice"" in your lucid dream state can be seen as training and preparation for the real thing in the waking world.  Our neuronal patterns are already being conditioned.\n\nAt least half of all adults have had at least one lucid dream in their lifetime. Many have reported having lucid dreams without even trying. Often flying is associated with lucid dreams.  However with practice, lucid dreaming can be learned and can be achieved at  your will."
Gulls (as bitchy ornithologists would call them), lay their eggs in nests. in fact 70% of all gulls found in the U.S. lay their eggs near Mono Lake, California.\nSea birds in general have specific islands where huge colonies gather to lay their eggs. The islands provide a barrier for predators to reach them.\nA lot of these islands are found in the southern oceans, especially for albatrosses.\nHope this helps.

Fermat's last theorem states that:\nThere are no non-zero integers x, y, and z such that x^n + y^n = z^n where n is an integer greater than 2.\n\nThe answer for it is NO, there aren't any such numbers.\nIt was finally proved in 1993-1994.\n\nAttached article has enough information about that.

Deep inside the earth, there is a spinning molten core of iron. This iron creates a huge magnetic field which surrounds the earth. The field protects us from deadly radiation waves from the sun. It also makes the Earth act like a giant magnet - so, the tiny free-spinning magnet aligns itself with the earth, pointing to the North and South Poles.\n\nNow if you went somewhere out in space, away from earth, the needle wouldn't feel the pull of the earth's magnetic field, and wouldn't point to north.\n\nThe answer is no.
"Embalming is a way to prepare a dead human body for a viewing or funeral. Essentially, embalming removes the blood and other fluids from the body and replaces it with chemicals which temporarily restore the appearance of the body, sanitize the surface of the body, and slow down the decomposition of the body. \nArterial embalming is done by opening an artery, pumping embalming fluid into it (usually mechanically), and draining the blood through a vein. Sometimes many arteries are used if the body condition warrants it. Any incisions are sealed. Arterial fluid usually contains a pink dye to restore an ""capillary flush"" look to a person.\nCavity embalming is done by removing all the contents of the hollow organs (stomach, lungs, intestines, etc.) with a   tube-like instrument hooked up to a suction machine. An entry point is usually near the navel and all the fluid and blood is removed from the pelvic, abdominal and thoracic cavities. A strong embalming fluid is then introduced to the cavities, and the entry point is sealed. \nMost people who are embalmed have both arterial and cavity embalming done. Often these procedures are followed by cosmetizing the person to restore their coloration."

Not with today's technology, but maybe in the distant future.  First we'd need to get the DNA of a dinosaur, or genetically engineer a modern animal into something that resembled a dinosaur.  But even with the DNA, we'd have no way to make a clone of that dinosaur with our current technology, and we're not even close to being able to genetically engineer our own bacteria yet, let alone a dinosaur.

"Biotin is commonly used as a ""tag"" in this instance to amplify the hybridization signal in the southern blot.  Older procedures for southern blot hybridization used radioactive 32P labeled DNA or RNA probes for the detection method.  Because of the expense and risk of dealing with radioactive waste, alternate methods that would give comparable signals were developed.  Chemiluminesence, fluorescence, and biotin-amplification systems will all give comparable sensitivities.\n\nIn the case you're describing, it's a sandwich detection system akin to an ELISA.  The biotin-tagged (biotinylated) lamda DNA is used to hybridize to the DNA on the Southern blot.  The researcher would then wash the blot and re-probe with a substance which binds to the biotin (ie. avidin, streptavidin or neutravidin) which itself was labeled either with an enzyme (for a colormetric reaction) or a fluorescent label.  If the reaction was colormetric it's likely the scientist used a streptavidin-HRP (HRP=horseradish peroxidase) for detection of the biotinylated DNA probe.  The HRP is then exposed to a substrate (TMB) to cause the color change.  \n\nThe benefit for using a biotin/steptavidin detection system is that multiple streptavidin molecules bind to a single biotin molecule, so you get an amplification of the signal.\n\nHope this clarifies things."

The trick here is the positioning of the resistance wires relative to the bread.  The infra-red radiation emitted comes out in all directions from the wires.  By positioning the wires just close enough together, at just the right distance from the bread, the heat generated is close to even.\n\nThere is, of course, more than that--but that's the basics as I know 'em
Physics is directly related to many areas of research such as particle and nuclear physics and astronomy.  There is also a large overlap in areas in chemistry and engineering so it is relevant to electronics, material science, energy supply etc.  Jobs in both academic research and industry exist in these areas.\n\nIndeed with a physics background it is often possible to go into any kind of scientific research or analysis, even areas in biology, once considered to be the science least related to physics, are asking for physicists.  The reason is that it is generally easier to pick-up knowledge in non-physics area than a physics area.\n\nThe mathematical, analytical and computing background of physics is sought after by certain areas of finance, information technology, statistics etc.

Biochemistry is essentially a narrow field of organic chemistry that deals with organic chemistry in living organisms.\n\nIf you like biology and chemistry, are interested in metabolic pathways, the chemistry of biomolecules, or medicine go with biochemistry. If you just like plain old chemistry, then organic chemistry may be the better choice.\n\nThe primary careers in both fields consist of lab work and research, but there are other options out there. If you want to make more money, you'll probably want to look into obtaining an M.A. or PhD. There are jobs for those with a B.S. or B.A., but you aren't going to make a whole lot of money.\n\nI would recommend talking with academic advisors in both fields at the university you will be attending. They can give you information on what classes you'll need to take for each major, possible career paths you can take, and so forth. Once you know the possible career paths, do some research and see what interests you the most.\n\nRemember that the average undergraduate college student changes their major about 4 times. Don't be afraid to dive in to something because you can always change your mind down the road. In the case of organic chemistry and biochemistry, the classes will probably be the same up until your 2nd year anyways.\n\nMost importantly, have fun and make sure you enjoy the field you are in! You'll find college a lot easier and a lot more enjoyable!
It depends on the persons situation.\n\nIf the person is at school or any other situation where they are with people of the same age, the odds of anyone you meet sharing birthdate is 1/365.  Therefore - in a class of 36 on their first meeting (ie. start of school) roughly there's a 10% chance of meeting someone with the same birthdate.\n\nIn general - someone you meet is going to be between 1-80 years old and born on 1/365.25 (incorporating leap-years) days.\n\nSo say roughly 1/30000.\n\nObviously - if you go to an area with a high number of retired people whilst you are young - the odds are drastically reduced - and vice versa.
I agree with conservation of energy. It is the one constant from Newtonian mechanics through quantum field theory.

I think it is presumptuous to ask a French university to teach in English.  Why not simply go to an English or American university?

Unfortunately its not that simply.  You have to stop the HIV from actually effecting the DNA in the first place.  Otherwise its just a back and forth game.

It does.
The answer is that the space program, and the race for the moon, began as a political test of wills between the Soviet Union and the United States and had nothing to do with science.\n\nBoth sides saw the moon as a goal not for the scientific purposes of the mission (ie:how the moon was formed, collecting moon rocks, etc...) but to showcase their technology and 'get the better' of each on the world stage.  It had everything to do with politics and after the USA beat the Soviets there, there was no reason to go back.  \n\nThe enormous costs of the mission were justified in the eyes of the superpowers if they could be perceived as being superior to the other, but once the race was won the costs to sustain the missions for purely scientific purposes proved too much to bear and as a result Apollo XVII was the last mission back in 1972.\n\nWe have the technology to return, but not the political will.
The bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus) is generally solitary outside the breeding season, or at most traveling in groups of 3 to 5 individuals.  Bearded seals are mostly bottom feeders, foraging for critters such as cod, flounder and sculpins, as well as clams, crabs and even octopus.\n\nDuring breeding season they can form groups of up to 50.  They don't form harems as many other seals do, but males may compete for mates by fighting with tooth and the claws they use to scrape holes in the ice to make breathing holes.\n\nThey are very vocal for seals, producing chirps, whistles and even melodious songs which can be heard for considerable distances under the water.\n\nPolar bears and humans are their chief predators, and a few are eaten by orca as well.  Bearded seals have little commercial value, but a few thousand a year are harvested for their meat and their hides are used for nonskid boot soles.\n\nIn addition to their claws, bearded seals will ram holes in the ice with their heads.\n\nBeing bottom feeders, they tend to found in shallow waters (at most 600 feet deep) where they can reach their food.  They prefer areas with thin or broken ice cover.  Some ice provides them with areas they can get out of the water and rest, but too much ice is too hard to break through to make breathing/escape holes.  \n\nThey are found in the portions of the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic Oceans where it freezes over in winter, and ice floes are present.  It's estimated that there are about 500,000 bearded seals worldwide.
depends on room temperature, and on other factors, but...\n\nmost of the time boiling to room temperature will go very quickly compared to frozen to room temperature. Let's assume that you are talking about water, or things containing a lot of water like soup.\n\nPart of the reason boiling cools faster is that boiling things are releasing their hottest bits (molecules) up into the air above the container. When the hottest water leaves the container, what's left is actually colder. This is why water splashed on your skin very quickly feels cold even if it was warm at first. Evaporation is carrying away the heat.\n\nThen, the other main reason has to do with the nature of ice. Ice is a crystal, and it takes energy (heat) to break the bits of the crystal apart and turn them into water. So, ice will soak up a lot of heat in order to just melt, without the temperature even changing. After enough heat has been soaked up to break down the crystal, then the water remaining will begin to to start warming up to room temperaure, but without the benefit of the boiling/evaporation effect discussed above.
Everyone says that The surface tension causes the drop to be spherical. But how? and Why?\n\nLets explain surface tension first-\nIn an air-water interface, the molecules that are close to the surface are attracted by fewer molecules of the liquid than the ones that are NOT close to the surface. The former thus, has less attractive potential energy than the latter, right?\n\nNow, for any matter (solid or liquid), attractive potential energy results in stability & repulsive energy results in instablity. Right?\n\nSo, it is energetically unfavourable to have a surface for a liquid (or solid) as it results in loss of attractive potential energy.\n\nNow, for that reason, a drop tends to have the lowest possible surface area to remain stable. Now, using some high level mathematics, we can find out that a sphere has the lowest possible surface area for a given volume. (it is better than a cube atleast).\n\nHence why we can see that the water bubbles and drops tend to be spherical. \n\nBUT, as gravity pulls the drop downwards, it looks like the way it does. Due to the distortion by the pull of gravity, the drops appear somewhat oval in shape but, in the absense of gravity, all the liguid-air surfaces tend to be spherical.\n\nI hope it helped.\nHave a nice day!
Most of the answers you're getting are too big.  They count A♥A♦ as distinct from A♦A♥.  It's the difference between permutations, where order matters, and combinations, where it doesn't.\n\nThere are 4C2 = 6 ways of picking 2 aces from 4, and 48 ways to pick the 3rd card.  So top of the fraction is 288.\n\nThere are 52C3 = 22,100 ways to pick any 3 cards, and that's the bottom of the fraction.  Divide top and bottom by 4 to simplify.  You get 72/5525.\n\nWith card hands it's easy to count the same hand twice.  8's and aces is the same as aces and 8's.

"Bermuda Triangle Fact Sheet\n\nPrepared by the U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters and the Naval Historical Center\n\nThe U. S. Board of Geographic Names does not recognize the Bermuda Triangle as an official name and does not maintain an official file on the area.\n\nThe ""Bermuda or Devil's Triangle"" is an imaginary area located off the southeastern Atlantic coast of the United States, which is noted for a high incidence of unexplained losses of ships, small boats, and aircraft. The apexes of the triangle are generally accepted to be Bermuda, Miami, Fla., and San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\nIn the past, extensive, but futile Coast Guard searches prompted by search and rescue cases such as the disappearance of a flight of five TBM Avengers shortly after take off from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., or the traceless sinking of USS Cyclops and Marine Sulphur Queen have lent credence to the popular belief in the mystery and the supernatural qualities of the ""Bermuda Triangle.""\n\nCountless theories attempting to explain the many disappearances have been offered throughout the history of the area. The most practical seem to be environmental and those citing human error. The majority of disappearances can be attributed to the area's unique environmental features. First, the ""Devil's Triangle"" is one of the two places on earth that a magnetic compass does point towards true north. Normally it points toward magnetic north. The difference between the two is known as compass variation. The amount of variation changes by as much as 20 degrees as one circumnavigates the earth. If this compass variation or error is not compensated for, a navigator could find himself far off course and in deep trouble.\n\nAn area called the ""Devil's Sea"" by Japanese and Filipino seamen, located off the east coast of Japan, also exhibits the same magnetic characteristics. It is also known for its mysterious disappearances.\n\nAnother environmental factor is the character of the Gulf Stream. It is extremely swift and turbulent and can quickly erase any evidence of a disaster. The unpredictable Caribbean-Atlantic weather pattern also plays its role. Sudden local thunder storms and water spouts often spell disaster for pilots and mariners. Finally, the topography of the ocean floor varies from extensive shoals around the islands to some of the deepest marine trenches in the world. With the interaction of the strong currents over the many reefs the topography is in a state of constant flux and development of new navigational hazards is swift.\n\nNot to be under estimated is the human error factor. A large number of pleasure boats travel the waters between Florida's Gold Coast and the Bahamas. All too often, crossings are attempted with too small a boat, insufficient knowledge of the area's hazards, and a lack of good seamanship.\n\nThe Coast Guard is not impressed with supernatural explanations of disasters at sea. It has been their experience that the combined forces of nature and unpredictability of mankind outdo even the most far fetched science fiction many times each year.\n\nWe know of no maps that delineate the boundaries of the Bermuda Triangle. However, there are general area maps available through the Distribution Control Department, U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office, Washington, D.C. 20390. Of particular interest to students if mysterious happenings may be the ""Aeromagnetic Charts of the U.S. Coastal Region,"" H.O. Series 17507, 15 sheets. Numbers 9 through 15 cover the ""Bermuda Triangle.""\n\nInterest in the ""Bermuda Triangle"" can be traced to (1) the cover article in the August 1968 Argosy, ""The Spreading Mystery of the Bermuda Triangle"", (2) the answer to a letter to the editor of the January 1969 Playboy, and (3) an article in August 4, 1968 I, ""Limbo of Lost Ships"", by Leslie Lieber.

The air blown comes out of a small opening.  At the opening the pressure drops suddenly,\n\nThe air in the small cylindrical vessel below the opening rushes to the reduced pressure spot.\n\nThe surrounding air also rushes to the spot.\n\nBut the equilibrium of pressure is attained only after some vibrations. (Just like a pendulum comes to stop after some vibrations.\n\nBut all these happen for a single burst of air blow.\n\nSound is the compressions and rarefactions of air.\n\nWhen we continuously blow air, the air is made to vibrate with  different frequencies  which depends upon the volume of air made to vibrate.\n\nThus the whistle sound is heard.

It seems that every object has its own gravity, or attractiveness to other bodies. Scientists are still puzzled about gravity, but it seems that the larger the mass of an object, the larger the gravity. The further away from the object, the lesser the attractive force.\n\nAlso...human beings and all other animals on Earth evolved to operate effectively in the gravity on the surface of the planet. When we are in less gravity environments or greater gravity environments for extended periods, the body experiences ill effects. For example, in weightlessness, the body loses muscle mass and bone mass. We need our Earth gravity.

It looks like HSDPA is getting more popular, with data transmission rates of 4 to 5 times that of current generation 3G networks (UMTS) and 15 times faster than GPRS.\nAnd UWB can deliver data rates in excess of 100 Mbit/s, while using a small amount of power and operating in the same bands as existing communications without producing significant interference. However it is not limited to wireless communication, UWB can also use mains-wiring, coaxial cable or twisted-pair cables to communicate - with potential to deliver data faster than 1 gigabit per second.\n\nThough it looks like HSDPA is getting more popular, we may need to wait for a while to see which one of them will integrate into daily life seamlessly.
Use the pythagorean theorem (A squared + B squared = C squared). Divide the triangle in half by drawing a line from top to botton dividing it in half. This will make each side on the bottom equal to 3..then use the theorem to solve for the missing number ( the middle line)..hope this helps!

This looks like an obvious attempt to have someone do your homework for you. Why don't you ask how to solve these types of problems and then you would know.
"Strings have sound because they vibrate in harmonic waves.  The length of those waves, or ""wavelengths"" is one factor that affects how the sound will behave.\n\nSince both ends of the string are fixed tight, the waves are forced to begin and end in a definite space.  This forces the wavelengths into lengths that are dependant on one wave starting and finishing from one end of the string to the other.  Since different string lengths will produce different wavelengths, the sound will behave differently.  \n\nThe other main factor that affects sound is tension.  The tighter the string, the shorter the wave will be.  A short wave height, or ""amplitude"" causes the wave to move faster, which produces a higher pitch.\n\nSo, you have wavelength and amplitude.  Those two things could take up a whole semester of physics, but they're relatively simple concepts.  (Unless you play trumpet)"

You solve these sort questions by calculating the energy contained in the sample (blocat?) and the water initially, and realizing the final energy content must be the same, or less if the system has lost energy to the environment.\n\nIf you actually run this experiement in a lab, you will find that the final temperature is the same as the air temperature of the lab.  If it would be warmer, you did not wait long enough, the system would lose energy to its environment.  The 2nd Law of Thermo prevents the reverse from occurring.  This is probably not the expected answer, but I believe it is correct.
Hold a meter stick perpendicular on the ground and measure the length of the shadow (from the base of the stick) and the shadow of the tree( from the base of the tree), then compare the ratios.\n\nSo if you have a meter stick casting a 1.5 meter shadow and the shadow of the tree is 20 meters then your tree is 20 * 1.5 = 30 meters tall.

I remember that the auto Xfmr (buck/boost) has standard input terminals then a series of terminals based on the voltage range you are looking for. Look at the connection diagram shown on the link below.\n\nYou want to have the Xfmr setup to Figure C where you have input on H4 and X1/X3. The Xfmr is jumpered between H3 to H2 and H1 to X4/X2. The Output comes off of H4 and H1. H4 terminal would be considered common. Monitor the output voltage using a trusty DVM, don't ever go by the info on the Xfmr.

The phase angle is the displacement of the wave (Delta) from it's normal position corresponding to Delta=0.  For example if \nthe solution is the form Acos(wt)+Bsin(wt) then it can be rewritten in the form Rcos(wt-Delta) where R=(A^2+b^2)^.5 and tan(delta)=B/A and w^2=k/m
Graphically, a domain is how far across the x-axis a graph spans.  A range is how far up and down the y-axis a graph stretches.\n\nSome graphs, like y = x^2, are limited in range.  In this case, y can never be less than 0, so the range is y>=0.  x in this case can be anything, so the domain for x is all real numbers.  Graphically that makes sense - you can graph your parabola as far left and right that you want to, but not up and down.\n\nOther graphs, like y = sin x, are even more limited in the y direction.  Graphically, you can see that y can't go past -1 or 1, so the range is -1 <= y <= 1.\n\nAnd still others have no bounds.  y = x exists everywhere - there's no limit on what x or y can be.\n\nThis is probably a lead-in to graphing more advanced functions, such as y = (x^2 - 1)/(x + 1), where you'll have a domain of all real values except for x = -1.  As you can tell, the function can't exist at x = -1 because you'll have a 0 denominator.  So graphically, you'll have problems with that.  (You'll end up drawing an open circle at that point to indicate that it doesn't exist there.)

"Honestly, I don't know about the process of grading tektites, like moldavite. You would need to take it to a gemologist for appraisal. You could take your chances and put it up for sale at an online auction...the bids will tell you how much it's worth. However, if you don't want to risk selling it for less than you think it's worth, you might do an online search for people who sell moldavite. Contact them and see if they'd like to buy your moldavite and add it to their product lineup. You'll need to know carat size and other information. There are plenty of ""rockhounds"" out there who might be willing to offer some advice; however, your best bet might be an appraisal by a licensed gemologist."
It acts to reduce the electrical activity of the heart, therefor inhibiting ectopic loci- It is not used a great deal anymore.Class I agents have generally fallen into disfavour, notably in patients with underlying ischaemic heart disease, notably following the CAST study where mortality increased by 6%. Encainide and Propafenone are occasionally used for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with supra-ventricular arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation provided there is no underlying structural heart disease. Similar, infrequently used agents with Class I actions are mexiletine, tocainide (which also causes bone marrow aplasia / lung fibrosis), and moricizine. Lignocaine is still useful for some acute ventricular arrhythmias, but its routine use in ischaemic heart disease must be strongly condemned.

this is difficult without using structures, but it is a free-radical mechanism.  I've added a link below which gives the mechanism about 2/3rds down the page.\n\nA peroxide initiator is thermally cleaved to generate two oxygen radicals.  These then add in a radical mechanism to the alkenic bond of styrene, to generate another carbon centred radical.  This carbon centred radical then adds to another double bond of another styrene molecule...etc  etc.  The reaction between a carbon centred radical and another radical terminates the polymerisation process.\n\nCommonly 1 - 2% of divinylbenzene is added to the polymer mix to allow cross-linking and strengthening of the formed polymer.\n\nHope this helps.
Magma flow occurs due to internal pressue in the mantle below the core.

The center is (h, k), so if you want a circle centered at the origin, h and k are both 0.

Graphite is a molecular form of pure carbon that is covalently bonded. Carbon atoms form layers of hexagons, and those layers are bonded loosely to each other. That's why graphite is used for pencils, because the carbon can come off easily with light pressure.
The three things that determine the average temperatures of any location are altitude (height above sea level), latitude (distance from equator of the earth) and any mitigating factors (like being near a big body of water).\n\nThe lower the altitude, the higher the temperature because (as others have noted) there is more air directly above you and thus higher air pressure, which in turn leads to higher temperatures.\n\nBeing closer to the equator of the earth (latitude) means you are somewhat closer to the sun and because of the angle that sunlight hits the earth, sunlight has to go through less atmosphere at the equator.\n\nBeing near a large body of water (ocean or sea) tends to reduce extreme temperatures because the water temperature does not change as quickly as air temperature and thus acts a moderating force (that is why San Diego has fairly moderate temperatures, but if you go a 100 miles inland, it gets hot).  Location related to global and local air streams also makes a difference.\n\nThe Sonoran desert (Tucson) is hot because of low elevation, low latitude (for the US anyways) and no large bodies of water nearby.

a sneeze is simply an involuntary nervous response to nasal irritation. According to this nifty science blog entry, the sneeze impulse affects a variety of body parts, including the abdomen, chest, neck, and face. During a sneeze, the impulses that travel through your face cause your eyelids to blink. This response is entirely automatic. There's nothing you can do about it. Sneezing puts a lot of pressure on your head and respiratory system, so blinking is probably a protective mechanism.\n     The point is that all of these responses (the abdominal contraction, the sharp burst of air out of your lungs, the general lunging movement) are intertwined. When you sneeze, you can't do one without the other.
a photon when absorbed by a material will elevate it to a higher energy state. when the material relaxes to its ground state it can lose energy both by radiative and nonradiative processes. if the process is nonradiative it will be by emission of phonons which is nothing but heat.
A proportional integral derivative (PID) controller uses the integral and derivative of the error signal in addition to the error signal itself. An application of this would be where the controlled variable is velocity, but the system also wants to null displacement error (integral of rate error), and wants to correct the velocity error with an acceleration proportional to the rate of error change (derivative of rate error). See the ref. for a far better explanation.

Since sun from the Earth appears in a blue sky in space it is in a black background. Blue sky is the result of reflection of sunlight from very small drops of water in the atmosphere. The angle of radiation causes blue color. But sometimes when the angle changes, the color changes too. For example in dusk we have a red sky. Because of that in space there is no atmosphere (include water drops) there is no reflection and it causes a black sky. But about the brightness of sun we can say its radiation is much more dangerous than when we are on Earth. Because there is no filtering system (For example Ozone layer) and all spectrums and UVR can reach you and hurt you.

We are only beginning to be able to detect planets within an order of magnitude of the mass of Earth. Just a couple months ago, we found the smallest rocky planet yet discovered outside the solar system, orbiting a star 20,000 light years away. It's about 5 times the mass of Earth, and has a larger orbit (and orbital period), about 2.6 AU (and orbits in about 10 years). It's also very cold, about 50 K (-370 F), as it orbits a red dwarf about a fifth the mass of the sun.\nIt was discovered with a new technique called gravitational microlensing, which can only be used occasionally. However, as this planet is one of three so far detected by microlensing, scientists think it implies that earthlike planets may be much more common than previously realized.\n\nThis isn't much of an answer to your question, but, honestly, the closest (non-earth) planet which is capable of sustaining intelligent life could orbit one of the two primary stars in the Alpha Centauri system (the nearest star system to the sun, at 4.3 light years away; there are three stars there, the larger Alpha Centauris A and B, and the distant companion Proxima Centauri) for all we know. The only way we'd have to find such a planet (without the presence of extremely rare astronomical conditions which allow microlensing) is the spectroscopic method, which has a difficult time finding any planets which are not a) extremely massive, and b) orbiting extremely close to their star. \n\nThe two primary Alpha Centauri stars could have rocky planets orbiting at less than 2 AU (Mars has an orbit of about 1.5 AU), and Alpha Centauri A is a metal rich G2 type star like our own sun, while Alpha Centauri B is a metal rich K1 star, which is in the band of spectral types which may be suitable for life-bearing planets.\n\nIn short, we don't know. They could be everywhere, including practically on our doorstep, or they could be relatively rare, and not found for thousands of light years from Earth. We'll have to wait until our methods of finding planets improves to know for sure.

Any electrical conductor moving in a magnetic field will have a emf induced into the conductor.  Using a permanent magnet, rotate a coil of wire (more turns = more length = more emf) in the mag field, rotation provided by muscles or water mill or air flow, and you get emf. Trandfer the electricity by slip joints (contacts) from each end of the coil to surrounding stationary wires (contacts), and you have electricity at the contacts. Voila!!
How far away the horizon is depends on the height your eyes are at.  A taller person will be able to see farther than a short person, and a person at the top of a building or other tall object will be able to see much much farther.\n\nFor a person of average height standing in a featureless field  (i.e. the ocean) the horizon would be about 3 miles away.\n\nThis website: http://www.boatsafe.com/tools/horizon.htm  will give you the distance to the horizon based on your height.
It is important for a few reasons. \n\nThermal Expansion--temperature changes cause the metal to expand and contract.--Without the joint the concrete would crack.\n\nBuilding settlement.   With a parking garage, there is a lot of weight coming on and off during the day and night.   It is a much heavier building when it is full of cars.  This causes a sponge effect with the ground.   The joint acts as a sort of shock absorber.

The process is a bit complex, but I'll walk you through it step-by-step.\n\nLoop diuretics block the Na/K/Cl co-transporters in the distal nephron. This causes a decrease in the reabsorption of chloride ions and therefore, increases the luminal electronegativity of the distal nephron.  The increase in luminal electronegativity allows excessive 'wasting' of both hydrogen and potassium ions, as these cations will be attracted to the relatively negative charge in the lumen.  Over time, the depletion of cations (particularly hydrogen ions) causes the plasma pH to increase (i.e. alkalosis).  \n\nBecause both potassium and hydrogen ions are lost in this process, the phenomenon is generally refer ed to as 'hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis'.
"That period is called the ""polar night"", nothing more fancy than that.\n\n\n\nThe winter solstice is the day, all over the world, that the days are the shortest.

There are no good characteristics of an intelligence test, because there are no good intelligence tests. There are good tests of information that people know, but that's not intelligence, and there are tests (of extremely varying quality) of different psychological factors, in both absolute and relative terms.\n\nThe real problem is that intelligence is not defined very well, in the literature or in the public consciousness. IQ is not really a measure of intelligence, partly because it really measures things like knowledge and maturity, and partly because, as stated, there is no good definition of intelligence. IQ is not intelligence, although it deceptively contains the word.\n\nA good intelligence test would provide equivalent evaluation for all testers, and provide a basis on which to compare the resulting data, just like any good test. For an intelligence test, this is not currently possible. People have been trying to make it possible for well over a hundred years now, so don't hold your breath.
"There are some generalizations that are useful, because of the statistical strength, such as ""men are usually physically stronger than women"" or ""Its colder in Canada than the US"".  They are not always true, but true much more than 50% of the time.  This statement, I think, is not one.  I would think that that passivity or aggresivity of a person romantically would have a great deal to do with the person they are with.  If you are more aggressive, the woman does not have to be.  If you were passive, and she liked you, then she would *have* to be aggressive.  Also, keep in mind that your statement is culture-specific.  There are any number of cultures in which the woman is generally more aggressive, and many in which there isnt any perceptible difference.  In answering a quesion ""Why would a person be more passive romantically"", one could think of a number of reasons:  They are shy or insecure, they are not sure they are ready yet, they are not willing to take the risk of rejection, etc.  In Western culture, men are taught to be aggressive, to take rejection without being hurt, to be confident, and we are taught that sexual conquest is something to be proud of and even a mark of manhood.  Women in Western cultures have been taught that rejection is devastating, that aggressive women are frowned upon, that loss of virginity is shameful, that men are attracted to demure women.  In many ways, men and women are raised in different cultures, with difference belief systems, even when raised in the same country, or even same house!  If you were to want a woman to be more aggressive, then make sure she knows you consider this a positive trait in a woman, that you appreciate more aggressive women, that you don't want to move forward unless you are *sure* she is ready- In addition, this would hopefully help unburden both the genders from outmoded cultural legacies, that put a great deal of pressure on the man, and reduce the freedom of the woman."

Polyethylene (PE) and Teflon (PTFE) are very different plastics, with very different physical properties.  Also, there are many varieties of both polymers depending on the molecular weight.  Higher weight generally equals better mechanical properties.  If you're looking for something with good wear and thermal resistance - that's PTFE.  On the other hand, PE tends to be more tough.  PE is a lot cheaper too.
"Cold fusion is a nuclear fusion reaction which its proponents claim occurs well below the temperature required for thermonuclear reactions (millions of degrees Celsius) in a relatively small ""table top"" apparatus. A variety of experimental methods are used; originally electrolytic cells. The idea was first brought into popular consciousness by the Fleischmann-Pons experiment in March of 1989, which was front-page news for some time, and has been controversial ever since. Cold fusion is sometimes referred to as low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) or chemically-assisted nuclear reactions (CANR"

You've already been told of the physical effects. Now, get a hold of the emotional ones. Someone who dies from the effects of smoking needlessly leaves behind loved ones to mourn. My sister smoked heavily for years, she died 4 years ago and left 3 young adult children who'd already lost their father when they were teens. She now has beautiful grandchildren she will never see. It is slow suicide and is intrusive to others who suffer from asthma and allergies. Second hand smoke is just as dangerous. Just butt out while you still can!
Your question isn't clear about the height of the prism; is the height 12 meters?\n\nThe base is a 3-4-5 right triangle (because 3^2 + 4^2 = 25, and sqrt(25) = 5), so the base perimeter is 3+4+5 = 12 meters, and the area of the base is 3*4/2 = 6 square meters.\n\nAssuming the height is 12 meters, the surface area is 12*12 + 2*6 = 156 square meters.

There are two factors to understand difference and similarities in humans. First is HEREDITY, every person inherited some of his characteristics from the parents, on the ratio of 4:1. This kind of characteristics can never be changed cause it is in the genes that makes you genetically similar to either your father or mother. This characteristics cannot be modified and are observed in the color of eyes; shape of the body, fingers, face; size of chest. Second is ENVIRONMENT, every person is also a product of environmental condition. This characteristics are the ones that can be modified externally. The color of your skin may change thru climatic condition, surgery, intake of chlorinated water; color of hair can change by exposure to salt water in the shore at all times, dye and etc.
alright;\nnow if you imagine a cube in 3 dimensional space with one of its body diagonals(passingthrough the body of the cube), you will notie that it forms the hypotnenuse of a right angled triangle with one of the sides of the cube as the altitude and the face diagonal of the bottom face of the cube a the base.\nhypotnenuse length =?\naltitude = length of side of cube = 4\nbase = ?\n\nlets find the base length. the bae itself if a face diagonal for the lower face. so it forms the hypotnenuse of a right angled triangle with two of the sides of the cube as the other sides. applying pythagoras theorem, we gt:\nbase = sqrt(4*4 + 4*4)= sqrt(16 +16) =sqrt(32)\nlets leave it as such for now;\nnow for the body diagonal, we again apply pythagoras theorem whihc gives us:\ndiagonal = sqrt(4*4 + 32)= sqrt(16 + 32) = sqrt(48)\n         = 6.93 inches (approx.)\n\nims orry if my explanation was complex but its really hard to explain 3-d figures in words. good luck teaching your kid. if you really need the diagram, feel free to email me and i shall send it in the mail.

"Tesla was from a family of Serbian origin. His father was an Orthodox priest.\n\n He was born in Smiljan, Lika, then part of the Austrian Empire, today in the Republic of Croatia.\n\nSo, he was a Serbian born in nowdays Croatia.\n\nthe next includes some info of his origins. You can find it at http://www.frank.germano.com/nikolatesla.htm\n\nNikola Tesla (1856-1943) - Nikola Tesla was born in Croatia, which at that time, lay within Austro-Hungary. Tesla was born ""at the stroke of midnight"" with lightning striking during a summer storm. He was born in Smiljani near Gospiæ, Lika, (the Krajina, a military district of Austro-Hungarian Empire, now in Croatia). At the moment of his birth, the midwife commented, ""He'll be a child of the storm,"" to which his mother replied, ""No, of light."" Tesla was baptized in the Old Slavonic Church rite. His Baptism Certificate reports that he was born on June 28 (Julian calendar; July 10 in the Gregorian calendar), and christened by the Serb orthodox priest, Toma Oklobd'ija. It is interesting to note that he was a Serbian of Valachian descent. Tesla was proud of his Croatian motherland and Serbian descent. When his mother died in 1892, he paid a visit to Croatian capital Zagreb, and gave a lecture about alternating current. On that occasion Tesla said: ""As a son of my homeland, I feel it is my duty to help the city of Zagreb in every respect with my advice and work""  - (""Smatram svojom duznoscu da kao rodeni sin svoje zemlje pomognem gradu Zagrebu u svakom pogledu savjetom i cinom""). Nikola Tesla, besides being a great inventor and an outspoken Serbian patriot, had sincerely adored free Serb states, Serbia and Montenegro. He had never hidden his patriotic feelings, on the contrary, he stressed them.\n\nOn June 1st 1892, Tesla arrived in Belgrade due to a call for assistance from the Belgrade municipality. Several thousand people were there to greet him at the Belgrade train station. He addressed the gathered crowd, who saluted him: ""There is something within me that might be illusion as it is often case with young delighted people, but if I would be fortunate to achieve some of my ideals, it would be on the behalf of the whole of humanity. If those hopes would become fulfilled, the most exiting thought would be that it is a deed of a Serb. Long live Serbdom!..."" Tesla further said to the students of Belgrade University: ""As you can see and hear, I have remained a Serb overseas where I have done some researches. You should do so and by your knowledge and hard work you should glorify Serbdom over the world.""\n\nI copied some tekst just for the official informations, but Serbs claim that he is Serbian and Croats that he is Croatian...."

"I read your question ""What would happen if I shot someone with an antimatter bullet?""  It is right in that matter and antimatter annihilate each other on contact, and are in fact drawn magnetically to each other to mutual detonation.  If in fact the particles could last so long as to leave the gun fly through the air without detonation (we may assume some sort of magnetic container) the bullet becomes a small antimatter missile, or bomb, with a few grams, maybe ounces of antimatter.  When such a payload of antimatter explodes there is a large gamma radiation burst, one pound of which would be more powerful than the first atomic bombs, detonated over Japan at the end of WWII.   The conclusion i draw is there would be a massive explosion that would devastate an area the size of a small city, from a single antimatter bullet.  Makes one think.  \n\n- LOVE YOUR NIEGHBOR AS YOURSELF"
Moonshine is the term for whiskey that is made at home. It is usually pretty nasty, flavor-wise.

"The short answer is that three blades do the job.  Even the largest wind turbines using blades nearly a football field long commonly use three blades.  Although four or five blades may work better, the additional improvement likely does not justify the added weight and cost.  Also consider that there is a ""wake"" behind each moving blade and depending on rotating speed and air velocity, too many blades would prevent each blade from biting clean air.  As a fan becomes larger, the circumference at the tips is also larger and perhaps larger fans can use more than three blades efficiently.  I just noticed that my window fan uses five blades and is much smaller than a ceiling fan but rotates much faster (higher air velocity) on high speed."

All materials have a heat transfer coefficient.  materials used for insulating have a much lower coefficient so the overall heat that gets transferred from one point to another over a given time is much less.  Given enough time the water would be the same temperature as everything else in the system if no other heat sources are introduced.  Insulators just slow down the process by making it harder for the heat to escape.

Since the structure of the genes on the chromosome hasn't chnaged much, we may well still be compatible to some extent."

About 12-13 m (39-43 ft) in length, 5 m (16 ft) tall and estimated to be from 4 tonnes [6] to 8 tonnes in weight, T. rex was one of the largest land carnivores of all time. Compared to other carnivorous dinosaurs, the skull of Tyrannosaurus is heavily modified. Many of the bones are fused together, preventing movement between them. The bones themselves are much more massive than is typical of a theropod, and the serrated teeth, far from being bladelike, are massive and oval in cross-section. Heavy wear, and the bite marks found on bones of other dinosaurs, indicate that these teeth could bite into solid bone. The teeth are often worn or broken at the tips from heavy use but, unlike mammals, were continually grown and shed throughout the life of the animal. Tyrannosaurus' brain was long and close to cylindrical, and it was probably among the most intelligent theropods, as measured by EQ. The neck was short and muscular, to support the head. The arms of T. rex were very small, perhaps to make up for the weight of its enormous head, but were very sturdy. They may have been used for grasping during mating or as aids in rising from a lying position, or perhaps to pin meat against the body while dragging a carcass to prevent it swinging around. The legs were relatively long and slender for an animal of its size. To compensate for its immense bulk, the interior of many bones was hollow. This considerably reduced the weight of the skeleton while maintaining much of the strength of the bones.

"I'm not sure what the difference between contamination and bad technique is. Poor sterile technique could lead to contamination. However, maybe the bad technique is in the gram stain? If you destain for too long it may be possible for a gram+ to appear gram-. However, if you have some clusters that are clearly gram + and some that are clearly gram- and they also differ in morphology, it is likely that you have a mixed (""contaminated"") sample. You can get a pure culture by streaking your contaminated mix for isolation, picking a single colony and then streaking that colony for isolation on a fresh plate. Repeating this process a few times with a single colony should give you a pure culture. Assuming your ""unknown"" is more numerous than the contaminants you should be able to separate it out and repeat your diagnostics tests (gram stain, catalase, hemolysis, etc). Hope this helps."

The electron accelerating back and forth sends out electromagnetic radiation, ie radio waves, that's all. Electrons actually travel relatively slowly in metals, due to frequent collisions with the metallic lattice. So there is no  fantastic disruptions to the space-time continuum. It is electric pressure that moves very quickly which allows eletrical signals to be sent so quickly. The effect is the same as turning on a tap to a long hose already full of water. Water will start coming out the other end of the hose long before the water at the tap reaches the nozzle.

All the previous answers are correct. However, with regards to enthalpy and entropy remember what these terms mean. While enthalpy is heat energy, entropy is (essentially) a universal tendency towards chaos. So, hydrophobic interactions decrease the total enthalpy of a system and (according to some fundamental physics) increase the entropy of that same system. The apparent paradox, proteins and lipids forming ordered systems IE. micelles, is disproven when we take into account the ordering of water around these systems. Water molecules become MUCH less ordered when hydrophobic components are allowed to form contacts. This is known as decreasing the hydration shell. Thus, all hydrophobic interactions are typically exothermic in nature and cause an increase in enthalpy of the system. Hope this helps!

I am a lefty too. Sorry to hear about how your mom treated you, that is wrong. This part about thinking with the right side of your brain though. You use different parts of your brain for different things. You don't think only with the right side. Although the motor controls for the left side of your body are found in the right hemisphere of the brain and vice versa for the right side of your body. There are studies that say that the creative part of your brain and analytical part are in different hemisphers, but that doesn't tie well with me as to how people are. You can be creative and or analytical regardless of which had you write  with. You are you, stop worrying about trying to figure it out and just let it happen.
The nine regions are the left and right hypochondriac, the epigastric, the left and right lumbar, the umbilical, the left and right iliac (or inguinal), and the hypogastric (or pubic).  These are arranged like a tic-tac-toe grid.  Altogether these nine regions contain all of the abdominopelvic organs found between the diaphragm and the pelvic floor.  So the list would include the liver, gall bladder, stomach, pancreas, spleen, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, appendix, kidneys, adrenal glands, ureters, urinary bladder, and the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries in females.  This schema is used primarily by anatomists, seldom by clinicians, who tend to use the four-quandrant schema instead.  An common exception here, though, would be clinical references to pain in the upper abdominal area which is frequently referred to as epigastric in clinical notes.  Most of the time such pain originates in the stomach, but severe epigastric pain is sometimes a symptom of myocardial infarction.  Evaluation of other clinical data is needed to distinguish one from the other.
predators and prey have a relatively simple relationship. If there is not enough prey the predators must compete too much and die off a bit. if there are too many predators the prey dies and then the predators follow. if there is too much prey the predators multiply until there are too few and then die off. if there are not enough predators and too much prey the prey will die of natural causes such as disease and starvation due to overcompetition for food \nso an equilibrium is really nonexistent, there is a constant state of change

If it is an isosceles triangle, and you drop a height from the angle between the 14's, then you're creating two right triangles with hypotenuse 14 and one leg 9 (the height bisects the base of the triangle).  Using some trig, you can find the base angle.  From the point of view of that angle, 9 is an adjacent side, and 14 is a hypotenuse.  So,\n\ncos x = 9/14\ncos x = 0.6429\nx = 50 (look it up in a table or use your cos^(-1) function on your calculator)\n\nSo your answer is (a).
"Yes.\n\nSince 1646 Pascal began a series of experiments on atmospheric pressure. By 1647 he had proved to his satisfaction that a vacuum existed. Descartes visited Pascal on 23 September. His visit only lasted two days and the two argued about the vacuum which Descartes did not believe in. Descartes wrote, rather cruelly, in a letter to Huygens after this visit that Pascal had too much vacuum in his head.\n\nIn August of 1648 Pascal observed that the pressure of the atmosphere decreases with height and deduced that a vacuum existed above the atmosphere. Descartes wrote to Carcavi in June 1647 about Pascal's experiments saying: ""It was I who two years ago advised him to do it, for although I have not performed it myself, I did not doubt of its succes""\n\nIn October 1647 Pascal wrote New Experiments Concerning Vacuums which led to disputes with a number of scientists who, like Descartes, did not believe in a vacuum.\n\nRene Descartes (1596-1650) \nBlaise Pascal (1623-1662)"

"The fire is believed to have been caused by a spark somewhere in the capsule's 30 miles (50 km) of wiring. Due to the pure oxygen inside the capsule (which was at a pressure of 15 psi or 100 kPa) the fire was quickly out of control. The Apollo 204 Review Board determined that a silver-plated copper wire running through an environmental control unit near the command module pilot's couch had become stripped of its insulation and abraded by repeated opening and closing of an associated access door. This weak point in the wiring also happened to pass near a junction in an ethylene glycol/water cooling line, which had developed a leak. The electrolysis of ethylene glycol solution with the anode made of silver resulted in a violent exothermic reaction that ignited the ethylene glycol mixture, which in turn was able to burn in the atmosphere of pure pressurized oxygen.[1] A similar March 1961 incident had previously claimed the life of Soviet cosmonaut trainee Valentin Bondarenko when the pure oxygen atmosphere in the isolation chamber he had been occupying had caught fire, a calamity the USSR had, for years, concealed from the public. The NASA investigation found that a bar of aluminum can burn like wood in a pure Oxygen atmosphere. It also found substandard wiring in the craft and a missing socket wrench that was ruled out as the fire's cause. Many items on board were flammable, and flammable velcro had been applied to the walls of the craft to secure items in weightless conditions.\n\nThe fire spread quickly and within seconds was an inferno. As a result of toxic smoke and malfunctioning gas masks, ground crew needed five minutes to open the hatch and suppress the flames. The fire had melted the astronauts' space suits and the air lines which connected them to the capsule's life support systems. Grissom's and White's suits were found to have fused together. It was evident from how the corpses lay that they had tried to get out, but they never had a chance. Ed White, who was supposed to open the hatch, was partway out of his harness and had apparently made an effort to escape. The procedure would have had Grissom lower White's headrest, and White proceed to unlatch over 12 bolts to release the hatch. Indeed, even if he were to accomplish that, the internal pressure had risen so high that the inward-opening hatch could not have been opened. Chaffee's job was to begin shutting down the spacecraft and maintain communications with ground control. He was found dead still strapped into his right hand seat. Only 17 seconds from the first call of ""Fire!"", all three were dead.\n\nIt was later confirmed that the crew had actually died of smoke inhalation rather than burns. According to the Report of the Apollo 204 Review Board — Appendix D Panel 11, (link provided below), Grissom suffered third degree burns on 36% of his body (1st, 2nd and 3rd degree burns covered 60% of his body) and his spacesuit was 70% destroyed. White suffered third degree burns on 40% of his body (1st, 2nd and 3rd degree burns covered 48% of his body) and his spacesuit was 25% destroyed. Chaffee suffered third degree burns on 23% of his body (1st, 2nd and 3rd degree burns covered 29% of his body) and his spacesuit was 15% destroyed."

Clostridium shows optimimum growth when plated on blood agar at human body temperatures. When the environment becomes stressed, however, the bacteria produce spores that tolerate the extreme conditions that the active bacteria cannot.\n\nClostrium species also form spores which survive boiling water, but the Closterium species can not form spores in the presence of oxygen. Most clostridia are aerotolerant (they survive exposure to air), but most species of Clostridium do not resume growth if oxygen is present.\n\nMinimal requirements of amino acids and vitamins were determined in chemically defined medium for five strains of Clostridium difficile. Cysteine, isoleucine, leucine, proline, tryptophan and valine were essential amino acids for growth of C. difficile. Arginine, glycine, histidine, methionine and threonine enhanced growth. Biotin, pantothenate and pyridoxine were essential vitamins. A defined medium containing the minimal requirements of amino acids and vitamins produced a rapid and heavy growth which was comparable to that in modified brain heart infusion, a complex medium. Adenine was able to substitute for glycine and threonine, suggesting that the two amino acids may be utilized as precursors of purine nucleotides. The defined medium developed here will assist physiological and biochemical studies on C. difficile.

Radiation is emitted across virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves at the long wavelength end, through optical emission to x-rays and gamma rays at the short wavelength end.

"The difference in relative size of one body part with respect to another (generally speaking, with respect to body size) is called allometry (from allos ""different"" + metro ""measurement""). And from a developmental viewpoint, it is determined by differences in growth rate between those parts, or in the onset or offset of the growth period (collectively known as heterochronies). \nThose differences may be directly coded in the person's DNA (especially in the general developmental homeotic genes) but can also arise from interaction among tissues and chemical signals between cells during growth. And in the case of abnormal size, there can be problems of embryonic development, hormones or others involved."

"Causes of yawning\nAn indication of tiredness, stress, over-work or boredom. \nAn action indicating psychological decompression after a state of high alert. \nA means of expressing powerful emotions like anger, rejection or apathy. \nA sign that one is not breathing deeply, and not receiving enough oxygen through the body. \nA yawn can express strong anti-social messages, and so in some cultures people try to mute or mask them by placing a concealing hand over the yawning mouth.\n\n \n\nA long-standing hypothesis is that yawning is caused by an excess of carbon dioxide and lack of oxygen in the blood. The brain stem detects this and triggers the yawn reflex. The mouth stretches wide and the lungs inhale deeply, bringing oxygen into the lungs and hence to the bloodstream. It is almost certain however, that this hypothesis is not correct. One study documented that this effect does not exist (""Yawning"" by Robert R. Provine, pages 532-539, American Scientist, November-December 2005, Vol 93, No. 6). [1]. A more recent hypothesis is that yawning is used for regulation of body temperature. Another hypothesis is that yawns are caused by the same chemicals (neurotransmitters) in the brain that affect emotions, mood, appetite and other phenomena. These chemicals include serotonin, dopamine, glutamic acid and nitric oxide. As more of these compounds are activated in the brain, the frequency of yawning increases. Conversely, a greater presence in the brain of opiate neurotransmitters such as endorphins, reduces the frequency of yawning. Patients taking the serotonin reuptake inhibitor Paxil (Paroxetine HCl) have been observed yawning abnormally often.\n\nAnother theory is that yawning is similar to stretching. Yawning, like stretching, increases blood pressure and heart rate while also flexing many muscles and joints. Some have observed that if you try to stifle or prevent a yawn by clenching your jaws shut, the yawn is unsatisfying. As such, the stretching of jaw and face muscles seems to be necessary for a good yawn.\n\n \nA cockatiel yawningThe yawn reflex is often described as contagious: if one person yawns, this will cause another person to ""sympathetically"" yawn.[2] The reasons for this are unclear; however, recent research suggests that yawning might be a herd instinct.[3] Other theories suggest that the yawn serves to synchronize mood behavior among gregarious animals, similar to the howling of the wolf pack during a full moon. It signals tiredness to other members of the group in order to synchronize sleeping patterns and periods of activity. It can serve as a warning in displaying large, canine teeth, thus proclaiming, ""don't attack while I am sleeping..."" The contagion of yawning is interspecific (i.e., try yawning in front of your dog). Ironically, yawning in public is generally regarded as impolite in the West, but came into fashion in polite French society for a brief period in the late 18th century. Oddly, sometimes sympathetic yawning may be caused by simply looking at a picture of a person or animal yawning, or even seeing the word ""yawn"".\n\nAdelie Penguins employ yawning as part of their courtship ritual. Penguin couples face off and the males engage in what is described as an ""ecstatic display,"" their beaks open wide and their faces pointed skyward."
As a signal is being advance towards you it will rise in frequency.  Like wise as it emitting object goes away the frequency will decrease.

Many recipes are actually chemical reactions. For example, if you use baking soda in muffin batter, then cook it, you are using the oven's heat to speed the production of carbon dioxide that results from mixing the sodium bicrbonate with water. This produces CO2 gas which makes bubbles that causes the batter to rise.\n\nWhen you marinate meat in a vinegar or wine sauce, the acids in the marinade break down the protein strands in the meat making the meat more tender. \n\nKneading bread dough encourages the development of gluten, which is  made up of chains of proteins.

preload is the amount of tension in the ventricular myocardium right before contraction.  kind of like a rubber band, the more blood that goes into the heart the more tension is created, the harder the muscle fibers of the heart contract, the more blood is moved.  check out the Frank-Starling law of the heart on the internet for specifics.
They love insects and small fish. At work we give ours tons of bugs, grated veggies (whatever variaty we want that day) and smelt. They seem pretty happy with that diet ;)
Initially, the pressure from outward flowing photons created by nuclear fussion of hydrogen prevent the star from collapsing.\n\nWhen hydrogen has been expended, other elements in turn are burned, although this process goes rather quickly.\n\nWhat happens next depends on the total mass of the star.\n\nIf the mass is insufficient, the star cools, and becomes a brown dwarf.  Electron repulsion holds these stars from further collapse.\n\nIf the mass is sufficient, then electrons are crushed into an associated proton, and create a neutron.  This causes a neutron star, and releases additional light and heat.\n\nSome stars stop here, but with sufficient mass, the neutrons are eventually crushed together, and a black hole forms.
When I was a kid, I had a reoccuring dream that a man broke into my house, went upstairs and cut off my parent's big toes, then came downstairs and cut off my sister's big toe, and then just as he was about to cut off my big toe, I woke up and checked to make sure I still had my toes. Then I would always go upstairs and check to make sure my parents still had their big toes. I never checked my sister though because she was older and mean so I hoped hers was really gone. :)
Redi and Spallanzani had already done some experiments disproving the hypothesis of spontaneous generation. However, many people still believed in this false idea.They argued that air was necessary for spontaneous generation. Spallanzani had kept air out of his experiment. \nWhen Pasteur did his experiment, he did not seal the end of his flask, the end of the flask was open to the air but had a long, curved neck. He showed that microorganisms did not arise in a boiled nutrient broth even if it is exposed to air as long as airborne matter was not allowed to enter the broth. \nLouis Pasteur put an end to to the spontaneous generation hypothesis.He definitely proved that life comes only from life.
The research has just begun actually, I remember it said something about sticking to anything wet or dry, but it didn't mention heat yet. I guess that's because its a natural occurring substance that is not usually subject to that kind of temp. That is a good point though, and you should be able to find out in the future. But if you told me you glued my car back together i think i might be a little skeptical!

It depends on what is applying the force. Example, an average human can bench press about 150 lbs using both arms in an extension motion. However, the average human can exert 180 lbs. of biting force using their jaws / teeth.\n\nAlso, if F=M*A, then a 300 lb person running at 6 mph (or 8.8 ft / second) can exert 2,640 ft / lbs, over a ton!
Only 2% of cases of congenital hypothyroidism are hereditary, so it is unlikely that your grandchildren will have any problems.  Even if they do, *all* newborns in the U.S. are tested for this before they leave the hospital--so it would be discovered right away.  As long as they took their synthroid, they would be normal kids and grow up to be normal adults.

"there are many shapes of carbon, such as diamond, graphite, soccer ball and spheroidal.\n\nMost carbon formations in metal have to do the cooling rate of the liquid metal to the solid forms. Some really hard steels are cooled rapidly (a few seconds) from molten to a bit under 300 degrees celcius and then held there for days then allowed to cool slowly.\n\nOther are cooled to room temperature rapidly (less than half a minute) then reheated to a few hundred degrees (this is called tempering).\n\nI studied materials science over 15 years ago, and I can not recal the exact process for spheroidal graphite. I can't even remeber now if it is the same thing as pearlite. If you can not find the answer on the net, go to a library and look up books with titles like ""engineering materials"""

"H o t  A i r   o v e r   H o t   W a t e r \n \n\nIn the 1500s, fishermen who lived in South America began to wonder about a current of unusually warm water that came to their shore every few years near Christmastime. Since the fishermen believed in the birth of the Christ child at Christmas, and since they spoke Spanish, they named the hot water El Niño, which means ""the infant"" in Spanish. \n \n\n Where do scientists look for El Niño? The hot water usually comes first to the coasts of Peru and Ecuador in South America.\n \nBut if we've known about El Niño for four hundred years, why is everyone talking so much about the hot water this year? \nThe 1997-1998 El Niño may or may not be stronger than ever before. Scientists are still deciding. One thing that is definitely different about this El Niño is the technology that scientists are using to study it. \n\n \n\n Scientists and governments from around the world—United States, France, Japan, Korea and Taiwan—are sharing knowledge and funding for The Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) Array. \n \nBut why all the fuss anyway about some hot water in the tropical Pacific Ocean? Well, it's not just the hot water. It's also the hot air. \nTry this: take two cups that are the same. They can be ceramic, plastic, styrofoam, whatever, as long as they're the same. Fill one with cool water. Fill the other with hot water. (Not boiling, just good and hot.) Place them on a table. Hold each of your hands over one cup and feel the difference in the air above the water. (Don't actually touch the water. Just feel the air.) The hot water warms the air above it. The cool water doesn't. \n\nNow, imagine you fill your bathtub with hot water. Think about how warm and steamy the air in the bathroom gets. Now, imagine millions and millions of bathtubs-ful of hot water. All of that moist, hot air has to go somewhere. Scientists know that hot air rises and carries the moisture with it. Once the moisture gets into the air and starts to cool, rainclouds start to form. \n\nNow try this: hold a small mirror over the cup of hot water for a few minutes. The moisture in the air should collect on the mirror, and, as it cools, form tiny droplets. Imagine the bathroom mirror after you fill the bathtub with hot water. The ""water"" on the mirror is caused by the water vapor in the air gathering and cooling. Now imagine the air over the hot water of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Huge rainclouds start to form and flooding results in South American countries along the coast.\nIt's not quite that simple, but the science of El Niño does start with those basic ideas about hot air over hot water."

Snoring can be an advantage... For some people who snore, they do so in fight for air to pass through to air passageway to continue breathing... some people have swelled up or enlarged pharyngeal tonsils, so snoring ensures an unblocked airpassage way by exchanging air through the oral cavity... \n\nEX: on the Tyra (Banks) show, Big Boy announce how his excess skin post-op of liposuction was almost suffocating his g/f in bed...but her body's response while she was sleeping was to autmatically start snoring to get air exchange when her nostrils were covered.
Gallium has an atomic number of 31, you find this in any chemistry book.  The atomic number is the same as the number of protons.  Since an atomic is not charged, then that must be also the same as the number of electrons.\n\nSo, any elements, the number of electron, or proton is just the atomic number on the chart.\n\nOk, good luck, have fun

Depends on whether you want to use fusion or fission, and on how large of an explosion you want.  Since for fusion, you need to much energy to get it started in the first place for you to be able to make it small, fission is the way to go.  You can make a solution combining uranium with fluorine and then diffuse the solution through long thin tubes.  The uranium 235 (the type that goes boom) will pass faster through the tubes and after a lot of time, effort, and money, you can get a solution of Uranium with a high enough concentration of the 235 isotope to be able to detonate it.  To prevent detonation, you want to use a moderator that will absorb neutrons before they can induce detonation.  Cesium works well for this because of its high density.  Set up a remote control that can remove the moderator and you have a reaction that accelerates exponentially (fast) and releases huge amount of energy.  Boom.  \n\nWhile bombs can be used for good and constructive purposes, I doubt your motives.  Regardless, the construction of atom bombs is public knowledge.  I believe that you would find obtaining uranium to be the easiest step, and that is not saying much for the easiness of the rest of this type of process.\n\nAs a side note.  The USA is one of the last countries still using diffusive methods for enriching uranium.  Most countries use centrifuges that are more efficient.
false.  you're runing a current through the gas which causes it to fluoresce.
Its a mathematical function which converts the time domain data stream into the frequency domain (spectrum).\n\nOnce the spectral peaks have been identified, fixes and mods become pretty obvious. In addition, one can create a stored  baseline, and if a different spectral content is obsered, you know something has changed, and the frequencys of interest, can help you pin point the problem. An FFT analysis can predict early bearing failure, as well as hardnening of the mouting surfaces.
Transition metals in general catalyze an incredible array of reactions, and nature makes full use of these abilities in metalloenzymes. As a result, there are many different purposes for transition metals in proteins.\n\nOften the metal center serves as a Lewis Acid to help catalyze a reaction, as is found in many metalloproteinases.\n\nSince metals can be reversibly oxidized and reduced (which is not true of normal amino acids) they play an important role in reduction and oxidation reactions. This is esepecially important for processes like photosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation.\n\nMetal centers are also important for storing certain compounds, such as oxygen. We all rely on hemoglobin and myoglobin for oxygen storeage.\n\nThere are many other uses as well, but these are most of the major ones.
To find out if every vector in the xy-plane can be written as a linear combination of those two, you would do a little linear algebra:\n(these are matrices/vectors)\n|1 -2 | |a|  = |x|\n|4  5 | |b| ...|y|\nso a - 2b = x\n  4a + 5b = y\nif you reduce this, it becomes\na - 2b = x\n13b = y - 4x\n\na is the number multiplying your (1,4) vector\nb is the number multiplying your (-2,5) vector\nx is the x coordinate of any vector you want\ny is the y coordinate\n\nSo you see that b is expressed as b = 1/13y - 4/13x, so no matter what your x and y value is, b will be a number.\n\nWhat about a? If the same is true for a, then any vector can be written as a linear combination of the two.\nSo again, we had:\n\na - 2b = x\n13b = 2x + y\nsubstitute b into the first equation\na + 8/13x - 2/13y = x\na = 5/13x + 2/13y\n\nSo a can also be found given any x,y coordinate. So the answer is Yes.\n\nP.S. I'm a bit tired right now so the math might be a little off. I hope you still get the general idea. My answer of yes, however, doesn't change, but the value of a and b could be off by a little.\n\nP.P.S. You can verify this. Think of any vector you want, and find the value of a and b. Then do a*(1,4) + b*(-2,5). You'll get back your vector.\n\nAlternatively, if you don't need to actually find the linear combinations, you can just do it this way:\nIt's easy to see that (1,4) and (-2,5) are not parallel. Any two non-parallel vectors in the xy plane span the whole plane.
Official answer: Earth! Why? Because it provides life, and some of it is amazingly beautiful.\n\nBut, if we were to go with planets other than earth, I'd say Jupiter and Saturn, because they're gorgeous. Jupiter has a stunning array of colors, and the thought that it's all one big violent storm just amazes me. Saturn, of course, has its phenomenal rings.\n\nOh! And if we're talking moons, then I'd say either Io (which is basically a huge mass of volcanoes; some of which are the size of Colorado!), and Europa, because beneath its icy surface may be an ocean which supports life.

..mmmm.... NOT really correct!!! you know! Energy of water does not depend on the way that water flows, just about loss!\nDischarge of Water in WC is not main reason! in Air plane you can not have enough water flow. It works by pressure.\nAs you know in Bernoulli's Equation we have :\n\nE=z+(p/Gamma)+(v^2/2g)\n\nkinetic Energy just depends on Velocity. Well... let me back to your question...\nin a Hydropower design the main thing is having more energy and less Loss, during generating Electricity. Well... with the main key which I told you, is it really logical that you have a spiral flow?!! in spiral flow you have a lot of loss and also you have some important hit on penstock during swirling flow. If I were you, I designed a really simple and usual penstock. It works better. For comparing of them, you can calculate the value of loss in both alternative and then compare them.\nAnd about simulation model. let me leave you a piece of advice... mmm... Do not use model in this area!! try to see a physical model or built one of them (if your project is really important) because of this reason I told you that use a simple pattern for penstock.\n\nBe Success!!!

"The man is pushing against the box in one direction, and against the floor (with an equal force) in the opposite direction. The force on the floor is transmitted through his shoes, via a frictional force. And the man experiences reaction forces in his hands and feet (the box and the floor ""pushing back"")\n\nWhen stationary, or at constant velocity, all the forces balance. As the box starts to move (accelerate), there must be a resultant force in the forward direction, i.e. the forces are not balanced."

The main force behind folding is that hydrophobic side chains on some amino acids repel water.  If they are surrounded by water, the system is at a higher energy state than if they are away from water.  Thus, they attact each other, and end up inside the core of the coiled polypeptide chain, with water molecules contacting only charged (polar / ionised) side chains, which end up on the outside.\n\n(This applies to proteins which will be active in aqueous emvironments.  With proteins that will sit in hydrophobic environments, such as in biological membranes, the folding works to keep hydrophobic side chains exposed.)\n\nThen, the positively - charged side chains are attracted to the negatively - charged ones.\n\nFinally, the cysteines that end up near each other may oxidise, turning their -S-H chains into _S_S_ disulfide bridges.  That is; these form late, but then they are stable covalent bonds, and so they do increase the final stability of the 3D folded conformation of the protein.\n\nIt is the 3D structure that gives proteins their biological function.
Proximity switches are used in industry to detect proximity of moving components. I am from aviation industry so I give example of landing gear down & locked condition sensing being done by proximity switches.The main parts of a proximity switch are the switch module & the target which do not come in contact with each other but come in close proximity. When the target comes in close proximity to the switch a signal is generated from the switch module for the appropriate circuit.\nThere are two distinct types of proximity switches;\nA) Magnetic type; Here the switch part of the module consists of an internal magnetically operated microswitch & the same is activated when a magnetic target comes in close proximity to it.\nB) Solid state type; The switch module consists of a gauss generating unit. When the non-magnetic target comes in close proximity to it the internal circuit is completed & a signal is generated.

Well, I won't do it for you - but here is HOW to do it.  You have one C on each side so that is good.  But you have 4 Hs on the left side so you need 2 H2Os on the right to balance the Hs.  Now you have 4 Os on the right, so you need to make your 2 O2s on the left to balance the oxygen.\n\nCH4 + 2 O2   =   CO2 + 2 H2O\n\nNow - using the atomic weights of H=1, C=12, O=16, you get molecular weights for methane = 16 and 02 = 32.  Convert the weights of menthane and O2 into moles using the molecular wieghts - whichever is the smaller # of moles is the limiting reagent - meaning that the reaction will stop when this reagent has been used up.
"Microtubulus composed of monomers (it's a kind of building blocks, if you're not familiar with the term) called tubulin. In short, there is an GTP binding grrove in each tubulin monomer, allowing them to form dimer of alpha and beta tubulin. In the GTP binding state, their conformation favors formation of microtubulus polymer. There is a special protein that acts to ""charge"" GDP binding monomer with new GTP molecule."

"It depends how you define your number system.\nFor example, the decimal number system in everyday use states 1 + 1 = 2\nBut if you define 1 differently, such as in base 2 maths (binary maths) then the previous answerer was correct in stating 1 + 1 = 10\n\nAlternatively if you define 1 as a symbol, not a number, then 1 could represent anything.\nE.G, you could define a whole new number system which goes 3,2,1,6,5,4... etc\nwhere 3 is the first number, 2 is the second number... etc\nThis would be very confusing!! But the point i'm trying to make is that the concept of ""one"", ""two"" or ""three"" is not dependent on the symbols we use for them, 1, 2 ,3."

Driving a truck doesn't require much math, science and technology - on the surface.  But imagine you are buying a truck and trying to figure out which truck to buy.  One may get great mileage, but requires higher maintenane.  Another may cost less, but gets terrible mileage.  Having the knowledge to figure out what is the right truck will take math.\n\nTechnology and trucking are quite a pair.  GPS(global positioning system) for route planning is a start.  Another buzzword these days is RFID(Radio Frequency IDentification).  This is a new way of taking inventory.  It is kind of like a barcode, but you don't have to see the RFID device.  If the cargo in your truck has RFID tags, a RFID reader could take inventory  as the boxes are loaded onto the truck.  This is a new trend that will make trucking more efficient.  The ability to identify and implement new trends makes science and technology a must for someone in trucking.

The “Big Bang” really refers to one simple hypothesis:  that the Universe is expanding from a state when it was once much hotter and denser than it is today.  One can think of a “zero point” at which the Universe was unimaginably tiny, etc., and that point is what we often refer to as the “Big Bang,” but that presupposes a bit more than we need to.\n\nSo…  If the Universe was indeed once much hotter and denser than it is today, it may have been too hot and too dense for light to travel very far—a bit like the interior of a cloud, which is too dense for us to see inside.  We would then only “see” (i.e., be able to detect) radiation from a time after that epoch, after the Universe had cooled to the point that photons could zip around relatively unimpeded, as they do today.  That point in time corresponds to the equivalent of the surface of a cloud in our sky—also called the “surface of last scattering,” which isn’t a distinct, smooth surface at all, but kind of a fuzzy region that represents the limit of how far we can see into the cloud.  (Or, in the case of the Universe, the surface of last scattering, is the fuzzy boundary between when the Universe was too hot for light to travel far and when it was cool enough for photons to travel basically inifintely far.)\n\nSo far, so good (I hope).  It turns out that we can calculate the temperature at which this transition would took place—something like 3,000 Kelvins (or 5,000° Fahrenheit).  Something that hot should radiate light in a highly characteristic way, which we call “blackbody” radiation—the same effect that causes the Sun or other stars or a red-hot poker to glow a certain color.  As it turns out, a 3,000-Kelvin blackbody would glow reddish-orange—not just a single wavelength that we’d call “reddish-orange,” but a collection of wavelengths that peak around the color reddish-orange.\n\nBut wait!  The Universe is expanding, and light expands with it.  So that reddish-orange gets redshifted down into microwave light.  COBE and WMAP detect exactly the kind of microwave light we’d expect from a blackbody some 13 billion years in the past.  This is a remarkable confirmation of the Big Bang hypothesis.  Furthermore, we can look at the characteristics of the blackbody “curve” (another name for the collection of wavelengths of light emitted by stuff of a certain temperature) and determine lots of other things about the early Universe.  Including the time that the light was emitted, about 370,000 years after the “Big Bang.”\n\nOf course, other sources of microwave radiation get in the way, but because we’re looking for a collection of wavelengths (not just a single color, but a collection of colors that correspond to a specific temperature), we can weed out interference.  So we can determine which photons have travelled to us all the way from the early Universe, some 13 billion years ago.\n\nThe WMAP website explains all this pretty well, if you want another description:\nhttp://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_mm.html\n\nI hope that helps…\n\n\nRyan Wyatt\nRose Center for Earth & Space\nNew York, New York

Oils are composed of one or several liquid hydrocarbon compounds. They differ from other hydrocarbons, such as alcohols, ketones and ethers by their non-polarity. Their difference from fats and waxes is given by the length of their molecule chains.\n\nIn particular, petroleum consists of a complex mixture of various hydrocarbons, largely of the alkane series, but may vary much in appearance and composition.
Count the number of valence electrons in each atom, and add them up. Cl = 7, O = 6, so total is 19.

Yes.  Collisions between extra-terrestrial objects and Earth occur all the time.  \n\nMost of them are inconsequential (i.e. shooting stars), but every so often one of them is a real doozy.\n\nThe asteroid believed responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs is one such collision.  \n\nThere is also evidence that even larger impacts have occurred at various periods.  The Manicougan crater in Quebec is a pretty visible reminder of one large impact.\n\nThe craters on the moon show what the Earth might look like if we didn't have erosion and continual vulcanism renewing our surface.\n\nThe moon itself may have been ripped from the mantle of the Earth when a huge asteroid glanced off Earth 3.5 billion years ago.

It is a sleeping pill. \n\nWhen used for treatment of insomnia, the usual dose is 7.5mg to 15mg taken at bedtime.\n\nAlthough not usually fatal when taken alone, a temazepam overdose is considered a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel.\nThe lethal dose is not known, but supposed to be over 500 mg. A case of a person surviving after taking 300 mg is known.
I lot of knee-jerk... ah, never mind... The answers that follow will show my point.
"(m)\n\nMost of us like stability in our lives, especially when it comes to planet-wide phenomena, such as the daily appearance of the sun or the periodic change of season. So it can be unsettling to learn of global phenomena that are inherently unstable, unpredictable. Such is the case with the Earth's magnetic field. Every so often, our planet's magnetic poles reverse polarity . Compass needles have always pointed north; in a reversal, they would point south. \n\nYou could perhaps take comfort in the knowledge that these reversals happen infrequently—on average every 250,000 years—but maybe not when you consider that it's been over 700,000 years since the last reversal, and the next one may be currently underway. \n\nThe Earth's magnetic field is created deep within our planet's outer core through a complex, self-sustaining interaction known as the ""geomagnetic dynamo"" . In the 1980s, Gary Glatzmaier, now at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Paul Roberts of the University of California, Los Angeles, began work on a computer model that simulates this interaction. By 1995, they had created a model that not only created a self-sustaining magnetic field , but after simulating the passage of 36,000 years, the field it generated spontaneously flipped."
K.  They're all in the same row, so the one to the left has the biggest radius because there are fewer protons to attract the electrons towards the nucleus.\n\nAtomic radius is how far the electrons are circling around.\n\nEr, no one believes me.  :(\n\nI know the noble gas is supposed to buck the trend, but for some reason, it's listed as having a smaller radius here: http://dl.clackamas.cc.or.us/ch104-07/atomic_size.htm\n\nK has an atomic radius of 2.31 Angstroms or an atomic diameter of 5.54 A, while the others generally go down.\n\nThere's also a graph here that shows the same thing: http://www.webelements.com/webelements/properties/text/image-period-4spd/atomic-radius.html

"Hi!\nFirst of all, if the galaxy ends... so does the earth since the earth is part of the galaxy!\nI don't think there are any theories as to the end of any galaxy specifically, but there is a theory that the Universe is currently expanding from the time of the Big Bang (which is scientifically considered the beginning of the universe) and one day, the universe will stop expanding and start to contract.\n\nSo, in simple terms, scientists believe that the universe strated from a single point in empty space, that point exploded into the universe (an event called the Big Bang) and since then, all the objects in the universe (all the galaxies etc.) are moving away from this point. Basically the theory says that the explosion is still going on and will continue for a few billion more years. At some point in the future, the objects in the universe will stop moving away from the point of the initial explosion. Once that happens, scientists have different theories about what happens next. \nSome believe that the universe will just stop moving and stay that way forever (Steady State Theory). Some believe that gravity will pull the whole universe all the way back to the starting position and then the whole universe will become a single point in empty space again (just like in the beginning) and that will be the end of the universe. Other scientists believe that when the universe returns to that same point again, it will explode again, and so this will keep going on forever (I.e. the universe will keep exploding and reforming and exploding over and over again). There are some other theories but these are the main ones.\n\nRegardless, scientists believe that we may never know what will happen because almost all scientists agree that in 5 billion years time (or so) the sun will die (also known as ""going nova"") and in its death will burn the entire solar system in what we call a nova explosion. So unless we can find another planet outside of this solar system to inhabit, we won't see the end of the universe!\n\nSuddenly believing in God seems like the much safer option - at least we have a chance then!\n\nSorry, I just want to reinforce this comment, the sun WILL NOT go supernova and become a white dwarf it is far too small, it can only go nova (becoming a red super giant - which actually makes it the size of the solar system not just to mars' orbit - remembering that the nova is in fact an explosion, the surface of the sun is blasted outward and is likely to go beyond the edge of the solar system) and then the core will collapse on itself.\n\nHope that helped,\nFahed"
"You inherit a tendency towards obesity, but only eating will make you obese. Genes determine the number of fat cells we have, but it is the ages 8 - 12 where we really can put these beasts on the body. If children are fed a normal amount of food, healthy food, not allowed to sit all day in class and on computers, made to run and play, deprived of soft drinks and junk food, chances are the fat cells will NEVER develope. Therefore, we can ""trick"" the tendency. Unfortunately, parents do not tend to their kids in this respect. It used to be, ""a fat child is a healthy child."" Kids were made to ""clean up their plates"" whether they were full or not. Too bad...Today, obesety is epidemic because of inactivity and very bad diet. These kids will have a real battle their entire lives to control their weight, simply because they were allowed to put uncontrolled fat cells on their body at a critical time in developement. Only cell removal will have a great effect on perminent weight controll after the damage is done...that removal (Liposucion) is painful, dangerous, and very expensive....so silly when it could have been prevented in the first place."

There are certain kinds of transition lenses nowadays that don't depend on the chemical that the lens is soaked in. They used to call this photo white photo black, for its ability to turn clear and dark under different light conditions. What happens is when light impacts the molecules that make up the lens itself, causing it to become excited at the atomic level. When this happens you have electrons jumping from a ground state to an excited state, and the resultant photon given off is of a certain energy level, which will explain why we even have a choice of colour for our transition lenses. This is largely based on the electromagnetic spectrum. When we go back into a room there is not enough light to continually maintain the higher energy quantization of the atom and it reverts back to its original ground state, a.k.a unexcited state, and it ends up clear.

There was a program on the Animal Channel about a baby walrous that was abandond by his mother, and was rescued and brought to the zoo. Humans were taking care of him, and teaching him the walrous ways. He was sooo cute. He was a huge creature that just wanted to cuddle, and could have killed his handlers if he cuddled too much, but it was heartbreaking to see how he just wanted to be with others. \nThen they intorduced him to a few grown walruses. The first time he met one of them he was just so joyful and playful and cute... I love walrues ever since I saw that program. Wish I had become a marine biologist.

"Melting icebergs can only change the sea level in a very small amount, almost insignificant but not zero. This is because sea ice is much fresher than sea water. When the ice melts the resultant melt water is slightly less dense than the original sea water, so the melt water still 'stands' a little higher than the local sea level. The amount of extra height depends on the salinity difference between ice and ocean, and corresponds to about 2% of the thickness of the original ice floe.  \n\nThere is a calculus for this:\n""For 30 million square kilometers of ice (global maximum extent) and average thickness of 2 meters (the Arctic ice is about 3 meters, the Antarctic is about 1), the corresponding change in global sea level would be:\n 2(meters) * 0.02 (salinity effect) * 0.10 (fraction of ocean covered by ice), or 4 mm.  Not a large figure, but not zero either.""\nhttp://www.radix.net/~bobg/faqs/sealevel.faq.html\n\nWhat can really change the sea level is the ice that is not floating, the ice sheets in the Antarctic that are grounded on land.\n\n\n---addition---\nReading the answers above, just remember Archimedes principle to understand why an ice that melts in a glass of water doesn't change the water level. In the case of the icebergs the result is slightly different because the iceberg doesn't have the same components as the sea water (salinity)"

"There are only two driving forces:\n\nSlab pull (from the descending slab)\nRidge push (from the topographic high at the rift)\n\nThese are the only driving forces.  Often the effect of the mantle below the plate is believed (sometimes even taught in first and second year courses! - something that frustrates us TAs to no end...) to be a driving force, but in reality, it is a resistive force referred to as ""mantle drag"".  This is because the rate of movement of the lithospheric plates is in general, far greater than the rate of convection of the asthenosphere - that is, if they are in the same direction in the first place (which is often not the case!)  However, IF the rate of mantle movement in the area WAS in the direction of plate movement (only an assumption - and this would likely be a rare instance), AND the rate of mantle convection exceeded that of the lithospheric plate, only THEN would mantle drag be considered a driving force.\n\nHope that helps - and hope you don't have a prof that is ""oversimplifying"" things to the point of being in error."

I believe we'll find the remnants of an alien homeworld. Stars don't last long (not meaning Red dwarfs) so really, any advanced alien civilization would have moved away from their homeworld, unless they figured out a way to keep their sun from burning out :) In which case, I hope they'd share that knowledge if we ever met them ;D\n\nBut as you know, anything we see with telescopes is old, so chances are if we spot a world, the aliens there will either be gone (dead, or moved) or still there.

There are so many theories about this issue. String theory, parallel universes, tachyons (btw, tachyons are particles that  seem to be travelling faster than the speed of light) And to answer your question, maybe someday humans will be able to travel to another universe (if such a thing exists) But it would take tens of thousands of years of technological development. Some scientists have actually thought up ideas of how to travel to other universes, like sending nanobots containing human DNA through small wormholes, or building a particle acclerator so massive that it creates a wormhole.

"The fundamental particles of the universe that physicists have identified—electrons, neutrinos, quarks, and so on—are the ""letters"" of all matter. Just like their linguistic counterparts, they appear to have no further internal substructure. String theory proclaims otherwise. According to string theory, if we could examine these particles with even greater precision—a precision many orders of magnitude beyond our present technological capacity—we would find that each is not pointlike but instead consists of a tiny, one-dimensional loop. Like an infinitely thin rubber band, each particle contains a vibrating, oscillating, dancing filament that physicists have named a string.\n\nIn the figure at right, we illustrate this essential idea of string theory by starting with an ordinary piece of matter, an apple, and repeatedly magnifying its structure to reveal its ingredients on ever smaller scales. String theory adds the new microscopic layer of a vibrating loop to the previously known progression from atoms through protons, neutrons, electrons, and quarks.\n\nAlthough it is by no means obvious, this simple replacement of point-particle material constituents with strings resolves the incompatibility between quantum mechanics and general relativity (which, as currently formulated, cannot both be right). String theory thereby unravels the central Gordian knot of contemporary theoretical physics. This is a tremendous achievement, but it is only part of the reason string theory has generated such excitement.\n\nField of dreams\n\nIn Einstein's day, the strong and weak forces had not yet been discovered, but he found the existence of even two distinct forces—gravity and electromagnetism—deeply troubling. Einstein did not accept that nature is founded on such an extravagant design. This launched his 30-year voyage in search of the so-called unified field theory that he hoped would show that these two forces are really manifestations of one grand underlying principle. This quixotic quest isolated Einstein from the mainstream of physics, which, understandably, was far more excited about delving into the newly emerging framework of quantum mechanics. He wrote to a friend in the early 1940s, ""I have become a lonely old chap who is mainly known because he doesn't wear socks and who is exhibited as a curiosity on special occasions.""\n\nEinstein was simply ahead of his time. More than half a century later, his dream of a unified theory has become the Holy Grail of modern physics. And a sizeable part of the physics and mathematics community is becoming increasingly convinced that string theory may provide the answer. From one principle—that everything at its most microscopic level consists of combinations of vibrating strands—string theory provides a single explanatory framework capable of encompassing all forces and all matter.\n\nString theory proclaims, for instance, that the observed particle properties—that is, the different masses and other properties of both the fundamental particles and the force particles associated with the four forces of nature (the strong and weak nuclear forces, electromagnetism, and gravity)—are a reflection of the various ways in which a string can vibrate. Just as the strings on a violin or on a piano have resonant frequencies at which they prefer to vibrate—patterns that our ears sense as various musical notes and their higher harmonics—the same holds true for the loops of string theory. But rather than producing musical notes, each of the preferred mass and force charges are determined by the string's oscillatory pattern. The electron is a string vibrating one way, the up-quark is a string vibrating another way, and so on.\n\nFar from being a collection of chaotic experimental facts, particle properties in string theory are the manifestation of one and the same physical feature: the resonant patterns of vibration—the music, so to speak—of fundamental l"
Efficiency of photovoltaic energy depends on many factors:\n\n- Wavelength of Light: When light strikes the surface of a solar cell, some photons are reflected and do not enter the cell. Other photons pass through the material, some are absorbed but only have enough energy to generate heat and don't create charge carriers\n\n- Recombination: Charge carriers—which are electrons and holes—in a solar cell may inadvertently recombine before they make it into the electrical circuit and contribute to the cell's current.\n\n- Natural Resistance: The natural resistance to electron flow in a cell decreases cell efficiency.\n\n- Temperature: Solar cells work best at low temperatures, but solar cells work with sun light wich increases its temperature.\n\n- Reflection: When light arrives to any surface, a percentage of light will be reflected. A cell's efficiency can be increased by minimizing the amount of light reflected away from the cell's surface.\n\n- Electrical Resistance: Larger electrical contacts can minimize electrical resistance, but covering a cell with large, opaque metallic contacts would block too much incident light.\n\n- Quantum Efficiency: is the ratio of the number of charge carriers collected by the solar cell to the number of photons.\n\nbecause of that silicon solar cell efficiencies vary from 6% for amorphous silicon-based solar cells to 30% or higher with multiple-junction research lab cells (gallium arsenide or indium selenide).\nSolar cell energy conversion efficiencies for commercially available mc-Si solar cells are around 12%.

WELL...AFTER TAKING THE MCAT I FEEL FOR YOU. MY BEST ADVICE WOULD BE TO GET YOUR HANDS ON SOME PRACTICE TESTS AND TAKE AS MANY AS YOU CAN BEFORE YOUR ACTUAL TEST DATE. STAGE EACH PRACTICE TEST EXACTLY AS THE ACTUAL TEST WILL BE ADMINISTERED. I TOOK 8 FULL LENGTH MCAT'S PRIOR TO MY TEST DATE AND EACH TIME MY SCORE ROSE.

Well, I'm doing a bit of U-Pb dating on zircons as part of my thesis, and I think the way to tell is to sort your grains carefully when you are preparing them for isotopic analyses into similar populations.  Then when you run the different populations in your TIMS, and if you get one population that is significantly older than the other populations, you can assume that this population of zircons is inherited.\n\nAnother problem you might run into is magmatic overgrowths of inherited zircons, which you MAY be able to see under an ordinary petrographic microscope, but which may need to be recognized using CRL light or by doing in-situe laser ablation isotopic analyses.  Magmatic overgrowths on inherited zircons which are anlyzed using a bulk method like TIMS will of course give you bad data which would not be concordant - so if your data is not concordant, you might also be dealing with magmatic overgrowth and inheritance.\n\nI'm going to have to deal with all this in a month or so too... so good luck!

Zero.  I'm being a jerk, but for an important reason.  Your question is incomplete.  You can ask two people and have a 95% confidence that the results are representative.  But your margin of error is 75 percent.  That's the part I'm being a jerk about.\n\nIf you're trying to predict an election, 3 or 5% is probably close enough.  But that means a 55 to 45 vote is as likely as a 45 to 55 vote.    And 3% means asking more than 800 people, 5% only 350.  If you sell extended computer warranties and need to know how often their pc breaks, a smaller error is very important.\n\nYou can use an online tool to calculate these figures [click below] or you can skip the Audi TT and go to graduate school to learn how to do it yourself [damn! there was an online tool?].  But this is only an estimate.  The actual figures depend on the question and consistency of the answers.

Tower of Pisa\nThe tilting of the structure is not new. Soon after this 800-year-old campanile (free standing bell tower) was begun, workers noticed a risky inclination caused by soft subsoil. Partial remedies were applied and the architecturally flawed tower was completed about 70 years later.\nOver the centuries the tilt angle of the 56-meter (182-feet) tall Leaning Tower of Pisa continued to increase. Today the top edge lists about 5 meters (16 feet) from the perpendicular, creating a gravity-defying appearance.\nSome experts predict an any-year-now collapse, others believe that the current restoration project will save this world wonder.

"They don't, specifically.  When a mosquito feeds, it has 2 tubes, one to suck blood up to them, and another to pump fluids into you.  One of those fluids is an anti-coagulant (to keep your blood from clotting and keep it flowing freely for them), but the other fluid is a numbing agent so that you don't notice and kill them.  It's because of this numbing agent that you never feel them, you only hear them, and since they're so small and, therefore, quiet, you only hear them when they're next to your ears, making that the only time you notice them.\nSide note:  The bump and itching associated with mosquito bites doesn't show up on everyone.  It's a minor allergic reaction to the anti-coagulant and the numbing agent.  When people say ""mosquitos don't bite/like me"", it's not because mosquitos don't bite them, it's because they're not allergic like most of us, so without getting the bump and the itching, there's no way for them to tell they've been bitten."
The main histopathological feature of Huntington's disease (HD) is the presence of protein aggregates that are gathered into inclusion bodies. So far the mechanisms that lead to inclusion formation as well as their role in the pathogenesis of HD are not totally understood. However, it is well established that inclusion bodies contain components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Accordingly, it has been postulated that impairment of this machinery can be one of the causes of this disorder. In this review, the authors summarize the state of current knowledge about this hypothesis.

"(m)\n\nDoes the thought of quantum physics send a chill down your spine, just like the words calculus, differential equations, and -gasp- organic chemistry? You may not even think that quantum physics is a serious science, like the more familiar Newtonian physics. Just relax! I'm sure you're comfortable with regular physics, which describes the way that matter interacts with other matter, i.e. gravity, velocity, etc. If not, maybe you should check out my regular Interactive Physics site. Anyway, quantum physics is just the physics of the incredibly small. While Newtonian physics can suitably describe the orbit of the planets or the energy transformations during a game of pool, quantum physics describes how electrons surround the nucleus of the atom and other subatomic actions. At this point, you may be thinking that there's not that big of a difference between these two sciences. Hey, both explain how matter interacts with other matter, so what's the big deal? The difference is that the common laws of physics begin to deteriorate on small scales. For example, Nippendenso (Japan Electric) built a car that's only half a millimeters long. One could easily mistake it for a grain of rice if not for its gold color. At the scale of 1 to 1000, physics is already changing. Oil would now gum up the engine, and the tires wouldn't have enough traction to move the car. \n\n\n\n \n Quantum physics tries to explain the behavior of even smaller particles. These particles are things like electrons, protons, and neutrons. Quantum physics even describes the particles which make these particles! That's right; the model of an atom that you were taught in high-school is wrong. The electrons don't orbit like planets; they form blurred clouds of probabilities around the nucleus. Protons and neutrons? They're each made of three quarks, each with its own 'flavor' and one of three 'colors'. Lets not forget the gluons, the even smaller particles that hold this mess together when they collect and form glueballs (not a very original name). Why weren't you told about this already? Were you fluent in calculus when you took general chemistry? The quantum model of the atom is much more complex than the traditional model, so most teachers save that stuff for college. (But this doesn't mean that you can't have a basic understanding and impress your friends!) The reason that quantum physics needs complex math to explain the behaviors and properties of small particles is that the world of these subatomic particles is a very bizarre one, filled with quantum probabilities and organized chaos. For example, the exact position and velocity of an electron is very hard to find because attempts to ""see"" it involve bouncing other particles off of it. By doing this, you've just changed the electron's velocity, so your data is useless. What quantum physics does is give us the statistical probability of the electron's location at any one moment. By learning how these particles act, scientists can better understand the matter which makes up the universe, and the way it behaves (or misbehaves). Quantum physics even plays a part in blackholes, where regular physics is thrown out the window and then some!"
"Not sure exactly what you mean by ""model.""

It is a little difficult to learn in the beginning but it is a very valuable tool.  I believe they still have a free version available at the web site below.\n\nGood luck."

Tropical cyclones can form on both sides of a basin, but there are indeed generally fewer of them the farther east one goes.  As a general rule, the western halves of ocean basins have a larger expanse of warm water that TCs need compared to the eastern sides, which often have large expanses of cool water.  Also, the eastern halves of ocean basins also tend to be regions of dry, descending air, while the western halves have rainier, more tropical conditions.

This is easy to explain, there are multiple intelligences and yours is named: Logical-mathematical intelligence consists of the capacity to analyze problems logically, carry out mathematical operations, and investigate issues scientifically. In Howard Gardner's words, in entails the ability to detect patterns, reason deductively and think logically. This intelligence is most often associated with scientific and mathematical thinking. However, the physic also implies to have: Spatial intelligence involves the potential to recognize and use the patterns of wide space and more confined areas. \nBut you should not feel bad for this because when A. Einstein was a child, he was really bad in math.

you need to have no oxygen nearby.  atmospheric oxygen (O2) gets converted to ozone (O3) in the neighborhood of electrical discharges and high fields.  there's not much way around it except to keep the oxygen away from the electric field.  \n\nyou could do this by putting your tesla coil in a pure nitrogen atmosphere, for instance.

mud puppy, common name for North American salamanders of the genus Necturus, found in rivers and streams throughout the E United States and SE Canada. The name derives from an erroneous belief that mud puppies bark. Like its relative, the European olm, the mud puppy exhibits neoteny, i.e., it reaches sexual maturity without losing its larval characteristics. Adults have lungs, characteristic of most adult salamanders, as well as gills, characteristic of larvae. Their short, sturdy limbs develop at an early stage. The mud puppy may reach a length of 12 in. (30 cm); it is reddish brown and black-spotted above and grayish below, with conspicuous bushy red gills at the sides of its head. It walks on river bottoms and feeds primarily on crayfish and aquatic plants. Mud puppies are classified in the phylum Chordata, subphylum Vertebrata, class Amphibia, order Urodela, family Proteidae.

Staphylococcus aureus (most common), Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis cause bacterial superinfection or bacterial tracheitis. Group A streptococcus, viridans streptococci, gram-negative enteric bacteria, and anaerobes also have been implicated. When S aureus invades the trachea, it causes mucosal ulceration and necrosis, and the trachea is covered with a thick purulent exudate. This increases luminal narrowing and exacerbates the respiratory compromise.

the average distance from the Moon to the Earth is 384,403 kilometres (238,857 miles, why do i say average because the orbit of the moon to the earth is elliptical, so sometimes it is bigger than that number and sometimes it is smaller than that number.  An elliptical orbit is an oval orbit, to say it in shorter words, and instead of having one center it has two, called foci, it revolves around those two points to create the orbit that it travels in.

In a crystal, the positions of the atoms form a regular lattice structure, and the smallest unit of that structure that repeats itself is called a unit cell.  Si(100) tells you that the surface of the wafer is a plane that crosses the x-axis on the surface of a unit cell, and is parallel to the yz-plane.  This information can be used to determine the spacing between atoms on the surface, and their arrangement i.e. square, hexagonal, etc.  From the spacing and configuration, you can determine what materials will form a good interface with that surface-- things with a lattice mismatch of a few percent usually work well.
None of the ideas suggested in the answers so far would result in an end of ALL life on earth. As humans we think of ourselves as important, but in the greater scheme of things we are not. A biog comet impact might wipe out humans, but it would not wipe out life, in fact for many of the surviving species it would be a very poitive outcome, getting rid of homo sapiens, the planets biggest poluters and parasites. The end of lie on Earht is likely to happen when the sun reaches the end of it current stage of hydrogen fusion, this will happen in about 5 billion yeras, so we are hal way there. the sun will at first contract, then as it gets hot enough for Helium to fuse it will expand and become a REd Giant. THIS will end life on earth, effectively. The earth may even be swallowed up as the sun swells to a diameter of around 300,000,000 km which is about the same as the earths orbit (so the earth would be at the surface of the sun).

For the first, if one side is x, then another side would be 9-x (so that they would add up to 18).  The area is then\n\nA = x(9-x)\n= 9x - x^2\n\nTo find the maximum area, take the first derivative and set it to 0:\n\nA' = 9 - 2x\n0 = 9 - 2x\n2x = 9\nx = 9/2\n\nSince the parabola opens down, the maximum area happens when x = 9/2.\n\nSo if x = 9/2, the other side is 9 - 9/2, or 9/2 - it turns out to be a perfect square!  And the area is then (9/2)^2, or 81/4.

Sporophytes are interesting in that the organisms that contain this phase have multi generations of cells.  The sporophyte is created through the union of a male and female gametophyte.  The sporophyte is thus a diploid state in terms of chromosomes.  \nThe sporophyte then divides into another form. The name of this form depends on the organism.  For instance mosses and such have protonemas that eventually develop into gametophores.  \nProtozoa such as the organism that causes malaria become mesophytes.  These forms can continue to make more of themselves (another mesophyte in the case of malaria) or differentiate into gametophytes.  \nThis takes the circle back to where we started.\n\nHope that helps.
You can save a lot of calculation by simply remembering one sentence: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BooleanRing.html .\nThis type of ring is useful in logic because in a logical statement, two true statements yield a true statement when conjuncted or disjuncted and thus the truth function taking statements into their truth value is a homomorphism into this ring.

"I would try to pull out the inherent properties in the problem as they relate to the possible choices.  For example, in this one, we have:\n\nx < 0\n0 < y < 1\nz > 1\n\nFor (a), we are told that x^2 - z^2 is always negative.  In this case, we want to either note that x^2 - z^2 factors into (x+z)(x-z) or that x^2 = (-x)^2.  Both would suggest that we can make x^2 - z^2 ZERO by choosing any x = -z (e.g. z = 2, x = -2) so (a) is immediately shown FALSE.\n\nFor (b), we note that if z > 1, 0 < 1/z < 1 so that we can let y = 1/z.\n\nFor (c), we simply note that the product of 2 nonzero Real numbers can never be zero.\n\nFor (d), we either note that y^2 - z^2 = (y+z)(y-z) so that we have the product (positive + positive)(smaller # - bigger #) = (positive)(negative) = negative or that squaring a positive number less than 1 will only make the number smaller while squaring a positive number greater than 1 will only make the number bigger so that we get smaller # - bigger # = -#.\n\nTherefore some sort of algebraic analysis is usually the fastest way to attack these problems.  Obviously though, seeing all these tricks takes an understanding and familiarity with algebra.  However, many of the algebraic techniques you need for standardized tests is actually captured in this one problem.\n\nIt'll also help to know when to reverse inequality signs.  For this, understanding increasing/decreasing functions is critical.  For example, if you're subtracting 10 from both sides of an inequality, you look at the graph of y = x - 10 and see that it is strictly increasing (i.e. the larger the values you plug in, the larger the ones you get).  Therefore, in this case, you would not reverse the inequality sign.  If you were multiplying by -2 you would see a strictly decreasing graph and would therefore reverse the inequality sign.\n\nIf you need to guess, plugging in values such as -1, 0, and 1 where appropriate are best for counterexamples.  Also in cases with questions such as above as ""which one is false"", look for answers that appear to be broader in scope.  For example, (c) is pretty narrow.  All it says is that xy cannot obtain one specific value so it is likely to be true.  We can also look at the wording for clues.  (b) uses weak wording: CAN (without the never) is not very restrictive, and in fact, it can be argued on a technicality that (b) is never false.  For example, ""pigs can fly"" is true in an imaginative person's dreams.  (a) and (d) both use strong working, but (a) is broader.  x can assume ANY value less than 0 whereas y must be between 0 and 1, exclusively.  Lastly, look for choices that are equivalent.  If x > 0 and x^2 > 0 are both possibilities, we can eliminate both since they are equivalent conditions. and they can't both be TRUE/FALSE when we are only allowed to pick one or the other."
In a simple neutralisation reaction, a strong acid reacts with a strong base to give a simple salt and water.\n\nConsider the two half-reactions involved in neutralisation:\n\nA strong acid(HA) dissociates in an aqueous solution to give H+ and A- ions. Since it is a strong acid, it dissociates to an extent of 100%\n\nHA(aq) = H+(aq) + A-(aq)\n\nA strong base(BOH) dissociates in its aqueous solution to give B+ and OH- ions. SInce it is a strong base, it dissociates to an extent of 100%\n\nBOH(aq) = B+(aq) + OH-(aq)\n\nThe A- and B+ ions stay in the aqueous state. On crystallisation, they form the salt BA.\n\nHowever the reaction mainly involves the combination of H+ and OH- ions to give water. \n\nH+(aq) + OH-(aq) = H2O + 13.7 Kcal\n\nThus, neutralisation is actually the combination of H+ and OH- ions to form water irrespective of the acid or base used.\n\nIn simple neutralisation, both the acid and base dissociate to 100% to give equal moles of H+ and OH- ions, which combine to form water always releasing 13.7 kcal of heat per mole.\n\nOn the other hand, if a weak acid or weak base is involved, some of this heat is used by the weak acid or weak base to undergo dissociation. For example in the reaction between NaOH(strong base) and CH3COOH(weak acid), 0.36 Kcal is used by each mole of acetic acid to dissociate, thus releasing only 13.34 Kcal of heat.
A fish adapted to salt water must have a certain concentration of salt in the water because of osmotic pressure. \n\nThe cells of a fish don't have cell walls, just like all animal cells. \n\nIf a salt water fish is put into fresh water, too much water will rush into its cells.  As you can imagine, this is not too good for the cell. \n\nSome fish are adapted to live in fresh water part of their lives and salt water part of their lives. I really don't know how they do that, but then again, I'm not an ichthyologist.

Yes. Metals corrode when in contact with water for long. They also corrode when in soap water due to the presence of other metal salts in soap water. Soap water can corrode the metal faster than pure water.
Your're seated in the car, and so your body is directly effected by the motion of the car, and thus moves forward when you apply the breaks.\n\nHowever, the helium balloon is simply floating in the air, and it's actions are not affected by the car, but by the air around it. When you brake the car, the balloon doesn't actually move backwards, it pretty much remains stationary (due to the air pressure moving in front of it), and the car moves forward (giving it the balloon the illusion of moving backwards)\n\nWhen the car moves forward, that same air pressure, keeps the balloon in place and helps it move forward. (You may find that if you suddenly press the accelerator and shoot forward, that while your head is thrown against the seat rest, the balloon will actually move forward.)

See another doctor.\n\nThey should probably do a renal ultrasound + dopplers of the renal blood vessels.  Your kidneys are involved in both BP regulation (through water+salt retention) and also RBC production (through erythropoetin secretion).  Damage to the kidneys and/or stenosis of the arteries could do this.  It is also possible that she has something called polycythemia vera which is a pathological overproduction of RBCs (are you by any chance, Jewish?).  It can cause all of the symptoms you described except the high BP.  What else?  Pheochromocytoma (adrenaline-secreting tumor).  This can be checked with a blood or urine test for metanephrines (metabolites of adrenaline).  Other tumors of the adrenal glands (check aldosterone levels).  She may also have a transient cardiac arrythmia that comes, causes her symptoms, then goes away before she sees the doctor (so they wouldn't see it).  If none of these things are the case, it might be worthwhile to look at her brain with an MRI or CT scan.  She probably has increased intracranial pressure, but it's hard to say whether that was caused by the high BP or is *causing* the high BP.\n\nKind of tough to figure out what is wrong with her without seeing her in person....

"""...was a Danish (Scanian) nobleman astronomer as well as an astrologer and alchemist\n\nHe is credited with the most accurate astronomical observations of his time, and the data was used by his assistant Kepler to derive the laws of planetary motion. No one before Tycho had attempted to make so many redundant observations, and the mathematical tools to take advantage of them had not yet been developed. He did what others before him were unable or unwilling to do — to catalogue the planets and stars with enough accuracy so as to determine whether the Ptolemaic or Copernican system was more valid in describing the heavens."""
"When comparing the two models of Ptolemy and Copernicus the main difference between them is that Ptolemy puts the earth in the centre of the solar system, with the sun and planets orbiting it; whilst Copernicus had the sun at the centre, with the earth and the other planets orbiting it.\n\nAs the Heliocentric (sun in centre) is by far the more accurate of the two theories (when considering the solar system), Copernicus did not have to make any huge changes to the basic ""all planets have circular orbits around the sun"" as clearly it almost exactly fits the observed phenomena.\n\nPtolemy had some major problems with retrograde motion when observing the planets - at some times of the year the path of the planets across the sky sometimes reverses and the planet goes ""backwards"" across the sky, only to reverse it's path again later.\n\nPtolemy invented ""epicycles"" to account for these retrograde motions.  These were where each planet rotates around an off-centre point close to itself (see the second source below for a diagram).  But these epicycles still did not accurately explain why sometimes retrograde motion lasted longer than other times.\n\nCopernicus used a heliocentric basis an wrote 7 basic law which accurately described observed phenomena in a simple way.  These were -\n\n1. There is no one centre in the universe.\n2. The Earth's centre is not the centre of the universe.\n3. The centre of the universe is near the sun.\n4. The distance from the Earth to the sun is imperceptible compared with the distance to the stars.\n5. The rotation of the Earth accounts for the apparent daily rotation of the stars.\n6. The apparent annual cycle of movements of the sun is caused by the Earth revolving around the sun.\n7. The apparent retrograde motion of the planets is caused by the motion of the Earth, from which one observes.\n\nHowever, Copernicus' theory could not be proved using the equipment of the time (early to mid 1500's) and the long-term use of the Ptolemy system, combined with the religious implications of the Heliocentric system meant that few people accepted the theory as being correct.\n\nIt took until Galileo's observations of the phases of Venus (around 1610) before there was any clear observational difference between what was predicted by the Ptolemy model and the Copernican model.  These was swiftly followed by Galileo's observation of 4 moons of Jupiter, another blow to Ptolemy."

an oxidation reduction reaction (or redox) is an eqasion in which 2 half reactions take place. one half reaction, oxidation is where the # of electrons in the element reduces and the charge increases. the element with the increasing charge is called the oxidizing agent. the other half reaction, reduction, is where an element gains the electrons given off by the oxidizing agent. the element who gains electrons is the reducing agent and the charge lowers (because electrons have a negitive charge). i hope this has answered your question.

"There are all kinds of particles in the air which someone might consider pollution.  Oxygen, for example.  Anaerobic bacteria consider our clean, breathable air to be horribly polluted with oxygen.\n\nI presume you don't want to remove the oxygen from the air.  We want the air to be hospitable to our own life forms and those which we depend on for our survival.  In that case, we need to continue to advance technologically.\n\nFor most of the earth's 4.6 billion year history, the air has been filled with all kinds of bad chemicals that are toxic to humans.  Only recently (in terms of the earth's existence) has our air been ""clean"" for humans to breathe.  We have no reason to believe that nature will preserve this balance indefinitely, so it makes sense that we have to proactively work to clean our air.\n\nIn order to develop this kind of technology, resources must be available to devote toward such research.  This means we need to stop our governments from siphoning the resources from the most productive (richest) members of society and putting them toward unprofitable uses.\n\nIn areas where pollution is the biggest concern, the quality of air (or water, etc.) becomes more and more valuable to the residents.  They become willing to put more and more resources toward developing technologies to clean the air, which in turn makes it profitable to do.  This is impossible to do when the resources have been stripped from the producers of wealth and put toward failed socialist experiments.\n\nIn short, we need to keep the government out of the economy, because the markets with the most freedom tend to become the wealthiest.  The wealthiest economies are the only ones who can devote resources toward cleaning up the environment.  When people are worried about their next meal, they're not too worried about some abstract theory about the environment 100 years from now."

Scraping a mineral sample on a porcelain plate is used to test the streak of the material.  Some minerals leave a streak of a different colour than you might expect from the colour of the sample itself.  For example, many iron compounds are greyish/steely in colour, but leave a reddish streak.  This can be used as an identifying characteristic.  The porcelain plate can also be used as part of a hardness test, in that a very hard mineral (i.e. diamond) would scratch the plate without really leaving a streak.\n\nAs far as the second question:  C - it describes a quality (the relative size of the sun and Earth), but not a quantity (as the others do), thus it is a qualitative statement.

you are not exactly tasting the metal, as metal molecules are tightly bound. unless you are eating a metal that reacts too easily, like sodium.\n\nmetal keys are usually made of iron, so you are actually tasting impurities like rust mixed with dust, that you think is the metal.\n\ntry tasing a gold or platinum thing that is totally clean. your tongue will probably feel cold, but ther won't be any taste.

I beg to disagree with all the others, because it's not the melanin pigmentation that's responsible for the hair color but the KERATIN glands. MELANIN is for the skin color and KERATIN is for the hair.

I am more inclined to think it was a U.F.O. simply because thats what the government initialy said about the incident with the initial reports.  I don't think the government would in any way not be able to recognize the weather balloon that they later claimed it was. Millions of people claim to have seen U.F.O.'s, so I guess I'd say that I partialy believe there's some form of intelligent life out there that the government doesn't want us to fear, so they cover it up. There's many eye witnesses to the roswell crash site along with a few other areas within a few miles of where the U.F.O. was found.  Another words, I believe that whatever crashed in Roswell was moving at a high rate of speed, and come down from a high altitude. There is also an autopsy video from around the time of the Roswell incident that shows what would appear to be a body of an extraterrestrial being. This video if a hoax was very expensive to produce for the time period.  It also contains many things in the video that fits the time period ie... the clock on the wall, a phone on the wall, the suits they wore, etc...I do believe there is a great chance that a U.F.O. did crashland in Roswell New Mexico in 1947 that the government covered up and continues to hide that fact to this day.

Senile plaques vary in protein composition, both in terms of the types of Abeta peptides and of other proteins found in the plaques. Monomeric Abeta peptides are 39 to 43 amino acids in length and occur in two major forms: Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40.\n\nThe N terminus of Abeta peptides is known to be heterogeneous. In senile plaques, the predominant N-terminal-truncated Abeta peptides are Abeta3-40/42, Abeta11-40/42, and Abeta17-40/42.

I don't think so.  A key event that has to happen for something to become superconducting is the formation of Cooper pairs.  These are loosely bound pairs of electrons that act as a single particle.  Because they are so loosely bound, I think that the vibrations present in materials at normal temperatures will always be big enough to break apart the Cooper pairs and prevent the material from becoming superconducting.
* MRI of head with gadolinium\n\n          o Typical MRI findings support the diagnosis (ie, 50% progress to clinically definite MS within 2 years), but 5% of suspected patients with normal MRI findings similarly progress to MS.\n\n          o T1 shows active lesions (2-6 weeks) reflecting perivascular inflammation and breakdown of blood-brain barrier (BBB). T2 most commonly shows old lesions in periventricular supratentorial white matter, but old lesions occasionally are seen in the cerebellum and brain stem.\n\n          o To visualize the optic nerve, a special MRI technique is required to suppress the fat signal.\n\n          o Acute disseminated encephalitis may be radiographically indistinguishable from MS.\n\n    * MRI of spine with gadolinium\n\n          o For patients with acute transverse myelitis, this is indicated to rule out a compressing lesion.\n\n          o For MS lesions of the spine, a special MRI technique is required to obliterate CSF signal on T2-weighted images.\n\n    * CT scan of the cervical vertebrae: This is used as a screening test for cervical radiculopathy secondary to trauma and for osteoarthritis.
Bees are actually most often attracted by the pattern that is created in the coloring of the flower.  The stronger the contrast between the center of the flower, and the outside of the flower, the easier it is for them to see that they should pay a visit.  You might notice, for example, that bees would be attracted to pansies that have white leaves, but have a purple center.\nAlso, bees are attracted to sweet smelling flowers.  One of the most common white flowers, daisies, are foul smelling, and use flies to pollenate, as opposed to bees.
I'm not sure I understand your question, but if you are talking about when you receive an xray, there is no special formula. The technique used has many variables. Some of the many things to consider when taking an xray... body part, thickness, distance, kilovoltage, milliamperage, seconds, type of tube, type of film, type of screen, and many, many others. Every technique is different. But when someone sets the control panel, they are selecting the kilovoltage peak and the milliamperage seconds.

"One of the difficulties of looking at addictions within a ""disease"" model, is that from a rehabilitative point of view, it effectively absolves the person from any personal responsibility, as they have a ""disease"". Obviously, this is problematic in treatment, as it relies essentially on the person being motivated to change and taking some ownership of the problem, which is not the way the medical or disease model works. In medicine, things are done to people, i.e. they are treated, but when rehabilitating people with dependency issues, the opposite needs to happen, they need to take personal responsibility, otherwise they will go back to using. This is all part of an overall trend over the last 30 years, where medicine (and in particular, psychiatry) has attempted to classify what was previously seen as deviant behaviour and turn it into a ""disease"". It can be argued that this has led to modern psychiatry being more about social policing then actual treatment of mental health problems in the classic sense (such as schizophrenia, depression, etc.). However, as a final point, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that some people do have a physiological vulnerability to becoming addicted to some substances. Hope this helps!"
"A fringe shift is most often referred to in interferometry experiments such as the Michelson-Morley. It is the behavior of a pattern of ""fringes"" when the phase relationship between the component sources change.\n\nA fringe pattern can be created in a number of ways but the stable fringe pattern found in the Michelson type interferometers is caused by the separation of the original source into two separate beams and then recombining them at differing angles of incidence on a viewing surface."

Any gas in too high of a concentration is deadly. Too much oxygen is bad for you too. A lightning bolt creates many times more ozone than the EPA says is dangerous to your health. The biggest lie about ozone is that it is pollution. Ozone destroys polution through oxidation. It is also created when the light from the sun interacts with our atmosphere. If a city is poluted the sun hitting our environment creates more ozone to deal with the polution. There are many good uses for ozone as long as you don't get too much of it. I have constantly been breathing ozone created by machine now for over two years. I have not had an allergy since. If you're getting too much ozone it smells like bleach and starts to irritate your nose and lungs. What may be too much for some may not even register to others.

Um, it depends on what you mean by gas. You can make methane by opening a can of beans and eating it. You can make ethanol which some people might call gas for cars (I call it booze) by fermenting pretty much any organic matter you have around the house from a sack of potatoes to your dirty cotton gym socks. You can set a glass of water on the counter and it will evaporate creating the gaseous form of water.
(x-3a)(x-2a)=0 (don't forget to do the whole equation), so x=3a OR x=2a. This gives x in terms of a. If you want a in terms of x, get a=x/3 OR a=x/2.

Production of healthy germ cells (sperm & eggs) is regulated by specific hormones (chemical signals) in men and women. Infertility can result if there is imbalance in certain hormones and hence can be treated by external hormone supplements. On the other hand changing the body's natural hormone balance, carefully, can be one of the ways of contraception. \n\nFor a quick definition of hormones: please check answers for the question: functional difference of hormone and enzyme?  By lovec27\n\nAs an example, the events regulated by hormones in a woman are mentioned here: An ovary in a woman's body would produce and release (ovulation) one egg a month and her body prepares (uterine wall thickening etc) to receive and nourish the embryo every month. All these normal events as well as pregnancy require several hormone-mediated changes in a woman's body. Some of these hormones are follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estrogen (E), progesterone (P). FSH and LH help the eggs grow and when they rise in quantity, E also increases and this causes ovulation. Later P helps the uterus to grow so that, in case there is fertilization, the embryo can settle on uterus wall and eventually grow into a baby. \n\nMale fertility is also regulated by hormones. While hormone-based contraception is available for women, it has not yet reached success for men.
"The 20/20 ""scale"" is actually a way of saying how good your eyesight is overall. It is a practical test. The patient looks at the special, standard chart from a predetermined distance and the doctor measures how much he can read. There are many factors that determine the result, including myopia, catarract, age etc etc\n\nOn the other hand, diopters measure the ability of the lens to focus on the retina. Nothing else. There can be no conversion from one scale to the other, but someone with myopia will have worse eyesight (20/20 scale) without correction."
Recent scientific testing has proven that plants will grow better no matter what kind of noise is played repeatedly to them. There is no particular kind that works better. It appears to be that the vibrations from sound waves causes certain cells to be stimulated to divide, or certain proteins to form. Only time will tell for sure.

One way this happens is by epigenetic silencing/chromatin remodeling. Your DNA (which contains your genes) is wrapped around proteins called histones that help to organize your DNA and keep it from getting all tangled up. Histones can be acetylated and deacetylated by proteins called HATs and HDACs. These proteins change how tightly or loosely your DNA is wrapped up. When the DNA is more loose the genes can be expressed, but the ones you don't need in adult cells can be very tightly wrapped. A similar thing happens to half of the X-chromosomes in women. In each cell, women express genes off of one or the other of their X-chromosomes, but the other ones becomes tightly wrapped into a structure called a Barr body.

Chemical engineering is the application of science, in particular chemistry, physics and mathematics, to the process of converting raw materials or chemicals into more useful or valuable forms.\n\nChemistry (derived from alchemy) is the science of matter at or near the atomic scale. In this pursuit chemistry deals with the properties of such matter, the transformations of matter and the interactions of matter with other matter and with energy. \n\nEXAMPLE: \n\nThe difference between chemical engineering and chemistry can be illustrated by considering the example of producing orange juice. A chemist working in the laboratory investigates and discovers a multitude of pathways to extract the juice of an orange. The simplest mechanism found is to cut the orange in half and squeeze the orange using a manual juicer. A more complicated approach found is to peel and then crush the orange and collect the juice. A company then commissions a chemical engineer to design a plant to manufacture several thousand tons of orange juice per year. The chemical engineer investigates all the available methods for making orange juice and evaluates them according to their economical viability. Even though the manual juicing method is simple, it is not economical to employ thousands of people to manually juice oranges. Thus another, cheaper method is used (possibly the 'peel and crush' technique). The easiest method of manufacture on a laboratory bench will not necessarily be the most economical method for a manufacturing plant.

Some evolutionary biologists believe that skin tone is directly correlated with UV exposure.  Historically speaking, humans who have lived in relatively 'sunny' places near the equator (e.g. Central Africa), have been exposed to relatively large amounts of UV.  Since fair-skinned humans show a greater increase in mortality in response to increased UV exposure (thanks to skin cancer) than do dark-skinned humans, it logically follows that indivuduals with darker skin should have been more likely to survive in 'high UV' regions.  Natural selection at its best!  \n\nOf course, this theory doesn't explain why fair-skinned people predominate in areas where UV exposures are relatively low.  That is, dark- and fair-skinned individuals should, according to this logic, both have similar survivability rates in an area where UV exposure is not a major cause of mortality.  And yet, in countries like Norway or Scotland, where UV eposures have historically been quite low, ALL natives seem to have extremely low melanin levels.  Do fair-skinned people somehow have increased survivability in these regions?  I suppose it's possible, but I can't quite see how.  Or perhaps natural selection isn't only force at work? I'd be interested if anyone else could shed some light on the issue. :)

"The Roman Year used to start on March 1st so the last day in February was New Year's Eve.\n\nMy understanding is that there always were 12 months, as the word is derived from Moon, which rotates around the earth once every 29 days or so. 12 times and a bit in a solar year.And September is simply the 7th month, starting counting from March as the 1st month. \n\nSo I think the idea that there were ten months is jumbling the facts. December was the tenth month but it wasn't the end of the calendar year, January was then the 11th and February the 12th month.\n\nMarch 1st being the year-start makes it kind of logical to add or subtract days at the end of February. When we added a leap second a few years ago, it was added to the end of the year on 31st December. Our current year-end.\n\nAs far as I know, there was only one change of length of month because of honouring an Emperor. August used to be 30 days long. When they added a day to make it 31 and equal the length of July (to imply Augustus was Julius' equal) and named the month August, it was at this point in time that they changed February from 29/30 days to 28/29 days.\n\nSo before Augustus Caesar's time there were people with birthdays called Feb 30th but nobody with a birthday called August 31st... that date simply did not exist in the calendar.\n\nSo if you asked ""What day of the week was August 31st in BC 100?"" the answer would be that there was no day called August 31st in 100 BC. It is a trick question, like ""What was the next day after September 2nd 1752?"" (in England) to which the answer is ""September 14th 1752!"", because that was the year the Julian Calendar was changed to the Gregorian Calendar and 11 days were lost from September that year."
A geologic 'hot spot' is an area in the middle of a crustal plate where volcanism occurs. The actual hot spot is usually an immense magma chamber below Earth's crust. As the crust moves over the relatively stationary hot spot, a line of volcanos often erupt through the crust. The islands of Hawaii are a classic example of how hot spots work.

Then with your final number they can saposedly read your mind, but really the mathematical formula leads everyone to the same number.\n\nThe other ones are more psychological and statistical, working on the most likely answers a wide range of people will come up with.

The solution is in the units. Before you starting to solve, you should check the units and understand that correctly.\n\nLet's solve the question. \n\n100m/s to km/h;\nif we travel 100m in 1 second then we travel (3600*100)m in a hour. \n!!!Because 1 hour is equal to 3600 seconds.!!!(Eq.1)\n\n360000m is equal 360km. \n\n!!!Because 1000m is equal 1km.!!!(Eq.2)\nSo your first question's answer is 360km/h\n\nNow, using the information above we convert 60km/h to m/s.\nWell, 60 km is equal 60000m. (Eq.2)\n60000/3600= 16,67m/s (Eq.1)\n\nLet me ask a question. What is the 717 miles/h in m/s?
Because ammonia is a base. The structure (NH3) allows it to accept a proton, becoming NH4+.
"Basic Answer \nThe circumference of the Earth at the equator is 25,000 miles. The Earth rotates in about 24 hours. Therefore, if you were to hang above the surface of the Earth at the equator without moving, you would see 25,000 miles pass by in 24 hours, at a speed of 25000/24 or just over 1000 miles per hour. \n\nMultiply by cosine of your latitude to see how fast the Earth is rotating where you are. \n\nEarth is also moving around the Sun at about 67,000 miles per hour. \n\nAdvanced Answer \n\nIf by ""turning"" you mean the rotation of the Earth about its axis (where axis just means the straight line between the North and South poles) it is quite easy to figure out how fast any part of the Earth's surface is moving. \n\nThe Earth rotates once in a few minutes under a day (23 hours 56 minutes 04. 09053 seconds). This is called the sidereal period (which means the period relative to stars). The sidereal period is not exactly equal to a day because by the time the Earth has rotated once, it has also moved a little in its orbit around the Sun, so it has to keep rotating for about another 4 minutes before the Sun seems to be back in the same place in the sky that it was in exactly a day before. \n\nAn object on the Earth's equator will travel once around the Earth's circumference (40,075.036 kilometers) each sidereal day. So if you divide that distance by the time taken, you will get the speed. An object at one of the poles has hardly any speed due to the Earth's rotation. (A spot on a rod one centimeter in circumference for example, stuck vertically in the ice exactly at a pole would have a speed of one centimeter per day!). The speed due to rotation at any other point on the Earth can be calculated by multiplying the speed at the equator by the cosine of the latitude of the point. (If you are not familiar with cosines, I wouldn't worry about that now, but if you can find a pocket calculator which has a cosine button you might like to try taking the cosine of your own latitude and multiplying that by the rotation speed at the equator to get your own current speed due to rotation!). \n\nThe Earth is doing a lot more than rotating, although that is certainly the motion we notice most, because day follows night as a result. We also orbit the Sun once a year. The circumference of the Earth's orbit is about 940 million kilometers, so if you divide that by the hours in a year you will get our orbital speed in kilometers per hour. We are also moving with the Sun around the center of our galaxy and moving with our galaxy as it drifts through intergalactic space!"

"Its equivalent to proving\nm*n = (lcm(m,n) ) * ( gcd(m,n) )\n\nNow, i'll have to use basic number theory. The idea is to show that the number of times a prime factor of m*n occurs on the LHS is equal to the number of times a prime factor of (lcm(m,n) ) * ( gcd(m,n) ) occurs on the RHS.\nNote : LHS = Left Hand Side\n       RHS = Right Hand Side\n\nFor any prime factor p of m*n, call it p. Now say p occurs to the power of h in m and power of k in n. That is to say m ""contains"" p^h while n contains p^k. Note that h,k are nonnegative integers. \n\nNow, in lcm(m,n), we would choose p^ [ min(h,k) ] while\nin gcd(m,n) we would choose  p^ [ max(h,k) ]   \nNote that min (h,k) means minimum of h and k, similarly  max (h,k)means maximum of h and k . For example, if h=2 and k=3, then min (2,3) = 2. while max(2,3) = 3. If say h = k, then obviously in both lcm and gcd of m*n we choose p^h to be in its product. This is true for EVERY prime factor of m*n.\n\nSo, consider the product (lcm(m,n) ) * ( gcd(m,n) ).\nFor EACH prime factor p of m*n, we have shown above that it occurs as { p^ [ min(h,k) ] } * { p^ [ max(h,k) ]   }, that is our RHS product contains \n  p^ [ min(h,k) +  max(h,k) ] = p^(h+k)\nNow, in our LHS, p occurs as p^h * p^k = p^(h+k) too!!!\nThus, we have shown for each prime factor, p of m*n, it occurs as the same product in both the LHS and RHS. And thus\nwe have LHS = RHS. Done.\n\nOne question may circle in your mind, that is how i know that [ min(h,k) +  max(h,k) ] = (h+k)\nWell, this is a fact.\n\nFurther, if you want to show it, consider 3 cases.\n\nCase 1. ( h = k)\nHere min(h,k) = min(h,h) = h\nand  max(h,k) = max(h,h) = h\nSo, [ min(h,k) +  max(h,k) ] = h + h = 2h.\nAnd (h+k)= h + h = 2h.\n\nCase 2. ( h < k)\nHere min(h,k) =  h, because h is smaller.\nand  max(h,k) = k, because k is bigger.\nSo, [ min(h,k) +  max(h,k) ] = h + k \n\nCase 3. ( h > k )\nHere min(h,k) =  k, because k is smaller.\nand  max(h,k) = h, because h is bigger.\nSo, [ min(h,k) +  max(h,k) ] = k + h"

Evolution explains this easily, we evolved from furry ancestors, the parasite is responsible for our current state.  Creationism has no explanation for why God would have created us with a broken gene, with a parasite, neither of which we actually want.\n\nOne gene we do want is a Vitamin C gene.  Untold masses of people have died throughout history due to lacking a way to make their own vitamin C.  But, we do have one.  It's just broken.  Our primate ancestors lived in fruit rich environments, making their own vitamin C was an unnecessary waste of energy, so a mutation killing the gene was a good thing.  Humans do *not* always live in such areas and a vitamin C gene would have saved many, many lives.  But instead, we have one broken, broken in EXACTLY the same way that a chimpanzee's is broken.  Why were we created wtih a broken vitamin C gene?  Why is it broken *exactly* the same way as a chimp's?

Scientists can piece together the motion of the continents from species distribution, creationists are left only with pretending it isn't enough.\n\nAs far as the ""missing"" link goes, this is primarily a press bugaboo.  There is no singular missing link.  Rather, we have a wide series of very non-missing links.  Classic case in point:\n\nhttp://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/compare.html\n\nHere you can see a list of some of the fossil skulls scientists claim are links between humans and the rest of the apes.  Creationists have to pretend that there are no transitions, each of those fossils is either ""obviously"" human or ""obviously"" ape.  But when you look at what they say is ""obviously"" what, you'll see they cannot even agree on which skulls are ""obviously"" which.  If it was really obvious, wouldn't they agree?  Wouldn't they come *close* to agreeing?\n\nThe only thing obvious about that chart is that the skulls really do seem to be transitional and creationist demands for a supposedly missing link are nothing but the equivalent of sticking one's fingers in one's ears and yelling, ""DOES NOT"" to make the evidence go away."
palaeolatitude - the position, relative to the equator, of a geologic or geographic feature at some time in the past. The evidence of the position may come from palaeoclimatic data or palaeomagnetic determination.\n\ncolatitude - the latitudinal didtance from the pole, i.e. 90degrees - latitude.
Krypton has 36 electrons.  It's atomic number is 36 which means it has 36 protons.  Because atoms have the same number of electrons (negative charges) as they do protons (positive charges) then it must also have 36 electrons.\n\nDon't get atoms confused with ions - an ion is an atom that has a positive or negative charge... meaning that it has more or less electrons than it does protons.\n\nAn atom can't have more or less protons without it becoming something else.  If Krypton had one more proton it would be rubidium, if it had one less it would be bromine.\n\nBy the way, kryton (or Kryten) was a character in the TV series Red Dwarf and he would have had squillions of electrons.
Do you mean nimbostratus ???\nNimostraus clouds bring us rain!
Yes, no doubt about it. The rain tree is an angiosperm plant/tree and hence it bears flower. It is a quick growing tropical and subtropical tree and has huge size.\nScientific name is- Samanea saman or Pithecolobium saman.\nIt bears tiny pink flowers in groups. The stamens of each flower are numerous, have length greater than the flower it self and attractively colored.They collectively render the flowers very attractive.\nIt is a good avenue tree and planted along the road side for shade.\nIt provides an abode for millions oh very tiny insects.Very often they drench those who take shelter beneath the tree with their liquid droppings and hence the name Rain Tree.

Are you talking about Aurora Borealis (northern lights)?
Temperature in space is a relative notion, since temperature is really just a measure of molecular activity. In space, molecules are so far apart that they rarely collide with one another, and therefore exchange very little heat.
It all depends on which summer you're referring to.  The season begins on the 21st of June in the northern hemisphere while it begins December 21st in the southern hemisphere.  While for my oldest son, as well as many other children in the area, summer begins with the end of their school day on the 30th of June.  For me, summer is when summer ice begins and I begin to work hockey camps for kids to adults in early July.  And to others, summer begins when it gets hot outside.  To many, it already is summer.

Studies have found that the hormones a foetus is subjected to before birth may well play a part in determining the person's sexuality in later life.\nThe hypothalamus, a small lobe that hangs down at the base of the brain and is linked to sexual intercourse, has been found to play a significant role. In a study it was proved that the size of the hypothalamus in homosexual men is more alike to the size of a heterosexual females, not a heterosexual male. As the hypothalamus develops before birth it can be argued that homosexuals were 'born that way'. \nAlso there is statistical evidence to state that homosexuality can be hereditary. It can be passed through the female line (for example, gay man (who has a sister) has a gay nephew through her, and then this gay nephew would in turn have another gay nephew through his sister and so on down the family tree). This means that a homosexual gene is probably passed on through the X chromosome.\nWith all this evidence it seems doubtful that the origins of homosexuality are anything other than biological, and people who believe otherwise like that guy at that top... urban something are just showing their ignorance.\nhope that answers your question!
Most mammals have promiscuous mating systems; however, in the case of the lion, promiscuity is prevented by the complex pride unit.  Within a pride, lions are promiscuous, but since the pride limits the number of females and males available for mating, lions are termed as being polygynandrous.  This means that each male mates with multiple females and each female mates with multiple males.  Nearly all reproduction in lions is done by the resident prides.  So, if you’re not in a pride…you’re not mating (Bertram 1975).  Mating within a pride is first come first served.  Since there is no dominance hierarchy amongst males or females, no mate selection is found to occur (Viljoen 2003).
There is a layer, called the heterosphere, in which the earth's atmosphere has varying composition. As the altitude increases, the atmosphere is dominated successively by helium, molecular hydrogen, and atomic hydrogen. The precise altitude of the heterosphere and the layers it contains varies significantly with temperature. The heterosphere generally extends from about 55 miles altitude right up to the edge of outer space. Surely you don't want somebody to figure out the changes in gravity over that entire range.
In mathematics, a weird number is a natural number that is abundant but not semiperfect. In other words, the sum of the proper divisors (divisors including 1 but not itself) of the number is greater than the number, but no subset of those divisors sums to the number itself.\n\nThe first weird number is 70, because its proper divisors are 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 35; which sum to 74, but no subset of these sums to 70. The number 12 is abundant but not a weird number because the proper divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6; which sum to 16, but 2+4+6 = 12.\n\nThe first few weird numbers are 70, 836, 4030, 5830, 7192, 7912, 9272, 10430, ... (sequence A006037 in OEIS). It has been shown that an infinite number of weird numbers exist, and the sequence of weird numbers has also been proven to have positive asymptotic density.\n\nIt is not known if any odd weird numbers exist; if any do, they must be greater than 1018 (as noted by Bob Hearn in a July 2005 posting to the SeqFans mailing list).\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_number

Every body has an inherent tendency to continue in its erstwhile state of rest or uniform motion when no external force is acting on it. therefore, bodies start to move, speed up, slow down or stop only when an external force acts on them and forces them to do so. for example, a ball rolling on the ground slows down and then stops because the force of friction acts in a direction opposite to the direction of motion and therefore decelerates it.\nThis is newton's first law of motion.
In a vacuum (assuming the water didn't boil) the water level of the bowl and the bottle would be equal. However, the air pressure on the water in the bowl pushes the water up and back into the bottle. It's a constant battle between gravity and air pressure, which is determined by the surface area of the water in the bowl.

It is very tightly controlled these days - it used to be that you could neutralize the acids with bases and put them down the drain (not any more).\n\nChemical machining by its nature dissolves large quantities of metals into acids.  These days an elaborate system is setup to precipitate all the metals out of solution down to the parts per million level, and then any waste acid that can't be recovered is sent to an incinerator.  Nothing is allowed down the drain, and the EPA is watching what comes down the drain very closely - the will sue you if you dispose of any heavy metals down the drain.
If you coat a copper penny with zinc at room temperature, nothing interesting happens.   The zinc just lies around on the copper substrate.   If you heat it, the atoms start vibrating and some of the zinc and copper change places, and you get a solid solution of copper and zinc, which is the alloy brass.
"""ksi"" is the abbreviate of 1000 pounds per square inch, used when psi (pounds per square inch) uses very large numbers.

According to most computers, it's 'NaN'. Which is a symbol that stands for 'Not a Number', or 'stop asking me silly questions'.\n\nTechnically, x / y mean 'What is the number that, when you multiply it by y you get x?' So 0 / 0 means 'What is the number that, when you multiply it by 0, you get 0?'. To which the answer is obviously 'Any number you like.'

Most people would probably relate this to physics, but I deal more with the electromagnetism of paranormal activities. I have seen watches stop. The freakiest one was on a camping trip, we felt a spirit near the bon-fire. We had a ring of 40 tiki-torches around the bonfire. It was a still and windless night, but all the tiki flames near the spirit bent in. One of the people in the circle had a fancy camera. After the campout she went to get the film developed, and all the photos from before the visitor turned out, but after that all the film was blank. She took the camera in to be repaired. The repairman asked if she'd been in a nuclear power plant. All the innards were fried from electromagnetism
well lightning dosent directly strikes and reaches ground. Its a electronic discharge and needs electrons to pass on energy. These electrons are in air. A single electron passes its energy to nearby electron. this way lightning moves, so it cud be not a straight line but a curve path also as electrons can transfer energy to other electrons in any direction. so sometimes its zigzag pattern also.

Probably has something to do with mating instincts.  Whether a chemical change, or a light-by-night cue they all probably head to shallow water and sand at the same time to make it easier to find a mate.  Jellyfish and squid come close to shore in large numbers at certain times for the same reason.
The output frequency of an alternator (AC Generator) will be directly proportional to it's speed. Common speeds for 60 Hz generators is 1800 RPM and 3600 RPM. The same generator would generate 50Hz if run at 1500RPM and 3000RPM.
Photoelectrochemical devices for conversion of solar energy into both electrical energy and chemical energy are discussed with emphasis on how the various material properties of the photoactive electrodes influence device efficiency and stability. The similarity between photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) and solid state devices is used to model their behaviour and optimize such parameters as band gap, doping level, minority carrier lifetime, etc. A model is presented which calculates the electron affinity of any semiconductor and allows the prediction of the open circuit voltage of wet photovoltaic cells and optimum biasing forchemical producing cells. The effects of absorbed ions at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface are reviewed. The temperature dependence of the energy levels in the semiconductor and the electrolyte are considered and the implications of these results to operation of PECs at elevated temperature are discussed. The major differences between PECs and solid state devices are the stability considerations.

Details??\nFor details a good references is given by one before me.\n\nConcept:\n\nHydrates of carbon are carbohydrates.\nThis is why the ration of H & O is always 2:1\nGeneral formula of carbohydrates is CnH2nOn where n is a natural number.\n\nThere are different carbohydrates.\nThe basic unit of carbohydrate is known as sacride.\nOne sacride unit may contain 3, 4, 5 or 6 carbon atoms. So for 6 C atoms the formula will be C6H12O6.\n\nThese sacride unites in pure form are known as monosacrides. Glucose is one example.\n\nSome times two or more monosacride units combine to form a big molecule. In such cases the compounds are referred as di sacrides or tri sacrides etc. Sucrose (sugar) is a di sacride.\n\nSome times monosacrides form long chains such as cotton. These are called polysacrides.
Einstein comprehended that time is relative.  From the perspective of the living ... it would appear to be millions of years (or maybe not, given world events just now), but from a metaphysical point of view time is different.  It is not too difficult to understand that, relatively speaking, we could die and find ourselves at the Day of Judgement almost instantaneously.  If you're looking for an absolute truth on this question the answer is that nobody knows.

"Where to begin?\n\nI guess first I'll say there is no such thing as ""electricity"", as far as some tangible resource you can store and generate.  There is charge, voltage, and current, and the only one you can truly store is charge (but with charge, you can create a voltage difference, which can, in turn, create current).  \n\nSecond, the link given above is to someone posting an idea they had about storing lightning with capacitors.  It has not been done and, to the best of my knowledge, is unfeasible.  Storing the energy (not the charge) from the lightning strike is much more feasible, but still not likely to happen for a long time.  \n\nIn short, if YOU were thinking of collecting lightning, storing the charge, and then using it to power your home, you can't do it, and you'd be well advised not to try.  If some brave researcher were to have been able to store a few kilojoules from a lightning strike at some point, I wouldn't be too surprised, but at this point, it's just not happening."

Stem cells in animals and humans are primal undifferentiated cells that retain the ability to divide and differentiate into some, or all other, cell types. (The equivalent in higher plants are meristematic cells.) Stem cells have the potential to act as a repair system for the body, because they can divide and differentiate, replenishing other cells as long as the host organism is alive.\n\nFor more information about stem cell, u should visit:\nhttp://stemcells.nih.gov/

Further, int(3692/10)*10=3690.\n""*"" means times.\nThe rule is: to find the number following a number, let the\nfirst number be N, then the following one is\n\nint(N/10)*[N-int(N/10)*10]  for example,\nWhen N is 3692 then the rule translates to:\n......369*[3692-(369)*10]=\n......369*[3692-3690]=\n......369*2=738"
A mean is an average. You get a mean by adding several numbers together, and then didviding it by how many numbers you added up. For example, to get the mean of 60, 55, and 50, you would add them to get 155, and then divide by three.
I think all atomic clocks are synchronized with each other.
You really have to look at average bond enthalpies.\n\nThe average bond enthalpy for breaking a CH bond is around 416 kJ/mol, whereas the average enthalpy for breaking a CC bond is around 348 kJ/mol. As a result, CC bonds are weaker and break more readily.

I don't think that the Earth is as small compared to the sun as a golf ball compared to the Earth itself. \n\nI would say a Red Supergiant, one like Antares, the alpha star in Scorpius, would be much like the Earth when the Earth is compared to a golf ball.\n\nNew!:\nI just received the information from Wikipedia.com and I did some calculations. \nthe diameter of a golf ball is about 0.00004 km, \nthe diameter of our Earth is about 12756 km,\nand the diamter of Antares is about 924000000 km. \n\nSince calculating the volume requires us to cube the radius (let us ignore the pi and 4/3 for simplicity's sake since in ratio, they don't matter). So:\nthe cube of the radius of the golf ball is 8 x 10^(-15) km cubed,\nthe cube of the radius of our Earth is 2.6 x 10^(11) km cubed,\nand the cube of the radius of Antares is 9.9 x 10^(25) km cubed. \n\nWe can get a brief idea of their sizes by comparing the powers of 10: \n\ngolf ball -> Earth is\n1 -> 100000000000000000000000000\nEarth -> Antares is\n1 -> 100000000000000\n\nSo Earth is far bigger than a golf ball than Antares is than Earth (at least from my calculations). \n\nNow, returning to the questions, I would say something 1000000000000 times the size of Antares, probably a nebula.

A ligament is a short band of tough fibrous connective tissue composed mainly of long, stringy collagen fibres. Ligaments connect bones to other bones to form a joint.\n\nCartilage is a type of dense connective tissue. Cartilage is composed of cells called chondrocytes which are dispersed in a firm gel-like ground substance, called the matrix. Cartilage is avascular (contains no blood vessels) and nutrients are diffused through the matrix. Cartilage is found in the joints, the rib cage, the ear, the nose, in the throat and between intervertebral disks. There are three main types of cartilage: hyaline, elastic and fibrocartilage. The main purpose of cartilage is to provide a framework upon which bone deposition could begin.

A eunuch is an infertile human male whose testicles have either been removed (deliberately or by accident) or are otherwise non-functional. The earliest records for intentional castration to produce eunuchs are from the Sumerian city of Lagash in the 21st century B.C. Over the millennia since, they have performed a wide variety of functions in many different cultures such as courtiers or equivalent domestics, treble singers, religious specialists, government officials, military commanders, and guardians of women or harem servants.

The definition that the other two gave is correct, a mutation that has no effect on reproductive fitness, also, on a more concrete level, a neutral mutation also refers to a mutation that causes a change in one amino acid in a polypeptide chain that doesn't have an effect on the function of the protein.  Often this occurs when one amino acid is replaced by a chemically similar one, which could be caused by a single base pair mutation.

The earth is tilted on its axis as it orbits the sun.  In the months where the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun it is in summer and the southern hemisphere is tilted away from the sun and is in winter.  The other two seasons are the transitions between summer and winter.  The further north or south you go (closer to the poles) the more extreme the difference in conditions between summer and winter.  At the equator, there is very little difference between the seasons.
Cancer is the result of an accumulation of many different mutations that cause cells to grow out of control.  Skin cancer has a different set of mutations than brain cancer, for example, and so they are distinct at the molecular level.  Not only that, but the cells themselves are often already differentiated, so skin cancer is really an unchecked growth of skin cells, whereas the brain cancer is an unchecked growth of brain cells, etc.

He piloted a craft from Niburu to Earth to look for gold to mine and grind into a powder to form an orbiting cloud of gold dust, probably to protect its atmosphere from dissipating into space anymore than it already had from its very elliptical solar orbit. Consult Zacharia Sitchin's ""The 12th Planet""."
"Manifold is a Germanic/Old English word that means, simply, ""many folds.""  In today's language, it generally means many folds, forms, or features.  I would say the two uses of the word you mentioned are both perfectly reasonable.  Exhaust manifolds are structures that have multiple inlets/outlets (hence, many features).  In topology, manifolds are, in general, surfaces with many features."

Not invading the planet. They have always been here. They will come out in a couple of years and make their selves public. They are here using energy and many of them want the natural resources and free energy that the Earth provides. There are different aliens that are highly advanced.

Why do you think the gov. spends millions and billions each year on alien research and space each year.
The longest I've ever stayed up is about 36 hours, but people can stay up a lot longer than that.\n\nEven staying up just a few hours later than you normally go to bed you start to have decreased cognitive function, blurry vision, etc.  That stuff increases the longer you stay up.  \n\nThere's never been a documented case of a healthy person dying from sleep deprivation, but rats die after about 28 days without sleep.  People with a certain type of genetic insomnia sometimes die after several months without sleep.\n\nThe longest people have stayed up in monitored experiments is 10 days, and they had less memory and concentration and stuff after a long time without sleep, but no serious health problems.
To fly you need thrust and lift.\nUsing engines(turboprop, prop.,Ramjet,Scramjet,turbofan, etc) would provide you with thrust and the shape of the wing provides you lift.

they most likely mean nothing. This appears to be one of many heretical documents created during the reign of THeospacy in England. Since many of the documents were formed by the process of 'ghost writing' (relying on spritual impulses or dreams to form content) random infomration can appear more significant than intended.\n\n-Intresting note: SOme of the names have been changed from the orginal document, according to the footnotes, based on further 'translation' of the heavenly language. It would appear that the names are suppose to have meaning in the language of 'heaven' which some teoshpists and today's new-agers belive would give them mystic power if they could learn to speak it.

There is such a thing as a matrix plot, which is a way to display all possible two-way scatter plots (in this case, it's 5!/(2!3!) = 10 different scatter plots).  I posted a link below to see what a matrix plot looks like.\n\nOf course you really can't see a normal distribution on a scatter plot.  If you add up the students exams or take the mean, you can draw a histogram of the data to get an idea what the distribution looks like.  It's possible that they are normally distributed, but it depends on the exams and the skill level of the class.  If one exam is easy, then its distribution would be skewed to the left (meaning it has a left tail), which would not be normal-looking.  Same thing with hard exams except those would be skewed to the right.  Then also, since classes are not selected randomly and the tests are different, you cannot be assured that the Central Limit Theorem will hold for the means, especially since you are only taking the means of 5 tests, but it is possible that you will.

"Steel is not an element, like oxygen, or a chemical compound, like water, but an alloy of iron and carbon, in which the two substances are mixed together physically, but not bound by any fundamental interaction.  So the limiting factor in steel manufacturing is the amount of iron available in easily mineable and refineable state.  Iron is one of the most common elements on earth, composing some 5% of the earth's crust.  \n\nDue to its high availability, and the fact that iron is not created nor destroyed in the steelmaking process, it is not exactly accurate to think of it as a question of how much steel is ""left"", but how much can be profitably exploited at current price levels.  The answer to that question is ""a lot"".\n\nEl Mutun in Bolivia is the richest provider of iron ore in the world, and it alone contains 40 billion tons of reserves.  For conmparison's sake, world consumption of Pig iron, the basic conponent of most steel, hovers around 500-600 million tons.  So El Mutun alone contains enough iron ore to provide 60-80 years of steel consumption."

Planck was one of the people who was thinking of energy as being delivered in discrete amounts or bundles.  This was one of the clues that lead Einstein to conclude in his 'Photo-electric Effect' experiments that, again, energy was being absorbed at only very specific frequencies and possibly in specific bundles of energy.\n\nThen you get to thinking of light as photons to carry the energy and materials seem to only absorb special kinds of bundles of energy and some guys in Stockholm start thinking that energy changes in atoms occur in discrete quanta.  Neils Bohr and friends were trying to come up with equations to describe the orbit of the electron around the nucleus and put some of the Planck stuff together with the Einstein stuff and came up with the idea that electrons could only change orbits according to the energy quanta that they absorbed and emitted.\n\nFrom all this we get the basics of quantum mechanics, sub-atomic orbital mechanics, lasers, fluorescent lights, bunches of stuff :).

Sound actually passes through water pretty well--that's why Navies use sound to find submarines.  In general, lower frequency sounds travel further. I seem to remember reading once that humpback whale songs, which are at very low frequencies, can be heard across entire oceans, but I'm not sure that's true.\n\nYou might think sound doesn't penetrate through water well because sound does not move well from air to water (or vice versa). Sound tends to bounce off surfaces where materials of different densities meet. So, if you're underwater, it's very hard to hear things above water.

"Oooo, that's a good one, and thanks, because I was going to ask a similar question.\nDid you ever look at a fan as you were walking towards it? If you take a heavy step, or stomp, the fan blades will appear to stutter, or freeze for just a second. Sort of a strobe effect.\nI think that this is related to the ""bounce"" in the computer monitor, which is also presenting moving images (at 60 or 120 cycles).\nMy theory = which has not been confirmed - is that we are seeing a mental/psychological response to momentary interruption of the visual ""signal"" transmitted to the brain. The brain sort of smooths over the gap in signal, which results in a freeze-frame, in the case of the fan, or a bounce, in the case of the monitor.\nI think the cause of this might be that vision is a chemical process in the rods and cones of the retina. A thump, produced by chewing or stepping, might cause a momentary change in the chemical reaction. \nAnyway, I like your question ... it shows genuine curiousity about why things are the way they are ... which is the basis of good science."

In physics, a force is anything that causes a body with mass to accelerate--intuitively, a push or a pull. The net (or resultant) force is the sum of all the different forces acting on a body.\n\nQuantitatively, force is a vector quantity defined as the rate of change of momentum induced by the force, and therefore has a direction associated. The SI unit for force is the newton.\n\nExamples...\n\n- a person holding a dog by a rope experiences the force applied by the rope on his hand, and the cause for its pulling forward is the force transmitted by the rope.\n- while standing still gravity pulls downwards, but the floor pushes upwards, and the net force is zero.

To produce vacuum, a venturi pump uses a transducer, which forces compressed air through a small opening into a venturi section. As air exits the opening, it expands, increasing in speed to supersonic velocity before entering the venturi section. This creates vacuum, or negative pressure, at the vacuum inlet port which is located between the opening and the venturi section.

Try the keywords substitution reactions of naphthol on yahoo. Here is a little of what I found:\nDiazonium ions are present in solutions such as benzenediazonium chloride solution. They contain an -N2+ group. In the case of benzenediazonium chloride, this is attached to a benzene ring.\n\nIn this set of reactions of the diazonium ion, the -N2+ group is replaced by something else. The nitrogen is released as nitrogen gas.\n\nThis is a good example of the use of diazonium salts to substitute things into a benzene ring which are otherwise quite difficult to attach. (That's equally true of the previous reaction, by the way.)\n\nIf you add potassium iodide solution to the benzenediazonium chloride solution in the cold, nitrogen gas is given off, and you get oily droplets of iodobenzene formed.\nThere is a simple reaction between the diazonium ions and the iodide ions from the potassium iodide solution.\n\nI found this information at the sources listed below-try it out.

What causes lightning?\nLightning originates around 15,000 to 25,000 feet above sea level when raindrops are carried upward until some of them convert to ice. For reasons that are not widely agreed upon, a cloud-to-ground lightning flash originates in this mixed water and ice region. The charge then moves downward in 50-yard sections called step leaders. It keeps moving toward the ground in these steps and produces a channel along which charge is deposited. Eventually, it encounters something on the ground that is a good connection. The circuit is complete at that time, and the charge is lowered from cloud to ground. \nThe return stroke is a flow of charge (current) which produces a luminosity much brighter than the part that came down. This entire event usually takes less than half a second. \n\nWhat causes thunder?\nThunder is caused by lightning. The bright light of the lightning flash caused by the return stroke mentioned above represents a great deal of energy. This energy heats the air in the channel to above 50,000 degrees F in only a few millionths of a second! The air that is now heated to such a high temperature had no time to expand, so it is now at a very high pressure. The high pressure air then expands outward into the surrounding air compressing it and causing a disturbance that propagates in all directions away from the stroke. The disturbance is a shock wave for the first 10 yards, after which it becomes an ordinary sound wave, or thunder. \n\nThunder can seem like it goes on and on because each point along the channel produces a shock wave and sound wave.
"Thunder is the sound of the shockwave caused when lightning instantly heats the air around it to up to 30 000 °C (54 000 °F). That super-heated air expands rapidly, then contracts as it cools. The rapid expansion/contraction generates sound waves, making the sound that is called ""thunder."""

In the early Universe matter was so hot, that protons and electrons were still roaming freely and had not yet combined into atoms. This state is called the plasma state of matter, and can be found on the sun too.\n\nIn a plasma, photons are constantly absorbed and reemitted in a process called Compton scattering. The sun is therefore opaque to light: we can not see *inside* the sun, we see only its surface. The early universe was opaque to light too. However, after the Big Bang the Universe was cooling down rapidly due to the expansion. Eventually, when the temperature fall below 3,000 K electrons and nuclei combined to form atoms and the primordial plasma turned into a neutral gas. This process is called as photon decoupling. \nWith only neutral atoms present the photons can travel largely unimpeded. \n\nThe photons that were emitted at recombination, the first that can travel freely are called First light.

If lot C is 5000 more than lot B then lot C = x + 5000 + 5000\n\nSo lot A = x\n   lot B = x + 5000\n   lot C = x + 10000\n\nThe total of this is 3x + 15,000 and this equals 60,000\nSo if 3x + 15,000 =60,000   then 3x = 45,000 \nso x = 15,000 which,as you can see from the above is lot A.\n\nWhich shows that the book is correct.\n\nTo complete the problem B = 15,000 + 5,000 = 20,000\n                        C = 15,000 + 10,000 = 25,000\n\n25,000 + 20,000 + 15,000 = 60,000 correct!

I have only recently began to try my hand at electronic voice phenemon.  My first time out we went to the Gnadenhutten, OH - Movarian Indian massacre site (now a park). Across the street from it is a cemetery.\n\nAnyhow, we took an Olympus digital recorder set on manual record. My fiance' and son went out and took pictures and I started talking into the recorder.\n\nWhen we got home we were shocked at the results. I got some very strong EVPs from that location.\nThere was a lawn mower going over in the cemetery so I think that worked as white noise. Since then I haven't had quite as good of luck but I have managed to get a couple of others.\nThe best results I have gotten I had something electrical in the back ground.  I have tried recording with no white noise and not gotten anything. But I'm so new at it I can't say that you defintely need or don't need white noise.\n\nI do know that you should say Hello and talk as if you believe you are talking to someone.\n\nYou should record for only a few minutes at a time. When playing back its easier to analyze small chunks rather than an hour or so.\n\nIf you are recording talk in a normal voice and if something happens in the distance like a car drives by or a dog barks, say something on the recorder about it so you aren't trying to remember if thats real or an EVP.\n\nDon't listen to the recordings til you are done with the site. Its best to listen to them in a quiet place that you are comfortable with - in case there is someting on there that shocks or frightens you.\n\nAlways be respectful. Do not taunt or torment anyone or anything.\n\nNot all spooky, old places are haunted. Not all cemeteries are peaceful.\n\nIf you'd like to hear my EVPs, please feel free to IM me and I will send a link to them. They are on Putfile.com.

Applies to other senses as well. If you stare at a picture for long enough it also tends to lose it's meaning. Everything only has meaning when it is put into context with something else, how it interacts with other objects. Take an object out of it's normal context, isolate it and it loses something. Take that same object and place it with objects that it would normally never be seen with and it takes on a whole new meaning, this was the idea of the art movement of Surrealism and a mechanism for exploring the technique of lateral thinking. When a word is repeated over and over it loses it's meaning because the brain kind of 'loses interest' in it's normal activity of associating the word with other words and meanings leaving it with nothing but the literal input of the sound of the word itself.

First, this is a chemistry question, not biology.\n\nSecond, any solvent can hold more in suspension when it is hot.  Basically, hot water can dissolve more detergent, and more detergent can pick up more dirt particles.\n\nThird, any substance like oil or grease will have a lower viscosity at higher temperature and therefore flow more freely. This will allow the water to rinse it away more easily, independent of detergent. That's why you run hot water to rinse greasy pans; otherwise, the grease would tend to accumulate in the drain pipes and cause a clog.\n\nNOTE: If your question is about sterilization, only water above 180 degrees Farenheit will do the trick.

"Science is not sure about the real nature of space. It's an old question: If you remove *everything* from inside a glass, would the walls touch each other? So can you remove space from inside the glass?\n\nIs a vacuum really empty? We know that there are on a quantum level things like so called vacuum fluctuations. The uncertainty of energy and time allows it for a very short ammount of time to borrow energy from nothing to create a pair of a particle and it's antiparticle, if they annihilate fast enough and give the ""borrowed"" energy back. This is experimentally confirmed and happens all the time.\n\nSo we can not create a vacuum as the ""absence of everything"".\n\nIn cosmology scientists had the idea of a ""false vacuum"" which would be a vacuum which is not in the lowest possible energy state. So you see even the word vacuum is not as simple as it seems.\n\nThe problem is, as you have realized: We don't know what space is made of, especially on a microscopic level. We need to ""marry"" quantum mechanics with Einsteins general theory of relativism, which would give a quantum theory of gravitation.\n\nUp to now no one was able to do that, there are some fundamental problems. But we have some approaches, one is for example the quantum loop theory which says that space on a very microscopic level has a foam like structure, another one are the super string theories, which say that particles are vibrating strings in a much higher dimensional space (the higer dimensions hve not ""unrolled"" and are attached to every point in space), but none of them has been experimental tested up to now.\n\nSo the answer to your question is simple: We don't know, but we're working on that."

Get a piece of wood, some nails, and some identical rubber bands. Hammer a row of nails into the wood at one end. Hammer nails at varying distances from the first row (such that one pair of nails is really far apart, the next a bit less, and so on.)\n\nStretch the rubber bands between each set of nails. Pluck them. See how they sound different? That's because they're vibrating at different frequencies. If you have a piano, figure out which note each of them is playing. If not, don't worry. Look up some basic information on sound (the shape of a sound wave, how they're transmitted) and write a couple of paragraphs on sound frequencies and pitch. \n\nIf you're feeling particularly interested, you could also look up what range of frequencies the human ear can hear, or what harmonics are. Since you've left it last minute, though, I doubt you're that keen. :)

"It would be more proper to ask, ""What is the mass of planet Earth?""1 The quick answer to that is: approximately 6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (6E+24) kilograms. \n\nThe interesting sub-question is, ""How did anyone figure that out?"" It's not like the planet steps onto the scale each morning before it takes a shower. The measurement of the planet's weight is derived from the gravitational attraction that the Earth has for objects near it. \n\nIt turns out that any two masses have a gravitational attraction for one another. If you put two bowling balls near each other, they will attract one another gravitationally. The attraction is extremely slight, but if your instruments are sensitive enough you can measure the gravitational attraction that two bowling balls have on one another. From that measurement, you could determine the mass of the two objects. The same is true for two golf balls, but the attraction is even slighter because the amount of gravitational force depends on mass of the objects. \n\nNewton showed that, for spherical objects, you can make the simplifying assumption that all of the object's mass is concentrated at the center of the sphere. The following equation expresses the gravitational attraction that two spherical objects have on one another: \n\nF = G * M1 * M2 / R2 \nR is the distance separating the two objects. \nG is a constant that is 6.67259x10-11m3/s2 kg. \nM1 and M2 are the two masses that are attracting each other. \nF is the force of attraction between them. \nAssume that Earth is one of the masses (M1) and a 1-kg sphere is the other (M2). The force between them is 9.8 kg*m/s2 -- we can calculate this force by dropping the 1-kg sphere and measuring the acceleration that the Earth's gravitational field applies to it (9.8 m/s2). \n\nThe radius of the Earth is 6,400,000 meters (6,999,125 yards). If you plug all of these values in and solve for M1, you find that the mass of the Earth is 6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilograms (6E+24 kilograms / 1.3E+25 pounds). \n\n1 It is ""more proper"" to ask about mass rather than weight because weight is a force that requires a gravitational field to determine. You can take a bowling ball and weigh it on the Earth and on the moon. The weight on the moon will be one-sixth that on the Earth, but the amount of mass is the same in both places. To weigh the Earth, we would need to know in which object's gravitational field we want to calculate the weight. The mass of the Earth, on the other hand, is a constant."

I assume you want the values of x and y?\n\nTop triangle hypotenuse:\nsqrt( (y-4)^2 + 16 ) \n\nTop triangle vertical leg:\ny-4\n\nFull triangle hypotenuse:\n12\n\nFull triangle vertical leg:\ny\n\nBy similar triangles\nsqrt( (y-4)^2 + 16 ) / (y-4) = 12 / y\n\nMultiply by (y-4) and y:\ny sqrt( (y-4)^2 + 16 ) = 12 (y-4)\n\nSimplify:\ny sqrt( y^2 - 8y -16 + 16 ) = 12y - 48\ny sqrt( y^2 - 8y ) = 12y - 48\ny sqrt( y (y-8) ) = 12y - 48\n\nSquare both sides:\ny^2 * y(y-8) = (12y - 48)^2\ny^4 - 8y^3 = 144y^2 - 8*144y - 48^2\ny^4 - 8y^3 - 144y^2 + 8*144y + 48^2 = 0\n\nNow just solve for y, and from there it is easy to solve for x...\n\nAfter a bit of playing with an Excel spreadsheet, I'm getting the following pairs:\n\nx = 6.680915, y = 9.968218\nx = 9.968218, y = 6.680915\n\nNotice how these are symetric answer depending on whether x is a long leg or y is a long leg.  Double checking the answers we get:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 12\nsqrt((x-4)^2 + 4^2) + sqrt((y-4)^2 + 4^2) = 12\n\nThe two solutions are therefore:\nx = 6.680915, y = 9.968218 (y is the long leg)\nx = 9.968218, y = 6.680915 (x is the long leg)\n\nIf you assume y > x, then the first solution is the only solution.
Which Columbia river? The fact is using hydroelectricity is a wonderful resource, until you think about the fish.

"From the supine (laying down position) to the standing positions, there are several changes that occur. When supine, the blood is all at the same level as the heart, and as such, all has the same gravitational potential energy. This means the heart doesn't have to work as hard to pump it. When someone stands up, the blood ""falls"" down, and Baroreceptors in the aorta (among other places) cease to be stimulated. This means there will be less inhibition of the RVLM (Rostral Ventral lateral Medulla). Less inhibition means more activity, and the RVLM is part of the Vasomotor Center (along with the IVLM, CVLM and NTS) which is responsible for speeding the heart rate, raising blood pressure, and increasing blood flow. This response is momentary, as once pumping increases, flow is maintained, and the heart rate can return to normal."

"""The Orange Moon"" \n\n\nHave you ever wondered why the moon is more orange or yellow in color when it first rises at night. This effect is caused by the atmosphere of the earth. The reason for the orange color is due to the scattering of light by the atmosphere. When the moon is near the horizon, the moonlight must pass through much more atmosphere than when the moon is directly overhead. By the time the moonlight reaches your eyes, the blue, green, and purple pieces of visible light have been scattered away by air molecules. That's why you only see yellow, orange, or red.\nThe moon can have an orange color at any time of the year. Sometimes the moon appears orange even when it's directly overhead. This occurs when there's a lot of dust, smoke, or pollution in the atmosphere. The size of those particles will determine the type of color you will see. \nViewing Cause And Effect  \nLook first at the white moon directly overhead. See the red part of the arrow pointing to the white moon? This red part of the arrow shows the part of the atmosphere we are looking through to see the moon. Now look at the orange moon just rising in the east. Look at the blue portion of the arrow pointing to the orange moon. See how much longer the blue line is than the red line. This shows that we are looking through about three times as much atmosphere at a rising or setting moon.    \n\nHarvest Moon Colors  \nAt times the moon might look red, orange or even blue. The moon appears to be certain colors during certain times of the year. For instance, the Harvest moon during the fall appears very large and orange. There are two reasons for this, the moon's path across the sky, and the climate of earth. During certain times of the year, the moon will rise and set at different angles. Sometimes the moon stays really low in the sky and never reaches an overhead position. The earth's atmosphere also goes through certain changes at certain times of the year. \nIn some months, the atmosphere has more dust particles than usual; in other months, the atmosphere contains a lot more cloud particles than usual. Extra particles in the atmosphere mean more scattering of light. In the fall, many farmers are harvesting their crops. Lots of dust from the soil of the crops gets disturbed. The dust floats into the atmosphere. At the same time, the moon is lower in the sky during the fall season. So if there's more dust in the sky and the moon is closer to the horizon, then what color will the moon be? Orange! That's where ""Harvest Moon"" gets its name."
Sheer volume. When a river flows into the sea, it takes time for the waters to mix. While they are mixing, their salt content will vary. Also, various currents exist within the oceans, separated by temperature, which also affect salinity. The whole system is controlled by gravity, wind, and solar energy. Very complex, but also quite interesting. You might want to pick up an oceanography text if the subject interests you.

Actually, most fish do have teeth, but the number varies greatly depending on what kind of fish you're talking about, what species, and even what age the fish.  The numbers go from zero to tens of thousands.\n\nFor example: The great white shark has 46 teeth in its Front Row Dentition, but there are any number of teeth behind each of those teeth ready to take their place should the front tooth be lost.  The cownose ray usually has seven series of teeth on their dental plate in each jaw.  Each series has 11 to 13 rows exposed and functional at any one time, fitted into an interlocking pavement of hexagonal, pentagonal and tetragonal shaped flat grinding surfaces.  \n\nSome fish not only have teeth along their jaws, but also in the bones on the roof of their mouth (vomerine teeth), and along gill rakers.\n\nFor rabbits, most of them have 2/1 incisors (2 top, 1 bottom), 0 canines, 3/2 premolars and 3/3 molars for a total of 28 teeth.  One genus(Pentalagus - the Amami rabbit found only a small island off Japan) has one fewer upper molar on each side, so they have only 26 teeth.\n\nIn toads, the number of teeth is also variable depending on species, but in most the number of teeth is set for each species.  It is often used as a characteristic to define a species.  Often the teeth of many frogs and toads are very small, barely more than spicules, and not easily visible to the naked eye.

Statement a is true.  B is not true, as distinct great circles (which are the lines of spherical geometry) intersect at two points which are antipodes of one another.  C is not true for the reason you observed, as is D.  Thus A is the only statement that can be true.  Of course, we have to understand what a segment is in spherical geometry.  In Euclidean geometry, a line segment is that portion of a line which falls between two points (this is an informal definition, by the way.)  What is true about line segments in Euclidean geometry is that they are paths of minimum distance between their endpoints.  In other words, every other path between two points is longer than the line segment between them.\n\nArmed with this knowledge, lets talk about segments in spherical geometry.  They will be portions of lines (great circles) between two points.  Notice that, given any two points on a sphere, there is at least one great circle that passes through them (if these points are antipodes, there are infinitely many!)  Here's one difference between Euclidean and spherical geometry:  on a sphere, there are two line segments between these points.  Draw a circle and put two points at random on the circle:  you'll see both segments right in front of you.  One of these will be of shorter length that the other (unless you picked antipodal points, in which case the line segments will be of equal length.)  \n\nSo, what does this have to say about shortest distance?  Great circles are what as known as geodesics, which are constructed as paths which minimize distances between points on a space.  Straight lines are the geodesics of Euclidean space.  This isn't trivial to show.  So A is somewhat true, in that it is true that the shortest distance between two points on a sphere is given by a line segment (portion of a great circle.)  It is not true in that any line segment is the shortest distance between those points.

Carl Linnaeus: He was the founder of the Modern Botany and the most lauded botanist of all time. He was born in Sweden in 1707. He traveled throughout Europe and America, collected thousands of plants and described them in great details.          He wrote numerous botanical works. Amongst these, Species Plantarum (Don’t confuse with Planetarium that deals with stars and planets.) published in 1753.\nHe was first to introduce Binary Nomenclature or the binomial nomenclature for all the living things. In this method, each of the living beings is known by a single scientific name through out the world to avoid any confusion in communication. The name itself consists of two parts. First is the generic name and the second is the specific name, hence the name binomial nomenclature. This method is in operational practice even today. (i.e. more than two centuries!). All human beings in the world are Homo sapiens (man the clever one). These names are written in italics, the generic name begins with a capital letter and the specific one with a small letter.\n     The other contribution of this great botanist is regarding the classification of living plants. He introduced Sexual System of plant classification. The basic principle of the system is as follows:-\nIn order to adapt themselves to the changed environment, plants may change their outward form or morphology, but; when it comes to reproduction, they are more conservative or orthodox and do not change the process of reproduction so easily.\n     If, therefore, the system of classification is based on their salient modes of reproduction then it will have a very sound base.\n     This reasoning is so accurate that all the systems of plant classification that are in vogue in different parts of the world are based on this principle only.\n      Thus, Carl Linnaeus will eternally be remembered in the scientific world for his Binomial Nomenclature and Sexual System of Plant Classification.\n      The Linnaean Society in London was founded in 1788 to honour him.

The clouds appear for the same reason that clouds always form, namely, that the air has cooled to the point that the ambient water vapor condenses.\n\nThe first site explains in detail why the clouds are merely an effect of aerodynamics and pressure and not a literal visualization of a barrier penetration. The second link explains it further and then provides links to some really cool pictures of the effect.
A perfect bell curve indicates that the data is normally distributed, with the mode equal to the mean. Also, virtually all of your data (99.7% to be exact) will lie within three standard deviations of the mean.\n\nIn laymen's terms, most of the data hovers around the average with very few extreme values (outliers).

If you look at the half reactions taking place within an electrolytic cell,\n\nCathode, reduction:\n2 H2O (l) + 2 electrons --> H2 (g) + 2 OH- (aq)\n\nAnode, Oxidation,\n2 H2O (l) --> 4 H+ (aq) + O2 (g) + 4 electrons\n\nSo you can see tha for every 2 moles of electrons (AKA, 2 Faradays of charge), 1 mole of Hydrogen gas is produced.\n1 Faraday of charge = about 96485 Coulombs of charge.\n\nA current of 1 amp means that every second, 1 Coulomb of charge is flowing into (and out of) your cell.\n1 amp = 1 C / s\n\n\nYou can take this and do the conversions yourself to taylor it your specific conditions and in what units you want to use.
The terminology is at fault due to convention here.  When we say 'weight' in terms of how fat we are, we actually are measuring mass when se state it in kg or pounds and stone.  Sticking to the SI system of units (kg), we use Newtons 2nd law of motion:\n\nF=m.a\n\nHere: F is the force in Newtons\n      m is the 'mass' of the subject\n      a is the acceleration field the mass experiences.\n\nThe accelerating field here on Earth is typically 9.81m/s/s.  Thats the gravitational acceleration due to the cumlative effect of the earths mass.  However, many people round this figure reasonably up to 10 m/s/s.  This in turn means that a mass of 1 kg would result in a force of 10 Newtons here on Earth (using the 10 m/s/s) approx).  Therefore your 'mass' of 70 kg would have a force of 700 Newtons here on Earth.\n\nTypically we take the Earths acceleration field due to gravity for granted and thus refer to all mass measurements on Earth as 'weight'.\n\nTherefore, to summarize, on Earth, your mass is 70 kg, its weight is 700N and its effective force due to the earths gravitational field is also 700 N.\n\nGet confusing.. its got good reasoning in physics to be refered to as mass rather than the inaccurate weight.\n\nHope that helped.

"The word paper comes from the ancient Egyptian writing material called ""papyrus"", which was woven from papyrus plants. \n\nPapyrus was produced as early as 3000 BCE in Egypt, and in ancient Greece and Rome. Further north, parchment or vellum, made of processed sheepskin or calfskin, replaced papyrus, as the papyrus plant requires subtropical conditions to grow. \n\nIn China, documents were ordinarily written on bamboo, making them very heavy and awkward to transport. Silk was sometimes used, but was normally too expensive to consider. Indeed, most of the above materials were rare and costly.\n\nArcheologically, true paper had been excavated in China dated from the 2nd-century BC. It spread slowly outside of China; other East Asian cultures, even after seeing paper, could not figure out how to make it themselves. Instruction in the manufacturing process was required, and the Chinese were reluctant to share their secrets. The technology was first transferred to Korea in 600 and then imported to Japan by a Buddhist priest.\n\nAfter further commercial trading and the defeat of the Chinese in the Battle of Talas, the invention spread to the Middle East, where it was adopted in India and subsequently in Italy in about the 13th century. They used hemp and linen rags as a source of fiber. The oldest known paper document in the West is the Missel of Silos from the 11th century."

first of all the universe is inside a black hole.\n\nOn a scientific level as i believe in science not god, i make no apologies for my beliefs and you are welcome to your own.\n\nIn the beginning our universe was a star, it imploded and became a black hole, then a giant bounce it turned inside out, so its expanding not contracting as a normal sense of a black hole would. Therefore as we are inside a black hole, you cannot get out of it, nothing can escape the gravitational forces.\n\nAnother weird theory, is we are living in a much bigger item, the sun is one mere neucleus in a atom the planets are electrons around this, the galaxy is the molecules .... its possible just unlikely.\n\nTo get to the other side of the universe in an expanding universe is to stay still, dont move, eventually its edge will meet you.

Your question is not too different from asking if the chicken or the egg came first. The problem is that you can not talk about time without talking about changing events, and you can not talk about changing events without talking about time. They are inseparable.\n\nBTW, time does not flow. That is a figure of speech. In physics, no one refers to time as a flow. Particularly after Einstein proved that time is relative to each observer and is a function of their velocity.

An algebraic approach is easiest.  First, write everything in terms of sin & cos.  This gives:\n\n1/cosx - sinx = cosx + sinx/cosx.\n\nAlways check square roots to make sure there are no negative numbers inside it (not applicable here) and another place is to look at denominators to make sure that\nthey are not = 0.  You have a cosx term in the denominator, so set cosx = 0 and solve for x.  In this case, x = + or - (2n+1)pi/2 (or, the odd multiples of pi/2).  Where the denominator = 0, the function has a vertical asymptote and that will be a restriction.  In other words, you can't use those values.  In this case, you can't use the odd multiples of pi/2.  Anything else is okay.\n\nRestrictions occur where a function is not defined, such as under a sqrt where the quantity can't be negative, logx, where x cannot be 0 or negative, and places where the denominator = 0.  Those are the places to look for restrictions.  Let me know if this isn't clear.

When I look at problems like these, I use the two-point formula. Since y is decreasing by a constant amount each time, it's ok to use the two-point formula. Basically, you choose two points...I'll choose (0,1) and (1,-8). Then, you calculate the slope, which is (y2-y1) / (x2-x1). It doesn't really matter which y or x comes first as long as they are correspondent with each other. So, the slope would be (-8-1) / (1-0), which is -9/1, which is -9. Then, plug it back into the equation y = mx + b. So, I'll use the point (0,1). 1 = -9(0) + b. 1 = 0 + b. b = 1. As a result, the function is...y = -9x + 1
You mean butane. It's a hydrocarbon that they use in lighterfluid as well as for portable blowtorch/soldering irons. It's chemical formula is C4H8 or (CH3)(CH)2(CH3)in a more longer form (all those numbers should have been subscripts by the way).
Acetone peroxide is one of the few explosives that can be quite easily made from materials that can be readily bought with no questions asked. For this reason, many young fools who know little about the chemistry of the reaction have attempted making it. With little knowledge on the topic, the chances of injury or death become much, much, higher. \nAcetone peroxide appears as a white powder to the unobservant eye. However, it is actually a crystalline compound. Acetone peroxide (or AP, as it will hereby be referred to as) can be ignited with a flame or spark, and will then deflagrate at an explosive rate. This deflagration produces hot gasses that are capable of bursting relatively strong containers, which makes it apparently a good explosive for firecrackers.AP can also be detonated with a blasting cap. If a sufficient shockwave is sent through it (the shockwave needn’t be very powerful), the AP will detonate and therefore decompose at a significantly faster rate than when deflagration occurs. What this basically means is that, when detonated by a blasting cap, AP will explode much more powerfully.\nThe one main downfall of AP is its sensitivity. It is one the most sensitive explosives commonly manufactured. This downfall is the very reason that makes AP so dangerous, and is why so many of the “fools” that attempted making it have been badly injured, or even killed. A small amount of AP will detonate if tapped with a hammer on a hard surface. If stepped on it will go off under the weight of a human. The truth of the matter is, AP is no toy. It should be taken seriously before manufacture, during manufacture, and after manufacture.\nThere are three chemicals needed to make acetone peroxide. If searched for, one can often find them at common stores, at least in the US.\nYou will also need a 600ml beaker, or similar glass container. You will also need a graduated cylinder, plastic or glass. It should go up to 50ml, unless you’re not using a beaker with measurements, in which case it should go up to about 100ml. You will definitely need an alcohol or mercury thermometer. It should have a Celsius scale that goes down to less than zero and goes up to more than 40. You will also need something to stir with. If you can get a glass stirring rod, then use that. If you cant get one, use the thermometer to stir. You definitely want something glass or wood, preferably glass. You don’t want plastic or metal, unless its plastic made for stirring chemistry mixtures. You’ll need a funnel, and some filter paper. A coffee filter works great.\nProcedure:\nPour 500ml of 3% hydrogen peroxide into the beaker \nPut the beaker in an ice bath (a larger bowl filled with ice and cold water, and often salt) until it cools to about 5 degrees Celsius. This might take awhile, but be patient. \nPour 60ml of acetone into the peroxide, and stir until thoroughly mixed. As a general rule of thumb, when using 3% hydrogen peroxide, you should use 5 times as much peroxide as acetone. Measure out 15ml of acid. This is quite a bit, considering the other amounts, but through testing it has been found that more acid will catalyze more ingredients faster, and better. You can use as little as 5 or even 3ml, but to be safe, 15ml works great. Once you’ve got it measured out in the graduated cylinder (that should have a spout), pour the acid very slowly into the mixture, a couple drops at a time, while constantly stirring. The temperature of the mixture should never go above 10 degrees Celsius. If it gets to about 8 or 9 degrees C, stop pouring the acid and keep stirring until the temperature gets back to normal. Keep doing this until all the acid is in the mixture. \nKeep stirring for about 5-10 minutes. \nThen place the beaker (with the ice bath, if possible) into a refrigerator, making sure the temperature is kept below 10 degrees C. Keep it in there for 24-48 hours, the latter preferably. Stir periodically. After about 12-24 hours, you should start to see

"Urine:\n\nUrine is the byproduct or fluid secreted by the kidneys, transported by the ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored until it is voided through the urethra. It is a transparent solution that is clear to amber in colour, and usually is light yellow. Urine is made up of a watery solution of metabolic wastes (such as urea), dissolved salts and organic materials. Fluid and materials being filtered by the kidneys, destined to become urine, come from the blood or interstitial fluid. The composition of urine is adjusted in the process of reabsorption when essential molecules needed by the body, such as glucose, are reabsorbed back into the blood stream via carrier molecules. The remaining fluid contains high concentrations of urea and other excess or potentially toxic substances that will be released from the body via urination. Urine flows through these structures: the kidney, ureter, bladder, and finally the urethra. Urine is produced by a process of filtration, reabsorption, and tubular secretion.\n\nUrine contains large amounts of urea, an excellent source of nitrogen for plants. As such it is a useful accelerator for compost. Urea is 10,000 times less toxic than ammonia and is a byproduct of deamination (2 NH3 molecules) and cellular respiration's (1 CO2 molecule) products combining together. Other components include various inorganic salts such as sodium chloride (the discharge of sodium through urine is known as ""natriuresis"".)\n\nFaeces:\n\nApproximately 75% of an ordinary sample of human feces is water. This percentage changes; diarrhea has more water than average and the longer the piece is in the bowels, the more water is taken out. Of the remaining 25%, 1/3 (or about 1/12 of the whole) is dead bacteria. Another 1/3 of the remaining quarter is undigestable food, such as cellulose.Common undigested foods found in human feces are seeds, nuts, corn, and beans, mainly because of their high fiber content."

First of all: time is directly related to space in a way.  According to special relativity, time and space both dilate with gravity and speed.\n\nAlso, to give the specific location of an object, time should be included.  For example, if I say to meet me at the corner of the street, it would be unlikely that you would find me because I did not mention when.\n\nTime is not a spacial dimension.  Travelling back in time isn't possible due to many things, such as thermodynamics.  Basically, time can slow down, and even stop, but not reverse.  The why isn't clear to me, but I haven't seen a plausible way for time travel to occur.\n\nThis hypercube thing uses extraspatial dimensions which are theorized to exist.  The difference here is that it is a spatial dimension, not time.  There are supposedly up to 13 different dimensions in which this fourth dimension could be.

This is a leftover from the old, old days of computers, as in the 1980's.  Back then, a computer just had a fixed number of 'ports' that you could plug printers, modems, mice, etc. into.  USB and firewire are much much better, so most new computers don't have them, but you might see trapezoid shaped connectors with 9 or 25 little metal pins on some PCs.\n\nEach port on the computer had a name, like COM1:, PRT:, and so on.  These names referred to the hardware connections, so they couldn't be used to name a file.  For instance, one way of printing things then was just to copy a file to the printer:\n      copy file  PRT:\nCON was one of these devices...it represented the screen and keyboard.  So, you could display a file on the screen by copying it to CON:, and record keyboard input by copying CON: to a file.  \n\nIf you're comfortable in a command prompt, this still works.  Try doing\n   copy some_file CON:\nand you'll see the file contents on the screen. Try\n   copy CON: filename\nand you'll be able to type directly into a file.  Be careful, this will erase the file if it already exists. (Hit Ctrl-Z when your done).\n\nMicrosoft has a real devotion to backwards compatibility--that is, they try to make sure things that worked with old versions of Windows still work with new versions.  This is kind of taking it to extremes, since any program that uses this would be 20+ years old now.
White noise, similar to white light, is the equal comination of all frequencies of sound or electromagnetic signal.\n\nSometimes white noise is used to mask or hide other sources of noise.

"Sexual reproduction is just better for generating lots of species ... i.e., it increases the adaptation of new organisms to changes in environment, and creates new organisms that can move into new environments.  Whether it is more or less *likely* to originate than asexual reproduction is irrelevant.  (Most of the history of life was without it.)  What matters is that, once it does occur, it is *very* effective at generating *lots* of new organisms that have it ... and it can way outpace asexual reproduction in populating the world with new species that have it.\n\nThis is not to say that asexual reproduction can't work quite well for many organisms that continue to thrive and produce new species through occasional mutation.  But the type of widespread variation and *inventiveness* we see in much of the plant kingdom and all of the animal kingdom, is a direct result of sexual reproduction.  (And I use ""inventiveness"" metaphorically, as I would use the word ""beautiful"" ... I of course don't mean ""deliberate invention"", but just that sexual reproduction can produce 20 different solutions to a problem of survival, 2 or 3 of which survive long enough to branch out new species.)\n\nIn other words, (and this is the key) we see way more sexual than asexual reproduction in plants and animals only because it is *so* effective at generating new species.\n\nOh, and to address your original question, evidence ... the evidence that sexual reproduction arose from asexual organisms includes (1) the fact that the two have exactly the same genetic machinery (same DNA, same orientation of double-helix, same codons, A, C, G, T, same amino acids, same proteins); (2) the fact that the genes themselves have a huge amount of commonality (% of shared genes); and (3) the fact that the amount of this commonality is always consistent with a common-descent model (the % of genes in common between humans, apes, salamanders, sponges, and amoebas don't all have to have a sensible proportions that point to genetic ""distance"" from each other ... but they do)."

Magnets are always dipoles. Always. This is Maxwell's second law of electromagnetism (Div B = 0). The divergence of a magnetic field always equals 0.\n\nThe magnetic moment would decrease for each part of the magnet, but the sum would remain the same. Magnetic moment equals pole strength times separation distance. Each individual magnetic moment would be unchanged, but the sum for each part would be less, and the total sum would be the same.
take benzene and treat it with CH3COCl in AlCl3(Friedal crafts acylation)\n\nAnd then to the benzoyl chloride formed, perform bromoform reaction.\ni.e. NaOH/Br2\nand then CBr3 will form with benzoic acid.\n\nHope this helps.
a) Let f(kx+l)+b = x^2-2x.\nThen (kx+l)^2+b = x^2-2x.\nThen k^2x^2 + 2klx + l^2+b = x^2-2x.\nThen k^2 = 1, 2kl = -2, and l^2+b = 0.\nSo k = 1 or k = -1.\nIf k = 1, then 2l = -2, so l = -1 and (-1)^2+b = 0 so b=-1.\nIf k = -1, then -2l = -2, so l = 1 and 1^2+b = 0 so b = -1.\n\nSo either k = 1, l = -1, and b = -1\nor k = -1, l = 1, and b = -1.\n\nb.  I'm not sure how to do that.
Where are you using the circuit breaker ?\nin a house panel the circuit breaker is max sized by the wire and mim sized by the load at 100%. Unless the load is a motor then the c/b is oversized 115% or 125%.  the reason is the starting current of the motor and if it has a 60 or 90 C rating. Please read the (Nationa Electrical Code 2005) for more information.

"Today, elevators are built under strict supervision of the Building Codes. Model Codes which are the standard in most US jurisdictions require compliance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers' (ASME) standards for the installation, maintenance, and inspection of elevators. In Canada, the governing authority is the CSA (Canadian Standards Association). In addition other related standards are likely required to be complied with as specified by Local Authorities Having Jurisdiction.\n\nElevators are generally sold in prepackaged components which are inherently non-proprietary. All of the four major manufacturers sell proprietary microprocessor controls. Each manufacturer provides similar product designs, and the overriding issue for purchase is usually price and availability. In the case of renovations, the use of non-proprietary controls has become a large part of that business because it allows the owner to offer the maintenance contract to multiple bidders rather than accept a single manufacturer for the life of the elevator which can be more than 30 years. In some large campus type properties, the use of non-proprietary equipment in new construction has replaced the standard prepackaged product. Non-proprietary systems generally have a higher up front cost, but may be offset by allowing the owner to control the long term costs over the life of the elevator.\n\nIn some locations, the shaft and parts of the cab are made of transparent material for specialized ""Scenic elevators."" This allows riders to see outside the cab as they travel on the elevator. Some locations take advantage of this transparent material by placing the elevators along the walls of their building. This allows riders to see the outdoor environment as the cab runs along the side of the buildings. An example of this is the CN Tower in Toronto, Canada.\n\nToday, all new elevators are computer-controlled and microprocessor based. This allows the elevator system to place cabs where they are most needed in the interest of smooth running, with behavior based on analysis of building use called ""Traffic Studies."" Traffic Studies are done by professional elevator consultants who use specialized tools to determine the optimum size, speed and number of elevators for a building based on its peak use periods. Computer control also permits greater control of access to various floors of a building after hours and on weekends. Methods of access control include card readers, keys, and access codes entered into the control panel of the elevator.\n\nElevators are usually installed in a building during construction. Renovations may consist of replacements for hoistway (floor landing) doors, car doors, interior cab finishes, controls, hoist machines, hydraulic pistons and hall fixtures. At times renovations may also include replacement of the entire cab itself. In many instances the upgrading of components may require additional code compliance, these issues should be reviewed with an elevator consultant prior to the purchasing of new materials."
The equation is that of a straight line, which in slope intercept form becomes y = (3/5)x - 2.  So one ordered pair is (0,-2) and there are an infinite number of others - any that make the equation true.  Take X=5 and you get Y= 1, so (5,1) is another ordered pair.
In Game theory you don't have to start with a lot of plausible scenarios and then go selecting the best one. You build up from a few initial assumptions. In terms of computing, that means reduced memory requirements.

well, if you got c2 from e=mc2 then its actually c^2 or the speed of light squared.\n\nso m=e/c2  and because F=GMm/r^2 and F=ma.  so a=gM/r^2.  and the m cancle out, so if there is a realationshiop then it is probably very remote and neglible.

Your compound A is ethanol: H3C-CH2OH.  It is an alcohol which can be used for sterilizing (killing germs) on surfaces.  Ever see an old western movie where they get a bottle of whiskey and dribble some over the knife blade before they start to cut open the wound to remove the arrow?  That's what ethanol can do.\n\nBy oxidizing ethanol, you can create ethanoic acid, otherwise known as acetic acid: H3C-C(O)-OH\n\nH3CCH2OH  + O2  ======>  H3C-C(O)OH  + H20
Probably not.  There is a lot of land that is uneconomical to develop, either because the environment is too difficult, or there are no resources to make it worth it, or both.  For instance, the world's great deserts, and high mountain ranges.
Pluto the planet was discovered in 1930, Pluto the dog was created in the late 30's I think, so Disney probably was inspired by the discovery of Pluto the planet\n\nNot that it relates to the question but a lot of people are saying now that Pluto isn't technically a planet.
Antimatter (or, rarely, contra-terrene matter) is matter that is composed of the antiparticles of those that constitute normal matter. If a particle and its antiparticle come in contact with each other, the two annihilate, that is they are both converted from matter to energy in accordance with Einstein's equation e = mc2, giving rise to a brief flood of high energy photons (eg gamma rays) and possibly other particle/antiparticle pairs. Because c2 has a large value, the resulting photons and particles are endowed with a large amount of energy, ie, the difference between the rest energy of the products of the annihilation and the rest energy of the original particle/antiparticle pair.\n\nAntimatter is not found naturally on earth, except very briefly and in vanishingly small quantities (as the result of radioactive decay or cosmic rays). This is because antimatter which came to exist on earth outside the confines of a suitable physics laboratory, would almost instantly meet the ordinary matter that earth is made of, and be annihilated. Antiparticles, and some stable antimatter (such as antihydrogen), can be made in miniscule amounts, but not in enough quantity to do more than test a few of its theoretical properties.\n\nThere is considerable speculation both in science, and science fiction, as to why the Earth is almost entirely matter, and if other places are almost entirely antimatter instead, and what might be possible if antimatter could be harnessed, but at this time the apparent asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the visible universe is one of the great unsolved problems in physics. Possible processes by which it came about are explored in more detail under baryogenesis.
Ice cubes do not float on all liquids. For example, if you place your \nice cube in a cup of light oil (thin cooking oil. Don't use heavy greasy \noils), it will sink. It depends upon density of oils, density of oil is less than water in other words oil is less denser than water thats why it floats on water. If you put ice in more denser oil like heavy greace oil, ice cubes will float on this greace oil.\n\nWhy do things float on water? This has to do with something known as \nbouyancy. It's because of bouyancy that ships can float on water, \nas can corks and other things. It's also the reason that Archimedes ran \nout of his bath naked screaming 'Eureka!' all those years ago. \n\nThink about a tub of water or a swimming pool. If you push your hand in, \nthe deeper you go, the harder the water pushes on your hand, because the \ndeeper you go, the more water there is above you that's weighing down on \nyou. Same with air. If you climb high into the mountains, there is less \nair over your head, so it doesn't push on you quite as hard any more. This \nis the reason your ears pop when you go very high very fast. The \npressure of air in your ears is different from that of the air \noutside, and it is released in a 'pop'.\n\nIce cubes float on water because it is less dense than water. \nDensity measures how much mass there is per volume. For example, if you \nhave a metal cube and a plastic cube of the same volume (same length, \nwidth, and height -- same size), the metal cube is denser than the plastic \ncube. Most people would say 'the metal cube is heavier', and that's \nbecause it's more dense, so there's more matter per unit of volume than \nthe plastic cube.\n\nWhen an object, like an ice cube, is placed in water, the water pushes \nagainst the object, this is called 'exerting a pressure on the object'. \nhis pressure can come from below as well as from above. If you're not \nusing water, and use honey or some other liquid that is denser than water, \nthe pressure will be higher. If you use oil or some liquid that is less \ndense than water, the pressure will be less. The object itself has a \nweight, and is being pulled downwards by gravity. The more mass the object \nhas, the more strongly it is pulled downwards by gravity. If the downward \npull of gravity is greater than the upwards push of the liquid against the \nobject, then the object will sink. If the gravitational pull is less than \nthe upwards push of the liquid, then the object will float. If the two \nforces are the same, then the object will just hang there, neither \nfloating nor sinking.\n\nTbe ice cube floats not only because of its density, but because of its \nshape too. Imagine a huge ship. It's made of lots of heavy metal and \nsteel, but it still can float. This is because of its shape. It is made to \nspread out wide over the water, so that there is more water that can push \nup from below to balance out the weight of the ship. If the ship were just \na solid cube of metal, then it will sink, because the force of the water \npushing from below, the bouyant force, is not enough to balance out the \nweight of the ship, and it sinks.\n\nI hope this explanation helps, and if you have any more queries, feel free \nto ask us Have a great time!
"In the case of large estates, before we had suburbs, a driveway was the road that leads to the house from the public road. So you drive on it.\n\nHistorically, the term ""parkway"" has often implied that the road was designed specifically with a naturalistic or manicured landscaping of the median and adjacent land areas. Like a park.\n\nFreeways are named so because they have high speed limits and allow cars to move ""freeeeely"" without the burden of traffic lights or stop signs.\n\nSo that's why"
Alot of this depends on what kind of animal..for example snakes will eat their own young, so do sharks. But, most animals only have their young for a few months before they're off on their own. Whereas a human, usually has their child until their 18. Hope this helps..
"Though it cannot be evidenced that this was something to do with Ramayana or not however considering the quality and details included in Ramayana it is very likely that author of Ramayana had seen some sort of connection between two which looks like bridge and that's why he would have included this in his books.\n\nSome Hindu groups claim that the bridge is evidence that events narrated in the Ramayana epic actually took place and cite NASA's imagery of it as proof of their claims. NASA has distanced itself from such claims:\n\n    ""The images [...] may be ours, but their interpretation is certainly not ours. [...] Remote sensing images or photographs from orbit cannot provide direct information about the origin or age of a chain of islands, and certainly cannot determine whether humans were involved in producing any of the patterns seen.""\n\n\nArcheological studies of the bridge are ongoing, and some archeologists claim to have found evidence suggesting that the bridge is man-made. For instance, some researchers from Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, announced that the ""bridge"" is only 3,500 years old.\n\nSea levels rose about 10 or 20 metres in the 6th millennium BCE to reach levels similar to today, so in 6000 BCE the bridge would have been an isthmus situated above sea level. As such, it almost certainly would have been a viable route for humans to have reached Sri Lanka by dry land."

A BSN degree is great because you earn more money that ASN nurses and you get to supervise (promotions are easier).\n\nIf you want to earn a BSN, I recommend that you go to a state college. For example, here in California the Cal State system offers nursing programs on several of its campuses, whereas NONE of the University of California campuses have undergraduate-level nursing programs. Stay local and your tuition will be cheaper.\n\nThe time you should really look into the upper-tier schools is if you are considering a graduate degree such as a MSN or PhD (you can be Doctor Nurse!). Upper-tier schools (U of Washington, UCSF, etc.) offer excellent graduate-level education in nursing.\n\nOtherwise, if you are just shooting for the BSN for now, it's not worth your time and effort to go far away and pay tons of tuition for your education. Save your resources and focus on getting high grades in your program so you will have better options later on down the line.

Sir Peter B. Medawar, OM, FRS (1915--1987). British immunologist of Arab extraction (which, as he said in Memoir of a Thinking Radish, makes him sound like a kind of gum). Won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1960 for work on tissue transplantation which eventually helped make organ transplants possible. In addition, he wrote extensively, and extremely well, on science and philosophy. \n\nPeter Brian Medawar was born on February 28, 1915, in Rio de Janeiro. He is the son of a business man who is a naturalized British subject, born in the Lebanon.\n\nMedawar was educated at Marlborough College, England, where he went in 1928. Leaving this College in 1932, he went to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study zoology under Professor J. Z. Young. After taking his bachelor's degree at Oxford, Medawar worked for a time at Sir Howard Florey's School of Pathology at Oxford and there became interested in research in fields of biology that are related to medicine.\n\nIn 1935 he was appointed Christopher Welch Scholar and Senior Demonstrator at Magdalen College, Oxford, and in 1938 he became, by examination, a Fellow of Magdalen College. In 1942 he was Rolleston Prizeman and in 1944 he became Senior Research Fellow of St John's College, Oxford, and University Demonstrator in zoology and comparative anatomy. In 1946 he was elected a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, and in 1947 he was appointed Mason Professor of Zoology at the University of Birmingham. In 1951 he moved to London as Jodrell Professor of Zoology at University College, London. Here he remained until 1962, when he was appointed Director of the National Institute for Medical Research, London.\n\nMedawar's earlier research, done at Oxford, was on tissue culture, the regeneration of peripheral nerves and the mathematical analysis of the changes of shape of organisms that occur during this development. During the early stages of the Second World War he was asked by the Medical Research Council to investigate why it is that skin taken from one human being will not form a permanent graft on the skin of another person, and this work enabled him to establish theorems of transplantation immunity which formed the basis of his further work on this subject. When he moved to Birmingham in 1947 he continued to work on it, in collaboration with R. Billingham, and together they studied there problems of pigmentation and skin grafting in cattle, and the use of skin grafting to distinguish between monozygotic and dizygotic twins in cattle. In this work they took into consideration the work of R. D. Owen and concluded that the phenomenon that they called «actively acquired tolerance» of homografts could be artificially reproduced. For this earlier work on transplantation and growth, Medawar was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, London. When he moved to London in 1951, Medawar continued to work with R. Billingham and L. Brent, on this phenomenon of tolerance, and his detailed analysis of it occupied him for several years. He also carried out other researches into transplantation immunity.\n\nThe Royal Society of London, where he was the Croonian Lecturer in 1958, awarded him the Royal Medal in 1959. In the same year, he was Reith Lecturer for the British Broadcasting Corporation. He has been elected a Foreign Member of the New York Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.\n\nIn 1937 Medawar married Jean Shinglewood Taylor, daughter of a Cambridge physician. They have two sons, Charles and Alexander, and two daughters, Caroline and Louise.\n\nFrom Nobel Lectures, Physiology or Medicine 1942-1962, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1964 \n\nThis autobiography/biography was written at the time of the award and later published in the book series Les Prix Nobel/Nobel Lectures.

Methylated spirits contains something like 95% pure alcohol, the rest is methanol. (The methanol is added to try and stop people drinking it). Alcohol in general is toxic to cells. The higher the %% of alchohol in a substance is the higher its toxics abities. At 100% it is so toxic to cells either through poisoning (or osmosis effects (sp)) it well kill cells quickly. Also due to its psyicial properties methylated spirits can quickly evporate into the air leaving the surface you applied to dry.
"Your logic is flawed: humans did not evolve from apes, but rather ape-like creatures.  No organisms can have evolved from extant organisms.  That is, if it is around today, nothing else around today evolved from it.  Both humans and other apes diverged from an ape-like common ancestor and both extant apes and humans are equally evolved.  \n\nAs far as your question, the ""man"" refered to in such statement is defined as all humans.  Both male and female humans evolved slowly at the same time through selective pressures on both genders."

I'm not quite sure what you're asking, but I think you are looking for the dates at which various animal groups (including humans) evolved?\n\nThe oldest fossils of Homo sapiens sapiens come from the Klasies river mouth in South Africa, and are dated to about 100,000 years ago.  From there, modern humans spread out to reach all around the globe.\n\nThe earliest member of the genus Homo was Homo habilis (aka 'handy man').  This was the first hominid definitively linked with stone tool manufacture and use.  The earliest finds are in east Africa (Kenya, Tanzania) and are about 1 million years old.\n\nThe earliest hominids are the Australopithecines, such as Australopithecus afarensis.  One of the most famous is the skeleton known as 'Lucy'.  Also found in the region of east Africa, the earliest fossils date to about 3.5 million years ago.  Fossil trackways such as the Laetoli footprints take this date back to perhaps 5 or 6 million years ago, and there is some other evidence that they may have evolved 9 or 10 million years ago.\n\nThe earliest primates are Late Cretaceous in age, about 65 million years old (about the same time the dinosaurs went extinct).\n\nThe earliest mammals are known from the Triassic (about the same time the first dinosaurs evolved) about 210 million years ago.\n\nThe first reptiles appeared about 310 million years ago.\n\nThe first amphibians emerged on land about 360 million years ago.\n\nThe first fishes show up about 520 million years ago, and the very first chordates during the Cambrian explosion about 570 million years ago.\n\nThe Earth itself is 4.5 to 4.6 billion years old.\n\nAll of these dates have been arrived at through scientific radiometric dating techniques, as well as stratigraphic corellation.

Another example where there is also a solution (method not shown there, but it is essentially the method used here) is my reply to:\n\nhttp://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=1006021800716\n\nLet F be 10^n d + [n-1 digit part called ""x""]\nthen C is 10 * [n-1 digit part called ""x""] + d\n\nSo:\n\n(5/9)(10^n d + x + 40) - 40 = 10x + d\n\n(5/9)(10^n d + x + 40) = 10x + d + 40\n10^n d + x + 40 = (9/5)(10x + d + 40)\n10^n d + x + 40 = 18x + (9/5)d + 72\n\n(10^n - (9/5))d - 32 = 17x\n\nBecause of the fraction 9/5 there, we see that d must be divisible by 5: 0 or 5 -- But it is a leading digit and so it is not 0.  Therefore d = 5.\n\n(10^n - (9/5))5 - 32 = 17x\n17x = 5*10^n - 9 - 32\n17x = 5*10^n - 41\n17x = 4999....999959\n\nFor example, with no interior 9's you have 17x = 459 yielding x = 27, giving your result 527 F = 275 C.\n\nOtherwise just keep dividing 17 into 4999....  Anytime you see a remainder of 4 you can stop the nine's and append that trailing 59 and then you will see that your quotient for x ends in 27.\n\nThe first time this happens is with 527 F => 275 C, the second time is with:\n\n17 :  49 yields 2 rem 15\n17 : 159 yields 9 rem  6\n17 :  69 yields 4 rem  1\n17 :  19 yields 1 rem  2\n17 :  29 yields 1 rem 12\n17 : 129 yields 7 rem 10\n17 : 109 yields 6 rem  7\n17 :  79 yields 4 rem 11\n17 : 119 yields 7 rem  0\n17 :   9 yields 0 rem  9\n17 :  99 yields 5 rem 14\n17 : 149 yields 8 rem 13\n17 : 139 yields 8 rem  3\n17 :  39 yields 2 rem  5\n17 :  59 yields 3 rem  8\n17 :  89 yields 5 rem  4 <==\n\nand you could either stop here, or the next line will be 17 : 49 again, so x can be any number (0 or more) copies of 2941176470588235 yielding 5(2941176470588235)*27 as the F value and therefore (2941176470588235)*275 as the corresponding C value [the ""*"" means that the 2941176470588235 is repeated zero or more times]\n\nAs strings, where say (abc)^3 means abcabcabc then:\n\n5 (2941176470588235)^k 27 F = (2941176470588235)^k 275 C\n\nYou may also look up stuff about when 10 is a primitive root modulo a prime and/or about discrete logarithms modulo a not necessarily prime integer."

You find midpoint by adding the 2 x-coordinates of the endpoints and dividing by 2, and doing the same for the y-coordinates.  So if you know the midpoint and one end, it looks like this (assume the other endpoint is (x,y):\n\n(4+x)/2 = 10; (-4+y)/2 = 12\n\nMultiply by 2:\n4+x=20; -4+y=24\n\nSo x=16 and y=28
This is what's known as a Fermi question. You have to make certain assumptions and guesses, and use them to come up with a possible answer. Here's an example of how to do this problem.\n\nFirst of all, there are 973 years between 1027 and 2000.\n\nWhat's the average net population growth rate for a human population? Let's say it's 1.6% per year over these 973 years - because it's proportional to itself we'll be using an exponential growth equation. Starting with 1 (William himself), we can go 1*(e^(0.016*973)) the population borne out of William the Conquerer will be about 5.7 million. That sounds huge but we're talking about a millennium here, and most of them will have long forgotten about their ancestry (cause of all the daughters.) However, that 5.7 million will be the number of people alive. We're just looking for the population aged 0-1. In 2002 about 10% of the world was aged 0-4 and assuming similar characteristics for 2000 and even distribution inside 0-4 for each year, about 142,500 Conquerer kids were born in 2000.\n\nHow many people were born in the year 2000? Assuming 350,000 births a day over 366 days (leap year), 128.1 million people were born in the year 2000.\n\n142500/128100000 = 0.11%\n\nThat means the odds are about 1 in 900. Better than you'd think? Again, this could be widely varied depending on the assumptions you make. But I think that might be in the ballpark.

In 1960 a meteoroligist named Edward Lorenz was researching into the possibilities of long term weather prediction. He created a basic computer program using mathematical equations which could theoretically predict what the weather might be. One day he wanted to run a particular sequence again, and to save time he started it from the middle of the sequence. After lettin gthe sequence run he returned to find that the sequence had evolved completely different from the original. At first he couldn't comprehend such different results but then realised that he had started the sequence with his recorded results to 3 decimal places, whereas the computer had recorded them to 6 d.p. As this program was theoretically deterministic we would expect a sequence very close to the original, however this tiny difference in initial conditions had given him completely different results.\n\nThis sensitivity to initial conditions became known as The Butterfly Effect. This is because it compares to the idea that a butterfly flapping its wings could produce a tiny change in the atmosphere, and trigger a series of changes which could eventually lead to a hurricane on the other side of the world. The Butterfly Effect is a key characteristic to a choatic system.\n\nJohn

Electricity is the migration of free electrons form a highly negatively charged area to a positively charged area. When you rub your woolly socked feet on the wood floor and touch your your sister's ear, she gets a shock because you built up a negative charge compared to her charge level. so the electrons jumped over from you to her. These electrons can flow along any medium including air, as in Lightening. Even through space if the forces were strong enough. When you send electricity through a wire, the resistance of the wire and the wire itself absorb the free electron charge. It can go as far as the strength, or voltage, of the charge will push it against the resistance. We used to send phone messages across the oceans by wire so the longest we've done here on earth could be considered as many times the circumference of the earth. In short, there is really no limit as to how far you can transmit an electrical current. It will just take a lot more power to send it farther.

Dreaming is a function of the brain during the restorative state of the body... so there is no reason that other animals shouldn't have experiences during sleep just as we do. However, it would be logical to guess that the complexity and creativity of each animal's dreams varies in proportion to its intelligence and mental complexity (hence, humans would then have more complex dreams than parakeets).

The first step in trying to understand the vastness of space is in the ability to equate it with the understanding in the size (length, width, height, volume) of a point.  Both are equally unfathomable and for similar reasons.  You can think of our universe as an expanding point where we are inside.  Everywhere you are inside of the universe(that is not within close proximity of other objects for the effect of gravity to express itself) you will notice everything is expanding away from you.  \n\nI believe what you are considering space is what I see as our universe.  Our universe is what we can view, touch and explain through science we have developed.  Space on the other hand is an infinitely dimensional medium, in which our universe was born.  \n\nOur universe is nothing more than a 'disturbance' in space, and in space our universe exists as a point.  This point is a fraction of infinity, yet everything is a fraction of infinity.  So in the humble realization that we are nothing (a fraction of infinity), we are abstractly enlightened by the fact that we are equal to everything we can fathom, as it too is a fraction of infinity no matter how large.\n\nSo, through the realization that we are nothing comes the discovery that we are everything.  \n\nI believe this means everything that makes up the universe and space has its own existence or presence known to space and must exist.  The disappearance, or non-existance of any defined object and its position in space no matter how small, down to a point, would truly have mind boggling consequences.

"Pressure transmitters are used in research and development, process control, and factory automation to tell a control system or operator what the pressure is at the sensor location.  A ""transmitter"" tells you the pressure reading is converted to some type of signal that may be ""transmitted"" to another location.  The simplest transmitters only have a switch contact that closes or opens at a certain pressure point.\n\nFor instance, a spring-operated diaphragm connected to a variable resistor will sense the oil pressure in your car engine, and send a different voltage depending on the pressure.  The characteristic of the voltage level to pressure ratio is known in the sensor design, so the computer knows how to interpret the voltage.  \n\nTransmitters have all kinds of formats these days.  Common units output a current (4-20mA) or a voltage (all ranges: 0-5, 1-5, 0-10, etc.)  and are customizable.  With the advent of the cheap microcontroller, however, sensors are more flexible.  They can output a data stream with RS232 or RS485 (addressable), or nowadays the sensors can be networked with CAT-5 cable and internet protocol.  This is great when you have many sensors reporting to a central controller over long distances."

You're going forward with the train; you're not in a stationary position.  That's why if you've ever tried to jump out of a moving vehicle and land on your feet you get wrecked-- just because you're sitting still doesn't mean that you're not moving.\n\nBut if you jumped off the back of a moving train, would you be jumping forward or backward?
Family and species - The variety of sea lions which live at Sea Lion Caves is commonly called the Northern, or Steller, sea lion. This sea lion is named after George Wilhelm Steller, an eminent German naturalist who accompanied the Russian explorer Vitus Bering in 1741 on his second Alaskan expedition. Steller was the first qualified observer to study and classify these animals.\nThe Steller sea lion is a member of the Otariidae family, or eared seal. It is characterized by an external ear which can be closed when entering water and by hind feet or flippers that point forward. In contrast, Phocidae, or true seal, has no external ears and it's rear flippers point backward. Also belonging to the Otariidae family is the California sea lion and the Alaska fur seal.\nThe Alaska fur seal (Callorhinus alascanus), is not found at Sea Lion Caves. The California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) is seen all along the Pacific Coast and is generally found at Sea Lion Caves from late fall to early spring. It readily adapts to captivity and is trained for circus acts.\nThe largest of the eared seal family and the principal tenant of Sea Lion Caves is the Steller sea lion. This animal is also considered non-migratory because there is no mass movement to summer or winter grounds, although individuals or small groups may travel hundreds of miles in search of food. It is found from the central California coast, north to the Bering Sea and back south into northern Japanese waters. A recent U.S. Fish and Wildlife Survey indicates a possible total population of nearly 80,000 Steller sea lions. Most of these animals live on the offshore islands and rocks of British Columbia and Alaska. Some Stellers live along the California coast and about one thousand reside in Oregon Waters. The number of Steller sea lions in the Sea Lion Caves area varies from season to season and from year to year with the herd averaging about 200 animals.\n\nPhysical Characteristics - Sea Lions are mammals, or warm blooded animals which give birth, nurse their offspring, and must breathe air. Sea Lions are also pinnipeds -- literally, feather-footed -- meaning they have finlike members for propulsion. Their pelvic bone structure allows independent use of their flippers, and therefore, they can walk on their four weblike flippers which contain the same bony structure as the legs of land animals. In the water, the Steller sea lion swims by using a breast stroke and may reach a top speed of about 17 m.p.h. In contrast, other marine animals, such as the whale, depend on fishlike body action to move through the water. The true fur seal folds its front flippers and swims by the force of its trailing rear flippers.\nYoung sea lions called pups seem to be immune to most diseases as long as they are breast fed. As they mature, pups become susceptible to internal parasites such as round worms and tape worms which are a deterrent to both growth and longevity. Population increases are also somewhat checked by adult sea lions inadvertently trampling their young and also by accidental drownings of the newly born which have not yet learned to swim.\nDiet - Sea lions are carnivorous. Their skulls are similar to those of bears and their jaws contain sharp teeth much like those found in dogs, cats, and other flesh eaters. They feed exclusively on fish they catch themselves; their diet varying with whatever is abundant in the area. In the vicinity of Sea Lion Caves, they appear to subsist chiefly on bottom fish such as skate, small sharks, squid and various species of rock fish. Sea lions may descend in search of food to a depth of 80 to 100 fathoms, and normally remain submerged no longer then four or five minutes.\nPossible sea lion predation on commercially valuable fish has been of some concern. Because of the animal's remote and rugged habitat, and because collecting specimens at sea is difficult, much is unknown about its diet habits. However, recent scientific studies indicate th
Good question.  Just FYI, embryo is used to cultivate virusses because the environment can be easily controlled, unlike that of an animal.\n\nEmbryo really don't have any disadvantages after you've discovered the method.\n\nAnimals have several however.  He're a brief listing:\n\n- immune system response time (from infection to plasma b cell action)\n- immune system strength (number of plasma b cells)\n- immune system aggression (number of antigens created by plasma b cells)\n- inconsistant host cells\n\nControl is the key.  Embryo cultivation allows for this.  That's why it's used.
Vanilla is a flavoring, in its pure form known as vanillin, derived from orchids of the genus Vanilla from their seed pods..Madagascar is the world's largest producer.Though there are many compounds present in the extracts of vanilla, the compound predominantly responsible for the characteristic flavor and smell of vanilla is known as vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde). Another minor component of vanilla essential oil is piperonal (heliotropin). Piperonal and other substances affect the odour of natural vanilla.\n\nVanilla essence comes in two forms: the actual extract of the seedpods, and the far cheaper synthetic essence, basically consisting of a solution of synthetic vanillin in ethanol. Natural vanilla is an extremely complicated mixture of several hundred different compounds, versus synthetic vanillin which is derived from phenol and is of high purity.

"In chemistry, the term transition metal (sometimes also called a transition element) has two possible meanings:\n\nIt commonly refers to any element in the d-block of the periodic table, including zinc, cadmium and mercury. This corresponds to groups 3 to 12 on the periodic table. \nMore strictly, IUPAC defines the transition metals as any element with an incomplete d subshell or that may form stable ions only with an incomplete d subshell (IUPAC definition: ""An element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell.""). By this definition, zinc, cadmium, and mercury are excluded from the transition metals, as they have a d10 configuration. Only a few transient species of these elements that leave ions with a partly filled d subshell have been formed, and mercury(I) only occurs as Hg22+, which does not strictly form a lone ion with a partly filled subshell, and hence these three elements are inconsistent with the latter definition.[1] They do form ions with a 2+ oxidation state, but these retain the 4d10 configuration. Element 112 may also be excluded although its oxidation properties are unlikely to be observed due to its radioactive nature. This definition includes groups 3 to 11 on the periodic table. \nThe first definition is simple and has been traditionally used. However, many interesting properties of the transition elements as a group are the result of their partly filled subshells from d orbitals, a property which all members of the d-block except zinc, cadmium and mercury share\nTransition elements tend to have high tensile strength, density and melting and boiling points. As with many properties of transition metals, this is due to d orbital electrons' ability to delocalise within the metal lattice. In metallic substances, the more electrons shared between nuclei, the stronger the metal.\nTransition metals form good homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts, for example iron is the catalyst for the Haber process. Nickel or platinum is used in the hydrogenation of alkenes."
A train is moving from station A to station B; the distance between them is 10km.\n\nWhen the distance is 2m from station A, a man at station A will say that the train is 2km from A; whereas the man at B will say that the train is at 8km.\n\nTherefore, relative to man at A, the distance is 2km and relative to the man at B the distance is 8km.\n\nThis is called relativity.\n\nIn Physics we measure the quantities like mass, length and time.\n\nThese quantities can be measured in a laboratory which is at rest.\n\nThe same quantities can be measured in a laboratory which is set up in a fast moving train.\n\nWill the observations will be the same or different?\n\nThe theory of relativity deals about such things.
If I'm reading this right, your two functions start at 20 and end at 50. The first one goes up slowly following a curve, like a skateboarder's ramp. The second goes up faster, like a slide.\n\nI would guess that there would be more area at the start of the second function than the first. If you tried to draw a picture of what these functions are doing, and then you put them on top of each other, then you'd see that the slide function covers more area than the ramp function at the start. You can go further and say that the slide function has more area from 20 to 50 than the ramp function, again based on the overlapping drawings.\n\nNow, if you had actual functions, then we can find out exactly what the areas are by taking integrals of the functions from 20 to 50 (or 20 to 25, if you're still looking at the start). An integral is useful in finding areas under curves that traditional geometric formulas can't handle.

I myself am a agriculture major with a Master's degree. I have a few friends who are in the field of Botany and Plant Pathology (it studies the diseases plants can get) Here are some materials for your thinking.\n\nIf you think you like to do research, going to grad school at least for Master's degree is necessary. As a Botany major, you can work as a researcher/research assistant. Schools like UC Davis, UC Riverside, Cornell, Purdue, Texas A&M,etc, have great research labs to work at. You can also work for USDA (Department of Agriculture). They have many many experimental stations in almost every state. At such environment you have more chance to work with local farmers or agro industry while doing research. Some people like this better than pure research in universities.\nBesides, you can also work as a plant breeder for private seed companies. Teaching at college level is also an option after you finish the grad school.(Be sure to work as a teaching asistance before you graduate. This gives you good experience-you get to teach while experienced professors are suprovising by your side)\n\nSince you have not decided your major, I would suggest you to work in a research lab in Botany or Horticulture, just to know what life is like working in this field. You'll know if it's for you soon after you work there. Good luck and have fun!

This type of battery exhibits a high energy density, high efficiency of charge/discharge (89—92%), long cycle life, and is made from inexpensive, non-toxic materials. However, the operating temperature of 300 to 350 °C and the highly corrosive nature of sodium make it suitable only for large-scale non-mobile applications. A suggested application is grid energy storage in the electric grid. A 6MW-Hr system has been installed at Tsunashima Japan.

Cloning is the process of making a genetically identical organism through nonsexual means. It has been used for many years to produce plants (even growing a plant from a cutting is a type of cloning). People have been cloning plants in one way or another for thousands of years. For example, when you take a leaf cutting from a plant and grow it into a new plant (vegetative propagation), you are cloning the original plant because the new plant has the same genetic makeup as the donor plant. Vegetative propagation works because the end of the cutting forms a mass of non-specialized cells called a callus. With luck, the callus will grow, divide and form various specialized cells (roots, stems), eventually forming a new plant. \n\nMore recently, scientists have been able to clone plants by taking pieces of specialized roots, breaking them up into root cells and growing the root cells in a nutrient-rich culture. In culture, the specialized cells become unspecialized (dedifferentiated) into calluses. The calluses can then be stimulated with the appropriate plant hormones to grow into new plants that are identical to the original plant from which the root pieces were taken. \nMore recently, scientists have been able to clone plants by taking pieces of specialized roots, breaking them up into root cells and growing the root cells in a nutrient-rich culture.

Suppose the sun, the earth and the moon are in a line and it full moon.\n \nThe moon takes 27.5 days to make an orbit around the earth. But as the earth has moved further in its orbit around the sun the moon needs two days more to arrive at the same position with the sun for a new full moon.\n\nThe difference amounts to 7.3%, which is 104 minutes per day. As in most places high tide happens twice a day, a high tide happens every day 104/2=52 minutes later than the day before.

Synarthrosis are non-movable boine joinings-like the skull, ribs, and sternum- These are places where there are no mobile joints, where you don't require movement.  However, they do lend some flexibility to the bones, so your skull isnt like an eggshell that shatters, but has some freedom of motion.  Obviously, for your limbs, fingers, etc, you want freedom of motion-these types of bone-to-bone connections are called diarthroses, like the ball and socket joint of the shoulder, or knee joints- You need large range of motion here.

"""It's safe to say that feeders are more important to the people who maintain them than to the birds that use them. For people, bird feeders are a great way to connect with nature and enjoy close-up views of some of nature's most colorful and agile creatures. For birds, feeders merely supplement their normal intake of food. Even birds that regularly visit feeders obtain only a small percentage of their overall diet from them. However, research on black-capped chickadees has shown that chances of surviving a harsh winter may be greater for birds that have access to feeders. It's likely that this is true for other birds as well."""

No he does not.\n\nThe poison is highly toxic and is greatly feared by the San themselves; the arrow points are therefore reversed so that the poison is safely contained within the reed collar. It is also never smeared on the point but just below it - thus preventing fatal accidents. \n \nThe poison is neuro toxic and does not contaminate the whole animal. The spot where the arrow strikes is cut out and thrown away, but the rest of the meat is fit to eat.  The effect of the poison is not instantaneous, and the hunters frequently have to track the animal for a few days.
Sure, what are the problems?
Just work backwards.  You need to work for 8 hours plus a 1/2 hour lunch (8 1/2 hours).\n\nYou need to leave by 2:30 p.m.  So when do you need to start work?  In other words, what time is 8 1/2 hours before 2:30 p.m.\n\nI'm not sure how versed you are at calculating time, but 2:30 is obviously 2 1/2 hours after noon.  Then you just need 6 more hours to account for.  6 hours before noon is 6 a.m.\n\nSo if you start work at 6:00 a.m. and leave at 2:30 p.m. you will have been at work for 8 1/2 hours.  That's 8 hours of working and 30 minutes (1/2 hour) for lunch.\n\nSo the answer is 0 minutes after 6 a.m.
Coriolis showed that an acceleration acts on all bodies moving on the Earth’s surface.\n\nIf one looks along the Earth’s axis from the North Pole, the rotation appears counter clock wise. Hence in the Northern Hemisphere, any body moving rectilinearly relative to any inertial system will deviate to the right (as viewed by a terrestrial observer) in the course of its motion, while in the Southern Hemisphere, it will deviate to left.\n\nThis deviation could be large or small, depending on the direction of motion with respect to the axis and on the linear velocity of the motion.\n\nThe deviation of the body can take place in the horizontal or vertical plane (with respect to the surface of Earth). The Coriolis acceleration is directed perpendicular to the Earth’s axis; hence, the deviation taking place in the horizontal plane is the greatest at the Poles and equal to zero at the equator.\n\nThe reverse is true for deviations in the vertical plane.\n\nThe deviation of bodies moving in the horizontal plane from their rectilinear path is the reason why the right side banks of rivers are eroded in the Northern Hemisphere, and the left banks in the Southern Hemisphere to the left.\n\nAll masses flowing into regions of low pressure deviate from the radial direction to the right in the Northern Hemisphere, (to the left in the Southern Hemisphere) and form cyclones. Thus cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere stir the air masses counter clockwise, and in the Southern Hemisphere clockwise.  \n\nAs a result of the vertical deviation, a falling body does not fall exactly vertically. Such a body deviates from east to west.
mRNA codons are made during transcription in the nucleus.\nTranslation is when the mRNA that entered the cytoplasm attaches to the rRNA of a polysome-ribosomes while the tRNA triplet anticodons bring in individual amino acids to build a polypeptide (protein)

"Just size.  Where we make the cutoff is somewhat arbitrary.  Some people dispute the idea that Pluto is a planet because it is too small.  Asteroids are also known as ""minor planets"" (planet = wanderer in Greek, because they seemed to ""wander"" among the stars).  Not all planets have atmopheres.  Mercury's is essentially zip.  And some moons of other planets (such as Titan) have substantial atmopsheres."
first off you gotta know what certain words mean before you use them, second why are being so assertive that intelligent life exists outside of our planet, when apparently you don't even know the basics of physics?.
A white dwarf is an astronomical object which is produced when a low or medium mass star dies. These stars are not heavy enough to generate the core temperatures required to fuse carbon in nucleosynthesis reactions. After one has become a red giant during its helium-burning phase, it will shed its outer layers to form a planetary nebula, leaving behind an inert core consisting mostly of carbon and oxygen.

Do you want the extended answer or the short answer. \n\nthe short answer is a bit like this. \nA worm hole is a hole in the space (not time) continuim that occurs at a fold in the universe that you can travel through at almost the speed of light. the other choice is a wormhole that leads to a diagonal universe that is mostly the same.\n\nHowever a wormhole is a theoretical part of physics, and until either made or found can not be proved.\n\n\nfor the long answer try looking on NASA website but be warned, it will be long and confusing.
I've seen lots of proof that there is something going on which is out side the norm. Recently I was playing a game called Taboo where someone has to get people to say a word, but can't use certain key words. I noticed that the results tended to have less to do with the clues given, and more to do with certain people connecting.\n\nOne personal benefit was one time a friend and I created a psychic link which allowed us to go camping and keep tabs on each other without needing those family band radios.\n\nPersonally, I do spiritual healing with singing bowls. I play the bowl in someone's hand, and feel the vibrations as they extend through the person, and can tell them where the vibrations are and what they're doing.\n\nWe all have moments of intuition when we know things which are beyond what we would expect to know. I believe that it's only partly due to people connecting directly to each other, and more to do with a more general connection to the cosmic consciousness, and our interactions through the cosmic consciousness\n\nCosmic consciousness is just my way of visualizing it. Some of my friends who are more psychically developed think of it as a vision realm, or spirit realm, but that's basically where the business is done. The trick is to allow your brain to achieve an alpha state which will allow you to reach into the greater intuition of existence\n\nPart of the trick is that the intuition sounds very much like your own internal dialog, so you have to know your own thoughts so that you can recognize when thoughts are not your own
Suppose we take x^0=1, so \nx^0=1;\nx^(1-1)=1;\nx^1 * x^-1 = 1;\nx^1/x^1 = 1;\nx/x = 1;\n1=1; That is the proof... Enjoy....
Reducing air pollution (NO2 and SO2 emissions in particularly) will help prevent acid rain.\n\nAcid rain refers to rain which contained Nitric acid (HNO3) and/or Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) dissolved in it, hence its name.\nWhen Nitrogen Dioxide gas (NO2) and Sulfur Dioxide gas (SO2) dissolve in water, they form very strong and corrosive acids.  These two gasses are minor byproducts of the combustion of fossil fuels due to impurities in the fuel.  When these gasses dissolve in rain water, the rain becomes acetic and can damage things on the ground.\n\nReducing air pollution is a major step in preventing acid rain.
It's the smell of asparagine - one of the 20 common amino acids - and its derivatives. You get this from many sources as well as asparagus, but it is named after it (as it was first isolated from asparagus) and occurs in high levels in this vegetable.
Glycerol is used as a cryoprotectant at concentrations of between 5 and 20% for a number of reasons. Firstly, however, you need to know why a cryoprotectant is needed at all... Cells would otherwise be in some type of buffer and media, which if frozen, would cause ice formation inside and outside the cells, causing their death due to various reasnons including the freezing and non-freezing of solutes causing local increases in concentration, and ice crystals can cause rupture of membranes, as well as some other effects. Glycerol is therefore used as a cryoprotectant which allows for vitrification to occur, which is basically the lowering of the freezing temperature of the solutin as well as the increasing of its viscosity. This process prevents crystallization (ie. the ice crystals which are harmful to the cells). Obviously there are a number of cryoprotectants, but glycerol is cheap, fairly non-toxic to the cells, and since it is a polyol, provides some nutrient value to the cells.
The obvious answer is the tides would be much smaller. We would still have tides, but they would be: (1) Caused by the Sun and therefore smaller. (2) They would come at roughly the same time each day.\n\nThis would affect a good deal of the marine life that depends on the tidal changes.\n\nLighting would also change. Reproductive behaviors in a number of animals are goverened by the moon's cycle. It is not known how much the moon's absence would change this.\n\nThe days would not grow longer as someone suggested. The opposite is true as the friction overcome in producing the tides takes energy. That energy is coming out of the earth's rotation and the moon's orbiting around the earth. The moon is slowly moving farther away and the earth is slowing down so the days are getting longer. Of course, this is an extremely slow process and you are not going to notice any change. The moon's absence would mean it wouldn't take place.\n\nEarthquakes would not be affected. They are caused by plate tectonics, which is independent of the moon.\n\nIf you are interested in the moon, try\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/lunar-obse...\n\nHope this helps\n\nChuck
Series for sure. \n\nswimming pool: SP\nheat exchangers: HE1, HE2  \n  \nIn parallel, both HE heat the water to a temperature t1 higher than t0, the initial temperature in the SP.  \nSo in both parallel pipes we have the same temperature, the temperature obtained with just one HE. The other is useless. Or it gives you the advantage of heating two times faster.\n\nIn series we have the temperature increased from t0 to t1 after passing HE1, and from t1 to t2, a higher temperature, after passing trough HE2.\nThe water from SP is heated more than in the 1st case, but 2 times more slowly.

Glad I am not the only one.\nI recently saw a program, I believe it was the Science Channel that said the reason our season's are going the way they is because our moon is slowly pulling away from the Earth about an inch per year whis is causing our gravitional pull around our planet to wobble causing these season changes.

"There is a factor called ""Crush Depth"".  Crush depth is the depth at which the submarine's structure could collapse due to extensive water pressure of the surrounding.  WWII U-Boats reportedly had a crush depth of 200-250 meters.  Modern nuclear propulsion submarines (although not tested) could have crush depths of just above 700 meters.\n\nTo get the ""feel"" of it I suggest you watch the movies ""U-571"" starring Matthew McConnaughey, and ""Crimson Tides"" starring Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington"
Most of the answer above is wrong.\nColor is Energy.\nColor is Photons at a given wave length/frequency\n\nGiven by the equation:     Energy = hV                        \n\nh is the plancks constant,\nand V is the frequency of the wave.\n\nMost color you see is very low intensity, but just enough cause a change in the back of your eyes.\n\nLaser, is a kind of light that is all produced in one frequency.\nAnd, can be powerful enough to cut through very thick steel plates.\nSo is a color/light can cut through thick steel, you better believe it is energy.\n\nSo, color is energy, but not power.\nPower is color + intensity.\n\nIs like saying water flow is energy, but how much power depents on how much water is flowing.\n\nGood question, keep it up, you will find it very interesting.

It depends on how much THC was used and for how long a period.  A small amount, one time, and you should be clean in a few days.  A moderate amount to larger amounts over a longer period of time, will result in significant quantities of THC being absorbed by the fat in your body.  The THC in the fat will then start leeching out over a period of time.  This process is commonly described as taking about a month to get rid of all of the absorbed THC.

The above answer is not quite right.  In relativistic mechanics, momentum is defined as:\n\n  p = g * m * v\n\nwhere \ng = 1/sqrt(1-(v/c)^2),\nv is the velocity of the object in question (relative to some observer), \nc is the speed of light, \nand m is the rest mass of the moving object.  \n(Strictly speaking, both p and v are vector quantities.)\n\nFor |v|<<c, g is approximately equal to 1, and the relativistic momentum approaches m*v, the classical Newtonian value of the momentum.  \n\nIn the case at hand, g = 1/sqrt(1-0.15^2) = 1.01144, so the relativistic momentum of the electron is 1.01144 times the classical value (i.e., 1.144% higher than just m*v).

In modern usage, civil engineering is a broad field of engineering that deals with the planning, construction, and maintenance of fixed structures, or public works, as they are related to earth, water, or civilization and their processes. Most civil engineering today deals with roads, Railways, structures, water supply, sewer, flood control and traffic. In essence, civil engineering is a profession which makes the world a more habitable place to live in.\n\nEngineering has developed from observations of the ways natural and constructed systems react and from the development of empirical equations that provide bases for design. Civil engineering is the broadest of the engineering fields. In fact, engineering was once divided into only two fields--military and civil. Civil engineering is still an umbrella field comprised of many related specialties.

During that time there was two complementary beliefs that were almost universally accepted until the work of Galileo and the like.\n\n1. That peoples lives were affected by and tied up in the heavenly realms. So, belief in astrology was very deeply entrenched. For example, there was a royal astrologer in most courts in those days, including the court of Elizabeth 1. Despite the prevailing Christian views of the time, people were still given to the stars.\n\n2. As is clear in writing of the time, including the plays of Shakespeare, many believed that human events, especially those on a catastrophic scale or involveing kings and princes, caused effects on the earthe and the skies. So, as in Shakespeare's Macbeth, the murder of a king would create storms and upheaval.\n\nThe irony is that indeed the deeds of man, environmentally, have affected the weather and created ununual events. maybe the Elizabethans were right after all.

They can be used (practically) for taking measurements. They also crop up in periodic motion and lots of other areas of mathematics. They are functions of angles. \n\nIt is simplest to see from a right triangle ABC, where the angle B is the 90 degree angle. In this angle the length of the side AB might be called a, the length of the side BC might be called b and the length of the side CA might be called c. (draw it out.)\n\n\nSide c is the hypotenuse.\n\n For angle A, the Opposite side is b. For Angle A, the Adjacent side is a.\n\nFor Angle C, the opposite side is a, the Adjacent side is b.\n\nGiven this triangle, \nthe sin(A) = Opposite/Hypotenuse = b/c.\ncos(A) = Adjacent/Hypotenuse = a/c.\ntan(A) = sin(A)/cos(A) = b/a = Opposite/Adjacent.\n\n\nIf you're measuring height of a building and know how far you are from the building (adjacent side) and the angle you must look up to see the top edge of the building, tou can use (adjacent*tan(angle looking up)) = height of building.
Tensile strength measures the force required to pull something such as rope, wire, or a structural beam to the point where it breaks.\n\nSpecifically, the tensile strength of a material is the maximum amount of tensile stress that it can be subjected to before failure. The definition of failure can vary according to material type and design methodology. This is an important concept in engineering, especially in the fields of material science, mechanical engineering and structural engineering.\n\nThere are three typical definitions of tensile strength:\n\n    * Yield strength - The stress a material can withstand without permanent deformation.\n\n    * Ultimate strength - The maximum stress a material can withstand.\n\n    * Breaking strength - The stress coordinate on the stress-strain curve at the point of rupture.

"In physical geography, tundra is an area where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term ""tundra"" comes from Kildin Sami tū̄ndra, the genitive of tundar, ""treeless plain"", or according to some, comes from the Finnish word ""tunturia"", also meaning ""treeless plain"".\n\nThere are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, Antarctic tundra, and alpine tundra. In all of these types, the dominant vegetation is grasses, mosses, and lichens.\n\nTrees grow in some of the tundra. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree-line or timberline."

Planets spin because the stuff that fell together gravitationally to make them up had angular momentum relative to the planet's axis. If a meteor comes in and hits the Earth, the chances are nearly zero that it will hit head on. A glancing blow will contribute to the Earth's angular momentum. If a planet or star falls together gravitationally from a cloud of matter, even if the cloud has very little rotational motion, the angular speed of spin is increased as the planet or star becomes more compact. This has to do with the conservation of angular momentum, and a typical example is that of a spinning ice skater pulling in his arms to rotate faster. Another example is the water draining in a sink. It almost always swirls around as it goes down the drain, even if there was very little apparent motion to begin with in the water in the sink.

The more general problem is 1/x + 1/y = 1/M for some M.\n\nIt turns out that the way to find all solutions for integers is to find all factorizations:\n\n    M^2 = A*B  (A,B!=-M)\n\nthen the solution is x=A+M and y=B+M.\n\nIt's easy to show that this works:\n\n   1/x + 1/y = (x+y)/xy = (A+B+2M)/(A+M)(B+M)\n\nBut (A+M)(B+M) = AB + (A+B)M + M^2 \n    = (A+B)M + 2M^2  (since AB = M^2)\n    = M(A+B+2M)\n\nSo 1/x + 1/y = 1/M\n\nOn the other hand, if 1/x + 1/y = 1/M,\nthen xy = M(x+y).  Subtract M(x+y) from both sides, then add M^2 to both sides, and you get:\n\n  (x-M)(y-M) = M^2\n\nSo, in the case of M=99, we are looking to factor\n99^2 = 3^4 * 11^2 = 9801.\n\nA=1, B=9801, x = 100, y=9900\nA=3, B=3267, x = 102, y=3366\nA=9, B=1089, x = 108, y=1188\nA=11, B=891, x = 110, y=990\nA=27, B=363, x = 126, y=462\nA=33, B=297, x = 132, y=396\nA=81, B=121, x = 180, y=220\nA=99, B=99, x = 198, y=198\n(Case where A>B just switches x and y, so we skip those.)\nA=-1, B=-9801, x=98, y=-9702\nA=-3, B=-3267, x=96, y=-3168\nA=-9, B=-1089, x=90, y=-990\nA=-27, B=-363, x=72, y=-264\nA=-33, B=-297, x=66, y=-198\nA=-81, B=-121, x=18, y=-22\nA=-99, B=-99, x=0, y=0 (obviously not a solution)\n\nAgain for |A|>|B|, we just switch the x and y.\n\nSo, that's all your solutions.
"Before WW II \n\n1854 - Japan, formerly a closed country (foreigners not allowed in) is ""opened"" when Admiral Matthew Peary sails his fleet into Tokyo Bay. Japan remians sovereign, under rule of the Shogun. The Emperor is largely symbolic.\n\n1854 - 1900 - Japan invites Germany to train the army, Britain to train the navy, and the shogunate disappears as the Meiji Restoration occurs (Emperor Meiji, who brought Japan into the modern industrial age). Japan industrializes, zaibatsu, or business combines ruled by important families, expand, and Japan becomes relatively modern industrially. \n\nGlobally, Japan is looked down upon as an ""asiatic"" nation of ""yellow skinned slant-eyes"" who could never equal a western nation.\n\n1850 - 1900 - Golden age of colonization - Britain, France, and Germany carve up Africa, and other independent territories.

The US, which supports China, is concerned, and cuts off supplies of strategic materials to the Japanese. Japan is viewed with suspicion by western nations.\n\n1936 - ""Rape of Nanking"" Japanese forces capture the city of Nanking and pillage and rape. Thousands of civilians are raped and killed during a short period. Japan's international reputation falls even more.\n\nlate 1930's and 1940 - America moves to cut Japanese purchase of strategic material totally. No oil or steel goes to Japan from the US. Japan is outraged. Japanese planners beging to plan removing the US as a force in the pacific and expanding Japanese military operations to secure supplies of raw materials (East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere).\n\n1941 - Japan, ruled by the Emperor Hirohito, but run by Prime Minister Tojo, an army general, bombs Pearl Harbour and begins military action in the Pacific.\n\nAugust, 1945 - Japan surrenders after being defeated on land and sea, and being hit by two atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nSeptember, 1945 - General Douglas MacArthur takes over control of Japan. Emperoro Hirohito stays in. This allows the Japanese people to save face and gains the Americans support by all parts of society in Japan. \n\n1945 - 1950's - Japan recovers from the effects of the war. Like the Marshall Plan in Europe, the US helps Japan to rebuild, and works with the Japanese to bring in a democratic constitution and a democratic form of government.\n\n1950 - Korean War begins. Japan is an important staging point for American forces.\n\n1950's - 1970's - Japanese products are sold world wide. Japanese goods are known as shoddy and cheap. Made in Japan is not a sign of quality.\n\n1970's - 1990's - Japan's economy continues to grow, while the US suffers through the economic malaise of the OPEC embargo, Vietnam and Watergate. Japanese quality improves. Toyota, Datsun, Sony, and other Japanese firms become quality global brands through the late 1970's and throughout the 1980's.\n\nJapan is now considered as an American ally and works closely with the US in economic matters, as well as giving civilian support to military endeavours, such as Iraq. Japan's constitution forbids the country from having a standing army or navy, although it does permit a ""Defense Force"" to defend the homeland.\n\nJapan is now a key player in the global world, both politically and economically. What a difference from being voluntarily totally cut off up to 1854!"

Tension in the string is the force acting on the string.\n\nFor time being forget about the pulley.\n\nOne end of a rope is tied to a pole at the ground. Suppose you are pulling the rope from the other end.\n\nYou are exerting a force on the rope so as to increase its length.\n\nIf the rope is made of rubber you can see the increase in length.\n\nIf it is a steel rope, you cannot visualize the increase in length; but still it increases in its length. \n\nIf you exert a heavy force the rope breaks into two.\n\nSuppose you are not giving such a force. When the force is within a limit, the rope extends to a length which is determined by the applied force.\n\nWhen the increase in length is stopped, you and the rope are at rest; not moving further. \n\nNow consider the rope alone. What are the forces acting on the rope?\n\nTwo forces are acting on the rope, each at one end of the rope.\n\nSince the rope is not moving, by applying the law of forces, we come to a conclusion that these two forces are equal but opposite.\n\nNote that if the rope is moving with a varying speed, we cannot come to this conclusion.\n\nThe forces in the rope are called tension.\n\nNow suppose you know the value of the force, say 10N, that you have applied to the rope. It is obvious that this force which is pulling the rope and hence the value is 10N.\n\nNow coming to the pulley, a rope is passing through the pulley and one end carries a load and at the other end you are pulling it.\n\nSuppose the load and the end in which you are applying force is at rest ;( not moving)\n\nIi is similar to the above case; instead of the pole to which the rope is tied, here\nthe load is acting as a pole. (The load is also at rest).\n\nSince the system as a whole is at rest. The force you are applying must be equal to the load. Suppose if the load is 10N, you are applying 10N. \n\nActually you are applying 10 N to one end of the rope. The rope must move with this force; but for the load which is pulling it on the opposite direction.\nThus in the rope one end is pulled by you and the other end is pulled by the load.\n\nThe rope is under the tension of 10N force.\n\nNow you know the direction of tension in the rope also.\n\nConsider the end of the rope to which load is connected. The load is pulling the rope downward. Therefore, the tension in the rope at this end is 10N down ward.\n\nConsider the end of the rope to which you are pulling. You are pulling the rope downward. Therefore, the tension in the rope at this end is also 10N down ward.\n\nThe pulley is acted on by two forces on either side each equal to 10N, totalling 20N. \n\nIf there is no force acting upward on the pulley, the pulley will come down due the 20 N forces. \n\nTherefore, the pulley is pulled upward by a force of 20N by the one which is connected to the pulley.\n\nIf the load is moving with changing speed, the tension in the rope will be different.\n\nIf the concept of tension when the rope is at rest is understood, then it will be easy if even if the rope is having some acceleration.

Well for one thing it explains why electrons don't spiral into the nucleus (as classical physics would predict). \n\nQuantum mechanical theory states that electrons will inhabit discrete energy levels (orbitals). Therefore it would only fall into the nucleus if it lost exactly the right amount of energy, but there is a limit to the energy values it can emit in the form of a photon. \n\nThe main point is that available energy values are not continuous and this why electrons fall into strictly defined orbits rather than just going anywhere they want to or colliding with the nucleus.

It depends entirely on how rapidly the people can increase their population. For organisms that are rapidly reproducing there isn;t any real limit to the number of individuals required. One of each will work just fine. That's because the degree of genetic diversity will be increasing simply through re-assortment, and with an increasing population mutations will be arising more than fast enough to replace any losses.\n\nThe thing we need to know is how fast you think people are going to be able to expand, and that depends entirely on where these two survivors are located. In relatively benign environments such as the eastern US or Southern India people would be able to increase their populations exponentially immediately. In those circumstances two survivors would work. In more hostile environments such as Australia or Siberia people would find life a struggle for a long time and you'd probably need a good few hundred.
Assume that the incident rays are incident normally on the flat side (one of the sides forming the right angle) of the prism. The side opposite to the top angle is the base. When any light is incident perpendicular onto a transparent medium, it is simply transmitted without undergoing any refraction. So, the ray incident on the flat surface normally (means perpendicularly) is transmitted to the slant face containing 65* angle. Construct a line perpendicular to this slant face at the point of incidence. You will find that the angle between this line and the light rays is 25*, also known as the Angle of Incidence. Using\nRefractive Index = (Sine of the Angle of Incidence/Sine of the Angle of Refraction), we can find the Angle of Refraction for each colour depending upon its Refractive Index. The Angle of Incidence is the same 25* for both the rays. The problem is that the Refractive Indices given are for light travelling from air medium into glass medium, but, here, the light rays are travelling from the inside of the glass medium to the outside air medium. So, reverse the Angles of Incidence and Refraction so that it looks as if the rays are travelling from the air medium into the glass medium. So, now, the <i is to be found out and <r = 25*\nU = (sin <i / sin <r), sin <i = (U x sin <r). Calculating this, <i for red = 44.62* and <i for violet = 45.857* These are the answers. <i is the Angle of Incidence and <r is the Angle of Refraction.\n\nStill doubts?

Not quite sure what you are asking, but when matter is accelerated, it gains mass. The faster you go, the more massive you become. Finally, at c, your mass becomes infinite. Obviously, this is not possible, which is why lightspeed is not the sort of barrier that can be broken, like the sound barrier.
they are electromagnetic waves, like light waves, microwaves, x-rays, and gamma rays.  these are all transverse waves. sound is a longitudinal wave, and requires matter to transmit.  (you can't transmit sound in a vacuum, but you can transmit electromagnetic waves)

"Fever begins by a resetting of a ""set point"" which is a term used in physiology for where the body maintains its homeostasis.  So instead of your body trying to maintain your temperature at normal, say 98.6 degrees, it instead tries to maintain it at 102.  A fever fights pathogens because some pathogens like Rhinovirus (the common cold) prefer to replicate at a specific temperature.  Rhinovirus prefers a slightly colder than human body temperature to replicate and thats why it affects the upper respiratory tract (where it is slightly cooler).  If the temperature goes up, it doesn't replicate quite as well and the body has an easier time fighting it off."
An abnormal and persistent fear of blood is called hematophobia\n\nKnown by a number of names - Hemophobia, Hematophobia, Hemaphobia, and Fear of Blood being the most common - the problem often significantly impacts the quality of life. It can cause panic attacks and keep people apart from loved ones and business associates. Symptoms typically include shortness of breath, rapid breathing, irregular heartbeat, sweating, nausea, and overall feelings of dread, although everyone experiences fear of blood in their own way and may have different symptoms.
The Sun's core can reach 10 to 22.5 million°F. The surface temperature is approximately 9,900°F (5,500°C). The outer atmosphere of the Sun (which we can see during a solar eclipse) gets extremely hot again, up to 1.5 to 2 million degrees. At the center of big sunspots the temperature can be as low as 7300 °F (4300 K, 4000 °C). The temperature of the Sun is determined by measuring how much energy (both heat and light) it emits.\n\n\n\nlol davidroberts...hadn't heard that joke in a long time

The only way to know for sure is to go to your doctor. I found a lump some months back and went to the doctor straight away, mainly as I was worrying and panicking like crazy!\nThey sent me to see a specialist and after an examination and what was just like having an ultra sound on my breast they told me it was just swollen glandular tissue.\nIts a painless procedure and it will put your mind at rest. Cysts do need treating too, they often need to be drained which is not a big deal and easily done. If it is something that needs treating its better to get it done sooner rather than later. Good luck!
"Well it's called the ""theory"" of evolution for a reason. It's only a theory. Granted it's the theory we teach in schools now, and it most likely is what happened. But it wasn't generally accepted till quite recently really, and it still isn't taught in some parochial schools."
The thought of light being simple and obvious either means a very limited knowledge or a great genius who has outsmarted the world's greatest scientists of all time. My first notion would be that if light seems simple and obvious, you have jumped to conclusions; however, I will admit that many of life's great problems come from seeing simple things and making them more complex. However problems also frequently arise from making complex things into simple things that ignore and leave out all the wonderful properties that can acutally be useful. Light behaves in many strange ways: diffraction, refraction, scattering, x-rays, lasers, spectroscopy, wave mechanics, relativity, etc., all depend on our understanding of the nature of light. If you have truly found a way to simplify light so that it is easy to understand without making false assumptions, you should push for publication.

You have to be careful. Strong correlation does not necessarily prove a causal connection. I remember a letter to the London Times in the 1970's where a Cambridge undegraduate took a leading economist to task. The economist had found a strong correlation between the amount of money in circulation and inflation, he concluded that a large amount of money in circulation caused inflation. The undergraduate found a higher correlation between the incidence of dissentry in Scotland and inflation. He claimed therefore that dissentry was the cause of inflation. What they both had found was two increasing series of numbers. Unless you can explain the mechanism by which the two series are contected then proced with your hypothesis with caution. Don't bet your last dollar until you see whether your predictor works for a reasonable time, and then be cautious because unless you can explain the conection the circumstances may very well have changed since you original data was collected

"Hi! Well, it _is_ normal for tadpoles to have high mortality rates. After all, only a few of the hundreds of eggs will finally grow into adult frogs or toads. Some are eaten by birds, some are parasitized or just die because they were not well developed.\nBut if it is a large enough pond, at least some tadpoles will grow normally. And remember what I said about the water (I left comments in the other question): if it is not at least partly renewed, the concentration of ammonia will rise too much.\n\nOh, and another thing. When they first hatch, the tadpoles still have a bit of yolk from the egg and do not feed; only after a few days they develop their horny beaks and start scraping the algae. So it might be that now they're staying closer to the bottom surface, and that's why they're less visible. \nI'm including a link to a site that shows the developmental stages for most tadpoles. The stages are numbered from 1 to 46, but the time it takes for the entire process to be completed depends on the species and also on environmental conditions: \nhttp://www.trentu.ca/biology/tadpole/Webstage2.htm\n\nTry to catch a few and see which stage they're at :-)\n-------------\nPS I've just read the last comment.

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the theories of electricity and magnetism were investigated simultaneously. In 1819 an important discovery was made by the Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted, who found that a magnetic needle could be deflected by an electric current flowing through a wire. This discovery, which showed a connection between electricity and magnetism, was followed up by the French scientist André Marie Ampère, who studied the forces between wires carrying electric currents, and by the French physicist Dominique François Jean Arago, who magnetized a piece of iron by placing it near a current-carrying wire. In 1831 the English scientist Michael Faraday discovered that moving a magnet near a wire induces an electric current in that wire, the inverse effect to that found by Oersted: Oersted showed that an electric current creates a magnetic field, while Faraday showed that a magnetic field can be used to create an electric current. The full unification of the theories of electricity and magnetism was achieved by the English physicist James Clerk Maxwell, who predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves and identified light as an electromagnetic phenomenon.
There are a lot more advantages than disadvantages, of course.\nCrop rotation reduces considerably the risk of extinguishing the naturally grown individuals.\nThese ones are important mostly to preserve technology, creating a small population where certain diseases and plagues can keep living naturally, don't mutate and become resistant to insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, etc.\nLarge crops provide purer fields of the same quality grain/oilseed and at a lot cheaper price so the 6.3 billion people in the world can eat.\nRemember that, crop rotation, crop protection, and selected fertilization make sustainable agriculture.

The number of the beast.  GO IRON MAIDEN!!\n\nThe number 666 comes directly from the worship practices of the city of Babylon about he time of the Bible prophet Daniel.  The people of Babylon worshiped gods that were associated with the sun, moon, visible planets of our solar system, and certain of the stars involved with the practice of astrology. The Babylonians were the principle developers of astrology, as we know it today.  In their worship system, they had 37 supreme gods, and one of these, the god associated with the sun, was supreme over all the other gods.  These people believed that numbers in some way had power over the gods they worshiped.  However, they had to create numbers that they could assign to the gods so that they could have power over them.  To do this, they counted their gods and assigned a count number to each of the 36 lesser supreme gods, and then added up all of these numbers (from one to 36) and assigned the sum to the sun god.  The first god they counted got the number one assigned to it, and the second god they counted got the number two assigned to it, and so on up to all 36 lesser supreme gods.  Now, if you have not guessed it by now, the sum of the numbers from one to 36 totals 666, which they assigned to the god associated with the sun.  \n\nHowever, they went further.  They feared these gods and worried that one of them might strike them down sometime, so they made amulets with a 6 x 6 matrix of the numbers one through 36 on them.  Today we call these numeric matrixes magic squares.  The design of the amulets was to achieve a magic purpose, and they evidently believed that wearing a particular god's number would protect one from a specific god striking them down using his power of magic.  Now, the amulets had to be as powerful as possible, so in order to increase its power, they arranged these numbers in such a way that the sum of any given row, column, or diagonal is 111, and therefore the sum of all six rows or all six columns was 666.  This was supposed to provide extra protection, including from the god associated with the sun, since this god's sum was present on the amulet.  \n\nThe practice of creating amulets with this arrangement of numbers as part of astrology appears to have continued well past the time of Jesus. Archeologists have found amulets with Latin Inscriptions, so we know that the Romans were indulging in this practice. \n\nTherefore, the 666 number came about because of the pagan worship practices of the Babylonians and their practice of astrology.

Acceleration is NOT velocity divided by time, people are crazy and they will make you fail your final ;)  Acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the change in time.  If velocity is 7m/s and the time is 7/s the acceleration is NOT 1m/s^2 like they represent above.  That would only be true if the initial velocity was 0 and the acceleration was known to be constant... If you are told that a car is traveling at 7m/s for 7s the acceleration is 0... but if you simply put v/t you would get 1... \n\nVelocity is defined as distance per unit of time.  Acceleration is the change in velocity per unit of time.

I worked in a Steel Foundry.  It would take a temperature of about 2700 degrees F to completely melt steel.  It took a temperature of just over 3000 degree F to boil it.\n\nNow as for just heating it up to break it, that would be the temperature of the ovens where they put the steel in to heat treat it so that its glowing red and then before you put it in water or oil.  That temperature is around 1500 degrees F if I remember.  They used to break off unwanted parts of the casting at this temperature.\n\nDo, I google search on Heat treating Steel to get your temperature(that wasn't my department)\n\nP.S.

The speed at which the earth spins varies upon your latitudinal location on the planet. If you're standing at the north pole, the speed is almost zero but at the equator, where the circumference of the earth is greatest, the speed is about 1,038 miles per hour (1,670 kph). The mid-latitudes of the U.S. and Europe speed along at 700 to 900 mph (1125 to 1450 kph).
"There is a specific meaning:  how many surface feet per minute can a cutting tool operate with good life, while removing metal, in reference to a particular standard.\n\nThe machinability rating per se specifically means how machinable is a particular metal relative to a reference material, such as, a low carbon steel.  You'll see a note saying something like ""RELATIVE SPEED BASED ON C-1212"", with a machinability rating of 28% (28% as fast as machining C1212, or low carbon steel).  It gives you a starting point for how fast to machine the material.\n\nThe actual cutting speed will involve the cutting tool (whether high speed steel or carbide) and the material (whether aluminum or steel for example).\n\nThe RPM for the cutter or lathe spindle is then adjusted to render the correct surface feet per minute (SFM)."

If p and q are both non-zero, the answer is y=0 (by inspection).  If q=0, then y can be any real number, since the equation becomes y/p=y/p.\n\nFor a more general answer, cross multiplying gives you y(p+q)=y(p-q).  If y is non-zero, you can divide it out, giving\n\np+q=p-q\n\nThis is only true if -q=q, which only happens when q=0.\n\nSo, the only possibilities are the ones given at the beginning of this answer, namely y=0 if q is not zero, and y is any real number if q=0.
This is a tricky one.  The canonical number is around 200 billion, but the actual number might be twice as great.\n\nThe challenge lies in counting stars…  All the stars we see in our night sky are at most about 1,000 light years away, and the lion’s share are much closer.  But the entire Milky Way Galaxy has a diameter 100 times that size!  Even with our most powerful telescopes, we’re only seeing a tiny percentage of the stars in our galaxy.  Plus, our local region of the galaxy might be very different from the galaxy as a whole—we know that the density of stars is much greater at the center of the galaxy, but there may be other differences as well.\n\nFor example, based on the number of stars within approximately 16 light years of the Sun, astronomers estimate the total number of stars within about 80 light years to be at least 7,500, but we’ve only cataloged about a third that number.  Does that mean astronomers’ work is just beginning, or do we live in an unusually dense stellar neighborhood?  Almost certainly the former, possibly both.  One thing is for certain:  we have only begun to discover certain types of very low mass, dim stars that could up the total number of stars in our galaxy considerably (that’s where the 400 million number comes from).\n\nThus, extrapolating the total number of stars from the number that we observe proves tricky.  A safe answer to your question is “hundreds of billions,” but if you need to be more precise, you could do worse than to say something like 200 million.\n\n\nRyan Wyatt\nRose Center for Earth & Space\nNew York, New York

All of the previous answers are incorrect. It is possible to make the color red on a printer, yet there is no red ink.\n\nAll colors on a standard printer are made of four colors: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black.\n\nOn a printer, Red is the combination of Magenta and Yellow ink.
Good luck.  Go onto SciFinder and get a literature reference, and then hope that it's reported.\nProbably easier to just make it and measure it.

"We can see part of the Milky Way in the night sky, but what it looks like is a band of stars since we are seeing it from the ""side"".   There isn't an actual picture of the Milky Way from the ""top"", so the pictures you see are really simulations or projections based on what we know... We can make a good guess of what it looks like since we know the distances to many of the stars within our galaxy, and if we start plotting them, we can make an estimate of what our galaxy must look like from afar.  There's a great drawing of what some leading astronomers now think the Milky Way looks like:  http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap050825.html\n\nOn your question about planets, we can actually see all of the planets we know of with telescopes (on earth and in space... like the hubble telescope).  But some of the really distant planets are still hard to see from earth.  But we've also sent out several deep space probes that have passed nearby most the planets where we've been able to take great pictures."

Once again, it depends on the part of the brain that is affected and what treatment is decided.

There is no green component of the ink, it's made up of the two colours that separated, blue and yellow.  You can cut the bands out of the filter paper and dissolve it in 95% ethanol, but the resulting solution will be much weaker than the original ink, unless you use a rotovap to condense the ink compound.

The visible universe is 28 billion light years in diameter (since the earth is 14 billion years old)\n\n1 light year = 9.46 × 10^15 meters \n\nThe size of an atom .1 nm = 10^-10 m\n\nCalculations:\n\nThe diameter of the visible universe is\n\n28 x 10^9 x 9.46 x 10^15 m\n\n= 2.65 x 10^26 m\n\nWe are now, going to pack atoms side by side and see how many atoms will fit on this diameter of the universe.\n\nGiven the diameter is 2.65 x 10^26,\nthe size of atom 10^-10 m, there are,\n\n2.65 x 10^26\n-----------------\n10^-10\n\n= 2.65 x 10^36 atoms\n\nEstimating the max atoms that will fill a Sphere of this diameter,\n\nUsing 4/3 pi*r^3,\n\n= 4/3 (22/7) (2.65/2 x 10^36)^3\n\n= 9.75 x 10^108 atoms\n\nOridinary matter constitutes 4% of the universe.\n\nSo we have 4/100 * 9.75 x 10^108\n\n= 3.9 x 10^107 atoms\n\nSo one estimate is 3.9 x 10^107 atoms in the universe.

It's a kind of beige.  I'm not kidding.

"Actually, if you get really good in algebra, you can use that skill to do arithmetic better in the real world. You can do things in your head instead of on paper.\n\nHere's a really simple example: let's say that you want to buy three of something that costs $18.  Off the top of your head, you don't know what 3 x 18 is.  BUT! Algebra tells you that multiplication is associative.  So if you think of 18 as 2x9, then you can think:\n\n3 x 18 = 3 x (2 x 9)\n= (3 x 2) x 9 (that's the associative part)\n= 6 x 9\nand then you remember from your multiplication tables that 6 x 9 is 54.  So you'll pay $54.\n\nHere's a more complicated example: You're traveling for 5.5 hours at 65 miles per hour, and want to know how much distance you'll cover (distance = speed x time).\n\nWell, first, 65 x 5.5 = 65 x (55 / 10) = (65 x 55) / 10.  But now, how do you multiply 65 x 55 in your head?  Well, if you've learned about factoring in your algebra class, you can reason based on the ""difference of two squares"":\n\n(a+b)(a-b)=a² - b²\n\n65 x 55 = (60 + 5)(60 - 5)\n= 60² - 5² (there's the difference of two squares factoring coming into play)\n= 3600 - 25 (60 and 5 are easy to square in your head)\n= 3575 (also easy)\n\nSo 65 x 5.5 = 3575 / 10 = 357.5 miles!  And the point is that, with the algebra knowledge, you can do a lot of this in your head -- I wrote it all out for you to read, but you don't have to!"

"Space can be finite and not have an edge either. Think of old video games like ""asteroids."" You can fly in a straight line forever and never come to the edge of the screen. The 2-D space in asteriods ""wraps around"" back at itself. Our 3-D space could be on the surface of a 4-D hypersphere, or a torus or lots of other shapes. Just like stuck in 2-D on the surface of the earth you can walk (and boat) forever in a straight line and never find an edge, the same can apply to the universe.\n\nThere is no ""other side"" because you never reach an ""end"".  Going off the 3-D surface of the hypersphere does not count because you are moving into another dimension, so you are violating the implied premise of the question."

NASA can put an end to this debate by allowing an indenpendent group of scientist to view the Moon from an Earth bound telescope, or use the Hubble telescope.  There is a telescope powerful enough to view the Moon in Chile.  However, you can rent time on this telescope to view space, but unfortunately, you are restricted from looking at the moon.  What are they hiding?  Why won't the US Gov't allow indenpendent scientists to view the Moon with US owned Earth bound telescopes?  Becasue there is nothing on the Moon.  China is preparing to send a man to the Moon by 2012.  Dick Cheney has said on the record that the US needs to get back to the Moon.  Why?  Will the Chinese be the first to put a man on the Moon?\nFrom a logical standpoint, why has no one been to the Moon in the past 30 years?  A lot of people are basing their opinions on nothing but emotion.  It takes scientific evidence to prove your point.  NASA is covering this up by stonewalling independent scientists from viewing the Moon.  However, the truth will eventually come out.  How will this reflect on the US?

excercise eventually decreases the heart rate because the heart gets better conditioned and pumps more efficiently.  Certain medications decrease the heart rate by blocking the stimulation areas of the heart (beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers).  other medicines stimulate the heart and make it beat faster.  Disease can increase the heart rate if it makes the heart have to work harder to pump the blood around, or decrease it if it's things like a heart attack (affecting the heart rate generating area, or the path of the signal) or some electrolyte distrubaces or over medication.

If the four angles at P where PA, PB, PC, and PD meet -- i.e., the four angles APB, BPC, CPD, and DPA -- are all right angles, then using the Pythagorean formula you get\n\nAB = sqrt(1600) = 40\nBC = sqrt(1808) = sqrt(16 * 113) = 4 sqrt(113)\nCD = sqrt(2809) = 53\nDA = sqrt(2601) = 51\n\nArea = (1/2)(PA PB + PB PC + PC PD + PD PA) = 2002\nPerimeter = AB + BC + CD + DA = 144 + 4sqrt(113)\n = 4 ( 36 + sqrt(113) )\n\nActually I iterated a steepest descent search for the best values for those four angles to minimize the sum of the squared differences of the resulting area from 2002 and the sum of angles from 2 pi.  The result converged to all four angles being equal, i.e., being right angles.  Then I just made that assumption and did the math.\n\nWas there a diagram with the original problem that drew APC and BPD as straight lines intersecting at right angles?
Actuarial science applies mathematical and statistical methods to finance and insurance, particularly to the assessment of risk.

This is especially true with respect to the Old Age Survivors and Disability Insurance program in the United States and C/QPP in Canada.\n\nIn the property insurance field which protects against losses like those caused by hurricanes as well as automobile accidents, actuarial science tries to forecast losses to homes and cars.\n\nMore info at: \n\nhttp://www.stat.sfu.ca/about/stat_brochure.pdf\n\nhttp://www.ucalendar.uwaterloo.ca/9596/MATH/act_sci.html\n\nhttp://www.ucalendar.uwaterloo.ca/MATH/act_sci.html\n\nhttp://www.actuary.com/actuarial-science/
Dolphins have hair at one point in their life. When they are born, dolphins have whiskers on their rostrum. A dolphin’s whiskers are about one quarter inch long, and will fall out shortly after birth, as a result of water pressure. Even so, the follicular pits remain open. One can see these follicular pits on the rostrum of any dolphin. They probably serve some sort of sensory function, like the detection of speed or current. Some great whales and one type of river dolphin retain whiskers their entire lives.
In theory, no. You can't just create matter from nothing, so you can't have more than what you started with. In practice, yes. You screwed up in taking your lab measurements, so, while you didn't actually produce more than 100%, you measured that you did.

Depends on the humidity- Your breath has to have enough water vapor in it that it condenses in the air when you breath out.  So, if it is, say, 50 degrees outside but extremely humid, you could see your breath, because the air is already saturated with water and can't hold any more.  But, in very dry air, it has to be significantly colder before you see your breath, because the air can hold a lot more water when it's dry.  However, because cold air can hold less water than warm air, there is a certain point at which you will get condensation no matter how dry the air is..

When radiant energy strikes a surface, two main things occur.\n\n1.  Some portion of the energy is reflected back.  This depends on the emissivity (e) of the material, which ranges from 0 (shiny surface) to 1 (very black surface).\n\n\n2.  Some of the energy is directly changed into heat energy as a direct result of the thermal radiation of the radiant energy.  Furthermore, the heat energy generated by the thermal radiation is distributed from the surface to the rest of the body by means of  heat conduction.

The first 2 billion years of Earth's existence saw some pretty drastic changes, mostly the result of cooling from a molten mass. The remainder of the 4.55 billion years has seen this process continue, and the evolution of life, which likely started soon after the temperatures dropped enough for liquid water to form, has played an important role. Very recently, human activities like agriculture and manufacturing have had some effect. \n\nThe how and why is nothing more than laws of thermodynamics.

Stainless Steel Grades\nWhen an alloy of steel contains more than approximately 10 ½% Chromium it can be classified as a stainless steel. This is because Chromium has a high affinity for Oxygen and forms a stable Oxide film on the surface of the steel. This film is resistant to further chemical or physical change.\nStainless steels can be divided into four major groups, namely Martensitic, Ferritic, Austenitic and Duplex.\n \nMartensitic\nThis group contains a minimum of 12% Chrome and usually a maximum of 14% with Carbon in the range of 0.08 to 2.0%. Due to the high Carbon content of the steel it responds well to heat treatment to give various mechanical strengths, such as hardness. When heat treated this group of steels show a useful combination of corrosion resistance and mechanical properties that qualify them for a wide range of applications. These steels are all magnetic.\nType 410\nA 13% Chrome, 0.15% Carbon alloy possesing good ductility and corrosion resistance. It can be easily forged and machined. Exhibits good cold working properties.\nType 416\nSimilar to Type 410 but has added Sulphur giving improved machinability. Usually supplied in bar form.\nType 431\nA 17% Chrome, 2½% Nickel, 0.15% max Carbon stainless alloy. Has superior corrosion resistance to types 410 & 416 due to the Nickel. Usually supplied in bar form.\n \nFerritic\nThis group contains a minimum of 17% Chrome and Carbon in the range 0.08 – 0.2%. The increase in Chromium gives increased corrosion resistance at high temperatures. However it can not be heat treated therefore its applications are limited. These steels are magnetic.\nType 430\nA 17% Chrome, low alloy Ferritic steel. It has good corrosion resistant properties up to about 800°C. Usually on used in strip and sheet form due to its poor machinability.\n \nAustenitic\nThis group contains Chromium in the range 17 - 25% and Nickel in the range 8 – 20%, with various elements added in an effort to achieve desired properties. When fully annealed this group exhibits a useful range of mechanical and physical properties. These steels are normally non magnetic.\nType 304\nAn economic balance of alloying materials. Excellent corrosion resistance in unpolluted and freshwater environments, though not recommended for seawater.\nType 321\nA variation of Type 304 with titanium added in proportion to the carbon content. This improves its high temperature properties.\nType 347\nVery similar to Type 321 but uses Niobium instead of Titanium.\nType 316\nThe addition of 2 – 3% Molybdenum in this grade gives increased corrosion resistance in offshore environments, however it does pit when immersed in seawater. A nickel content of 12% maintains the austenitic structure.\nType 317\nSimilar to 316 but the 3 – 4% Molybdenum gives increased pitting resistance when immersed in cold seawater.\n6 Moly\nOr as it is more properly known – UNS S31254 – gives high resistance to sea water attack due to high levels of Chromium and Molybdenum.\nL Grades\nMost austenitic grades can be provided as low carbon grades e.g. 316L where carbon is restricted to 0.03 to 0.035%. This reduces the tensile strength.\n \nDuplex\nThis relatively new group has a balance of Chromium, Nickel, Molybdenum and Nitrogen to give a near equal mix of austenite and ferrite. The result is a high strength, highly corrosion resistant material. Recommended extended use within temperature limits of -50 to +300 °C due to embrittlement. They are referred to by UNS numbers, or manufacturer’s trade names.\nUNS S31803\nThe most widely used grade of duplex and is typical of above description. Typical composition is 0.03% max Carbon, 22% Cr, 5.5% Ni, 3% Mo and 0.15% N.\nUNS S32304\nA low alloy duplex with similar corrosion properties to type 316, but with approximately double the tensile properties. Hence its primary use is in structures where mechanical strength is important. Typical composition is 0.03% max Carbon, 23% Cr, 4% Ni and 0.1% N.\nUNS S3275
If the human race started from Adam and Eve, that would imply that their offspring would have had to reproduce with one another.  This is called incest.  You can take the rest from here.  If Humans evolved from apes, monkeys, etc., which is the probable explanation, that would account for our canine teeth.  It's not so bad having a monkey as your relative.  Just don't invite them to any parties.
Well, if the energy is potential energy (in other words, the water is on top of a hill), then you can let the water flow down the hill (converted to kinetic energy) and in so doing, pass it through a turbine to create electricity. This is often done with the use of dams. The water is held back in a lake. As the water is realesed through the damn, it turns the turbines.\n\nCommonly referred to as hydroelectric power.\n\nSide note: If you live near Harper's Ferry, WV they have an incredible display of the power of water. Back before the days of electricity, they hooked a watermill up to a interconected system of pullies and leather straps. Through these, they powered an asortment of different machines such as drills and saws. Basically, a shop full of power tools with no electricity.

draw a dotted line through coordinates (0,3) and (1,3).  This represents the equation Y = 3. \n\nSince the inequality is strictly greater than, the line should be dashed (or dotted).  If it were >= then it would be a solid line.\n\nNow you test each half plane for a true value.  You need a point that is not contained on the line.  How about the origin (that is always the easiest point as long as it is not on the line itself).\n\nIf we plug the point (0,0) into the inequality you get the statement 0 > 3.  Is this a true statement?  No.  Therefore, you shade the half plane that does not contain the origin. If it were true, you would shade the half plane that contains the origin.\n\nHope this helps!

Most coins are made of metals or alloys that will not hold a permanent magnetic field.  You'd need to start by finding a coin made out of an alloy or metal (iron or steel or alnico) that can hold a magnetic charge; then, you just need to put it up against a strong magnetic field (as might be a bar magnet or horseshoe magnet or an electromagnet) for a while.

It's a microtubule stabilizer, so it causes metaphase arrest in dividing cells.  I use it all the time to sychronize tissue culture cells.
All of them stabilize pH (concentration of H+).\n\n1. Carbonic acid (weak acid) dissociates partly bothsides:\nH2O + CO2 <=> H2CO3 <=> HCO3-, H+. Whatever you add, the equilibrium of this reaction shifts to one or another direction and H+ concentration of the solution (acidity) remains the same.\n\na) If you add acid ( more H+ then), a disbalance occurs. Excessive H+ react with HCO3- and a larger quantity of H2CO3 is formed. And it dissociates to water and CO2, neutralising addition of some acid.\n\nb) When a base is added, a part of H+ is removed (H+ and OH- form water, which is neutral). Then also a disbalance occurs, which causes CO2 combination with water, formation of H2CO3 and appearance of new H+. \n \n2. Na2HPO4 <=> 2Na+ + HPO4/2- + H+ <=>  H2PO4-  \nAnalogically, a shift occurs when adding acid or base, neutralising their effect:\na) HCl + Na2HPO4 => NaH2PO4 + NaCl \nb) NaOH + NaH2PO4 --> Na2HPO4 + H2O \n\n3. Different proteins act as buffers. Hemoglobin (located in red blood cells) buffer is one of strongest. Imidazole groups of histidine residues of this protein are most significant for this effect.\n\nHemoglobin without O2 <=> reduced hemoglobin \nReduced hemoglobin takes on H+, decreasing amount of free H+ in solution and the solution becomes not so acid.
Indeed it would be.  An object of about 13 times the mass of Jupiter would be able to sustain core deuterium fusion, and thus be candidate for a brown dwarf.  As far as actuall main sequence (hydrogen fusion) the lowest mass ones should have about 75 times the mass of Jupiter (90 times the mass of jupiter is you are making them out of nothing by hydrogen and helium).

Two types of Spinal Anesthesaia are sub dural and epidural though he former is more or less considered synonymous with spinal. It Spreads along the subdural or epidural space depending on where it is adminsitered. and the nerve fibres exiting from the spinal cord are bathed in the fluids containing the anaethetic agent, which Blocks off the Soidum channels o n the surface membrane of th nerve fibres. which in turn prevent the transmission of nerve impulses by depolarisation via these nerve fibres. And your legs feel numb and heavy. The larger nerve fibres take longer to be affected than the smaler one. Hence you lose Sensations first then  movement as motor nerve fibres are usually larger than pain/sensory fibres.
<Gas solubility> : Henry' s law\n  At higher pressures, gases tend to go into solution.\n(e.g. soda pop)\n  The solubility of gas is directly proportional to the\npressure.\n\n  Henry' s law: Cg = kPg \n(The gas solubility equation )\n\n Cg = solubility of gas (M), k = Henry s law const.\n Pg = partial pressure of the gas\n\nWhere Cg is the molar concentration of the gas in the solution, Pg is the partial pressure of the gas, and k is a solubility constant that is dependent upon the gas and the solvent. As we might predict, k is going to be dependent upon the intermolecular forces between the solvent and the gas.\nThe solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas on the surface of the liquid according to __Henry' s law.__\n\n\n<Solubility of gases in water>\nIt is quite well known that gases are soluble in liquids such as water. The ability of fish to breathe is dependent upon this fact. We bubble air into a fish tank and have water fountains in water purification tanks for the express purpose of improving the effieiency of the solution process. All of our carbonated beverages have their characteristic properties because of the solubility of carbon dioxide in water. We know that a soda left open in a warm room will get flat quickly. All of these observations are dependent upon the solubility of gases in water.
Hi! I am presently a medico on my way to become a doctor. Hope this helps. When u hav a goal of becoming a good doctor remember, that a dedicated doctor doesnot have a life of his own. All the pains u take in the process of becoming 1 is all worth just to have the job satisfaction & the respect in the society. People consider u next to God. What else would u want. Personally I consider the doctor's job next to a soldier's job in nobility. Well about the experiences u hav to bear a lot of odour while dissecting the preserved bodies, blood in surgeries & autopsies. All becomes secondary to the respect & love gained at the end of the race.

Sickle cell is a very sad disease.  The blood cells are sickle shaped..and cause severe pain, anemia, and because they are not carrying enough oxygen, weakness.\n\nThe disease can be tolerable with heavy morphine use by the person.  But, often the pain is so excruciating they get in a really bad sickle cell crisis.  The pain meds by mouth won't work.  So, they have to go in the hospital and get high doses of fluids in their bodies to keep the complications of necrotic joint disease from developing.  This is when it collects in the joints like your shoulder and causes very serious problems.  Also, pain meds in the veins and oxygen to help.  Some have to have blood transfusions.\n\nIt is really important to have a blood test before two blacks marry to rule out the sickle cell trait.  Seeing the young children crippled with this devastating disease is sad.
Bromine Salts are commonly used as reducing agents.  Specially in organic reaction, to reduce carbon double bond and to sythetize organic bromides.

All gases stay within the atmosphere of earth and are not scattered out to space. Earth's gravity is responsible for this.\n\nThe escape velocity v (minimum velocity required by a body to escape out of the Earth's gravitational field) is a function of the acceleration due to gravity g. Now, if the root-mean-square (RMS) speed of the gas particles (atoms and molecules) is less than v, obviously they can not escape the Earth's gravity. All gases which are present in the atmosphere satisfy this condition and therefore they stay with the Earth.

if you know the charge then divide the charge by 1.6 * 10^19 C\nthis the charge on an electron\nso ui shall know the electrons in the oil drop\n\nare you asking this as well:\nThe purpose of Robert Millikan's oil-drop experiment (1909) was to measure the electric charge of the electron. He did this by carefully balancing the gravitational and electric forces on tiny charged droplets of oil suspended between two metal electrodes. Knowing the electric field, the charge on the droplet could be determined. Repeating the experiment for many droplets, it was found that the values measured were always multiples of the same number. This was taken to be the charge on a single electron: 1.602 × 10−19 coulombs (SI unit for electric charge).\n\nIn 1923, Millikan won the Nobel Prize for physics in part because of this experiment. This experiment has since been repeated by generations of physics students, although it is rather expensive and difficult to do properly.\n\nA version of the oil drop experiment has subsequently been used to search for free quarks (which, if they exist, would have a charge of 1/3 e), without success. Current theories of quarks predict that they are tightly bound and will not exist in a free form, however it is interesting to note that in Millikan's original notebooks he observed and recorded the existence of an oil droplet which had a +1/3 partial charge, which he at the time dismissed as an error.

"Originally, there was enough to feed 135 people for 28 days, so 135 * 28 = 3,780 daily rations.\n\nAfter 9 days, there were 135 * 19 = 2,565 daily rations.  Now there are 36 additional people, making 135 + 36 = 171 people.  New rations are 3/4 the original size, so there are 4/3 * 2,565 = 3,420 ""new rations"".\n\n3,420 ""new rations"" / 171 people = 20 days.  Add back the original 9, and the food lasts 29 days."
They will if they are near each other when the female is in heat or looking for a mate.  This is one reason why most animals have an in-built tendency to leave the family group when they mature.\n\nIn some animals, the young disperse as far as possible, thus avoiding their siblings.  In many herd species, the males are forced out of the herd when they reach maturity, sometimes forming their own small herds until they can find a new herd full of new blood that they can join.\n\nWhen dispersal routes are blocked by human development, or when populations get low enough that there is little choice in mate selection, incestuous breeding does indeed occur.  In many parts of Africa, the cheetahs are now so inbred that a skin graft taken from one cheetah can be put on another cheetah with virtually no chance of rejection.  There is so little genetic variance that they are nearly clones of each other.
The Earth & the Sun are about the same age.  The Sun formed first and the Earth was formed out of the dust and clouds that the infant sun spewed forth as it was forming.

"Steam locomotives were huge railroad engines that drew long ""trains"" of railroad cars.  The word locomotive stems from Latin locus (place) + motio (motion).  Dimensional analysis is used to test scale models of steamships (etc.) that can be towed in model tanks to discover how the full-sized ship will perform (before it is built!).  For example, water exhibits a surface tension that may have nil effect on a large ship but must be accounted for on the model to correctly interpret test results."
Over the past hundred years or so, there have been more than a dozen expeditions into the deep jungles of the Congo basin in search of an allegedly dinosaur-like creature called Mokele Mbembe.\n\nRedmond O'Hanlon's account of his failed expedition (Congo Journey, 1996) makes for excellent reading, even though they didn't find anything.\n\nThe 1992 British expedition with William Gibbons has one photograph that in rather unusual, and it is claimed that it may be the head of a Mokele Mbembe.\n\nA 1987 Japanese expedition has some amazingly awful, blurry video footage that they claim is one of the beasts moving slowly through the water, but most of those who have seen it says it looks more like a boat with two people in it, one of whom is standing up.\n\nA 1980 American expedition has some castings of what may be footprints, that appear to be round with three sharp claws on them.  There's no known critter that leaves prints like that.\n\nThere have also been numerous 'sightings' of giant flying reptiles around the world.  It has been spotted in tropical Africa, the US Southwest, Mexico, the Andean highlands of South America and tropical New Guinea.  Dubbed Kangamato by cryptozoologists, some have tried to claim they are surviving remnants of pterosaurs, but there is little to no hard evidence for their existence, and they may well be Byakhee instead.\n\nOther than Nessie, Champie, Ogopogo and other lake critters that have varying degrees of evidence for their existence, those are about the best documented sightings of prehistoric-type reptiles.
"When a new object is discovered the International Astronomical Union (IAU) gives it a temporary designation based on the date it was first seen. Thus 2003 UB313 can be decoded to tell you that the data from which the object was discovered was obtained in the second half of October 2003. Next, depending on what the object is, the discoverers propose a certain type of permanent name.\n\nThe planet's temporary name is 2003 UB313. The name ""Xena"" is frequently heard associated with this planet; this name comes from an internal cod name that we used before we publically announced the existence of the planet. We use these names internally simply because they are easier to say and remember than things like 2003 EL61 or S/2005 (2003 UB313) 1 . There is no chance whatsoever that these will become the permanent names of these objects! As soon as the committees make their decisions these objects will get real names."

Mentos most likely have some base in them that is reacting with the acid to form water, some salt/s, and the release of a gas, most likely carbon dioxide.  Foam is just gas escaping from a liquid.
When a space probe passes around a planet the orbital energy of the spacecraft relative to the planet will remain constant and so from the point of view of the planet the spacecraft will not be moving any faster on the way out as it was on the way in.\n\nBut the planet orbits the sun and when one looks at the trajectory from a sun centered point of view then the momentum of the spacecraft is greater on the way out then it is on the way in.\n\nFor conservation of momentum to hold the planet must lose the same amount of momentum as the spacecraft gained.  Of course since planets are typically many orders of magnitude heavier than space probes the change in the orbit of the planet is so small that we can't detect it.
The periodic table is divided into sections by chemists in order to make it easier to talk about elements that behave in similar fashions.  The periodic table makes this possible by organizing elements by the number of electrons in each orbital.  The transition metals, the family that platinum and Iridium both belong in, is made up of elements that in their elemental (as opposed to compound) form have a d orbitals as their last filled orbital.  This gives them some similar properties and ways in which they will react.  Which is why scientists call them families.
according to scientists that preach the THEORY of evolution. we evolved from other animals that evolved from single celled organisms that evolved from a puddle of goo that contained the building blocks of life. problem is that the puddle of goo either came from dissolving rocks or a form of acid rain caused by the volcanoes of the time period.\nso basically scientists believe we evolved from rocks or magma.\n\ni think the idea That we were Created by God much more logical. considering the order thoughout the universe.

"The Legend of the Jackalope:\n\nThe jackalope is said to be a hybrid of the pygmy-deer and a species of killer-rabbit. Reportedly, jackalopes are extremely shy unless approached. It has also been said that the jackalope can convincingly imitate any sound, including the human voice. It uses this ability to elude pursuers, chiefly by using phrases such as ""There he goes! That way!"". Although no jackalope has ever been captured alive, it is said that a jackalope may be caught by putting a flask of whiskey out at night. The jackalope will drink its fill of whiskey, and its intoxication will make it easier to hunt. It is also legend that the Cherokee Indians would eat these at the end of a vision quest."

Its not easy as you will need to obtain a queen ant before you can start the colony. Making the nest is easy just a perspex box with soil in, make it about 3 inch wide but it needs to be big, they will make there own channels & you can see them in the box living there life.Plus you need a food source. Depends on what type of ants you gets, Ants can be herbivores & Carnivores.So best to try & get leaf cutter ants or something.

You would like to improve your memory, but you don’t know where to begin to accomplish a greater memory. \n\n\nDifferent parts of the brain, handle different types of remembering tasks, such as recalling a person’s phone number versus remembering a person’s car. \n\nPeople tend to remember things differently through the use of dreferential senses, which means seeing something versuses hearing it. \n\nThis approach acknowledges, that specific memory stategies, are appropriate for different memory tasks. Memory strategies must be talented, to meet the individual’s memory needs. \n\nThis approach also recognizes that memory can be affected by many factors, including cognitive, which involves knowledge about memory strategies and some non-cognitive, which deals with such \n\nthings as overall fitness, mood and health. \n\n\nThere’s a method of memory called the Holistic view of memory. This approach is based on the concept of an individual’s memory readiness. \n\n\nScientists and health-care say that memory readiness can be improved, with a person’s attitude physical condition, their \n\nemotional state, conversational skills and the use of physical memory aids. These aids can be used in improving practical memory performance. \n\n\nTests have shown that monentary memory can vary at particular times, which can happen during the course of the day, course of the week or month. \n\n\nPeople tend to believe that their memory skills, are poorer than they really are. \n\n\nImproving your memory can be done at anytime. It doesn’t matter if your young, old, brilliant or average. Your memory can still be improved to remember better. \n\n\nThere’s no magic pill that can be taken to improve ones memory. To improve one’s memory, a person has to access the state of various memory abilities and then this adds to a person’s memory \n\nskills one at a time. \n\n\nSometimes if a person is stressed or has a cold their memory can be affected. Some nutritionists believe that vitamins help improve memory. \n\n\nThere are various memory techniques, that a person can do to improve their memory. \n\n\nOne method is the mnemonics method. This method is used for remembering information, that’s otherwise quite difficult to recall. The principle of mnemonics, is to use as many of the \n\nbest functions of the human brain, as possible to code information into the memory. The mnemonics method uses the human brain that’s used to code and interpret complex stimuli-images, colour, structure, sounds, smells, tastes, touch, emotion and languages. The brain uses these to make sophisticated interpretations, of the environment. These features are what the \n\nhuman memory is made of. \n\n\nInformation presented to the brain to be remembered,is all from one source, which is normally words on a page. Language or words \n\non a page reflects, are of the most important aspect of the human evolution. Mnemonics seeks to use all of these resources, by coding the language and the numbers in sophisticated striking \n\nimages, which flow into stronger images then are actually coded. Both information and structure of the information which is, to be recalled later. This method is simple and easy to understand. Remembering names is important, but such things as remembering, a pack of cards is just an amusing sideline. \n\n\nWhen remembering a person’s name, you can improve memory by using face association. With this technique, when you are introduced to a person examine the person’s face. Find an unusual ffeature of the person’s face. Create an association with the person’s face and the name will be in your memory. Also use repetition \n\nwhen being introduced, ask for the name to be repeated, use the name yourself, as much as possible. The more you hear the person’s name, the more the name will sink in your memory. \n\n\nW
Electrophoresis is the movement of an electrically charged substance under the influence of an electric field. This movement is due to the Lorentz force, which may be related to fundamental electrical properties of the body under study and the ambient electrical conditions by the equation given below. F is the Lorentz force, q is the charge carried by the body, E is the electric field [1]:\n\n. \nThe resulting electrophoretic migration is countered by forces of friction such that the rate of migration is constant in a constant and homogeneous electric field:\n\n \nWhere v is the velocity and f is the frictional coefficient.\n\n \nThe electrophoretic mobility μ is defined as followed.\n\n \nThe expression above applied only to ions at a concentration approaching 0 and in a non-conductive solvent. Polyionic molecules are surrounded by a cloud of counterions which alter the effective electric field applied on the ions to be separated. This render the previous expression a poor approximation of what really happens in an electrophoretic aparatus.\n\nThe mobility depends on both the particle properties (e.g., surface charge density and size) and solution properties (e.g., ionic strength, electric permittivity, and pH). For high ionic strengths, an approximate expression for the electrophoretic mobility is given by the Smoluchowski equation,\n\n, \nwhere ε is the dielectric constant of the liquid, ε0 is the permitivitty of free space, η is the viscosity of the liquid, and ζ is the zeta potential (i.e., surface potential) of the particle.

Radioactive waste is waste material containing radioactive chemical elements that does not have a practical purpose. It is sometimes the product of a nuclear process, such as nuclear fission. The majority of radioactive waste in mass and volume terms is low level waste which is often items such as used protective clothing which is only slightly contaminated.\n \n \n\n\n\nNORM (naturally occurring radioactive material)\nProcessing of substances containing natural radioactivity, this is often known as NORM. Much of this waste is alpha particles emitting matter from the decay chains of uranium and thorium.\n\n\nCoal contains a small amount of radioactive nuclides, such as uranium and thorium, but it is less than the average concentration of those elements in the Earth's crust. They become more concentrated in the fly ash because they do not burn well [1]. However, the radioactivity of fly ash is still very low. It is about the same as black shale and is less than phosphate rocks, but is more of a concern because a small amount of the fly ash ends up in the atmosphere where it can be inhaled.[2].\n\n\nOil and gas\nResidues from the oil and gas industry often contain radium and its daughters. The sulphate scale from an oil well can be very radium rich, while the water, oil and gas from a well often contains radon. The radon decays to form solid radioisotopes which form coatings on the inside of pipework. In an oil processing plant the area of the plant where propane is processed is often one of the more contaminated areas of the plant as radon has a similar boiling point as propane.[3]\n\nMineral processing\nWastes from mineral processing can contain natural radioactivity.\n\n\nMedical\nRadioactive medical waste tends to contain beta ray and gamma ray emitters. It can be divided into two main classes. In diagnostic nuclear medicine a number of short-lived gamma emitters such as 99mTc are used. Many of these can be disposed of by leaving it to decay for a short time before disposal as normal trash. :\n\n\n\nIndustrial\nIndustrial source waste can contain alpha, beta, neutron or gamma emitters. Gamma emitters are used in radiography while neutron emitting sources are used in a range of applications, such as oil well logging.[4]\n\nNuclear fuel cycle\nAn overview of waste from the nuclear fuel cycle was written by B.V. Babu and S. Karthik, Energy Education Science and Technology, 2005, 14, 93-102.\n\n\nFront end\nWaste from the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle is usually alpha emitting waste from the extraction of uranium. It often contains radium and its decay products.\n\nUranium dioxide (UO2) concentrate from mining is not very radioactive - only a thousand or so times as radioactive as the granite used in buildings. It is refined from yellow cake (U3O8), then converted to uranium hexafluoride gas (UF6). As a gas, it undergoes enrichment to increase the 235U content from 0.7% to about 3.5% (LEU). It is then turned into a hard ceramic oxide (UO2) for assembly as reactor fuel elements.\n\nThe main by-product of enrichment is depleted uranium (DU), principally the 238U isotope, with a 235U content of ~0.3%. It is stored, either as UF6 or as U3O8. Some is used in applications where its extremely high density makes it valuable, such as the keels of yachts, and anti-tank shells. It is also used (with recycled plutonium) for making mixed oxide fuel (MOX) and to dilute highly enriched uranium from weapons stockpiles which is now being redirected to become reactor fuel. This dilution, also called downblending, means that any nation or group that acquired the finished fuel would have to repeat the (very expensive and complex) enrichment process before assembling a weapon.\n\n\nThe back end of the of the nuclear fuel cycle, mostly spent fuel rods, often contains fission products that emit beta and gamma radiation, and may contain actinides that emit alpha particles, such as 234U, 237Np, 238Pu and 241Am, and even sometimes some neutron

"Hey! I am a neurosurgeon, and it's... well, it's really fun. Assuming you like that sort of thing. Which I do. :)\n\nThere are different sorts of books out there, and I have a few recommendations:\n\n- BEST place to start: Women in Neurological Surgery (WINS) produces a pamphlet called ""So You Want to Be a Neurosurgeon"" which details everything you need to know about becoming a neurosurgeon. Link is below.\n\n- ""Principles of Neural Science"" by Kandel and Schwarz is a good basic neuroscience textbook, now in its 3rd edition, that you will end up using if you take almost *any* neuroscience courses in university. It may be a bit above your level at the moment but it is a good basic read, especially the first chapters.\n\n- ""Complications"" by Atul Gawande is not specifically a neurosurgical book, but it is a really excellent collection of essays about some of the ethical and moral issues of medicine and surgery, particularly with regards to training. It is a fascinating read, and was written by a general surgical trainee.\n\n- ""When The Air Hits Your Brain"" by Frank Vertosick is an interesting peek into the life of a neurosurgery resident. Having been through residency myself, I can say this is pretty true-to-life, and covers the tough bits, the funny bits, and the heart-breaking bits. It does contain a fair bit of profanity. But then, so does your average surgical residency program, sadly! :)\n\n- ""The Healing Blade"" talks about the work of Robert Spetzler, a very famous vascular neurosurgeon (does aneurysms, etc.) still practicing at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Texas.\n\n- there is also lots of good, easily understandable information about neurosurgical disease available on websites like Brain Injury Support, Brain Tumour Foundation, etc.\n\n- www.neurosurgery.org is a fun place to poke around.\n\nFinally, if you want to message with any specific questions, feel free. Good luck - it's a long road, but it really is a great, highly rewarding career."

No. Not all animals bleed red.\n\nWarm-blooded animals have red blood because they have the pigment hemoglobin.   Hemoglobin is the pigment in warm-blooded animals that carries oxygen molecules from the lungs throughout the body.\nHemoglobin is red, related to the iron atom at the center of the molecule.  \n\nInsect blood, for example, does not have hemoglobin, and is clear ... although it can appear green or yellow, most likely from chlorophyll from the plants it eats.  (Chlorophyll is the pigment in plants used for photosynthesis.)\n\nInterestingly, the chlorophyll molecule in plants is very similar to the hemoglobin.   The main difference is that chlorophyll has a magnesium atom in the center, rather than iron, and this is what makes chlorophyll green, while hemoglobin is red.

The chiasmata is wrong answer.  Chiasmata is formed during meiosis. The correct answer is conjugation since this a direct process of exchange genetic information from bacteria to bacteria. Transduction is the transfer of viral, bacterial, or both bacterial and viral DNA from one cell to another via bacteriophage.
It is irrelevant that the terminal ray is pointing whatever number.  tan(0) is just always 0.\n\nQuestion: Rewrite x in radian as quantity in degree.\nAnswer: We use the ratio pi(radian):180(degree).\nIf we let d be the quantity in degree for x in radian, we can find d from the following ratio equation.\n\nx(radian) : d(degree) = pi(radian) : 180(degree)\n=> (pi)d = 180(x)\n=> d = 180(x)/pi\n\nIn your question, x = 3pi/4.  Hence, d = 180(3pi/4)/pi = 135 (degree).

Some of the answers above are correct but with inaccurate explanations.\n\nAway from earth's surface (a good approximation is sea-level), distance decreases its gravitational pull.\n\nBut, under earth's surface, distance also decreases gravitational pull.  At the center of earth, its gravitational pull is zero or negligibly small.\n\nEven at the same elevation, gravity has small variations at different locations.  The variations are small enough for us to detect.  But there exists super sensitive people who can detect those variations.\n\nThe safe guess is that Mt. McKinley has lower gravitational pull.  But to be sure, we need to do measurements there and at the Red Sea.

Almost all the invertabrates are edible-and most are eaten by one culture or another, but lets assume you are making a menu for an American group- Common inverts that the average American would eat would include clams, scallops, lobster, crab, maybe escargot (snails), calimari (squid), shrimp, all sorts of mussels, especially in soup.\nMore exotic, but still found in Western countries would be, for example, chocolate-covered ants, sea urchin, octopus (especially in sushi).  \nIn a lot of countries, fried large grubs are eaten, worms, any sort of insect.  The one class of invert that is rarely eaten are the spiders, centipedes, millipede family, because they are often toxic or carry parasites that can infect people.
"While snow is ice it is not as dense as normal ice or an ice cube.  The molecules in an ice cube have formed without much air, which allows them to bond very closely to each other when water turns into a solid.  Snow on the other hand forms in air and the molecules are not as densely packed - which gives it many edges to refract light and thus the ""white"" appearance."
"For most of the twentieth century, coffee was decaffeinated with dichloromethane, CH2Cl2. Dichloromethane selectively dissolves caffeine without carrying off sugars, peptides, and flavor ingredients, so it removes coffee's buzz without changing its taste. However, it is somewhat toxic, and when evidence suggested that it might be carcinogenic, its use was sharply curtailed.\n\nEthyl acetate was used as a replacement for dichloromethane during the 80's and early 90's. Although it too is moderately toxic, coffee makers touted ethyl acetate as ""natural"" because it was present in fruit.\n\nA nontoxic and more environmentally benign solvent than either dichloromethane or ethyl acetate is now used: supercritical fluid carbon dioxide. \n\nWhen a sealed vial containing both gaseous and liquid carbon dioxide under high pressure is heated, the liquid density drops while the gas density rises. If the pressure is above 72.8 atm, and the temperature rises above 304.2 K, the density of the liquid and the density of the gas become identical. The meniscus between the liquid and gas phases vanishes. The carbon dioxide becomes a supercritical fluid which has both gaslike and liquidlike properties. The fluid fills the container like a gas, but can dissolve substances like a liquid. Supercritical fluid carbon dioxide is an excellent nonpolar solvent for many organic compounds, including caffeine.\n\nThe extraction process is simple. Supercritical carbon dioxide is forced through green coffee beans. Its gaslike behavior allows it to penetrate deep into the beans, and it dissolves 97-99% of the caffeine present. The caffeine is valuable, and coffee manufacturers usually try to recover it. The caffeine-laden CO2 is sprayed with high pressure water and caffeine is then isolated by a variety of methods, including charcoal adsorption, distillation, recrystallization, or reverse osmosis.\nReferences\n\nO'Brien, M.J., Spence, J.E., Skiff, R.H., Vogel, G.

Actually, chupacabra are an unusual prosimian primate, genetically modified for a phlebotomous lifestyle by American scientists in the early sixties.  \n\nThe chupacabra was originally intended to be released into Cuba as part of a ploy to demoralize the people and topple Castro.  As most elaborate CIA plots, this one failed as the chupacabra escaped during the final testing phase in the American southwest.\n\nEssentially, the chupacabra is a sifaka, but with four razor sharp incisors with which it can slice a small wound.  Its saliva is an anti-coagulant and keeps blood flowing long enough for the chupacabra to take a meal.  Then the chupacabra bounds away quickly, back to the trees to digest its meal.  Sometimes two or more chupacabra will attack one animal.  The more of them that attack, the more likely they will go beserk with bloodlust and start shredding their prey.\n\nThe reason they are seldom seen is their ability to remain completely motionless while they are digesting their meal.  Hanging high in a tree, they resemble largish, hairy coconuts, and often go unnoticed.  Even in areas where coconuts are rare, and unhairy, few people actually look up high in the trees for the critter, and even if they see the hairy ball, they rarely connect it to the cattle mutilations.\n\nEither that or they're completely made up.  That would also explain why they're so hard to find.
a greenhouse is a small building made of glass.  Sunlight, which can pass through the glass, hits something in the greenhouse and is converted to heat.  The heat cannot pass back through the glass.  \n\nSame thing happens with the Earth.  Light from the sun passes through the atmosphere.  when it hits the ground it is converted into heat.  Most of the heat can't get back through the atmosphere, but alot does escape.\n\nSo as emmissions increase, the atmosphere is changed and more and more heat is trapped on Earth - possibly making the Earth warmer and inducing climate change.\n\nThat is the greenhouse effect

"""Electromagnetic radiation from space is unable to reach the surface of the Earth except at a very few wavelengths, such as the visible spectrum, radio frequencies, and some ultraviolet wavelengths. Astronomers can get above enough of the Earth's atmosphere to observe at some infrared wavelengths from mountain tops or by flying their telescopes in an aircraft. Experiments can also be taken up to altitudes as high as 35 km by balloons which can operate for months. Rocket flights can take instruments all the way above the Earth's atmosphere for just a few minutes before they fall back to Earth, but a great many important first results in astronomy and astrophysics came from just those few minutes of observations. For long-term observations, however, it is best to have your detector on an orbiting satellite ... and get above it all!""\n\nFor those frequencies that do get through, it's a lot cheaper to build the telescopes on the earth, even if you do need to put a lot of effort into correcting the wobble in the images caused by turbulence in the atmosphere.

Why ME of course, silly boy!
First of all :\n I would like to inform you that in Paradise believing men and women will be showered with blessings; there is no room for discrimination based on sex in Paradise. The life of women in jannah will be as pleasant and happy as the life of men. Allah is not partial to any sex. He created both of them and He will take care of both of them according to their needs and desires. Let us all work to achieve the jannah and then, in sha’ Allah, we will find there what will satisfy all of us fully.\n\n\nSecond :\n it is untrue that Muslim men are the only ones that get companions in heaven. The main reason why the Quran and hadith are stressing the fact that men will get virgin girls is because it more appealing to men than promising virgin men to women. Men are more sexually active and therefore are facing a lot of difficulty (especially in the teenage years) to remain chaste. There are a lot of temptations in this world. That is why that Allah keeps promising these virgin girls who are more superior to the women of this world to those that remain patient and steadfast. That way, this motivates the unmarried men to remain chaste and be patient because they know  they have something better waiting for them in the next life.

OK - this is easier this way - The number of nickles is one less than 3 times the sum of dimes and nickles.  Get rid of that one less by adding another nickle to the calculation and making it 64 coins and $5.50.  \n\nNow the equation is 3 times the amount of nickles to the sum of the amount of quarters and dimes makes $5.50.\n\nBasically that means 3 times a number, plus that same number (which is really three times and one time is 4 times) makes 64 coins. So to make it easier, 4 times that number makes 64 coins. - and when you divide 64 by 4 - you get 16.\n\nNow back to the original equation - you have 3 times as many nickles as you have the sum of dimes and quarters - so 3 times 16 is 48.  48 times $.05 is $2.40.\n\nSubtract $2.40 from $5.50 and you are left with $3.10.  \n\nNow, 16 coins have to equal that $3.10.  if there were an equal amount of dimes and quarters the amount would be $2.80 - so there must be more quarters than dimes to make that amount higher - the answer is 10quarters - 6 DIMES\n\nI'm sorry about the explanation - its usually easier for someone to show another than to type it to them. :)
Warm air in the atmosphere tends to rise, as a result of is lower density.  Warm air is also able to hold more water vapor in it than cooler air.  As the air rises, it cools due to adiabatic expansion, until it reaches the saturation point -  the temperature at which it can no longer keep any more vapor in it.  The moisture condenses out of the air and forms the clouds.\n\nFor some online sources on cloud formation, check these sites.

"An open-minded question.\n\nYes, putting billions of years as an estimated date on the formation of the Universe is ""jumping to conclusions."" That's what scientists do. They look at the evidence, and draw conclusions. It is not ""jumping"" in the sense that they are doing so without weighing any or all evidence. But it is weighing *all the evidence we have available*. If some new evidence presents itself, then absolutely YES, scientists will re-examine their conclusions. That's what they do. They LOVE doing that. They give out Nobel prizes and professorships and big raises for doing that (re-examining conclusions based on new evidence).\n\nYes, according to Einstein (and others), time is very flexible. And according to Hawking (and others), the structure of time in the early moments of the universe was very different than it is now. But they gave precise equations that describe the limits of this flexibility and early strangeness. Time is flexible, but not completely whacked. Based on *what we know so far* about the speed of light, and what we see in telescopes, etc. etc. scientists estimate that the universe is about 13.7 billion years old. It may be as young as 10 billion years, or as old as 20 billion. But any theory about physics that place the age as low as, say, 1 billion years would have *huge* problems with the current evidence ... e.g. we have rocks and fossils on the Earth that are older than that. A theory that places the age at 1 million years has to contend with evidence that we have found man-made stone tools older than that. And a theory that reaches the conclusion of 100,000 years would have much more fossil evidence, and archaeological artifacts to contend with, plus the fact that our galaxy alone is more than 100,000 light-years across. But a contention that the universe (or even the earth, or even the human species) came into being less than 10,000 years ago, is beyond problematic. It is an insult to even call it a scientific theory.\n\nNow ... it is *possible* that some evidence might arise tomorrow in some journal that describes some enormous time dilation that has fooled us into seeing 10-thousand years as 10-billion. But until then, scientists have to go on what evidence they have.\n\nAnd by the way, scientists do *not* say that ""atoms got together magically."" The word ""magically"" does not appear in science. They have theories, based on what we know about subatomic physics, and based on *evidence* of how atoms form in extremely high-energy conditions (evidence gathered in those particle accelerators) that mimic what may have been the first micro-seconds of the Universe. What they don't know, they admit they don't know ... such as what happened in the first trillionths of a second of the univese. But they keep looking.\n\nTo answer your question ... ""Science can afford to be wrong?"" The answer is Yes! Absolutely! The history of science is preciesly about giving ""an actual picture of the Universe that would be found wrong"", and then fixing that picture. Over and over. Better and better. That's what scientists do. That is one path (but not the only path) to Truth."
Newts are one type of salamander.  They are tailed amphibians that live in or near water.  They are members of the Family Salamandridae (the 'true' salamanders and newts), but there are three suborders and ten other families of salamanders as well.\n\nNewts are characterized by the lack of costal grooves down the sides of their bodies, which the other 'true' salamanders in their family have.\n\nSome salamanders in several of the families (especially Ambystomatidae - the mole salamanders) sometimes exhibit a developmental adaptation known as paedomorphosis, in which they retain certain juvenile characters into adulthood (a process also known as neoteny).  In the case of most salamanders, these juvenile characters are the gills that larval salamanders possess that allow them to breathe water.  In the presence of a stable, deep water body, some of the salamanders will keep their gills, and continue living underwater instead of moving to a potentially dangerous terrestrial existence.  These neotenous salamanders are known as axolotls.

"Most circuit breakers are thermal devices that when excess current run through them they heat up and trip (open up). They can also be used as a switch to open a circuit.\n\nA contactor is a electric relay that is essentially a solenoid and a pair of electrical contacts. The solenoid is activated and it closes the contacts. They are typically used to permit a low voltage circuit or small switch to activate the solenoid so the much larger ""switch"" in the form of the contacts can close a higher voltage or higher amperage circuit. They can also be used for remote control of a electrical circuit.\n\nA good example if the starter solenoid on your car. It is really a contactor activated by the turning of the key to start the car. The amperage to run the starter motor is relatively large and requires relatively large wiring and a ""large"" switch."
Two, actually- One was a simple water heater for a cabin of mine, using a rooftop black insulated tub with a large clear cover-the sun heated the water, and I was able to take a warm shower at night- The other was a triple paned greenhouse made out of 3mm plastic- It was an experiment I did to see how long I could keep a greenhouse going in the winter here in Manitoba.  The cost of either was negligible.
In short, yes but not significant if I recall correctly.\n\nthere is a small shift in blood presure between measurement in the arms and measurement in the legs.  \nBlood pressure itself is measured during systolic and diastolic stages in the heart cardiac cycle.  \n\nAs blood travels away from the heart it experiences resistance to flow through vascular flow resistance - turbulance, etc... This reduces flow (but increases blood velocity), and increases blood pressure.\n\nAlso, under the force of gravity, blood pressure tends to be higher in lower extremeties due to blood compression towards the leg (although blood is pulsatile and valves built into vascular architecture tend to stop most of this.\n\nThis results in a slightly higher reading in lower extremeties.\n\nTaking blood pressure readings in arms and comparing to that in legs is a good indicator of stenosis and such problems on cardiology.  A drastic reduction in blood pressure in the leg when comapred to that in the arm is a good indicator of vascular blockage in femoral regions (typical) or typically, stenosis.\n\nPlease check this as my recollection on this may be a bit hazzy and it is late.
Conium maculatum (Hemlock or Poison Hemlock), the most common of several species of hemlock noted for their toxicity. contains the alkaloids Coniine, N-methylconiine, conhydrine, pseudoconhydrine and g-coniceïne. The most important and toxic of these is Coniine. Coniine is a neurotoxin, which disrupts the workings of the central nervous system and is toxic to people and all classes of livestock.Conium maculatum has been introduced and naturalised in many other areas, including much of Asia, North America and Australia. Poison hemlock is often found on poorly drained soils, particularly near streams, ditches, and other surface water.

anything that endothermically dissolves in water would fit the first request - i think salt would work - but it can actually cause afrost burn on bare skin, so that's probably a bad idea. also, the person would have to get wet and then put the gel on. sorry, best i could do.
you like the bad-for-you stuff because back in the hunter-gatherer days storing fat was very desirable. you didn't know where your next meal was coming from. it's a reward pathway built into the brain.\n\nnow food is easily accessible and we don't have to worry about it, but high-energy-content foods like fats and sugars are still very desirable from the body's standpoint because it's always looking to store up for the future.
OK.\n\nTo start from basics\n\nThe human body is made up mostly of cells. Cells are mostly microscopic bubbles of oil with salt water inside them. That accounts for 99% for what a cell is. The rest of the cell is the ‘important’ stuff that keeps the cell active and allows it to communicate and so forth.  And most of that stuff is protein.\n\nA protein is a molecule comprising a chain of smaller molecules called amino acids. There are millions of different types of proteins, and they are the basic machinery of living organisms. Proteins digest food, and they burn food to produce energy, they break down waste and move materials into and out of cells and they carry oxygen around the bloodstream. The chemical engines that make up muscles are proteins, so proteins are also entirely responsible for movement. Basically if something changes inside the human body, proteins are responsible.\n\nProteins also make up most of the structure in the human body. Cells really are just bags of oil containing salt water, they have no structural integrity of their own. They rely on protein fibres both within the cell and between cells to allows them to maintain their shape. Your body maintains it shape because of proteins.\n\nSo what happens when you get burned?  Well the first thing that happens is that the proteins break down. The arrangement of the amino acids molecules gets shaken up and the proteins lose their shape, and without their shape they become non functional, useless. And because all the functions of a cell depend on proteins the cells themselves become nonfunctional. Just as importantly the structural proteins break down and lose shape. That results in the cells and tissues losing their shape. \n\nThat breakdown of proteins is what is technically termed denaturation. The more common term is ‘cooking’. When we cook animals food we are largely trying to break down the proteins so that they are easier to digest. That is why cooked food is more tender than raw food, because the structural proteins have been smashed to pieces by the heat. A burn is nothing more or less than cooking of living tissue.\n\nThe first proteins to suffer from a burn are usually those on the surface of the cell. Those proteins are either embedded in the cell membrane with one end sticking out, or they are just sitting on the surface waiting for molecules to come by to react with. Either way, they cook.  The cooking of the surface proteins has one immediate effect: it disrupts water balance. Those proteins were responsible for pumping water and salt in and out of the cell to maintain the correct balance. Once they are damaged water and salts leak into and out of the cell at will.\n\nThe most noticeable effect of this is damage is in the formation of blisters. Water, salt and even proteins leak freely into the damaged area because the proteins that are supposed to prevent it have been cooked into inactivity. We see that as a buildup of plasma under the skin: a blister.\n\n\nThe second thing that occurs if the heat is applied for long enough is that the cells rupture. They are after all just little bags of salt water. As soon as they heat up the bags rupture and spill their watery contents. If they are heated to over 100oC the water inside vaporises.  As a result the cells lose their shape and lose any ability to function. They die. Now we have not just damaged leaking cells but dead and decaying cells. That presents a very real chance of infection if the area is large enough.\n\nFinally if the heat is applied for long enough and intense enough the structural proteins break down. The structural proteins are usually pretty tough, but they will cook eventually. When that happens the burned area loses its structural integrity. We can see this as the skin peeling off a serious burn. Without the protein strands holding the skin together it turns into mush. If the heat is very severe the underlying tissue also suffer destruction of structural tissue and becomes a
a case control study is one in which something (eg. a disease or exposure) is studied by finding a number of cases of that disease or exposure. Each case is matched with a similar control case (ie. same age, sex, etc) which lacks the disease or exposure.
At a certain altitude (25,200 miles) it takes exactly 24 hours to orbit the Earth.  Since the Earth turns in 24 hours, the satellite appears to stay over the exact same longitude.\n\nIt is important also to have the orbit lie along the equator.  If the orbit is at an angle to the equator, the satellite will appear to move north and south throughout the day.  \n\nOnce a satellite is in this geosynchronous (moves at the same speed as the Earth) or geostationary (hovers over the same point on the surface of the Earth) orbit, we can aim a satellite dish at it and not have to move the dish.\n\nThis works when you have a good line of sight to the geostationary orbit.  Countries that are far to the north and south don't have a good line of sight.  In the 60's, the USSR used to launch communications satellites in polar orbit.  Their satellite dishes had to swing slowly south to track the satellite, then swing quickly north to meet the next one when it came over the horizon.  If you needed a system like that in the US, satellite television would be too complicated and too expensive for the average homeowner.
Chlorophyl alone would not suffice. You should get the whole bunch of genes needed to build the photosynthetic machinery. And before you think that sticking chloroplasts inside animal cells will do, think again. Chloroplasts are the product of many hundreds of millions of years of evolution. Most of their genetic info (their genes) have migrated to the cell nuclei. So, you dhould get not only the chloroplasts, but also the rest of the genes that moved out of them. A pretty difficult task to current science. \n\nAlthough, nature has an interesting example of such a mixture: a particular kind of slug (I don´t remember the species) can actually eat green algae, seize their chloroplasts and accumulate them right below their skin. Eventually, this chloroplasts die (mostly due to the lack of essential genes to keep them alive for long periods) but in the meantime, the slug can actually live on photosynthesis. Maybe you can find something on the www.

A Field Programmable Gate Array or FPGA is a semiconductor device containing programmable logic components and programmable interconnects. The programmable logic components can be programmed to duplicate the functionality of basic logic gates such as AND, OR, XOR, NOT or more complex combinatorial functions such as decoders or simple math functions. In most FPGAs, these programmable logic components (or logic blocks, in FPGA parlance) also include memory elements, which may be simple flip-flops or more complete blocks of memories.

It really depends on the organism. Some have behavioral adaptations to avoid inbreeding, but in general one should assume that animals (except the ones with very large brains and social structures) don't have the capacity to recognize kin, certainly not as kin (i.e. they know this is their brother, parent, etc.). But they don't need to if, for example, they instinctively disperse at weaning, etc. However, you may want to consult this article by someone who's done a lot of work on this topic: http://www.bio.unc.edu/faculty/pfennig/lab/pfennig_files/kinrecoginization.htm

From what I've read online, DTH is a satellite system, so this will not be possible unless you have a satellite dish receiver on your radio.  This is because satellites use frequencies on the order of about 15 GHz.  Your AM/FM radio antenna will only pick up frequencies up to about 110 MHz.  \n\nFurther, DTH signals are digital.  An AM/FM radio is purely analog.  Thus, even if you had a satellite dish that was the right size and pointed in the right direction, all you would hear is garbage.  The signals are compressed and encrypted, so you need hardware to convert the analog signal to digital, and then decompress and unencrypt the data.\n\nSo, in short, the answer is a definitive no. Sorry buddy.
"Actually, over a long term, we don't know.  Over a short term, the EM waves obviously don't mess with our current mental processes.

Actually,  N has to do with the amount of electrons that the element has. the first level has a maximum of two electroins, so all elements that have under 2 electrons will be in this level (hydrogen has 1 e, He has 2). The 2nd energy level can hold up to 8 electrons, so look at the atomic number (# of electrons and determine which energy level it would be under). N=3, maximum number of electrons is from 9-18)

There is not a single human trait that is not affected by the environment.  DNA contains codes for proteins, which differentially affect cell metabolism.  The genes themselves are dependent on their environment (ie., the cytoplasm of the cell that surrounds them).  Depending on the composition of the cytoplasm, genes are expressed differently, and this is one major source of cell differentiation during mitosis in a zygote.  The bottom line is this: Even traits that seem to be directly linked to genes can be influenced by environment.  Take, for instance, the genetic disorder phenylketonuria.  In this disorder, the body lacks the enzyme necessary to convery phenylalanine to tyrosine.  Levels of phenylalanine reach toxic levels, causing irreversible mental retardation.  We now know that if this is diagnosed early that hte mental retardation can be completely prevented by diet.  Also, think about the effects of teratogens (environmental agents with the potential to cause birth defects).  Environmental toxins during pregnancy can affect the developing fetus and alter any aspect of its physical or mental development.  The bottom line: phenotypic expression is not the same as genotype.  EVERY trait has the potential to be influenced by the environment.
The expression is: 2*sin^2(θ) + 3*cos(θ)\n= 2*{1-cos^2(θ)} + 3*cos(θ)\n= 2 + 3*cos(θ) - 2*cos^2(θ)\n= {2 + 4*cos(θ)} - {cos(θ) + 2*cos^2(θ)}\n= 2{1 + 2*cos(θ)} - {cos(θ)}{1 + 2*cos(θ)}\n= {1 + 2*cos(θ)}{2 - cos(θ)}

Starting with hardness.. a steel knife is a bit over 5 and glass about 5.5, a steel file (hardened steel) can be as high as 6.5. So I would guess that whatever you have has a hardness between 5.5 and 6.5.\n\nAs far as density, consider the mass and volume (displacement). 53 grams / 20 cm^3 means it has a density of 2.65g/cm^3 (Note, g/cm^3 is the same as specific gravity).\n\nSo what mineral has a hardness between 5.5 and 6.5 and a specific gravity of 2.65? Well, I don't have a minerals table in front of me, but those are the key numbers you need. If no one else answers, I'll look it up tonight.\n\nEDIT: OK, found an online table. Rose Quartz has a hardness of 7, specific gravity of 2.65, shows conchoidal fractures.\n\nSo that would be my guess. Rose Quartz.
"Intellingence is thought to be influenced by many factors, genetics being but one of them.\n\nObviously, injury or disease can damage the brain, and result in lower intelligence, as can other factors such as malnutrition.\n\nAlso important are the conditions encountered during early childhood development.  The brain has certain ""critical windows"", when it is most open for developing language, reasoning, spatial relationships, and other skills.  Children who do not receive the proper stimulus during these windows find it difficult, if not impossible to learn the skills in later life."

that depends on the volume of the coffin and on the person's heart rate.. also on the persons lung capacity..an ordinary person can hold his breath upto a minute. depending upon the volume of the air.. it can range from 10 to 20 minutes.. and can extend or decrease depending upon the heart rate.

"yes, vibrio is a moneran. Monera is a Kingdom of the living world, like the other Kingdoms Animalia, Planteae, Fungi. \nMonerans are prokaryotic organisms, i.e. they are devoid of well defined nucleus, their nucleus do not have nuclear membranes, nucleolus, nucleoplasm, nuclear reticulum etc. these are microscopic organisms, also called as bacteria. Vibrio is a type of comma (',') shaped bacteria, which has one or more flagella.""Vibrio"" is the generic name, i.e. a Genus under kingdom Monera. the most common example is the Vibrio cholerae, that are present in filthy water and causes the disease cholera when ingested."

An ocean current is any more or less permanent or continuous, directed movement of ocean water that flows in one of the Earth's oceans.\n\nSurface ocean currents are generally wind driven and develop their typical clockwise spirals in the northern hemisphere and counter-clockwise rotation in the southern hemisphere due to the imposed wind stresses. In wind driven currents the Ekman spiral effect results in the currents flowing at an angle to the driving winds. The areas of surface ocean currents move somewhat with the seasons, this is most notable in equatorial currents.\n\nDeep ocean currents are driven by density and temperature gradients. Thermohaline circulation, also known as the ocean's conveyor belt, refers to the deep ocean density-driven ocean basin currents. These currents that flow under the surface of the ocean, and are thus hidden from immediate detection, are called submarine rivers. These are currently being researched by floating devices, which maintain their depth according to slightly differing densities of waters. Upwelling and downwelling areas in the oceans are areas, where significant vertical movement of ocean water is observed.
The power rating would be described as the work done upon the time takes. \nThe work done= number of bricks*mass of each*accln due to gravity* height=2750 Joules (assuming accln due to gravity to be 10)\ntime taken =10 seconds\nPower is hence: 275 w or 0.275 kW
The answer lies in the mechanism of action of the two medications.  \n\nAtomoxetine (Strattera) is a norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor inhibitor that acts almost exclusively on the noradrenergic pathway.\n\nBupropion (Wellbutrin) inhibits the re-uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmission without any significant direct effects on serotonin neurotransmission.\n\nSo as you can see the medications act on similiar mechanism and therefore taking them both would be like overdosing on either.  Wellbutrin can also promote seizure which is dose related too.\n\nIn sum, taking them together could be dangerous.
Infrared diode pair.
AM is Amplitude Modulation whereby the signal is encoded by changes in signal strength.  It is very easy to do that so it was the first method in use.\n\nAM radio is usually transmitted at MF (Medium Frequency) which gives enough bandwidth for voice and low quality music and in the day time doesn't propagate very far since the D-region of the ionosphere absorbs the signal.\n\nBut at night the D-region doesn't exist and so the signal can travel all the way up to the F-region where it is reflected back down to Earth which allows MF signals to propagate very long distances at night and is why you can often hear AM stations from the other side of a continent at night.\n\nFM is Frequency Modulation in which the signal is encoded as changes in Frequency.  It is harder to do but the result is more resistant to interference and gives better quality.  FM is also transmitted at VHF (Very High Frequency) which gives higher bandwidth so more signal can be sent (thereby allowing increased quality).  VHF goes pretty much straight through the ionosphere so unless there is Sporadic E (massive increases in ionospheric electron density where the E-region is) VHF isn't going to be reflected anywhere and so it'll only be rather local (the wave will follow the ground to some extent).\n\nThe lower frequency MF waves will go through materials better than VHF so AM tends to work better in tunnels.\n\nAM and FM were both launched as mono systems with stereo being retrofitted onto FM by the use of a difference channel so as to allow old mono FM receivers to continue to work (basically the original mono FM signal is sent but superimposed onto that is the difference between the left and right channels).

London has 2 cities - the City of London (St Paul's Cathedral, and only about 1 sq mile in size) and the City of Westminster (Westminster Abbey). I seem to recall there was a lot of debating in the 1980's about which town should be ""upgraded"" to city status. In the US it is incorporated and can be any size - I lived in a ""city"" of only 3,500 in Florida!"
Are you referring to operating temperature of the engine?\n\nIt depends on where you are measuring it.  Inside the cylinders, oil temperature, coolant temperatures...they're all different.\n\nSince most dashboard temperature gauges refer to coolant temperature, I will elaborate a little bit on that.  Normal operating temperature for engine coolant is typically 180-195°F and is regulated by the coolant thermostat (usually a bimetallic controlled valve).  Coolant can get up to about 240°F before serious problems begin to develop (such as boiling).  This is because the coolant is not entirely water, and it is under slight pressure, which raises the boiling point of the coolant.

As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air. However, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue.
I would say definetely. There must be islands that haven't been discovered and mapped. It's highly unlikely that we know about everything on our planet. It's just too vast.

Is chemistry a good subject to learn - yes, if for no other reason than to give you an appreciation for the world around you. As for if chemists have a future, everything around you probably had a chemist working on it. For example, the food you eat, the computer you are using, the water you drink, etc. all had chemists working on them. Quality control for purity  must be performed on almost everything, and that is normally done by a chemist. I recently graduated in chemistry, and I am having no difficulty finding jobs.

Stratigraphy is the analysis of sediment layers and their correlation to time. Events in a stratigraphy are exceptional layers which were deposited due to a special occurrance - most commonly fire, but also think of the huge ash and lava deposits over Pompeii and Herculaneum, or the Iridium-rich layer on the end of the Jurassic Age commonly connected to the Yucatan meteorite impact.\n\nIn Archaeology or Palaeontology event layers are extremely valuable. Quite often they contain collateral damage of the event which can be dated to the event, and objects which normally wouldn't have been included in the sediment. Schliemann used the ash layers to distinguish several different stages of Troy. (Later research added more...)

Ok well the first thing to remember is that temperature is really just a measure of the kinetic energy in a material. That is, how fast the particles are moving.\n\nIn a cold material the atoms are moving about very slowly, but as the temperature increases the speed and energy of the particles increases. \n\nNow diffusion can be said to be the rate at which particles mix with each other or the rate at which they intermingle through random thermal motion. Obviously if they are moving faster, they will mix faster. And if they are moving slow they will mix slow.\n\nAs an example think of a jar of different colour sand layers, if you shake the jar slowly the sands will mix slowly, but if you shake it very fast the sands will mix very quickly. Same thing with molecules.
When a mother is HIV possible, it is very possible to have a child that is born HIV free.  The mother must take anti-HIV drugs (like AZT) to keep her viral levels down.  The blood baby barrier of the placenta should be able to prevent transmission under these circumstances.  The baby must also be born by Ceaserean Section rather than vaginal birth.

Gene splicing involves cutting out part of the DNA in a gene and adding new DNA in its place.\n\nThe process is entirely chemical with restriction enzymes used as chemical 'scissors'. Depending on the type of restriction enzyme used, different parts of the genetic code can be targeted. A specific restriction enzyme will split apart a specific strand of DNA leaving behind a gap in the genetic code. New DNA can then be added in this gap.\n\nWhen a new strand of DNA is added, it takes the place of the binds to the ends of the DNA strands that were originally cut. Another enzyme called ligase is used in the repair process.\n\nOnce the new DNA is in place, the function of the gene changes. In cases where a defective gene is repaired, the new gene will begin functioning correctly, producing the appropriate enzymes for its type.

Parts of a Refrigerator\nThe basic idea behind a refrigerator is very simple: It uses the evaporation of a liquid to absorb heat. You probably know that when you put water on your skin it makes you feel cool. As the water evaporates, it absorbs heat, creating that cool feeling. Rubbing alcohol feels even cooler because it evaporates at a lower temperature. The liquid, or refrigerant, used in a refrigerator evaporates at an extremely low temperature, so it can create freezing temperatures inside the refrigerator. If you place your refrigerator's refrigerant on your skin (definitely NOT a good idea), it will freeze your skin as it evaporates. \nThere are five basic parts to any refrigerator (or air-conditioning system): \n\nCompressor \nHeat-exchanging pipes - serpentine or coiled set of pipes outside the unit \nExpansion valve \nHeat-exchanging pipes - serpentine or coiled set of pipes inside the unit \nRefrigerant - liquid that evaporates inside the refrigerator to create the cold temperatures \nMany industrial installations use pure ammonia as the refrigerant. Pure ammonia evaporates at -27 degrees Fahrenheit (-32 degrees Celsius). \n\nThe basic mechanism of a refrigerator works like this: \n\n \n\n \n\nThe compressor compresses the refrigerant gas. This raises the refrigerant's pressure and temperature (orange), so the heat-exchanging coils outside the refrigerator allow the refrigerant to dissipate the heat of pressurization. \n\nAs it cools, the refrigerant condenses into liquid form (purple) and flows through the expansion valve. \n\nWhen it flows through the expansion valve, the liquid refrigerant is allowed to move from a high-pressure zone to a low-pressure zone, so it expands and evaporates (light blue). In evaporating, it absorbs heat, making it cold. \n\nThe coils inside the refrigerator allow the refrigerant to absorb heat, making the inside of the refrigerator cold. The cycle then repeats. \nThis is a fairly standard -- and somewhat unsatisfying -- explanation of how a refrigerator works. So let's look at refrigeration using several real-world examples to understand what is truly happening.

The point is that the mass shown on the periodic table for each element is in fact an average that takes into account the most abundant isotope (the one actually shown in the table) along with other less abundant isotopes (typically radioactive ones) that most often differ in one neutron or two. \n\nFor example, Hidrogen´s atomic mass should be just 1. But it is slightly higher than that. That´s because H1 is only the major form of Hydrogen. There are also H2 (deuterium) and H3 (Tritium). And the atomic mass averages the mass of all of these (1,2 and 3 respectively) according to their abundances. \nHere are their abundances:\n\nH1 (Common Hydrogen)= 99.985%\nH2 (Deuterium)= 0.015%\nH3 (Tritium)= minimal traces\n\nThus for a weighed average you need to calculate:\n\n1*0.99985+2*0.00015+3*0= 1.00015 which is a bit higher than just 1.\n\nThe same goes for the rest of the elements. \n\nExcelent question!

Thunderstorms have updrafts and downdrafts.  A downdraft is the area of sinking air.  A downburst a very strong downdraft where strong winds burst down toward the ground and spread out on the ground, producing damaging straight line winds.\nA downburst smaller than 2.5 miles in diameter is called a microbust.  \nDownbursts are either wet (accompanied by precipitation) or dry (no precipitation, or virga).

Tough call. Dealing with schoolyard bullies is one of the hardest things to learn. You _should_ talk to a teacher. The bully will see that as weakness. Bullies are usually stupid and feel inferior and have no good tools for dealing with life. Try to understand. Above all, don't lose your self respect. If you decide to fight, give no warning, just paste him as soon as he starts to hassle you. But be aware that most schools will discipline both parties in a fight, because there is no place for violence in schools. So the first thing to do is talk to a teacher or principal.
some suggestions:\n1. You could do your own poll (among your neighbours or even on yahoo answers) and see how your results can be extended to a general population. This is what pollsters do for example to come up with projections in an election. You can find good references for doing the mathematical studies for such a project easily on the net.\n\n2. You can study the evolutionary patterns of human beings - National geographic has a genographics project where they are collecting blood samples from around the world and mapping the journey of our ancestors. You could get your own journey mapped (by providing your cheek swab samples and $100) and then find out about other historical happenings through the ages and correlate the findings. This is a costly project so do your survey first before investing the $100 into the project.\n\n3. Study traffic patterns on some major road and correlate that with other events going on in your city. Then make predictions for the following week and see how your model compares with the actual traffic. If you are good at programming build a small software for doing this.
i almost have evidence against the hoax that Armstrong landed on moon.for reference i am placing a text version of the proof as the answer.i shall try to mail u the photographic evidence which i received from a friend.\n\n \n\n issue 1\nSince the Moon has only one light source, the Sun, the shadows must be in line. But in this cases, it looks as if there are multiple light sources in moon, which is not possible.\n \nIssue 2:\nThe foreground of many images of the astronauts on the Moon are filled in with light, while the shadows remain absolutely black, again proving that there are multiple light sources.\n\nIssue 3 :\nThere are no stars in the background from pictures taken on the Moon.\n \nIssue 4 : \nIn some images, a huge light source can be seen reflected in the astronaut's visors. This has to be a very bright, nearby source. There  is no possibility of external light source in moon.\n \nISSUE 5 - How could NASA take TV images of the LM ascending on Apollo 15, 16, and 17 if there was no one on the Lunar surface to man the camera?\n \n\nISSUE 6 - There can't be any pictures taken on the Moon because the film would melt in the 250° temperatures. Any  film exposed to 250° would indeed melt at that temperature.\n\nIssue-7 :  The LM engine was very powerful. How come it did not leave a crater below the spacecraft? Why didn't it kick up any dust when it landed?\n\n \nissue 8: The footprints left by the astronauts are proof that the Moon landings are fake.\nThis one is also essentially a two pronged argument. First, the Fox show charged that the LM engine was so powerful that the upper layer of dust should have been blown away around the LM, so there should not be any footprints. Others have charged that the footprints should not be there since in the absence of water as a bonding agent, they should not maintain coherent shapes and sharp outlines.\n \n\n \nissue 9: There is no dust on LM footpads. -- According to Kaysing and Fox, this is the strongest evidence that the Moon landings are faked. They allege that with the swirling dust from LM descent engine, the foot pads should be covered with dust.\n \nissue 10 :\nThe pictures below show that flags are waving. And they never will. The flag was on the airless Moon, just as we all knew.\n\n \nTHERE ARE MANY MORE ISSUES ON THIS,\nBUT\nTHOSE ARE TOO TECHNICAL FOR US.\n \n…..NEIL ARMSTRONG WAS NOT THE FIRST PERSON TO LAND ON MOON
The version of levitation that I saw goes as follows:\n\nHe stands with his back to the audience near to a raised platform, box, curb, etc.\n\nHis left shoe is attached to his pants. The pants are constructed so that the left pant leg opens in the front.\n\nHe distracts the audience, opens the pant leg, pulls his foot out of the shoe and places it on the platform. This is done in such a way that from behind, you still see the pants  and shoe on the ground and it blocks your view of his leg.\n\nHe then steps up onto the platform. The two pant legs and shoes are in the air so it appears he is floating. After a while he lowers himself, replaces his leg in his pants and shoe, closes the open in the pants, and walks away.
Nicolaus Copernicus (February 19, 1473 – May 24, 1543) was an astronomer who provided the first modern formulation of a heliocentric (sun-centered) theory of the solar system in his epochal book, De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres). Copernicus was born in 1473 in the city of Toruń (Thorn), in Royal Prussia, an autonomous province of the Kingdom of Poland. He was educated in Poland and Italy, and spent most of his working life in Frombork (Frauenburg), Warmia, where he died in 1543.

Industrialist-aviator Vijaypat Singhania on Saturday became the first man to soar 69,852 feet above sea level in a hot air balloon. In the process, he broke the world record of 64,997 feet, set by Per Lindstrand, in June 1988, in Texas.\n\nThe balloon, called Envelope and designed by Don Cameron, is around 160 feet high (approximately equivalent to the height of a 22-storey high building). It is made of 67,250 square feet of specially made light nylon, allowing it to gain altitude without much difficulty. It was inflated by blowing air into it using portable fans. It is also designed to be rip-proof, and the capacity of the air inside is 80,000 kilograms (80 tonnes) .\n\nThere are 18 burners of different capacity and design. The capsule is equipped with three fuel tanks, two filled with kerosene and one with propane. The weight of the balloon (including gondola, the envelope, 18 burners and other apparatus) is around 1,820 kilograms. The capsule is also equipped with necessary safety devices, should Singhania be forced to abort his mission. It is also fitted with state-of-the-art instrumentation and control systems for navigation.

Scientists don't even know what gravity is.  They know how to measure it and account for it in calculations but don't know how it's generated.  They know it's one of the weaker forces in the cosmos and have identified a particle they call a graviton.  Once it is known how gravity is generated the next step will be how to counter it, or develop anti-gravity.

Dante is right, the Coriolis effect, basically curves wind.  Imagine you are standing on the equator with a huge cannon.  If you fired the cannonball, it would actually be pushed to the right (shooting to the North, or the left to the South).  This is becuase of the earths rotation, and the wind pushing it.

"The Great Wall of China (Simplified Chinese:  Traditional Chinese: Pinyin: Wànlĭ Chángchéng; literally ""10,000 Li¹ long wall"") is a Chinese fortification built from 3rd century BC until the beginning of the 17th century, in order to protect the various dynasties from raids by Mongol, Turkic, and other nomadic tribes coming from areas in modern-day Mongolia and Manchuria. Several walls were built since the 3rd century BC, the most famous being the Great Wall built between 220 BC and 200 BC by the First Emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi, which was located much further north than the current Great Wall of China built during the Ming Dynasty, and little remains.\n\nThe Wall stretches over a formidable 6,352 km (3,948 miles), from Shanhai Pass on the Bohai Sea in the east, at the limit between China proper and Manchuria, to Lop Nur in the southeastern portion of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (refer to University of Washington: A. The Main Caravan Routes (b) The “Central Route” or “Middle Route.”)\n\nHISTORY \n\nA defensive wall on the northern border was built and maintained by several dynasties at different times in Chinese history. Its purpose, to defend the China mainland from nomadic Mongolians. There have been five major walls:\n\n208 BC (Qin Dynasty) \n1st century BC (Han Dynasty) \n7th century CE (Sui Dynasty) \n1138 - 1198 (Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period) \n1368 - 1640 (from Hongwu Emperor until Wanli Emperor of the Ming Dynasty) \nThe first major wall was built during the reign of the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang. This wall was not constructed as a single endeavor, but was mostly the product of joining several regional walls built by the Warring States. The walls that were linked together at this time consisted of rammed earth with watch towers built at regular intervals. It was located much further north than the current Great Wall with its eastern end at modern day North Korea. Very little of this first wall remains - photos reveal a low, long mound.\n\nThe government ordered people to work on the wall, and workers were under perpetual danger of being attacked by brigands. Because many people died while building the wall, it has obtained the gruesome title, ""longest cemetery on Earth"" or ""the long graveyard."" Possibly as many as one million workers died building the wall, though the true numbers cannot be determined now.\n\nThe later long walls built by the Han, the Sui, and the Ten Kingdoms period were also built along the same design. They were made of rammed earth with multi-story watch towers built every few miles. These walls have also largely vanished into the surrounding landscape, eroded away by wind and rain.\n\nIn military terms, these walls were more frontier demarcations than defensive fortifications of worth. Certainly Chinese military strategy did not revolve around holding the wall, instead it was the cities themselves which were fortified.\n\nThe Great Wall which tourists visit today was built during the Ming Dynasty, starting around the year 1368 and lasting till around 1640. Work on the wall started as soon as the Ming took control of China but initially, walls were not the Ming's prefered response to raids out of the north. That attitude began to change in response to the Ming's inablilty to defeat the Oirat war leader Esen Taiji in the period 1449 to 1454. A huge Ming army with the Zhengtong Emperor at its head was anihilated in battle and the emperor himself held hostage in 1449.\n\nAppearently the real focus on wall building started as a result of Altan Khan's siege of Beijing which took place one hundred years later in 1550. The Ming, faced with the choice of trying to defeat the Mongols with direct military force, choose instead to build a massive defensive barrior to protect China. As a result, most of the Ming Great Wall was built in the period 1560 to 1640. This new wall was built on a grand scale with longer lasting materials (s"
IF an air bubble was cubical then it would have to spend an extra amount of energy to form that shape.\n\nSphere is the only shape which has the least surface area as compared to its volume. So the bubble does not have to waste energy in trying to stretch its surface area.
A clear cloudless day-time sky is blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light.  When we look towards the sun at sunset, we see red and orange colours because the blue light has been scattered out and away from the line of sight.\n\nThe white light from the sun is a mixture of all colours of the rainbow.  This was demonstrated by Isaac Newton, who used a prism to separate the different colours and so form a spectrum.  The colours of light are distinguished by their different wavelengths.  The visible part of the spectrum ranges from red light with a wavelength of about 720 nm, to violet with a wavelength of about 380 nm, with orange, yellow, green, blue and indigo between.  The three different types of colour receptors in the retina of the human eye respond most strongly to red, green and blue wavelengths, giving us our colour vision.\n\nTyndall Effect\nThe first steps towards correctly explaining the colour of the sky were taken by John Tyndall in 1859.  He discovered that when light passes through a clear fluid holding small particles in suspension, the shorter blue wavelengths are scattered more strongly than the red.  This can be demonstrated by shining a beam of white light through a tank of water with a little milk or soap mixed in.  From the side, the beam can be seen by the blue light it scatters; but the light seen directly from the end is reddened after it has passed through the tank.  The scattered light can also be shown to be polarised using a filter of polarised light, just as the sky appears a deeper blue through polaroid sun glasses.\n\nThis is most correctly called the Tyndall effect, but it is more commonly known to physicists as Rayleigh scattering--after Lord Rayleigh, who studied it in more detail a few years later.  He showed that the amount of light scattered is inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength for sufficiently small particles.  It follows that blue light is scattered more than red light by a factor of (700/400)4 ~= 10.\n\nDust or Molecules?\nTyndall and Rayleigh thought that the blue colour of the sky must be due to small particles of dust and droplets of water vapour in the atmosphere.  Even today, people sometimes incorrectly say that this is the case.  Later scientists realised that if this were true, there would be more variation of sky colour with humidity or haze conditions than was actually observed, so they supposed correctly that the molecules of oxygen and nitrogen in the air are sufficient to account for the scattering.  The case was finally settled by Einstein in 1911, who calculated the detailed formula for the scattering of light from molecules; and this was found to be in agreement with experiment.  He was even able to use the calculation as a further verification of Avogadro's number when compared with observation.  The molecules are able to scatter light because the electromagnetic field of the light waves induces electric dipole moments in the molecules.\n\nWhy not violet?\nIf shorter wavelengths are scattered most strongly, then there is a puzzle as to why the sky does not appear violet, the colour with the shortest visible wavelength.  The spectrum of light emission from the sun is not constant at all wavelengths, and additionally is absorbed by the high atmosphere, so there is less violet in the light.  Our eyes are also less sensitive to violet.  That's part of the answer; yet a rainbow shows that there remains a significant amount of visible light coloured indigo and violet beyond the blue.  The rest of the answer to this puzzle lies in the way our vision works.  We have three types of colour receptors, or cones, in our retina.  They are called red, blue and green because they respond most strongly to light at those wavelengths.  As they are stimulated in different proportions, our visual system constructs the colours we see.\n\nWhen we look up at the sky, the red cones respond to the small amoun
You can not multiply two prime numbers together and expect to get a prime number. In fact you can not multiply any 2 number of Numbers together and expect to get a prime due to the definition of a prime. A prime is a number that can be divided only by one and itself. As a result of multiplying two or more numbers together you introduce factors by definition.\n\nNow 121 times 13 = 1573 which is a case where each digit is a prime.
Cane toads are the largest species of toad in the world, and adults can reach 4 or 5 inches in body length (one record holding specimen is close to a foot in length).  They are grey, brown, reddish or greenish in colour, with mottled patches of brown, black or dark reddish brown.  Behind their eyes they have very large parotid glands, which are the glands that produce bufotoxin.  Cane toads produce very virulent toxins, and can actually squirt it as much as a meter away.  This toxin can kill quite a large number of predators, and is potent enough to injure or even kill humans.\n\nCane toads are not the only species of toad that produces bufotoxins however.  There are a large number of toad species that secrete all manner of toxic substances.  Some of them might not be potent enough to affect your dog, but some of them can be.  In general, you shouldn't let your dog come into contact with any kind of toad if you can help it.

The process I am about to tell is highly dangerous. So it is better advised to wear rubber gloves before starting. Steel unlike soft iron has the property by which it can retain some magnetic properties after passing electricity for some time. So take the stainless steel object and get two wires and connect one of the end of both the wires to the each of the two sockets in the plug and connect the other ends each to the steel object and leave it for some time. After some time disconnect the wires and you will get a magnet.
when the electrostatic interaction between the ions increases the ionic strength increases.

So it is not just the presence. and the number which effects the ionic strength. \n\nBut for pH the number matters. the number of hydrogen ions H+ and OH- ions matters which effects the pH.\n\nHope that was clear enough.\nAny doubts u can ask further.

For the comic book character, see Stature (comics).\nHuman height, or stature, is the height of a human being. Adult height generally varies little between people compared to other anthropometric measures. Exceptional height (variation from the average of around 20%) is usually due to gigantism or dwarfism. Adult height for one sex in a particular ethnic group follows more or less a Gaussian distribution (bell curve) but with some individuals lying several standard deviations away from the mean. (The tallest well-documented giant was 8 foot 11.1 inches (2.72 m) tall.) Height is determined by the interaction of genes and environment. Final adult height may be attained anywhere from the early teens to early 20s, though it is most commonly reached during the mid teens for females and late teens for males. A person's height also varies over the course of the day, by an average of 19 mm (¾ in), gradually shrinking as the spine compresses over the course of a day, and stretching back out overnight (Tyrrell, et al. 1985).[1]\n\n \nYao Ming is the tallest person in the NBAContents [hide]\n1 Changes in human height \n2 Determinants of growth and height \n3 Process of growth \n4 Height abnormalities \n5 Role of an individual's height \n6 The role of height in sports \n7 Average adult height around the world \n8 References \n8.1 Notes \n9 See also \n10 External links \n \n\n\n[edit] Changes in human height\nThis article or section may contain original research or unverified claims.\nPlease help Wikipedia by adding references. See the talk page for details.\nHuman height is regulated by many factors. Since the development of modern medicine and plentiful nutrient-rich food in the developed world average height has increased dramatically. Nutrition is the most important factor in determining height; and height records from military records and other documents can be used to quite accurately compare nutrition and height in various eras. Evidence has shown that height decreased in Britain in the early nineteenth century, before beginning its long increase around mid-century. Increase in height has not been constant, however. The European Middle Ages was an era of tallness with men of above six feet (1.83 m) considered unremarkable. In Europe human height reached its nadir at the start of the nineteenth century. Until the general rise in human health, as urbanization increased, the accompanying trend was a height decline.\n\nEuropeans in North America were far taller than those in Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, in fact the tallest in the world. The original indigenous population was also among the tallest populations of the world at the time. However, several nations, indeed many nations in Europe, have now surpassed the US in terms of average stature, particularly the Netherlands, and the Scandinavian nations. Most markedly is the Netherlands where average height has increased at the greatest rates. For instance: the Netherlands was in the late nineteenth century a land renowned for its short population, but today it has the tallest average in the world [1], with young men averaging 1.83 m (6 ft) tall and only shorter than the peoples of the Dinaric Alps, where males average 1.856 m(6ft 1.08 in) tall. The Dutch are now well known in Europe for extreme tallness. The increase has been so dramatic that various things have been redesigned to fit the much taller frames. In contrast, average male height in impoverished Vietnam and North Korea[2] remains comparatively small at 5 ft 4 in (1.63 m) and 5 ft 5 in (1.65 m) respectively. Currently, young North Korean males are actually significantly shorter. This contrasts greatly with the extreme growth occurring in surrounding Asian populations with correlated increasing standards of living. Young South Koreans are about 3 i"

No, this is not true.  Mosquitoes are primarily nectar feeder with only the females requiring a blood meal to acquire protein prior to laying eggs.  Female mosquitoes may feed upon many types of animals including mammals, birds, and reptiles.  As a result, individual mosquitoes often serve as disease vectors, transmitting diseases from one host animal to another such as malaria, filariasis, yellow fever, dengue fever, epidemic polyarthritis, Rift Valley fever, and West Nile virus.  In fact, the organisms that cause these diseases have evolved life cycles that take advantage of this method of transmission.\n\nFemale members of the genus Anopheles can survive as adults up to a month in captive breeding and usually a 1-2 weeks in the wild.  During this time, the adult female repeats a cycle of eating a full blood meals then laying eggs every 2-3 days in tropical climates or over a longer time period in cooler climates.  Thus, multiple blood meals and multiple egg laying events.

peroxidase and catalase are different but they preform the same reaction - they both break down hydrogen peroxide. Our bodies don't have peroxidase because it breaks down hydrogen peroxide.Peroxide is produced as a harmful byproduct of respiration. The body needs to break down peroxide because it is a powerful oxidizer and acts as a free radical. If peroxide builds up in the body, cellular damage may happen.
How To Remove Skunk Smell\nSkunks spray a strong smelling fluid from a gland under their tail. It is a defense mechanism to repel would-be attackers. It adheres where sprayed and can last for many days. The spray is not easily washed away and instead must be neutralized.\n\nWashing or bathing in tomato juice to remove skunk smell is a popular myth. It does have a small neutralizing effect, but is really more likely to leave one smelling of skunk AND tomato juice. \n\nThe following recipe is effective at neutralizing skunk odor and can be used on people, pets, tires or any object that has been sprayed by a skunk. Note however, that it contains hydrogen peroxide and can cause skin, eye and mucous membrane irritation. Peroxide can also cause fading or damage to clothing, carpet, paint and so on. If you are concerned about the possibility of damage, test it on an inconspicuous portion of the material. Thorough rinsing with water will help to minimize any fading or damage. \n\nMix together:\n\nOne quart 3% hydrogen peroxide* \n\n¼ cup baking soda\n\none teaspoon liquid dish soap\n\n* white vinegar can be substituted, but it is not as effective\n\nIf washing a pet, keep the solution out of their ears and avoid their eyes and mouth. Wash thoroughly with the solution then rinse thoroughly. Repeat if necessary. Use the solution immediately after preparation. Do not store unused solution. \n\nRemoving skunk spray is most effective during the first few hours after spraying.

"First: Yes,vinegar can be considered a chemical (a diluted acetic acid).\n\n   The best way to find this out is to do some experiments on your own.  Now, keep in mind that mixing chemicals can be dangerous, so don't try combinations of chemicals if you haven't taken chemistry.\n\n   I would suggest trying things you can buy at the grocery store for cleaning things (one at a time).  There are all kinds of products you may already have in your house for cleaning metals (silverware?); vinegar sounds safe enough to me but the only way to learn things is to ""think outside the box"".  Try things you wouldn't normally think of as ""chemicals"", such as coffee, soft drinks (colas, etc.), orange juice, and the like.  Even if you find that something doesn't work, make a note of it.  This is often how great discoveries have happened.  Again, don't mix ""coffee and orange juice"" (or any other ""chemicals"")  just to see what will happen without having some idea of how they might react with one another.  Gather information, but carefully.  The more you have, the better your understanding will be and you will get a better grade."

This is not a mathematics question .. as there is no condition given .. however, I estimate it based on the following assumptions:\n\n1. More you go up, temp will fall.\n2. While travelling by air, (at 35,000 feet) outside temperature is around - 15 degree celcious. (this might vary from place to place and season to season though)\n3. Assume the temperature at ground level (altitude = 0) 30 degree celcious (this will vary from place to place though)\n\nnow we have two points\n\naltitude = 0, temp = 30 degree celcious\naltitude = 35,000 feet, temp = - 15 degree celcious\n\nso for an altitude difference of 35,000 feet temp drops by 45 degree celcious\n\nThe rough estimate could be done like this:\n\nfor 10,000 feet altitude difference, temp will fall by (45/35000)*10000 or 12.85 degree. So temp at 10,000 feet altitude will be 17.15 degree celcious\n\nfor 15,000 feet altitude difference, temp will fall by (45/35000)*15000 or 19.28 degree. So temp at 15,000 feet altitude will be 10.72 degree celcious\n\nfor 24,000 feet altitude difference, temp will fall by (45/35000)*24000 or 30.86 degree. So temp at 24,000 feet altitude will be -0.86 degree celcious\n\nfor 30,000 feet altitude difference, temp will fall by (45/35000)*30000 or 38.57 degree. So temp at 30,000 feet altitude will be -8.57 degree.

"That's depending on what type of metal you want to cover the steel parts in the galvanization process. \n\nThe galvanization in words refers only to that kind of process which is using electric deposition of a metal through a bath of a electrolyte from a plate containing pure metal needing to be deposed on steel tide at the ""anode"" electrode or ""+"" polarity and at the other side (other electrode, ""cathode"" or ""-"" polarity).\n\nThere needs to be a certain recipe of mixed salts for creating very tight and uniform growth crystals, for not being corroded or leafed away with time. There are certain salts which provide this king of growing in the same time with the polished look of the piece galvanized. This salts can be dissolved in water,  for creating the electrolyte or being melt (which is not so safe technique) and used and kept like that. \n\nThe ""dipping"" is no so used any more and it can not be called ""galvanization"". More recent techniques use hot plasma blowers, meaning a torch with plasma and a wire of the specific metal to be deposited being melt in the plasma and blown to the surface of the steel part.\n\nAnything you'll do you have to deal with the local Environmental Agencies and with the tap water supply/ sewerage administrator, because you;ll have to make a contract with them for you to show that you retain the hard metals from the water dropped to sewerage, if any.\nDfriend:)"

Tissue contains (amongst other things) proteins and enymes. Both act in concert to cause biochemical reactions.  When you boil proteins you change their structure and therefore the way they behave in a biochemical reaction.  A good way to imagine this is to think of what happens to egg whute (pure protein) when you cook it. When you boil enzymes they become denatured (unable to perform the function for which they were designed).  When you boiled the tissue you denatured the enzymes and changed the sturcture of the proteins and so whatever biochemical reaction was suposed to happen can't happen.  Notice that i did not need to know what you were trying to do or what the full details of the question were.  My answer is a generic truth about the biochemistry of tissue - it ALWAYS works this way.

In this instace, lore almost interects with science.  Turkey does contain Tryptophan, an amino acid which is a natural sedative.

That lazy, lethargic feeling so many are overcome by at the conclusion of a festive season meal is most likey due to the combination of drinking alcohol and over eating a carbohydrate-rich repast, as well as some other factors.

I don't think so.\n\nFirst, one must look at how we see different kinds of colours.  For example, we see a blue-coloured object because the object reflects blue light into our eyes.\n\nA black-coloured object absorbed all lights falling on it and does not reflect any light.  As no light comes into our eyes from the object, it is seen to be black in colour. On this reasoning, you can't produce a black light.
The most stable configuration is when all electrons are paired. So if you dont count valence electrons, the rest of the electrons in the nucleus are paired as is in noble gas e.g. helium.
in an endothermic reaction if heat is removed it favours reverse reaction because for forward reaction heat should be supplied,so that it can be absorbed to give the product.
"As scientists study field theories, they come across situations they can't explain or can't solve consistently.  Then, someone may say, ""What if there were a particle like this with these properties?  How would that fit into out theories?""  The scientific community then does calculations and thought-experiments to predict behavior of the particles and how they might explain observed phenomena.  If they find too many problems and contradictions, they discard the idea and try another, because they have proved the particle can't exist.  But if they find no contradictions, they can't prove it doesn't exist.\n\nThe most convincing way to prove it does exist is to find it or to build it.  It took a long to find meaningful evidence of the top quark.  Until then, it was just a proposed, hypothetical particle.  Those studying this hypothetical particle had enough 'faith' or confidence in their work that it could be real, that they were willing to devote their lives and carreers to finding the answer.  But they weren't betting their eternal destiny.  If the top quark were never found during their lifetime, they would be disappointed, but they would be satisfied that their dilligent efforts built up evidence against their existence and helped reach a reasoned evaluation that their existence was extremely unlikely.\n\nThey were working on a question of right or wrong, not a question of good or bad.  If God created me and (legitimately) makes demands on my behavior, then it is my highest duty to learn what God expects of me and to obey.  If I don't do that, I'm not simply wrong about some matter of fact.  I have violated the supreme, most fundamental law of my existence.  It's only reasonable to expect a penalty for that.  A stiff penalty, since I have failed to accomplish the purpose of my existence.  If I'm wrong about the top quark or about tachyons, I may still have contributed to science.  Newton was no less a great scientist because he didn't consider relativity or quantum mechanics.\n\nAnother difference is that quarks and tachyons and gravity waves are matters of physical science.  They are subject to physical measurement and experimentation.  We might not have the technology to do the experiments.  I know of no experiment we can perform and get the results while we are alive to prove or disprove the existence of God.\n\nWe can study the theories.  If God is real and provided truth about Himself to us in the Bible, then what does it mean?  Many people have studied that and have concluded it is true.  Then, they place their 'faith' in God as revealed in the Bible.  They are betting their eternal destiny that by doing so, they are obeying God's laws, funfilling their purpose, achieving the rewards for obedience, and avoiding the penalties for disobedience.  If they are wrong, the consequences could be severe, or there could be no consequences at all.  They are motivated to study the message for consistency.  They look at predictions made by prophets of God and study history to see if they came true.  The penalty for a false prophet was death.  All of the prophecies whose time of fulfillment has passed have come true.  That's not proof, but it's very strong evidence.  Scientists make predictions based on theories all the time.  If experiment shows the prediction is wrong, they go back and modify the theory.  In true science, there is no death penalty.  But if a large body of experimental evidence supports a scientific theory, scientists tend to believe the theory.  If a large body of evidence supports the idea of the God of the Bible, some people believe it, but some choose not to believe it, because it makes demands on their behavior and acknowledges a power higher than they are.  It's not simply a matter of believing a fact.  It has fundamental implications about who we are.  Belief in tachyons doesn't do that."
"Percent is just the part divided by the whole, and then that result multiplied by 100 (""Percent"" is a contraction of ""Per Centum"" which literally means ""For Every 100"" -- so we multiply the result per one by 100 to get per 100):\n\nRegular camera = $85\n\nTotal = $115+$165+$85 = $365\n\nPercentage = ($85 / $365) * 100 = .233 * 100 = 23.3 %"

"I don't think there are any good shortcuts. If you are going to go vegan all the way, you might want to try your local health-food store and look for ""vegan"" in the label. You may also find websites if you google the same word. The bottom-line is you will still need to read a lot of labels and slowly learn what products come from animals (lactose and things like that). Try sticking to organic vegetables, tofu, and fresh foods in general to save some time at the grocery store (but not necessarily in the kitchen). Another good meat substitute is seitan (it makes a killer stroganoff). Look for fast-meal vegan cookbooks online. There is a world of information out there. \nJust make sure you are still eating enough vegetable proteins. Try beans, tofu, seitan, mushrooms, soy, nuts, etc. (again, google things like ""high protein content"" or look for nutritional listings online). Good luck!\nObs.: You might want to put your posting under a subject like diet, health, cooking, or something like that. \n\nP.S.: I just found that there is a whole section of yahoo! questions dedicated to the subject.

Median is the average, so without knowing how many students were absent, we have to conclude the following:\n\n1) if the median does not change, then the median score for those absent must still equal the median for those present.  In other words, for each point above the median score an absent student scores, another student must score one point below the median score\n\n2) mode is the most frequent number in a series.  Since the mode in the present students is 68 (which occurs twice), we know that the scores of the absent students must still either have a mode of 68, or no mode at all with at least one 68\n\n3) Currently we have a median of 58 2/3, so we need scores that will bring this median to exactly 58, which means the absent students must score slightly lower than the present students\n\n\n\nPossible scenarios:\n\n1) 3 absent students who score 58, 59, and 59\n2) 3 absent students who score 58, 68, and 59\n3) 3 absent students who score 50, 50, and 68
"What an awesome question. They do that by looking at families and ancient DNA.\n\nLet's say you have a type of gene that is passed down ONLY by your maternal family line, they can take blood/lymph samples from you, your mother, grandmother , great grandmother, aunts, great aunts whatever.\n\nIn reality this exists in your Mitochondrial DNA/RNA.\n\nIf you have a long family line like lets' say your ancestor was Charlemagne's sister or some famous person from whom they had tissue - hair / blood whatever. Usually they have to find relatively uncontaminated samples so tissue from roots of teeth or inside of large undamaged bone or if the tissues are in some other ways preserved. They enhance this DNA by making many copies of the tissue and then use that to do the comparison.\n\nThey can compare the genes from that old ancestor and see what kind of changes occur between the generations and your distant relative whom you know you are related to.\n\nThen you see what has changed between those older samples and the newer samples. That lets people know what the overall error or difference is. \n\nBy checking with everyone else or using multiple samples from multiple family tree's they compare and get a common set of changes between everyone. \n\nNow you can figure out the rate of change or put another way, how many years or how many generations is it before you can expect to see 1 error/change or 10 or 50 or 100. \n\nFor Mitochondrial RNA/DNA that is very well figured out and there is a great book about this subject called ""The 7 Daughters of Eve"".\n\nComparing the older DNA of a few individuals to people today has had some AMAZING results.\n\nFrom those results they have discovered some amazing facts,  For instance,\n\nHumanity was almost wiped out as a species 2 times in the last 200,000 years (most recently about 70,000 years ago) , scientists determined there were no more than 5,000 people left after some event caused the population to dwindle. \n\nIn a way the story of Adam and Eve were right,(if I remember correctly) although Eve lived 80,000 years ago in Africa somewhere and Adam lived 40,000 years ago in the European Steppe.\n\nAll women decend from no more than 7 individuals who lived at various times in the last 40,000 years.\n\nAfricans are the oldest branch of the human genetic tree and show almost 10 times more genetic diversity than their indoeuropean and asian cousins."

To plot points on a coordinate grid, know that the first number in the point is the value left or right.  The second number is the value up or down.   If each vertical and horizontal mark on the grid is an interval of 1 and the the point is (-7,4)  you would make a dot at the point where you went left 7 marks and up 4 marks, starting where the axes intersect.  If the point is (5,-2) go right 5, down 2, and make a dot.\n\nOn a full coordinate plane, the two perpendicular intersecting lines are called axes and are labeled x and y.  The verticle line y, (the y-axis), represents the points at which x=0, and the horizontal line x, (the x-axis), represents the points at which y=0.\nA point, or coordinate, is defined by (x,y) where x and y are all possible values.  If x=3 when y=4 that is shown (3,4).  If x=5 when y= -4 that is shown by (5,-4).  All points left of the y-axis have negative values for x.  All points below the x-axis have negative values for y.  The four squares formed by the axes are called quadrants.  The top right square is the first quadrant, the top left is the second quadrant, the bottom left is the third quadrant, and the bottom right is the fourth quadrant.  These are usually depicted using roman numerals, for example QI would be written in the top right corner of the coordinate plane, QII on the top left, QIII on the bottom left and QIV on the bottom right corner.  In QI both x and y values are positive.  In QII x values are negative and y values are positive.  In QIII both x and y values are negative.  In QIV x values are positive and y values are negative.  For example the point (2,-9) is in QIV, the point (-9,-20) is in QIII, the point (-5,7) is in QII, and the point (1,8) is in QI.\n\n\nMore in depth explaination is available at \nhttp://www.shodor.org/interactivate/discussions/IntroductionToTheCoo/

"Polycythemia is an increase in red blood cell mass. It can be a normal  physiological increases in the Red Blood Count which can occur at high altitudes or after strenuous physical training. At high altitudes, less atmospheric weight pushes air into the lungs, causing a decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen and hypoxia. With strenuous physical training, increased muscle mass demands more oxygen.  It can also be due to a pathological reasons for an increased number of red blood cells like  Polycythemia vera which is a disease of unknown origin that results in an abnormal increase in red blood cells. \n\nThe term ""anemia"" is a general term that refers to a decrease in red blood cells. Anemia can occur from either a decrease in the number of red blood cells, a decrease in the hemoglobin content, or both.♥"

In plant cells, the central vacuoles will fill and the plant becomes stiff and rigid, the cell wall keeps the plant from bursting\n\nIn animal cells, the cell may be in danger of bursting, organelles called CONTRACTILE VACUOLES will pump water out of the cell to prevent this. \n\n\nIn plant cells, the central vacuole loses water and the cells shrink, causing wilting.\n\nIn animal cells, the cells also shrink.\n\nIn both cases, the cell may die.\n\nThis is why it is dangerous to drink sea water - its a myth that drinking sea water will cause you to go insane, but people marooned at sea will speed up dehydration (and death) by drinking sea water. \n\nThis is also why ""salting fields"" was a common tactic during war, it would kill the crops in the field, thus causing food shortages."

There's always a tradeoff between making them cheap and making them accurate.  You can take almost any thermometer and carefully calibrate it against known references to get accurate measurements.  It's much easier to make an accurate thermometer than to make an accurate hygrometer, to measure relative humidity.
The binomial distribution can describe both ture and natural experiments. A natural experiment occurs when your dog knocks over your jar of coins, and some of the coins land heads up and some tails up. If your dog does this many thousands of times, most of the time the coin distribution will be close to 50% heads and 50% tails, but hardly ever exactly 50% if you have lots of coins. But on some days you will get 75% heads and 25% tails, of course much less frequently than close to 50%. The binomial distribution describes the number of days that you will get each different kind of heads-tails outcome.\n\nAs for ture experiments, you are on your own.

Traveling at 31.25 m/s, the ball would reach 20 m in .64 seconds.\n\nAccording to Galileo's free-fall, objects have a 9.81 acceleration.\n\nSo, in .64 seconds, the ball would have fallen 2.00704 m.\n\nSubtract that from 5 m, you would get a number greater than 2 m, so I assume that if would clear the wall. I think.\n\n(To Above) Isn't time equal to distance divided by velocity? For example, it travels at 31.25 m/s, so it would travel 31.25 meter in one second. Doesn't that go to say that 20 meter would take less than a second?

5/16 equals 0.3125.  It's less than 0.313 unless .313 is a rounded off number.  It's considered acceptable to round off a decimal in this fashion.\n\nWhen to Round Up\nRounding up means that we increase the terminating digit by a value of 1 and drop off the digits to the right. If the next place beyond where we are terminating the decimal is greater than or equal to five, we round up. For example, if we round 5.47 to the tenths place, it can be can be rounded up to 5.5.\n\nWhen to Round Down\nIf the number to the right of our terminating decimal place is four or less (4, 3, 2, 1, 0), we round down. This is done by leaving our last decimal place as it is given and discarding all digits to its right. For example, if we round 6.734 to the hundredths place, it can be rounded down to 6.73.
"taq polymerase originated in a thermophile, Thermus aquaticus.  At this point, the taq you actually use is probably the taq gene cloned into E. coli.\n\nAnyhow, as a thermophile, Thermus aquaticus lives in very high temperatures, and its enzymes can also function at the elevated temps.  This is important for PCR, where your extension is at 70C.  THe ability to withstand high temps is also important because of the denaturation step which separates your strands and allows for the continued amplification of PCR product.  \n\n""Back in the day"" before thermostable polymerases, each round of amplificatin required the addition of new enzyme.  You can imagine how fun that must have been.\n\nNew thermostable enzymes are more thermostable, or faster, or have higher fidelity, etc.  Taq, however, for all of its short coming, is still mega cheap and used quite a bit."

"The periodic table of the chemical elements is a tabular method of displaying the chemical elements, first devised in 1869 by the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev. Mendeleev intended the table to illustrate recurring (""periodic"") trends in the properties of the elements. The layout of the table has been refined and extended over time, as many new elements have been discovered since Mendeleev's time, and new theoretical models have been developed to explain chemical behavior. Various layouts are possible to emphasize different aspects of behavior; the most common forms, however, are still quite similar to Mendeleev's original design.\nthe English chemist John Newlands, who noticed in 1865 that the elements of similar type recurred at intervals of eight, which he likened to the octaves of music, though his law of octaves was ridiculed by his contemporaries. Finally, in 1869 the Russian chemistry professor Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev and four months later the German Julius Lothar Meyer independently developed the first periodic table, arranging the elements by mass. However, Mendeleev plotted a few elements out of strict mass sequence in order to make a better match to the properties of their neighbors in the table, corrected mistakes in the values of several atomic masses, and predicted the existence and properties of a few new elements in the empty cells of his table. Mendeleev was later vindicated by the discovery of the electronic structure of the elements in the late 19th and early 20th century.\n\nIn the 1940s Glenn T. Seaborg identified the transuranic lanthanides and the actinides, which may be placed within the table, or below (as shown above). Element 106, seaborgium, is the only element that was named after a living person. (Seaborg has since died.)"

You tend to get big pushed up mountain chains where 2 continental plates are converging, subduction zone volcanism where you've got 1 plate being subducted beneath another (the subducting plate causes partial melting in the mantle and this magma pushes up through the plate above), mid-ocean ridge system where oceanic crust is being pulled apart (if you can find a map which shows sea topography as well as land topography you can have a look at the mid-ocean ridge system - it's pretty amazing, shows the outlines of the plates pretty well, too), and you also get continental rifting and volcanoes where continental crust is being pulled apart, like in Africa.

Oxygen combines with iron to form iron oxide (rust).  It begins immediately on contact and continues until either the oxygen or iron is consumed. Metal oxides are prevented (or at least reduced) by applying a coating that blocks the oxygen and does not itself contain available oxygen.  Some paints are specially formulated to do this.  Also some metals are self-passivating.  That is, they combine with oxygen to form a coating that prevents further oxygen contact . Aluminum, gold, silver, lead, and zinc are some examples.  I know of no practical method to reverse iron oxydation.

I'm sure you're aware that you have to find their breeding site. Once the site is found it must be thoroughly scraped, cleaned, and dried. \n\nThe locations vary widely, but are usually associated with rotting fruit, vegetables or meat, wet organic soil, potted plants, cut flowers, garbage disposals, pet cages and floor drains. \n\nLarge infestations of these flies are often the result of broken drains or garbage disposals that allow organic matter to accumulate in out-of-the-way places such as wall voids, under floors, in basements, or in the soil of crawl spaces. Phorid flies often serve as an indicator of a broken sewage line. As organic-rich waste-water passes through a damaged line, some of the solution seeps into surrounding soil. This can provide the perfect breeding ground for phorid flies. If you have an ongoing phorid fly problem, consider having the sewage lines inspected for leaks and repaired as needed

Propellers, or fans, or whatever you want to call them. \n\nA propeller that is attached to the drive mechanism spins a fluid (liquid or gas), which in turn spins a propeller that is attached to the load. The pitch of the blades of the two propellers can produce the same effect as gear reduction, so the two propellers can spin at different speeds.\n\nWhen fluid drive is used on an automobile, the drive propeller (attached to the engine) spins faster than the load propeller (attached to the wheels). Thus the engine can run at the high speeds it needs to produce maximum power output without sending the car off a cliff.

A kilogram(Kg) is a measurement of mass.  A newton(N) is a measurement of force.  Think of a mass measurement as measurement of how much stuff there is in an object.  A force measurement is the product of how much stuff there is multiplied by an acceleration of the stuff.  Force equals mass times acceleration.  F= ma.  Think of it this way, imagine you have a bowling ball.  On earth and on the moon, the ball has the same mass(m).  On earth, the ball is heavier because earth's gravity is stronger(gravity is the acceleration in the equation (a)).  Lets assume you have a 1Kg mass.  On earth the acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 meters per second squared(m/s^2).  A Kg is therefore 1x9.81= 9.81 Newtons on earth.

"The correct way to think of an electron around an atomic nucleus is to think of an electrostatic ""potential well"". The electron is trapped inside the well, so there is no need for the electron to revolve or spin around the nucleus. However, the electron does have angular momentum, but this is not the classical angular momentum you are used to (because electrons are point particles and do not have physical extension like a ball rotating about its center of mass). For an electron, its angular momentum are quantized, and also include a ""spin"" component that has nothing to do with ""spinning"" around an axis, but does have something to do with orientation. Also, in terms of picturing the electron around the atomic nucleus, it is useful to think of it as a cloud, smeared and surrounding the nucleus. But what kind of cloud is it? This obviously is not a cloud of gas, rather the cloud metaphor is to denote the fact that we do NOT know where the electron is at any given moment. This has to do with Hisenberg's Uncertainty Priniple. If we knew exactly where it is, then we would have no idea what momentum it has, which implies that the electron would gain energy and escape the nucleus.\n\nSo to answer your question, ""what will happen if electrons do not revolve around the nucleus?"" The electron may escape the nucleus if it receives the right amount of energy. For example, a photon or light of a certain frequency can collide with the electron and impart its energy to the electron and thus causes the electron to escape the nucleus. This is called the Photo-Electric Effect (as discovered by Einsteinand winning him a Nobel Prize).\n\n""Where does the energy in spinning electrons come from?"" The electrons trapped inside the potential well of an atomic nucleus must be in certain quantum states that correspond to a certain amount of energy. This corresponds to the binding energy of the electron to the nucleus, which is also the energy required in order for the electron to escape the nucleus.\n\nAs a side note, the most ""accepted"" view of an electron among  quantum physicists is that the electron is a ""wave packet"". The wave packet is a mathematical representation of the probability of finding the electron at some position (x,y,z) and at time, t."
I would do a search on the NGS website for a vertical benchmark in your specific area of interest.  Find that benchmark and run a level loop from the benchmark to the area of interest and close back on the benchmark.  You should have some surveying experience to do this.  Then check that benchmark with the NGS, USGS, and find the corrected elevation.  Apply this to your field data. \nYour question really depends on the required precision and accuracy you are interested in at this point.  To get this information from a map would leave you with a somewhat large error, compared to an actual field survey using specific equipment for the precision you are looking for.\nGood Luck
All you have to remember is that log (base a) of b = c means exactly the same thing as a^c = b. Thus, if you take a standard log of that equation, you get log(a^c) = log b, so c log a = log b, so c = log b / log a.\n\nThus, that gives you the precise way of working out such a log - take one of the normal logs of the number, then divide by the same log of the base.
"My daughter is also in 8th grade and you can appreciate the number of hours we dads struggle with these projects.....I am currently building (helping to build) a miniature, erupting volcano.....You know kids like flash....they love the show.  I sat here for a while and thought how about a real timer, like an old style egg timer. you know, the ones with the big knob that you wind up?  A 6 volt battery and a filament or model rocket igniter.(you can get these at the hobby store or make your own out of wire.....My daughter and I built a series of light bulbs for a 7th grade science project ) If you run a wire from the battery and glue it on the timer at an appropriate location...then glue(attach) the other wire to the knowb so that when the timer is wound up the wire moves toward the other and completes the circuit in the appropriate amount of time.  Connect a piece if thin wire as a ""gate"" to hold the ball and when the timer runs out the battery energizes the wire causing it to melt...the ball rolls down the ramp.  Have fun....."
It relates to the polarity of the ligands in question.  Peptide hormones are normally charged (that is their R substituent groups have polar atoms or groups) whereas steroid hormones are nonpolar molecules.  The phospholipid membrane of a cell is permeable only to nonpolar molecules such as steroid hormones and it acts to keep the peptide hormones out because of their charge.  For this reason, the cell has developed surface receptors located outside of the cell for peptide hormones and cystolic receptors for the steroid hormones that have direct access into the cell.
The faster the pulse rate the more chemical exchange of oxygen and Co2. Thus, the faster your heart beats the more blood it's pumping and therefor the more need for oxygen and Co2. \n  Physical activity or emotional stress are usually the two leading causes for an increase heart rate, and in your question, Oxygen and Carbon dioxide are increased to keep up with the demand of the heart. So really the respiratory system is adjacent to the cardiovascular system.

"Your heat pack probably contains Sodium Acetate.\n\nFlexing a metal ""trigger"" within the sealed container causes a few molecules of liquid to crystallize.  These few molecule start a whole chain reaction which starts a chain reaction causing the supercooled solution to change from a liquid to a solid as crystals form.\n\nThis phase change causes the pack to give out heat. When the heat pack contents crystallize, its temperature returns its freezing point, and then you can recycle it by boiling. \n\nWhen they pack is boiled, the crystals dissolve in their own water of crystallization so the heat pack returns back to a liquid state.\n\nI hope this was helpful!"

There are two main kinds of photosynthesis.  One kind is C3 photosynthesis and the other kind is C4 photosynthesis.  The main difference between them is that more water is conserved in C4 photosynthesis than in C3 photosynthesis.  C4 photosynthesis uses a different pathway to get CO2 into its photosynthetic cells. In order to perform this different CO2 transport mechanism C4 photosynthesis requires more energy from the absorption of light in the P700 independant photosystems, which just create energy.  So C4 plants conserve more water, but require more energy to perform their photosynthesis.  \nThe reason why all plants don't use the same kind of photosynthesis is because plants in some tropical areas grow where water is sparse so they must conserve water, and since they are in a sun rich area they are able to absorb more light to create energy.   The C3 plants live in cooler regions that tend to have more abundant water sources.  So C3 plants do not have to conserve water and grow where light is not as plentiful so they are not able to create extra energy from the absorption of extra light.  Therefore plants growing in temperate regions use C3 photosynthesis.\n\n\nNote: Plants do not choose what type of photosynthesis they use.  Plants will either only perform C3 photosynthesis or they will only perform C4 photosynthesis.

You can think of the formation of the gas giants as mini-nebular events like the one the formed the larger solar system.  Your instructor is fishing for you to compare the gas giant systems to mini solar systems. He/she is also asking you to evaluate  differentiation between the smaller orbital radius moons and the larger orbital radius moons (more lighter elements further away from the central mass, because the nebula was cooler out there).  I think this is a weak argument, but it has some ammo if you look closely at the Galilean satellites. Ultimately,  the radial temperature profile  in the proto-Jupiter nebula is not necessarily the biggest factor in differentiation, however probably played some role.

Probably, pump it through an automotive oil filter.  They are designed to filter out particles a micron or greater and handle all sorts of viscosities of motor oil.  My guess is that the viscosity of cooking oil will be much lower than that of motor oil, so an automotive oil filter should work fine.  Walmart has its own brand that are made by Champion Labs (same oil filter as Bosch, STP, etc.) and is about $2 each.
I assume that you are wanting straightedge and compass construction.\n\nTo make a decagon, let O be the center of a circle, with BOA one diameter and COD a perpendicular diameter (if you can't construct this, you shouldn't be doing this construction.) Bisect OA at the point E. Now draw a circle centered at E of radius ED. Let this circle intersect the line BO at the point F. Then OF is the length of the side of a decagon. Mark off arcs ofthis radius around the original circle.\n\nFor a pentagon, you can either just skip every other vertex from the decagon (easy!) or it turns out that the side length is the same as the distance FD above.\n\nThe problem of which n-gons can be constructed by ruler and compass was solved by Gauss when he was 17 years old. (!) For polygons with a prime number of sides, the only ones that are constuctible are those which are one more than a power of 2 (the Fermat primes): so far the only ones known are 3,5,17,257,65537.\n\nThen, the only constructible n-gons are ones where n is a power of 2 times a (possibly empty) product of Fermat primes with no repeats. So, 15=3*5 is possible, but 9=3*3 is not. Nor are 7,11,13,14,25, etc. However, all of 4,8,16,48,51,761, 204 are.\n\nHope this helps!

Geometry is more than just shapes and theorems.  It is about the ability to use logic and rules to prove what it is you believe.  The theorems (geometric laws) are just the basis for proving or disproving your point.  How does this relate to life? \n\nFor the rest of your life you will engage others in discussions and debates about topics that you either feel strongly about or feel that you have the right answer.  While this is not geometry, the process that you will use to make your point are no different than proving a right angle or determining the length of a hypoteneuse.

Actually, yes.\n\npH is the negative of the logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ion in aqueous solution:\n\npH = -log[H3O+]\n\nSo, for example, if one had a theoretical concentration of hydronium ion of 10, then pH would be -1.  And since \n\nKw = 10^-14 = [H3O+]*[OH-]\n\nthe resulting [OH-] would be 10^-15.\n\nthe resulting pH value would be -1, and the pOH 15, which would fit the equation pH + pOH = 14.

"particularly in desert areas, where the sky may appear white, brown,\nor some other color. Dust is also responsible for the pinkish sky on\nMars, as seen in the photographs returned from the Viking landers.\n\nIf the atmosphere contains lots of dust, the direct light from the Sun\nor Moon may occasionally get some quite unusual color. Sometimes,\ngreen and blue moons have been reported. These phenomena are quite\nrare though---they happen only ""once in a blue moon...."" :) The dust\nresponsible for these unusual color phenomena is most often volcanic\nin origin. When El Chicon erupted in 1982, this caused unusually\nstrongly colored sunsets in equatorial areas for more than one year.\nThe much bigger volcanic explosion at Krakatoa, some 110 years ago,\ncaused green and blue moons worldwide for a few years.\n\nOne possible exception to the above discussion is if the clouds on the\nplanet are composed of a strongly colored chemical. This might occur\non Jupiter, where the clouds are thought to contain sulfur, phosphorus,\nand/or various organic chemicals.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that the light of the planet's primary is\nquite insignificant. Our eyes are highly adaptable to the dominating\nillumination and perceive it as ""white,"" within a quite wide range of\npossible colors. During daytime, we perceive the light from the Sun\n(6000 K) as white, and at night we perceive the light from our\nincandescent lamps (2800 K, like a late, cool M star) as white. Only\nif we put these two lights side-by-side, at comparable intensities,\nwill we perceive a clear color difference.\n\nIf the Sun was a hot star (say of spectral type B), it's likely we\nstill would perceive its light as ""white"" and the sky's color as blue"

No, you do not have to worry about it.\n\nNutraSweet or aspartame is made up of two amino acids (components of proteins) phenylalanine and aspartic acid.  Only people who are born with a genetic disease called phenylketonuria (PKU), who have a decreased ability to metabolize phenylalanine should worry about consuming these artificial sweeteners.  It has been proven safe for consumption although some people complain of certain side effects like headaches, which may be psychological or related to something else.\n\nI don't think there is any evidence of aspartame having a laxative effect.  Sugar alcohols which are used as a sugar substitute because of their low impact on blood sugars may have a laxative effect if consumed in large quantities.  Foods containing sugar alcohols will generally have a warning about excessive consumption.
I assume you mean expansion valve.\n\nFailure of those valves is very rare since they are not really operated in a typical home AC. However, the valve could get plugged if something were to come loose or break off in the system, and I guess after time the valve could get worn. \n\nThis may happen even quicker if there is a mixture of liquid and gas passing though the valve. That combination usually cause turbulence, and may damage the valve. This may happen if the condenser is not cooling well enough and the coolant is not being fully liquifide.

Black powder is a type of gunpowder invented in the 9th century and was practically the only known propellant and explosive until the middle of the 19th century. It has been superseded by more efficient explosives such as smokeless powders and TNT. It is still manufactured today but primarily for use in fireworks, model rocket engines, and reproductions of muzzleloading weapons\nBlack powder consists of the granular ingredients sulphur (S), charcoal (provides carbon to the reaction) and saltpetre (saltpetre, potassium nitrate, KNO3; provides oxygen to the reaction).\n\nA simple, commonly cited, chemical equation for the combustion of black powder is:\n\n2 KNO3 + S + 3C → K2S + N2 + 3CO2 \nA more accurate, but still simplified[1], equation is\n\n10 KNO3 + 3S + 8C → 2K2CO3 + 3K2SO4 + 6 CO2 + 5N2 \nThe optimum proportions for gunpowder are: 74.64% saltpetre, 13.51% charcoal, and 11.85% sulfur (by mass). The current standard for black powder manufactured by pyrotechnicians today is 75% potassium nitrate, 15% softwood charcoal and 10% sulfur.

I had a biology teacher in high school say once that there was only one case of parthenogenesis (so-called vigin birth) in humans...Jesus Christ.  Parthenogenesis in vertebrates usually involves all-female species where the females lay diploid eggs that develop into diploid females.  Because human males have an X and a Y chromosomes and females two X's, the parthenogeneis explanation is impossible (unless Jesus was female).\n\nBut, in insects and some other animals, unfertilized (haploid) eggs develop into males - but this is impossible in humans.  So Jesus would have to have been diploid (that is if he existed) and we would have to assume that he got the Y chromosome from God (if he exists).
Depending on the book you use, the characteristic equation of a matrix A is the determinenat of A-xI or of xI-A. Sometimes the greek letter lambda is used in place of x, but I won't do that here. In your case, you are looking for the determinant of\n2-x -1 -1\n-1 2-x -1\n-1 -1 2-x\n\nIf you expand by the first row, you get\n(2-x)[(2-x)^2 -1]\n-(-1)[(-1)(2-x) -1]\n+(-1)[1-(-1)(2-x)]\n\nwhich is \n(2-x)^3-(2-x)\n-3+x -3+x\n=8-12x+6x^2-x^3\n-2+x-6+2x\n=-9x+6x^2-x^3\n\nNow, to find the eigenvalues, you set the characteristic equation to 0 to get\n0=-x(9-6x+x^2)\n=-x(x-3)^2,\n\nso x=0,3 are eigenvalues with 3 repeated.\n\nI hope this helps!

Given:\n         20 Drops = 1 ml of water\n          1 Drop = How many atoms?\n\nProblem is quite simple. It just need little thought and time. \n\nIn one molecule of water there is 1 atom of oxygen and 2 atom of hydrogen. Saying that lets calculate the number of molecules in 1 ml of water then, approximating drops of equal size, we can divide it by 20 to get the molecules in 1 drop of water.\n\nI am asuming that you must know density of water (1g/ml) meaning that 1 ml of water = 1 g of water. Also you must be aware of what avogadro's number mean. Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23) is number of molecules in one mol of substance.\n\nSo calculate mol of water from 1 g of water.\n\n1 mol of water = 18 g of water \n       ??             =  1 g of water\n\n1 g of water x 1 mol of water/ 18 g = .0556 mol of water\n\n.0556 mol of water x (6.022 x 10^23 molecules of water / 1 mol) = 3.35 x 10^22 molecules of water in 1 g.\n[by canceling mol of water you end up with molecules of water in 1g]\n\nSo in 1 ml of water there are 3.35 x 10^22 molecules of water. In 1 drop of water there would be 3.35 x 10^22/20 = 1.67 x 10^21 molecules of water in 1 drop.\n\nBut, in 1 molecule of water there are three atoms (1 atom of O and 2 atoms of H). So divide 1.67 x 10^21/3 = 5.58 x 10^20 which are the atoms of oxygen. And if you multiply that by two you get atoms of H since there are 2 H atoms for every O atom. So number of H atom would be 1.12 x 10 ^21 atoms of H
We should begin by expressing the distance D between them in terms of the elasped time T.\n\n(200-32T)^2 + (24T)^2 = D^2\n\nSince we are only interested in the rate of change of distance, we don't need to solve for D. We just differentiate the whole equation.\n\n2*(200-32T)(-32) + 2*(24T)(24) = 2D\n\nd/dt (D) = (-6400 + 1024T + 576 T)/D = (1600T - 6400)/D\n\nAt 6:00 pm the elasped time T is 6 hours.\n\nThe total distance D is sqrt[(200-32*6)^2 + (24*6)^2]\nD = sqrt[8^2 + 144^2] = sqrt(20800) = 144.22 km\n\nThe rate of change is (1600*6-6400)/144.22 = 22.2 km/hr

For dynamical systems, eigenvalues and eigenvectors tell you the long term, equilibrium behavior.  For a spacecraft, they tell you the modes of vibration of the spacecraft structure so that you can make sure that the accoustic environment of your launch vehicle won't shake it apart.\n\nMany, many examples.\n\nGeometrically, they show you special directions (invariant subspaces) of your vectors space that are simply stretched or shrunk, the direction remains the same.  Used for the projections that you see in advertising where it looks like a 3 dim figure is rotating.
"You can reference ""Water Cycle"" on google, and you should get plenty of hits, along with illustrations. The basic process is:\n\nEvaporation-heat turns liquid water in water vapor, sending it into the air\nTranspiration-plants and animals give off water vapor, sending it into the air\nCondensation-water vapor cools, turning into water droplets\nPrecipitation-water droplets become to heavy to float, falling to earth as rain or snow\n\nMany people include Runoff in the cycle (returning the precipitation to large water sources such as lakes and oceans)"
To differentiate x^x:\n\nset y = x^x\n\nthen ln y = ln x^x = x ln x.\n=> y' / y = ln x + x(1/x) = ln x + 1, so y' = x^x(ln x + 1).\n\nTherefore f'(x) = 2 cos(x) + 3(x^x)(ln x + 1), so\nf'(3) = 2cos 3 + 3(3^3)(ln 3 + 1).\n\nTo evaluate this, make sure your calculator is in radians, not degrees.

I do not know if this is the 'annihilator method' but here goes:\n\ny'' + 4y' + 4y = 2x + 6\n\nFirst solve y'' + 4y' + 4y = 0\nK^2 + 4K + 4 = 0 \nSo (K + 2)^2 = 0\nie K = -2, -2\nSolution is y = Ae^(-2t) + Bte^(-2t)\n\nNow for particular solution\n\nyp = Ax + B\nyp' = A\nyp'' = 0\ny'' + 4y' + 4y = Ax + (4A + B)\n= 2x + 6\nSo A = 2 and 4A + B = 6 \nSo B = -2\n\nThus the general solution is y = Ae^(-2t) + Bte^(-2t) + 2x - 2

You can combine the right side terms using the\n property log(a/b) = log a - log b in reverse.\n\nIt is log(3/(2x-1))\n\nSo now you have log(x+1) = log(3/(2x-1)\n\nSince the logs are equal, so must be the things you took the log of.\nSo x+1 = 3/(2x-1)\n\nCross multiply: (x+1)(2x-1) = 3 \n\n2x^2 + x - 1 = 3\n\n2x^2 + x - 4 = 0\n\nSolve for x.

here, as the gas is in equilibrium,the pressure exerted by the piston should equal the pressure exerted by the gas..                    Ppiston=mass/area =5g/0.047pa. Use the ideal gas law now..  V=nRT/P and so,area*ht(=V)=nRT/P this implies ht.H=nRT/aP and use your units carefully..i think the answer will be around 203.67502 km

A thiol is a molecule with a covalently bonded -SH group on it (like an alcohol has a covalently bonded -OH).  A thiol is quite nucleophilic (more than oxygen in alcohol); in other words, its an electron-donor (i.e. Lewis base).  They react with oxidizing agents to form disulfides or in extreme cases sulfonic acids.  \n\nI hope this helps you get started on your problem; you're going to have to spend a little time digging on your own to understand their role in phytoremediation (particularly in reference to whatever homework you're doing, your reading or teacher should've given you a clue but your question is too vague right now for me to give much help without answering it outright).

Well thats really several questions.  Any fab shop with laser or plasma cutting equipment and some machine shop capablility can fabricate a centrifugal blower wheel.  We've build several using stainless steel.  But not with Air foil blades, which are only good for clean air, if any dust or dirt is in the air stream I'd recommend flat rather than air foil blades.\n\nAs for the second part, theres never been a time when it was easier to produce a high quality product without a lot of expensive tooling.  Advances in computer aided design and CNC machining have made it possible to produce precision parts in small quantities.  \n\nThe company where I work produces one of kind special machines and what components we can't buy off the shelf we can fabricate for in most cases ourselves.  But I could farm out all of the welding and machine work and only bolt the assemblies together will nothing but hand tools.\n\nOne of our competitors in Florida builds food processing equipment.  He farms out all of the components which require machining or welding.  He assembles his equipment with a wrench.  To do that would require accurate component drawings and proper tolerances.  Which if you have a good CAD system shouldn't be a problem.
All other factors remaining constant, the relative humidity would increase. Relative humidity refers to the amount of water dissolved in the air as a percentage of the total amount of water the air, at that temperature, can hold. The warmer the air, the greater its capacity to hold water. It rarely snows in Antartica because the average temperature is so low the air can only hold a very small amount of water.  \nSumming up; it is called RELATIVE humidity because the actual amount of water in the air does not alone determine the relative humidity. It is a function of the temperature of the air, ergo its capacity to hold water,  as well. \nAs an aside: even at 100% relative  humidity air can only hold a maximum of 4% water by weight.
Charecteristics of physical systems is defined by differential equation. For example  a second order linear differential equation can define an RLC circuit. An antennae and it's polar diagram can be defined by a Legendre differential equation from which the whole antennae can be described and designed. A Bessel differential equation can define movement of planets in space. This can also be used to define cetain type of Electrical cirucuits. Butterworth, Chebyshev etc; polynomials define certain other type of Electrical circuits. So basically these are mathematical models of physical systems.

"This question could be interpreted two ways.\n1st interpretation: ""10%"" = 0.10.\nIn this case, the answer would simply be 6+0.10 = 6.10.\n\n2nd interpretation: ""10%"" = 10% of 6.\nFirst, let's determine what 10% of 6 is.  To find 10% of 6, we must multiply 6 by 10% (remember that 10% is 0.10).\n10% of 6 = 6*0.10 = 0.60\nNow we must add that to our initial quantity.\n6+0.60 = 6.60"
Okay, this is an example of simple harmonic motion (SHM).If the velocity is zero after 0.5s, this means the period of oscillation (T) is 2x0.5s = 1.0sec. If the initial displacement is 0.1m, then the amplitude of oscillation (A) is 2x0.1m = 0.2m. The maximum speed of the object will be achieved when the displacement is 0. The equation for the displacement for SHM is:\n\ny = Asin(2pift + pi/2) where A is the amplitude, f is the frequency = 1/T and disp = initial displacement, and t = time.\n\nSo the velocity is given by the time derivative of displacement:\n\nv = Acos(2pift + pi/2) = 0.2cos(2pit + pi/2)\n\nNow, since the maximum velocity is achieved after 0.25s (the max velocity is when the object passes through the origin which will be after half the time taken to reach the other end of the cycle);\n\nv = 0.2cos(pi/2 + pi/2) = 0.2cos pi = -0.2m/s\n\nqed

RNA polymerase (RNAP or RNApol) is an enzyme responsible for making RNA from a DNA or RNA template. RNAP accomplishes this task by constructing RNA chains through a process termed transcription. In scientific terms, RNAP is a nucleotidyl transferase that polymerizes ribonucleotides at the 3' end of an RNA transcript. RNA polymerase enzymes are essential and are found in all organisms, cells, and many viruses.\nEukaryotes have several types of RNAP:\n\nRNA polymerase I synthesizes a pre-rRNA 45S, which matures into 28 S, 18S and 5,8S rRNAs which will form the major RNA sections of the ribosome. \n\nRNA polymerase II synthesizes precursors of mRNAs and most snRNA. This is the most studied type, and due to the high level of control required over transcription a range of transcription factors are required for its binding to promoters. For detail of RNA polymerase function please see RNA polymerase II. \n\nRNA polymerase III synthesizes tRNAs, rRNA 5S and other small RNAs found in the nucleus and cytosol. \n\nOther RNA polymerase types in mitochondria and chloroplasts.
You need minimum \n1. mRNA that acts as a template\n2. Ribosomes to catalyze the reaction\n3. Transfer RNAs carrying amino acids. The amino acids are the building blocks of the protein chain and the tRNA is needed so that the system knows which amino acid to use.\n But also GTP to provide the energy for the elongation of the chain, elongation factors, etc.

64, divisible by 2,4,8,16,32.\n\nThats actually easy to prove. If you write out any number n as a product of primes:\n2^(a1) * 3^(a2) * 5^(a3)...\nthen how many factors does it have? For each factor, we need to choose a power of 2 between 0 and a1, a power of 3 between 0 and a2.., ie a total of (a1+1)(a2+1)(a3+1)... choices.\n\nIn this case, we need exactly 7 factors (5, plus 1 and itself), and the only way to make 7 out of a product like that is to make a1 = 6 (since we want the smallest, no need to choose a2 etc).\n\n(Note that it is *NOT* 2^(n+1) for n positive integers in general, as one answerer said. Take n = 7, say (where we want 9 factors). Its much better to choose a1 = 2, a2 = 2 to get 36, as opposed to taking a1 = 8 to get 256.)\n\nReplying to Jud: Sorry, I made a mistake. a1 = 2, a2 = 2 gives 36 as the smallest number with 7 factors other than 1: 2,3,4,6,9,12,18.\n256 is quite a bit higher than that :)

Think of the applications for medicine, to name a field... if we can put people into safe suspension for even 24 hours, imagine how much more effective and safer surgery would be. \n\n2. Now, as for manned space exploration... ""it depends"" kind of sums up the options. \n\n2A. What's the safety factor? \n\nI'm leery of cryogenics, for the reason that I'm not aware of any large-brained animal that can fully recover after having been frozen. Yes, I know, people have been revived after thirty minutes under the ice..  but I mean, frozen *solid.*\n\nI'm no expert on this subject. Please bring on citations to the contrary, but freezing one's brain has to be an order of magnitude more difficult than freezing the rest of one's body.

The only way I can imagine that we'd seriously push for some kind of human estivation in interplanetary travel, is if there was some tremendous urgency in establishing bases in the outer solar system...\n\nFor example, solar-system-wide, international competition, first one there gets the helium 3 and a great view down the gravity well. That imperative would over-ride the hazards of daring such exceedingly long trips (Saturn, anyone?) with chemical propulsion. \n\nWithout such a driver, we'll just have to wait until nuclear rocket propulsion or magsails come on-line. \n\nBy definition, an interstellar voyage will be a long one- and an irrevocable one as well.\n\n2C. What's the mission? Colonization or exploration? \n\nIt was a common experience for immigrants to the United States, until about 50 years ago, to regard their trip here as an essentially one-way voyage. \n\nFuture emigrants from our solar system would have to have much the same attitude, regardless of travel velocity; therefore, travel velocity would play second fiddle, I think, to the overall object of getting a colony-sized vehicle up to *any* fraction of light. If so, then suspended animation would be hugely important, as it would avoid the enormous difficulties of a generation ship. \n\nI can grok a high-tau mission to a nearby star without hibernation - time dilation will shorten the trip considerably for the explorers. \n\nThat said... it's not unlike saying ""Giant squid calamari will be the absolute best seafood ever"" - one first must have caught a giant squid!

The NaOH - OH- ratio is also 1:1.\n\nOne of the two numbers, H+ or OH-, is bigger than the other; subtract to find out which one is in excess.  If it is the H+, get the pH by taking the -log.  If it is the OH-, get the pOH by taking the \n-log and then subtract from 14 to get the pH \n(since pH + pOH = 14).\n\nSecond problem:  take the antilog of -1.84 to get the H+.\nFor the OH- subtract the pH from 14 to get the pOH and then take the antilog of that number to get the OH- (remember to change the number to a negative before you take the antilog).\n\nYou now have your H+ and OH-, proceed as in the first problem
Since you asked this question in earth sciences and geology category, I will assume that you are interested in the kind of dust that gets blown around in the wind, and so forth. \nThe great volume of this dust is formed by erosion (water, wind, ice) of soil, lake beds, and rocks. Clay particles are an especially abundant component of dust--because of they can be small enough to be easily picked up by wind.  But, dust can also contain anything else of the right size (small, light). USGS analysis of dust samples collected at monitoring stations shows that the African dusts can carry pesticides, heavy metals (such as mercury and arsenic), naturally occurring radioactive isotopes, pollen, insects, miscellaneous organic debris, smoke, and pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and fungi.\nArid environments generate big dust clouds at time because there are not many plants holding the surface down. Africa and the dry parts of China, for example, may generate big plumes of dust. Known dust sources in the SW USA include dry lake (playa) surfaces and their margins, ephemeral drainage areas, poorly vegetated alluvial fans, agricultural fields, military bases, and growing urban and rural areas. \n\nhttp://esp.cr.usgs.gov/info/dust/\nhttp://health.usgs.gov/inhalation/african_dust.html\nhttp://esp.cr.usgs.gov/info/sw/monitor/dust.html
Very simple. First, bring all the variable terms to one side of the equation and the constants to the other side. In the given example,\n1 - 6y = 1 + 4y\n-6y - 4y = 1 - 1\n-10y = 0\ny = 0
You'd do better to plant beans in the ground.  They're usually big, vigorous climbers and need some room and stakes or strings or cages or something like that to support their twining growth.  Plus, they need some sun, so make sure you have the right growing conditions for them.\n\nAs far as dirt, long-release plant food like in potting mix tends to support flower growth, which is not exactly what you want.  You want some leaves, some roots, some flowers (gotta have flowers to get beans)...potting soil is too specific.  I'd get some topsoil in a bag and mix in some rotten manure (if you don't have a manure pile around, beg some from somebody with farm animals or buy a bag pre-rotted.)  It *has* to be rotten--raw manure uses up nitrogen in order to rot, and beans need their nitrogen.\n\nMix the two until the result is black and crumbly.  Or, mix the rotted manure in with your soil in the ground.  Good rotten manure doesn't stink--it just smells like earth.  Plant, mind the pests, and water as needed.  Good compost is a pretty good bet, too.  Use like rotten manure.
I remember having trouble with these types of problems too.  There's so many trig identities to choose from, it's hard to know sometimes what to use!\n\nSince there's no trig identity (that I know of) for secx + tanx, I think I'd multiply my fraction by (secx-tanx) / (secx-tanx) to see if I can get rid of the denominator.  (A trick that sometimes works when you have a-b in the denominator is to multiply top and bottom by a+b so that you get a²-b² in the denominator.):\n\n1 / (secx + tanx) = \n\n(secx - tanx) / (secx + tanx)(secx - tanx) =\n\n(secx - tanx) / (sec²x - tan²x)\n\nNow I would use the trig identity tan²x + 1 = sec²2 (because notice this can be rewritten as 1 = sec²x - tan²x).  So ....\n\n(secx - tanx) / (sec²x - tan²x) = \n\n(secx - tanx) / 1 =\n\nsecx - tanx\n\nHope that helped!\n\n~ ♥ ~

"You can find all kinds of work environments.  Simulating things on a computer all day.  Testing things in a lab all day.  Conceptual design or detailed design.  Solving problems at the customer's site (Alaska in winter or SoCal at the ocean in summer).  Solving problems in your own company's mfg line.  Helping to sell your products to other companies. Helping define standards that will be used industry-wide.  Testifying in court cases.  Analyzing patent applications.  Supervise other engineers.\n\nTry as many as you can to find out which ones you'd really like to do for a long time...\n\nSome of the cool things you'll do:\n\nSee something you drew up get built.\nGet something you designed to work the way you thought it should.\nGet something you designed to work the way the boss thought it should.\nGet something you designed to work the way the customer thought it should.  (yes, they are all different!)\nGet something that your team designed to work the way the customer thought it should and now they are going to pay your company for it.\nPoint to something and tell your friends that you helped design it.\nHave something you designed get used by someone else and you know it helped them, even if they never heard of you.\nHave other engineers start asking you questions because they know you're the expert -- and you really are.\nCome up with a real cool solution that makes the customer's mouth drop open (because they know ""it can't be done"") during a design review presentation.\nDocument something well enough that the Production people don't call you.\n\nNot so cool things:\n\nGet laid off along with the rest of your coworkers -- usually just after buying a new car or house.\nSpend a long time at the customer's site during your least favorite season to be there.\nPut in 60 (80? 100?) hours and end up more behind than when you started the week.\nHave your boss take credit for your work.\nHave your boss's boss take credit for your work.\nHave someone you've never heard of in your corporation from another city take credit for your work.\nHave the customer ask your boss WTF when they see your design review presentation.\nSpend weeks answering Production questions while you're trying to get started on your new project.\n\nJust remember, they pay you because it's not always fun -- that's why it's called work!\n\nAlso, remember that engineers don't actually build things -- they create documents that let others build things.  Our outputs are the documents, so you want those to reflect your skills, abilities, and professionalism.  Yes, the products have to work, but they will always be built to the documents you create.  Sometimes it takes a while to ""get religion"" in this area, but the first time you're 2000 miles from home, using other engineers' documentation, and you aren't leaving until the customer is happy, will be the last time you put less information, instead of more information, in a document.  You'll curse their lack of documentation and resolve that you won't do that with yours (ever again).  If you're really unlucky, one of those poor documents will be yours from 6 months before, so you'll have to reconstruct what you were trying to do while the customer and your boss wonder why since you created it in the first place!  Definitely something to try to avoid if you want to have engineering as a long career."
Yes, but it's very hard to do that, I think.

"The conditional probability is the likelihood of an event, given the occurrence of another event.  It is usually written,\n\np(A|B)\n\nwhich is read as ""the probability of A, given B.""  This conditional probability assumes B has happened.\n\nIn your problem, assuming Micron goes UP, then on 10 of 17 days, Gateway goes up.  Thus the probability of Gateway going up, given Micron going up, is 10/17.\n\nSimilarly, p(Gateway up | Micron not up) = 2/8.\n\nThe key is, you take the first event as given and go from there."

"It depends on the amount of energy in time used.\n\nKilowattsX56.92=BTU/ per minute   This one tells us how many BTU's can be generated per minute per kilowatt\n\nKilowatts-hoursX3415= BTU      This one tells us how many BTU's for each hour a kilowatt is consumed\n\nSo therefore the answer to your question is 56.92 BTU's per minute, or 3415 BTU's per hour. Generally when we talk of BTU's to heat a pool or a hot tub we are referring to the BTU""s per minute. So it is possible to figure the kilowatt usage for each hour of operation of the appliance by dividing the BTU's by 56.92."

Bacteria plays a very important role in the nutrient cycle, such as the nitrogen cycle. They help decompose dead matter too, returning the nutrients in the dead matter back to the ecosystem.\n\nBesides that, there are lots of bacteria in the human gut, that plays an important role in aiding digestion. \n\nIn modern science, bacteria plays a big part in biotechnology, such as in the manufacture of cheese, yoghurt, production of wine etc. because bacteria is necessary in fermentation. It's also used as a vector, for splicing and inserting the insulin gene during the commercial production of certain drugs like insulin, for the diabetic patients.\n\nHope this helps =)

the first answer is partially correct.\n\nThe max tension is when the bob is straight down, but note that that the velocity is also a maximum at this point. There is a normal acceleration of v*v/r which increases the tension. The tension is m(g + v*v/r). Note v is velocity and can be found from conservation of energy. r is the length of the rope.\n\nThe minimum tension has no velocity component and comes only from the gravity component as the person above points out.

Hi, \n\nFor the example that you gave, the number that you choose will have two digits, a and b. \n\nso the two digit number will be 10a +b.

At room temperature and pressure (i.e., STP conditions), the main reaction of interest here is:\n\nCaO(s) + H2O(l) = Ca(OH)2(s)\n\nCaO(s) and H2O combine in a 1:1 ratio to form Ca(OH)2(s)\n\nBoth CaO and Ca(OH)2 are relatively insoluble in water, so we'll ignore the heat (enthalpy) changes of the reactions:\n\nCaO(s) = Ca++(aq) + O-- (aq)\nand\nCa(OH)2 = Ca++(aq) + 2OH-(aq)\n\nThe NIST Chemistry Webbook (see source) lists the standard enthalpies of formation for water, CaO, and Ca(OH)2 as:\n\nH2O(l) delta-Hf = -285.83 kJ/mol\nCaO(s) delta-Hf = -635 kJ/mol\nCa(OH)2(s) delta-Hf = -986.09 kJ/mol\n\n\nThe standard enthalpy change for the first reaction is then given by:\n\ndelta-H = -986.09 kJ/mol -(-635 kJ/mol) -(-285.83 kJ/mol) \ndelta-H = -65.26 kJ/mol\n\ndelta-H for this reaction is negative, so heat is released.\n\nEach mole of CaO that reacts with a mole of H2O at STP will release 65.26 * 10^3 J of energy as heat.  If  X moles of CaO reacts, then X * 65.26 * 10^3 J of heat will be released.

According to the experts, it's a solid iron ball.  That's where we get the Earth's magnetic poles from.  (BTW, the magnetic poles have been known to flip--usually about every 130,000 years, but they haven't for about 700,000 years [we're overdue!].)  If we didn't have the magnetic poles caused by the Earth's core, the atmosphere would be stripped away, like Mars'.  And, without the magnetic field around the Earth, deadly levels of radiation from the sun would fry everything on the planet.  Not good.

Yes of course you could, it would probably take another 15,000 years of domestication to reach the same diversity dogs are at now but it could be done easily. In fact dogs are wolves at the molecular level, they are also classified as a subspecies of wolf. Not to mention the fact that it would be easier to re-domesticate feral pariah dogs like Dingos etc.... all they are is domesticated dogs that went back to the wild. I know it is possible... I know people who have formed friendships with wild wolves (not captive) and although it would take some time we could easily domesticate wolves and wild dogs and eventually re-create the domestic dog as we know it. As was previously mentioned it has already been done with foxes.. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tame_Silver_Fox\n\nExcerpt from Wikipedia... Speed of domestication\nCurrent research indicates that domestication, or the attributes of a domesticated animal, can occur much more quickly[17] than previously believed. Domestication of a wild dog may occur within one or two human generations with deliberate selective breeding. It is also now generally believed that initial domestication was through mutual desire. Wild canines who scavenged around human habitations received more food than their more skittish or fearful counterparts. Canines who attacked people or their children were likely killed or driven away, while those more friendly animals survived. Canines would have been beneficial by chasing away other vermin or scavengers. With their sharp senses, they would also be valuable as an alarm against marauding predators. The relationship is theorized to have developed in this way.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog#Ancestry_and_history_of_domestication\n\nIn terms of their molecular biology, dogs are wolves (Canis lupus) and the wide variation in their adult morphology probably results from simple changes in developmental rates and timing\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_the_domestic_dog\n\nPS Whats wrong with people?? It would take no genetic engineering, just a few generations of selective breeding...dogs are already wolves its not that far of a leap....
"Einstein's theory of relativity figures in your question.  How we perceive ourselves turns on our metabolism.

Like the above person said, the more eggs you spit out, the more likely there is of some of them surviving to adulthood. It also depends on the development of the species. Chickens are relatively developed in comparison to frogs (tadpoles) when hatched, so more energy is put into each egg and ensuring its survival (the hen incubates the egg). Most frogs however, lay a mass of eggs and leave them to their own defences. \nTry and compare some animals that lay eggs and the state of development of the offspring and that gives you a pretty good understanding.
presume you are on about electric circuits.\ndepends whether you are on about electroinc or electrical circuits. (massive field of interest) probably best bet is to do a search on ohms law and basic circuit theorem. or ask you lecturers for a good book.
"First, put each pair of equations into ""slope-intercept"" form, which means that each equation is expressed as y = mx + b, where m and b are constants.\n\nPerforming this step for the three pairs of equations produces the following results:\n\n3x+y=5 and x=2y-3 \nbecomes y = -3x + 5 and y = (1/2)x + 3/2\n\ny=-x+4 and y=-x+2 is already in slope-intercept form\n\ny=-x+4 and 2x+2y=8\nbecomes y = -x + 4 and y = -x + 4\n\nNow you're ready to analyze them:\n1. if the two equations are identical, then they are ""dependent."" That is, for any value of x the two equations will produce the same value for y. The FULL name of this situation is ""consistent, dependent."" In other words, the two equations have at least one solution (i.e., they are ""consistent""). And in fact they have an infinite number of solutions because they are identical (i.e., they are ""dependent"").\n\n2. If the two equations have the same value for m (the slope), but different values for b (the y-intercept), then they are inconsistent. That is, there are no combinations of x and y values that satisfy both equations. In graphical terms, they consist of two straight lines that do not intersect (if they intersected, that point of intersection would be a solution of the two equations). This is true because the two lines are parallel. We know that they are parallel because they have the same slope. We know that they do not meet because they have different y-intercepts (i.e., they are parallel lines that pass through the y axis at two different points).\n\nFinally, if the two equations have different slopes (different values of m), then they are consistent, independent equations. That is, they are consistent, in that there is at least one solution. And they are independent because they are not simply identical equations. How do we know this? Because the slopes are different, the two lines can not be parallel, so they must intersect. And being straight lines, they will intersect in exactly one point.\n\nThat covers all the possibilities:\n1. the lines have different slopes (different values of m), so they are not parallel (consistent, independent)\n2. the lines have the same slope (same value of m) and the same y-intercept (same value of b), so they are the same equation, and their lines exactly overlap (consistent dependent)\n3. the lines have the same slope (same value of m), but different y-intercept (different values of b), so they are parallel and non-intersecting (inconsistent)"

Motion itself is measured by velocity, which is defined as the change in distance over some unit of time.  In physics, the standard expression of velocity is in meters per second, or m/s.  Velocity is a vector quantity, which means that it has both a magnitude (a number) and a direction (plus/minus, or compass heading, or whatever works in the context).\n\nForce, even net force, cannot be a measure of motion, because force by itself says nothing about its impact on the object -- we must also know the mass of the object to derive motion from force (Force = mass*acceleration).  Even then, we cannot directly compute velocity; instead, we get the acceleration of the object, which measures the change in velocity that the force brings to the object (in other words, acceleration is the change in 'meters per second,' per second, and is thus written as m/s^2).
"According to Newton's first law... \n\nAn object at rest will remain at rest unless acted on by an unbalanced force. An object in motion continues in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. \nThis law is often called \n""the law of inertia"". \n \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does this mean? \n This means that there is a natural tendency of objects to keep on doing what they're doing. All objects resist changes in their state of motion. In the absence of an unbalanced force, an object in motion will maintain this state of motion. \n\nAccording to Newton's second law... \nAcceleration is produced when a force acts on a mass. The greater the mass (of the object being accelerated) the greater the amount of force needed (to accelerate the object).  \n\n\n\nWhat does this mean? \n Everyone unconsiously knows the Second Law. Everyone knows that heavier objects require more force to move the same distance as lighter objects. \n\n             \n             \n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the Second Law gives us an exact relationship between force, mass, and acceleration. It can be expressed as a mathematical equation: \n\n \nor \nFORCE = MASS times ACCELERATION \n\nAccording to Newton's third law... \nFor every action there is an equal and opposite re-action.  \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does this mean? \n\n This means that for every force there is a reaction force that is equal in size, but opposite in direction. That is to say that whenever an object pushes another object it gets pushed back in the opposite direction equally hard. \n\n\n\nLet's study how a rocket works to understand\nNewton's Third Law. \n\n \nThe rocket's action is to push down on the ground with the force of its powerful engines, and the reaction is that the ground pushes the rocket upwards with an equal force.  \n\n\n  UP, \nUP, \nand \nAWAY!  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have just learned about \nNewton's Three Laws of Motion."

The 98 a values form an arithmetic sequence. That is, each successive one is larger than the previous one by a constant amount.\n\nLet the first value be x. (That is, a1 = x.)\nLet the increase amount be i.\nSo a2 = x + i, a3 = x + 2i, etc.\n\nSo the total for the 98 values is 98x + (i + 2i + 3i + ... + 97i).\n(Note that a98 is the 97th term after a1, so it equals a1 plus 97i, not a1 plus 98i.)\n\nWe need a way to simplify the sum of the i's (from 1 i to 97 i's).\nThere is a formula for this. The sum is i (97)(98)/2 = 4753i.\n\nSo now we have:\n98x + 4753i = 2006\n\nThere are lots of values of x and i that will satisfy this equation. In fact, you could choose ANY value for x and then solve for the value of i that will work: i = (2006 - 98x) / 4753\n\nAre x and i supposed to be integers? If so, this problem is of a type called Diophantine equations. These are tricky to solve. \nIn this case, I believe that there is no integer solution, but I'm not positive.

There are many of them, however, it is unlikely Humanity will survive to go meet them. Over the centuries, your planet was a curious place to visit once or twice and was not considered very interesting . Sure, your wars showed us how undeveloped you are as a species.  Your infantile,(in cosmic terms) dependence on god concepts does not bode well for you and neither does your penchant to breed beyond your planet's ability to sustain you. We are now showing an interest in you because it is not often that we get to observe a species commit suicide. You are so close to maturing as a sentient species and it will be a shame to see you kill yourselves. There are just not enough of you becoming rational enough to force the issue. You let the least among you determine your fate, so be it.

C.  Symbiosis involves a relationship by which both partners give something to the relationship.  A pathogen only takes, but does not provide.  \n\nFor A,  the human intestine provides food, and the bacteria produce vitamins.  For B, the bacteria aid in pollination and once again are provided with a food source.  For D, bacteria once again have a food source (and even outcompete) and thus help provide protection.   And E, the bacteria fix nitrogen for the plants' survival and get a place to live and food.\n\n\nThe key to convergent evolution is that the two species are not closely related, eliminating B and D.  The process involves the independent acquiring of similar traits due to similar environmental pressures.  This points us to E.

First, if that is an exact quote from the teacher, that teacher needs to proof read their work.\n\nThe only star that has a significant influence on our plane, and therefor our sky is the sun.  The sky generally refers to the atmosphere, which consists of different types of gasses: nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor and many others.  If the sun were to suddenly disappear it would get very cold very quick.  The temperature on the surface of the Earth would fall to below -200 degrees Celsius.  The gases in the atmosphere would all liquefy at this temperature, therefor what we refer to as the sky would exist no more.  We would be similar to the pseudo planet Pluto.  One difference is that our planet does have a molten core that would add warmth to a degree that I can not guess.\n\nTo sum up:  without the sun, we would have a cold, dark planet with no atmosphere to speak of, therefor no sky.

"It depends what you mean by weigh less.\n\n* If you are referring to its density, cooling it below 0°C at Standard Temperature and Pressure will freeze it, and reduce its density (boiling it above 100 C again will have the same effect).\n\n* If you are just referreing to the weigh (and not the mass), taking your water to a place with a lower gravitational field than earth's field (eg the moon, or in a space station in orbit) will make it ""weigh less""; since P = m g. Where P is the weigh vector and g is the gravitational field.\n\nBeware: heating it to water vapour (or freezing it to ice) will NOT reduce its weight, just its density."

"Well, where does that ""power"" come from?  \n\nI would say no, because black holes don't have a maximum mass, while pulsars do.  Black holes are what power quasars, and quasars are the most distant objects every seen, so they must be extremely powerful."
None of us posting here will be able to tell you the answer here with any certanty, but the theory that I'd most redaly accept would be that no it does not.  All matter entering a black hole is compressed incredibly in to a very (cosmically speaking) small amount of space.  This pressure and proximity cause a huge build up of energy, but the matter is not lost.  Also the incredible amount of matter in that space creates large gravatational fields.  If the matter was converted into energy the hole would lose its power to capture more matter.

"The Monty Pithon had a song ""Money makes the world go round"" \n\nBut since the question is in the astronomy category, perhaps you are after the serious answer.  Momentum.  The earth condensed from particles at the beginning of the solar system, and all those small rocks were in orbit around the sun, thus had momentum in them.  By falling into one another, they gave that momentum to the accumulating mass, which started spinning.  Actually, all planets rotate, it is the norm rather than the exception.\n\nBeing in space, without anything substantial to slow it down, save from the moon and sun tidal effect, the earth keeps spinning since then."
The word percent means per 100. So for example, 17% = 17/100. What if the percentage has a decimal in it? It still works the same way. For example, 17.5% = 17.5/100.

"Currently, there is absolutely no evidence to life beyond earth (that the general public knows about).\nAfter light signals, radio waves, telescopes scanning the heavens day and night, satellites taking details pictures of every planet in our solar system, probes digging through the sands of Mars, and on and on, all have turned up with nothing.\nHowever, humans, overall, have not been alive but just a few blinks of an eye ago in cosmis senses, and our tries might all just have been ill-placed, not yet recieved, or completely ignored (considering the fact that to recieve radio transmissions or light transmissions, the other life forms would have had to create something almost entirely like the technology humans have created and that might be our stumbling point, and they also would have to be looking directly at our little spit of a mudball, which is also highly unlikely).\n\nThat is not to say that we are not alone. There could be, in theory, an infinite number of different life forms in the universe, but who knows if any of them have reached the amount of evolution as humans? Or even if they are too advanced to be bothered with our pathetic ""talk to us"" demands. And then of course we really could be all alone, but that is a slim, slim chance.\n\nRecently though there have been reports from astronauts (Neil Armstrong included) working in the apollo missions (and apparently every space mission since) that there were sightings of alien spacecrafts/life seemingly following the rockets as they traversed space!

As having a great knowledge and interests in animals native to the North American continent I've heard of more Bull Moose attacks,  but don't get me wrong when Bull Elk range off into urban environments humans pose a threat to the animal and the animal defends itself.  The same goes for any Bull Moose.  If you show your scared or you threaten them they may attack, any deer in the related family will act the same way.  Thats why hunters take more precautions when trying to successfully bag the big one.  I honestly would never want to mess with either of the two large animals.   The most dangerous in my opinion would have to be prized to the Bull Moose.  But,  its your call.  Have you been out in the field with these animals?  Maybe not.

In general, plants give off oxygen when there is sunlight for photosynthesis. They respire all the time (use up oxygen), but during the day this is outweighed by the oxygen they produce.\n\nSome plants use CAM photosynthesis which changes the answer. They are able to close their stomata (pores) day and night during harsh conditions. This means that though they are photosynthesising, no oxygen is being released. They're just using it up internally. They can't do this forever, but it does mean they can have periods of no oxygen release. Some desert and tree-dwelling plants use this system.

If a man says something in the forest and woman isn't around to hear him, is he still wrong?
Pressure in fluid increases with the depth. The strange thing with pressure is that it works in every direction. So the water above 5 meters is pressing downwards on the water beneath the 5 meters and the water beneath the 5 meters is pressing upwards on the water above. Because it is the same depth the upward and downward pressure is the same. If we put an object into a fluid the fluid above the object is pushing it down, but the fluid beneath the object is pushing it up. Because we are talking about an object now and not some imaginary plane, there is a height difference (depth difference) between the fluid pushing down and the fluid pushing up, so the pressure differs, thus the forces differ. The upward force will be larger then the downward force. It depends on the weight of the object in relation to this forcedifference however if it sinks or floats.

If the codon is changed so that it still codes for the same amino acid, it will not change the protein.  For example, if the original codon is UCU (serine), and it is mutated to UCC, it will still code for serine.
Same thing with dolphins. They drew a colored mark on the side of the dolphin and measured how stressed they were, as well as how they reacted. If they didn't think it was on them, they would ignore it or try to touch the mirror. Since they knew it was them, they would contort themselves to see it better and see it from different angles. Same way you would inspect something in a mirror.

Negligible.  The exact effect would depend on the type of field and its intensity, but in any case the effects would be too small to be useful -- or even measurable.

molecular science is the study of molecules: another words what their properties are,  heat capacity, intereactions, pH sensitivity, pressure,  and what not. Now it depends who you ask, whether its a biologist or a chemist what a molecule really is. if you ask a biologist they may focus on protein, carbohydrate, and lipid interactions  where as if your a chemist you are just focused on monomeric type molecules.

Water, as a polar molecule, induces an accumulation of electron density (dipole moment) at one end of non-polar gas molecules such as oxygen (O2 ) and carbon dioxide (CO2 ). The electron cloud of O2 is normally distributed symmetrically between the bonded O2 atoms. When the negative end of the H2O molecule approaches the oxygen molecule, the electron cloud of the O2 moves away to reduce the negative-to-negative repulsion. A dipole (a molecule with positive and negative charges separated by a distance) results in the nonpolar O2 molecule and causes O2 and H2O to become weakly attracted to each other. This intermolecular attraction between the oppositely charged poles of nearby molecules is termed a dipole- dipole force. The creation of these forces explains the mechanism by which gases dissolve in water.

The main enzymatic products of the exocrine pancreas are trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase, and amylase.  Trypsin and chymotrypsin are proteases.  Lipase breakes down triglycerides.  Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starches into simple sugars.  If the pancreas is not able to secrete amylase into the digestive system, your body will not be able to utilize all the complex carbohydrates that it normally would.  Keep in mind however, that amylase is also secreted in the saliva, so digestion of starches will not be completely eliminated.
The lightning comes first.  Lightning is 5 times hotter than the surface of the sun, so the air around it is superheated and expands rapidly, creating almost a vacuum.  As the lighning dissapates, the pressure around the area immediately fills the vacuum due to the great pressure gradient.  Whenever there is a sudden change in pressure, shock waves are created that make audible sounds.  Just as in a gun shot or a balloon popping, the sudden increase and decrease in pressure cause a loud shockwave that can be heard for miles.

"Technically, anything with mass has gravity and there is no limit to gravity's range, but the affect on the earth is astronomically (pardon the pun) small and may be beyond our ability to detect.\nThat being said, there is another thing that massive object can do, and that is that they can act as a ""gravitational lens"".  We may be able to ""see"" another galaxy or object that is behind the irregular galaxy simple because the mass of the galaxy bends space to the point that the light from the other object bends around it and we can then see it.  This phenomenon has been observed on a small scale, and its effect can be caused by any massive object, not just an irregular galaxy."

The reason we don't fall off the bed while sleeping is due to a knob-like structure, called the pons, located at the base of the brainstem. \n\nThe pons assists in arousal, control of autonomic functions (breathing, heart rate), relays sensory information between the cerebrum and cerebellum, and finally, sleep.\n\nWhen we sleep, the pons virtually paralyzes the main motor muscles of the body and therefore stops us from possibly rolling off the bed. \n\nIn sleep-walkers, the pons does not function properly, allowing the body to function and move normally, even though the person's brain is very much asleep.

Explanation: Have you ever seen a halo around the Moon? This fairly common sight occurs when high thin clouds containing millions of tiny ice crystals cover much of the sky. Each ice crystal acts like a miniature lens. Because most of the crystals have a similar elongated hexagonal shape, light entering one crystal face and exiting through the opposing face refracts 22 degrees, which corresponds to the radius of the Moon Halo. A similar Sun Halo may be visible during the day. The town in the foreground of the above picture is San Sebastian, Spain. The distant planet Jupiter appears by chance on the halo's upper right. Exactly how ice-crystals form in clouds remains under investigation. \n\nThe moon can produce interesting optical effects when conditions are right. The most common of which are moon rings, moon bows, which are similar to rainbows, moon dogs and moon pillars. A rainbow is produced when sunlight is refracted through water droplets - A similar effect is produced when moon light refracts through ice crystals. Below are a few photographs and examples about this interesting phenomena. Thanks to everyone that helped me put together this simple explanation of moon light effects.  \n  A Ring Around The Moon\nThe ring around the Moon is caused by the refraction of Moonlight (which of course is reflected sunlight) from ice crystals in the upper atmosphere. The shape of the ice crystals results in a focusing of the light into a ring. Since the ice crystals typically have the same shape, namely a hexagonal shape, the Moon ring is almost always the same size. \n\nLess typical are the halos that may be produced by different angles in the crystals. They can create halos with an angle of 46 degrees. \n \nMoon Ring Weather Folklore \nFolklore has it that a ring around the moon signifies bad weather is coming, and in many cases this may be true. So how can rings around the moon be a predictor of weather to come? The ice crystals that cover the halo signify high altitude, thin cirrus clouds that normally precede a warm front by one or two days. Typically, a warm front will be associated with a low pressure system which is commonly referred to as a storm. \nIt is believed that the number of stars within a moon halo indicate the number days before bad weather will arrive. Give it a try the next time you observe a moon halo. \n\nRings Around The Sun - The same phenomena that causes lunar halos can also be observed around the sun. A few photos of solar halos using a Coolpix 995 digital camera.   NOTICE: Never look at or photograph the sun directly. \n \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Anatomy of a Moon Halo\nThe ring that appears around the moon arises from light passing through six-sided ice crystals high in the atmosphere. These ice crystals refract, or bend, light in the same manner that a camera lens bends light. The ring has a diameter of 22° , and sometimes, if you are lucky, it is also possible to detect a second ring, 44° diameter. Thin high cirrus clouds lofting at 20,000 feet or more contain tiny ice crystals that originate from the freezing of super cooled water droplets. These crystals behave like jewels refracting and reflecting in different directions. \n\nCloud crystals are varieties of hexagonal prisms, (6 sides) and range in shapes from long columns to thin plate-like shapes that have different face sizes. \n \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMoon Dogs\nMoon dogs are the paler version of sun dogs: bursts of light often in reds and blues that appear on both sides of the moon. Both phenomena are the work of almost invisible clouds that reside in the atmosphere where commercial airliners cruise, at about 30,000 feet. The clouds are composed largely of ice crystals, known as diamond dust. The official name for a moon dog is a paraselene if seen at 22 degrees. If the image is at 90, 120 or 140 degrees then it'

I wish there was some way to include a drawing in the answers.\nStarting from the end, we want the bob to complete a vertical circle about the peg. The radius of this circle will be L/3. The minimum velocity to complete the circle is given by\nv = sqrt (5*g*r) = sqrt (5*g*L/3).\nHence the KE of the bob at the lowest point is\nKE = 1/2 m*v^2 = 5/6 m*g*L. \nThis must be equal to the PE at the beginning of the swing.\nPE = m*g*L*(1 - cos theta).\nThis gives cos theta = 1 - 5/6 = 1/6. Thus the required angle = arccos 1/6 = 80.4 deg. \nFor the derivation of the min velocity for completion of a vertical circle, pl refer to any standard text book on Mechanics.
Your formula itself is incorrect...you must have copied it wrong.
"1. This is true by Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\n\nLet f be a continuous real function defined on a closed interval [a,b]. F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x) means that F(x) = Integrate f(t) dt from a to x. Suppose there is x and x+h inside [a,b], we have F(x) = Integrate f(t) dt from a to x AND F(x+h) = Integrate f(t) dt from a to x+h. The definition for dy/dx is such a limit on \n[F(x+h)-F(x)]/h in which h tends to zero. F(x+h)-F(x)= ""Integrate f(t) dt from a to x+h"" MINUS ""Integrate f(t) dt from a to x"" which is EQUAL TO ""Integrate f(t) dt from x to x+h"" According to mean value theorem, since f is continuos so is F, there exist a value c between [x,x+h] such that ""Integrate f(t) dt from x to x+h"" EQUALS ""f(c) h"". Then [F(x+h)-F(x)]/h = f(c) h/h = f(c). When u tends h to zero, since c is squeezed between [x,x+h], c tends to x (sandwich theorem). Hence dy/dx = f(x).\nTherefore, from y=F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x), you arrive at a conclusion dy/dx=f(x) which is equivalent to your question 1.\n\n2. This is also true by Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.(In fact this is a corollary(small truth following from the truth of a theorem, informally means small theorem)\n\nIf f(x) = F' (x) (ie dF(x)/dx). Therefore we know that limit h->0 for {[F(x+h)-F(x)]/h} is f(x). By mean value theorem, F'(c) = [F(x+h)-F(x)]/h for c in between [x,x+h]. {We assumed continuos function again, if not it doesnt work. In fact all your question means continuos function which is differential at all points within the function interval that we are interested in.} From f(x)= F'(x) we get f(c)=F'(c). Then you have F(x+h) = f(c)Xh + F(x). Since F(x+h) = f(c) h + F(x) for h tends to zero. Lets say we know that a certain initial value F(a). We want to find F(t) in the interval [a,x], then we can first start with F(a+h)=f(c) h + F(x) where c is between [a,a+h] and continue up till x. If we want to find F(x), it is just summation f(t) delta t, and if we limit delta x to zero, we get F(x) = Integrate f(t) dt from a to x  PLUS F(a), which is the antiderivative of f(x).\n\n3. x'' = k for k constant. Then x' = kt + C. x= k/2 * t^2 + Ct + D. Just do direct integration using statement 2."

LASER is an acronym of Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.  What this means is, the intensity of the light is increased via a process called stimulated emission.  The laser contains material called the laser medium, and when photons of light pass through this medium under conditions that are controlled by lenses within the laser, the medium gives up energy in the form of additional photons.  So the laser outputs a fine beam of highly energetic light as a result of a quantum mechanical process.

Yes.  You see the lightning instantaneously, but, since sound travels more slowly than light, the sound of the thunder is delayed.  One fairly reliable way to tell how far away the lightning is is to count the seconds between when you see the lightning strike and when you hear the thunder.  Divide the number of seconds by five, and that is approximately how many miles away the strike was.

Sorry, this is kinda long but stick with me. I studied this at uni so its a really interesting topic for me. If you dont like it blame my lecturers. \n\n70% of all life including the dinosaurs became extinct 65 million years ago at what is known as the K-T Event. The current theory which is known to be the best explanation for this to happen is that a large meteor roughly 10 kilometres in diameter collided with the Earth changing the climate at the time drastically as dust and ash clouded the sky blocking out the sun. At the same time fires raged around the planet as forests caught fire from the intense heat. Now that thats all cleared up lets get down to it.\n\n1) In 1990 a scientist called Alan Hildebrand was looking over some old geophysical data that had been recorded by a group of geophysicists searching for oil in the Yucatan region of Mexico. Within the data he found evidence of what could have been an impact site. What he found was a ring structure 180km in diameter which was called Chicxulub. The location of this structure was just off the northwest tip of the Yucatan Peninsula. The crater has been dated as being 65 million years old\n\n2) In 1980 scientists called Walter and Luis Alvarez wrote a paper on a 1cm layer of clay they had discovered in Gubbio which is in Italy at what was known to be the zone that marked the time the dinosaurs became extinct. This layer was found to be rich in a rare element called Iridium ( Ir ). \n\nThe presence of this element in much greater abundance than would be normally expected caused great confusion. Most of the Earth's store of Ir has been concentrated into the centre of the planet. They found the Iridium levels to be 160 times higher that would normally present. This much Iridium could not have occured naturally. The only way this amount if Ir could have occured is from an asteroid or comet.\n\n3) Quartz is a mineral made from Silica ( pure sand ) and has a structure that can be deformed if it undergoes high pressures. The high velocity impact of a meteor would not only create extreme levels of heat, but also high pressures. The type of pressure applied by an impact causes what is known as shock metamorphism, this deforms the structure of the quartz and creates parallel laminar ripples. This form of quartz has been found around the world and is a very strong argument for the meteor in two respects:\n\n-It is found all over the world, not just locally.\n\n-No other process on the planet creates this type of quartz.\n\n 4) Certain conditions favour certain elements and so if we examine the ratios of elements we can often identify a pattern that tells us what the conditions were. Meteorites have this 'fingerprint' and a characteristic set of elemental ratios. The ratios of elements found in the boundary layers of the impact suggest that it came from outside the earth.\n\nHope this helped
We will assume that air and spring friction is negligible. We will also assume that the mass starts falling with a velocity of zero (it isn't thrown, for example).\n\nFirst, we find the velocity of the mass at the time it strikes the spring. distance = (1/2)gt^2 so:\n4 = (1/2)(9.8)t^2, t = 0.90 sec.\nv = gt = (9.8)(0.90) = 8.85 meters/sec\n\nSo the kinetic energy of the mass when it hits is (1/2)mv^2,\nwhich is (1/2)m(8.85)^2 or 39.2m Joules.\n\nThe work done by gravity as the spring compresses is f*d or\n(9.8)m(1) or 9.8m Joules.\n\nNext, we need to know the work done by the spring as it compresses. This is the integral of force over distance or\nInt(1000LdL). Integrating gives 500 L^2 evaluated from 1 to 0 which is -500 Joules.\n\nFinally, we have our equation. The Kinetic energy of the mass is absorbed by the spring, as is the work done by gravity. So we have :\n\n39.2m + 9.8m = 500\n49m = 500\nm = 10.2 kg.

Base-5 is one of the most primative counting systems.  It was used primarily before the writing of numbers. The signs or words used are hand for 5, two hands for 10, person for 20 (two hands and two feet). \n\nSome cultures would count on fingers with 0 being a closed fist and putting a finger up for one, etc, and some cultures would have 0 being an open hand and 1 would be signified by putting a digit down with 5 represented by a closed fist or 5 down. \n\nBase 5 was used not as a formalized place value, but rather as a grouping value that combined with other values to a larger grouping value. For example 2 fives (two hands) are 10, 4 fives (two hands and two feet-or person) are 20. 12 fives are 60. Each of the groups 10, 20 and 60 were developed into more rigorous numbering systems throughout our globe's cultural history. \n\nThe use of 5 as a grouping value is easily understood as the hand has 5 digits. This grouping was used for several hundreds of thousands of years by many cultures around our globe. \n\nIn the twentieth century, only the East African Luo tribe of Kenya and the Yoruba of Nigeria were still using a base-five system. However, the base-ten (denary or decimal) system has prevailed in most areas and these tribes, like most previously quinary-counting cultures, have converted.\n\nBase-5 is still in use in a few places.  For example merchants near Mumbai, India will use a base-5 counting system for figuring totals.  This allows them to perform calculations on one hand while serving their customers with the other.\n\nMany ancient cultures (Roman, Chinese, Japanese) also used an abacus for counting.  While an abacus is generally used for base-10 calculations, they have a foundation in both base-5 and base-2.  They often have a dividing bar with 5 beads below and 2 beads above for the base-5 and base-2 part of a number.

Therefore, we can conclude that the equation is only true under the following conditions:\n\ncos x = 1\nsqrt[3 sin x] = 0\n\ncos x = 1 and sin x = 0\n\nThe values of x satisfying these two equations are 0 and 2 pi.\n\n2.\n\ncos x - sqrt[3] sin x = 1\ncos x = 1 + sqrt[3] sin x\ncos^2 x = 1 + 2 sqrt[3] sin x + 3 sin^2 x\n1 - sin^2 x = 1 + 2 sqrt[3] sin x + 3 sin^2 x\n4 sin^2 x + 2sqrt[3] sin x = 0\n\n2 sin x (2 sin x - sqrt[3] ) = 0\n\nsin x = 0 or sqrt[3] / 2\n\nFor the first equation, the possible values of x are 0, pi or 2 pi.\n\nFor the second equation, look at the 30-60-90 right triangle to determine that x is either pi / 3 or 2 pi / 3 (60 or 120 degrees).\n\nSo, all of the possible values for x are 0, pi / 3, 2 pi / 3, pi, and 2 pi.

We have:\n(2+√3)^(x^2 - 2x + 1) + (2-√3)^(x^2 - 2x - 1) = 4/(2-√3)\n\n(2-√3) [(2+√3)^(x^2 - 2x + 1) + (2-√3)^(x^2 - 2x - 1)] = 4\n(2-√3)(2+√3)^(x^2 - 2x + 1) + (2-√3)(2-√3)^(x^2 - 2x - 1) = 4\n(2-√3)(2+√3)(2+√3)^(x^2 - 2x) + (2-√3)^(x^2 - 2x) = 4\nand (2-√3)(2+√3) = 1, so we have:\n\n(2+√3)^(x^2 - 2x) + (2-√3)^(x^2 - 2x) = 4\nagain, (2-√3)(2+√3) = 1 so (2-√3) = 1 /(2+√3) \nsubstituting,\n\n(2+√3)^(x^2 - 2x) + 1/(2+√3)^(x^2 - 2x) = 4\nLet y = (2+√3)^(x^2 - 2x)\nso y + 1/y = 4\nor y^2 - 4y + 1 = 0\ny can then be found to be 2 ± √3\n\nso (2+√3)^(x^2 - 2x) = 2 ± √3\nif (2+√3)^(x^2 - 2x) = 2 + √3, then x^2 - 2x = 1\nif (2+√3)^(x^2 - 2x) = 2 - √3 = (2 + √3)^(-1), then x^2 - 2x = -1\n\nsolving these for x, we find x = 1 ± √2 or the double root x = 1
The partial pressure of H2 is just the total pressure minus the partial pressure of Ne.  The ratio of the H2 part press and total press gives the mole fraction of H2.  \n\nNow just calculate the number of moles in your 421 mL using the ideal gas equation  PV = nRT.  Solve for n, multiply this by the mole fraction of H2 to get the moles of H2, then multiply this by the mole weight of H2.\n\nI'll let you do the math.

Some seedless fruits are grown from grafts on existing trees.   Seedless grapes are not technically seedless, although they are seedless for practical purposes. Seedless grapes are different than most seedless fruits because the seeds initially develop but abort when they are very tiny embryos. So,  in seedless grapes, normal fertilization does occur. You can often see \nthe remains of the aborted seed in the mature fruit. Seedless grape breeders can remove the tiny embryos before they abort and grow them in tissue culture to produce a mature plant. This is termed embryo rescue.

Yes.  Fat cells are consumed for energy, which is why you can lose weight by exercising.  When you eat extra food, your body converts the excess energy into a storable chemical form, fat.  When you push your body to consume extra energy, as by exercising, the fat cells are raided and you lose weight.

No. I think they are extinct for a reason. What that reason could be I do not know. It is just the order of things. I would definitely think that they are cool and stuff, but I think the movie Jurassic Park was pretty accurate. Scientists would lose control. At some point anyway. Scientists made nuclear weapons and now we are being threatened every day by terrorists claiming to have them. \nI guess I would like to see dinosaurs, but not at the expense of destroying mankind. Maybe if it was controlled, but when have we ever had control? Could you imagine a Stegosaurus eating a tree in your back yard? Or an outbreak of T-Rex's in Texas?

Think of the die as containing one 1, one 2, two 3s, two 4s, six 5s, and six 6s.\n\nThis way, the probability of rolling a 3 is 2/18 = 1/9 and the probability of rolling a 5 is 6/18 = 1/3, which is three times as likely as 1/9.\n\nNow, since there is only one 2 present on the die, the chance of rolling a two is 1/18. Since there are two 4s on the die, the chance of rolling a 4 is 2/18. Add these two probabilities together to get:\n1/18 + 2/18 = 3/18 = 1/6\n\nThe answer is (a) 1/6\n\nGood luck, I hope this helps!

Hi. I'm going to try to answer this the best I can.  I've never heard of nigrogen base analogs: maybe you meant nucleotide base analogs? Typically (especially in HIV) the nucleotide base analogs take the place of a normal base, making the transcription of the virus 'inaccurate' with the mistake in it.  This slows down viral replication, and helps inhibit the spread of the virus.

"Not at all. Chlorella is a genus of unicellular green algae belonging to the Phylum Chlorophyta. Chlorophytes comprise a major component of the phytoplankton. Chlorella is a popular food supplement in Japan and is marketed as a nutritional supplement in the United States. Chlorella, along with wheat grass, barley grass and spirulina, are sometimes referred to as ""green foods."" There are several species of chlorella. Those most commonly used in nutritional supplements are Chlorella vulgaris and Chlorella pyrenoidosa.\n\nChlorella is rich in protein. In addition, it is rich in chlorophyll, carotenoids, such as astaxanthin, canthaxanthin, flavoxanthin, loraxanthin, neoxanthin and violaxanthin. Chlorella also contains the xanthophyll, echinenone.\n\nChlorophyll is the molecule that absorbs sunlight and uses its energy to synthesise carbohydrates from CO2 and water. This process is known as photosynthesis and is the basis for sustaining the life processes of all plants. Since animals and humans obtain their food supply by eating plants, photosynthesis can be said to be the source of our life also.\n\n;-D Chlorophyll is the green coloration in leaves."

The rules of math are always consistent.  I'm not really sure what you're asking about x, but different problems are solved in different ways.  In algebra, adding or subtracting x is usually enough to get your solution, while calculus often involves multiplying by x or dividing out powers of x.  More complicated math requires more complicated formulae, but that doesn't mean that the rules of the more basic formulae have been changed.

Thermic Fluid System work on closed loop principle and is the best solution for any heating need in process industry. In Thermic Fluid System, a synthetic / mineral based thermic fluid is circulated in the system using high temperature resistant pump and heat is one through combustion of fuel in main coils of the Thermic Fluid Heater. the heat produced is then utilized by thermic fluid and then utilised in the process. The returning fluid coming out of the process is taken to uniquely designed expansion cum deaeration tank, where all system is made non pressurized. The fluid from expansion tank goes back to the pump again and the process is repeated. temperatures up to 300 Deg. C can be achieved using Thermic Fluid Systems.
"The eggs are formed in the gonads of the females, that is, in the ovaries. They pass through the oviducts, where different protective layers are added, and finally go out of the female's body through the cloaca, an opening that is anterior to the tail (if they have one). \nThe cloaca also receives the end products of the digestive system (i.e. the feces) and the kidneys (i.e. the urine). \nThis process is common to all tetrapods (amphibians, ""reptiles"", birds and egg-laying mammals).\n\nWhat happens to the unfertilized egg within the oviduct is very different in amphibians and reptiles. If you're not interested, you may stop reading here ;-)\n\n************************** \nMost amphibians have external fertilization. This means that while the egg is inside the mother's body, it is still an undeveloped ovum. In some amphibian females (especially frogs and toads) the eggs are so abundant that they fill most of her abdominal cavity before they're released. They are usually released into water bodies, and the male fertilizes them as they come out. \n\nIn cecilians (legless amphibians), the males do have a copulatory organ (which acts as a penis) and fertilization of the eggs occurs within the mother's body. Some of them are oviparous and lay already-fertilized eggs, but others are viviparous.\n\nIn the case of newts and salamanders, fertilization can happen in the mother's oviduct because the males produce ""sperm packages"" called spermatophores, which the female takes with her cloaca. Then the eggs come out already fertilized; but there are also ovoviviparous and viviparous forms.\n\n****************\nNow, reptiles are a different story. Like us mammals, they are Amniotes, which means that their eggs (as those of birds and egg-laying mammals), come out of the female body already fertilized and well on their way to development. The amniote egg is a closed ""survival module"" that has everything the embryo needs to survive and develop: food (the vitellum, or egg yolk), water, calcium for its bones, an air chamber, etc. encased in a tough  cover (frequently calcified). \nThis means that fertilization must occur _before_ the egg is laid, while the ovum is travelling along the oviduct. All amniotes have internal fertilization, and male reptiles have a penis (turtles and crocs) or paired hemipenes (lizards and snakes). \n\nTo sum up, both groups lay their eggs through the cloacal opening, but amphibian eggs need water or at least moistness to survive, because they don't have the embryonic membranes of amniotes and they lose water fast. Amphibian eggs usually don't have much food either, and the embryos hatch as larvae or tadpoles that eat by themselves. In contrast, reptile embryos grow inside their extraembryonic membranes and hatch as mini-adults."

I agree with arbiter's approach and, mostly, his answer.  But I'd use an alternator efficiency more like 50% and therefore get about 75 ml/hour of gasoline.  (0.02 US gallons/hour).\n\nFor my Prius cruising at 65 mph, getting 48 mpg (1.35 gallons per hour), that would reduce gas mileage by 1.5%.  Or from 48.0 mpg to 47.3 mpg.  Maybe a touch less because the gasoline engine only comes on during more efficient loads (i.e. it never idles or operates at 5%) so it does a bit better than 30% efficiency.  \n\nI know a really meticulous German guy who approaches 70 mpg in a diesel VW by using all the tricks - no lights, no fan use, keeping the junk out of the trunk, shutting down as he approaches stops, high-pressure tires, slow starts, etc.  But, man!, it is nerve-racking to drive with someone like that.\n\nFor a Hummer getting 14 mpg on the highway (with a tailwind!), it would drop to 13.94 mpg.  Pretty dang hard to notice.\n\nOver 100,000 (daytime) miles at an average speed of 30 mph, 0.02 gallons per hour adds up to 67 gallons.  For either car.\n\nOf course, one head-on collision by someone who didn't notice your car, and you'd wish you'd spent the $200 on the extra gasoline.\n\nInterestingly, if the Hummer averages 12 mpg over 100,000 miles, and gas is $3/gallon, it will cost $25,000 to keep it fueled up.  With which, one could have bought a Prius.  Or two Echos (which would seat 10!).  Hmmmmm.

Day dreamer is correct. The profile of the cable is produced with a twist. Distorting it to any other shape than a spiral requires energy, let the cable free and the stored energy used to distort it is used to relax the cable back to its natural shape.  Try heating up any plastic object and you find before it goes back to a molten blob it will pass through other shapes ( the shapes it passed through when being produced). Its called inbuilt history.

The first one to answer had a point, no one really knows if the universe is infinite. But, assuming it is, some one else said that stars dont comprise the most matter in the universe. Only stars make up only 3 percent of the total matter in the universe, dark matter and dark energy comprise about 90 percent of the matter. And remember that stars usually form in clusters (nebulae) to form galaxies. But yeah, no one really knows if the universe is inifinite or not, I mean Voyager 1 and 2 have only just left the gravitational reach of our sun, so we still have a long way to go.

"Read the whole thing if you want to understand the spectrum. Read the end if you want it to be quick and dirty. I will leave out the part about how the machine receives the signal and how you use math to turn it into something easy to read (both parts of which are really cool, but are not necessary to answer your question).\n\nHere's the theory.\n\nA proton has a net magnetic moment. It's mathematical explanation comes from a relativistic correction in the quantum model and is somewhat mysterious (to me at least), as is all of quantum mechanics. What is nice, however, is that you can add all of the magnetic moments to get the net magnetic moment of your sample. Let's assume we are working in three coordinates, x, y, and z. Now we apply a strong magnetic field along the z axis. The moments of the protons will align themselves with the field, and you will get a net magnetic moment in the z direction. Now you point another magnetic field at the sample, but this field you keep in the x-y plane and you rotate it around the z axis (always pointing it at your sample). \n\nThe internal magnetic moments of the atoms will spin around the z axis with the x-y field. The bigger the magnetic moment, the harder it will be to change, the slower it will rotate around the z axis. When the x-y field and the moment are rotating at exactly the same rate, this is resonance. Protons all have magnetic moments of the same magnitude, but they generally have electrons near them. This is what makes nmr useful. Electrons tend to ""shield"" the proton by cancelling the net magnetic moment to some extent. The more electron density around the proton, the smaller the signal, the closer it will be to resonance. This means that hydrogen atoms sitting close to anything more electronegative than hydrogen (pretty much everything to the right of carbon on the periodic table), will deshield the nucleus and create a stronger net magnetic moment.\n\nProton magnetic resonance is really hydrogen nucleus magnetic resonance, because when you begin to use the same technique on bigger nuclei, other things begin to happen and other names are given to those techiques. What you are measuring when you use proton magnetic resonance is the difference in the rotation frequency of your applied magnetic field and your proton's magnetic moment. If your magnetic field makes 600 million rotations per second, it is a 600 MHz magnet. A proton will tend to be anywhere from 300 to 4500 Hz out of sink with the magnet, but there difference is close to one million times smaller than the total Hz of the magnet, so you take the resonance shift, also known as the chemical shift, to be the difference in Hz divided by the total  Hz of the magnet. This is reported in parts per million, or ppm, and that is what makes up the x axis of your spectrum.\n\nYou throw in an internal standard (like TDMS or DSS) which has a bunch of protons with the same chemical shift close to 0 ppm and you set that peak to zero ppm and scale your spectrum to it. This is just a reference and its job is done. Now you see a spectrum with some peaks on it. Each peak corresponds to a hydrogen atom with a certain chemical shift. If two hydrogens are totally equivalent, their peaks will totally overlap. This means that two hydrogens will share the same peak, and this peak will now be twice as big as a peak with only one hydrogen in it. Since the magnetic moments are kinda variable and quantum theory is inherently probibalistic, the same atom will create a nice distribution curve instead of a straight line. This curve is very much like a statistical distribution. The end result: to get any kind of reliable quantitative observation, you must integrate the peaks, not measure their heights. After you integrate peaks, you can then compare integrals to get an idea of how many hydrogens are represented in each peak. \n\nOne last thing. If a proton is bonded to a carbon, and that carbon is bound to another carbon "

No. Citrus juice contains mainly citric acid, and smaller amounts of ascorbic acid. Titrating with a base does not differentiate between the two. You can get the total acid concentration though.\n\nThe following link demonstrates redox titration to determine Vitamin C. This works because the oxidant (indolphenol) does not react with citric acid.
In general, acids and metals do not mix.\n\nTry a base.

Others have pointed out that it's not a waste of government money, but is it a waste of other folks' money?  I will say probably not.\n\nFirst of all, if we do detect intelligent signals that we wouldn't otherwise have detected, I don't suppose anyone could call it a waste of money, even if very large sums had been spent.\n\nBut even if we continue to not find anything, the project will not have been completely useless.  We'll still have learned a lot about our universe!  Namely, that there aren't any radio signal emitting civilizations within our ability to detect them.  That will, as is often the case in science, raise new questions.  Mainly, why don't we detect any other civilizations?  This is the Fermi Paradox.  See the attached article for information, I think it'll interest you.\n\nOf course, if the money and resources (radio telescope time, etc) spent on SETI could have gotten us more information about the universe if invested in other ways, then, yes, SETI would end up not having been worth it.  But it's difficult to say that unless we already know what we'll find (or fail to find).  And I'm not equipped to evaluate what use of science resources is best.  In the meantime, I'll enjoy what SETI has already told us about the universe and will eagerly await more data, whether that confirms that we are still alone in the known universe or whether we have company.
The most exotic real physics program I ever heard of was NASA's deceased Breakthrough Propulsion Physics research program.  The funded projects read like a sci-fi nut's dream. The beauty was that this was REAL science testing feasibility of different ideas that were not clearly bogus.\n\nhttp://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp/\n\nI encourage you to explore this material, however in the interest of not taking the name of real science in vain, I am reposting an excerpt near the bottom of that page, that you should read and take to heart.\n---------\nCautionary note: On a topic this visionary and whose implications are profound, there is a risk of encountering, premature conclusions in the literature, driven by overzealous enthusiasts as well as pedantic pessimists. The most productive path is to seek out and build upon publications that focus on the critical make-break issues and lingering unknowns, both from the innovators' perspective and their skeptical challengers. Avoid works with broad-sweeping and unsubstantiated claims, either supportive or dismissive.\n----------\n\nRemember, making spectacular claims about what you read there can damage such explorations in the future when your claims prove to be incorrect and those who learn this then dismiss out of hand anything associated with similar work as quackery.

The 4 factors making a chemical reaction faster are:1( higher temperature, 2)smaller pieces 3) concentration increase 4.) adding a catalyst. Pressure incease or decrease may help if a gas is involved. Mixing may help depending on the reactants and their sized pieces.
Factor the numerator and the denominator out:\nr^2 -5r + 6 = (r - 3)(r - 2)\nr^2 - 4 = (r + 2)(r - 2) (A^2 - B^2 can always be factored to (A + B)(A - B)\n\nCross out the (r - 2)'s, and you have (r - 3)/(r + 2), or answer choice A.
All the electronic equipments revolve around the electrons..\nBasically every gadget is made up of tiny transistors, FET etc.. Each of these devices have their own cut-in voltage above which only they will be able to operate... This energy level is the energy at which electrons start to work, ofcourse this energy is released as heat...\n\nThe same example holds good for all exothermic chemical reactions as well
Every fossil, every observation in biology points to evolution. There is nothing that goes against it or points to a different way to scientifically explain modern diversity. There is not one fossil or one piece of DNA that does NOT point to evolution. It would be hard NOT to see the concrete evidence, and only those blinded by faith can do this.\n\nEvolution is 100% world-wide accepted fact, including the evolution of man.\n\nThere is ZERO evidence for a higher being causing anything. This is why people who are religious need faith, you can't see or study the actions of a deity, by definition. Evolution has ZERO faith and ALL evidence.\n\nScientists (real ones) have been studying and supporting evolution for over 150 years, and still nothing has pointed to creationism. There is clear links and transitional forms between everything in the fossil record to the Class-Family level, if not Genus-Species level. And this includes humans, which there are several 'missing links' which are well described and studied, people just choose to ignore this. Sure, there are still things we don't know, but that's why science is not stagnent and dead. We learn more every day, that's what happens when you keep an open mind and follow the scientific method.\n\nThere are some areas of evolution in which all of the pieces have not been found in the fossil record, but there is no counter theory that has even ONE piece of evidence that can not easily be explained by evolution.\n\nLet me turn the question around, if Creationism was correct and science could definitively prove Creationism (and thus the existence of God), why would they not? That would be the greatest scientific discovery in the history of the world. No one would pass that up to maintain the 'status quo'. There is no conspiracy to hide creation evidence. Anyone who knows real scientists knows they are glory-mongers first. They love to prove others wrong to enhance their own standing. And if any scientist could prove Creation/God, it would've been done a long time ago.\n\nGo to a museum, take a class in biology, go to reputable sites on the Internet (like AAAS: http://www.aaas.org/news/press_room/evolution or http://www.talkorigins.org ) and find out for yourself.

Part of energy is always used to increase the entropy of the universe as per laws of thermodynamics. Any photon when is absorbed electrons in the pigment that absorbs the photon are energized/ excited. These excited electrons come to the ground level by 1. transferring their energy to other carrier so that ATP is generated. 2. give out the energy as heat energy so that the temperature increases. 3. give out a photon with less energy content i. e. emit light of longer wavelength. It is called fluorescence. What happens depends upon the system.

Glomeruli capillaries reform into arterioles and then split off into capillaries again around the other parts of the nephron (renal portal system). \n\nTubular reabsorption. A process where much of the water and all that is deemed 'good' is reabsorbed from the proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, and distal convoluted tubule. \n\nThe glomeruli capillaries had reformed into arterioles. Now this blood passes into a second capillary bed that starts by surrounding the proximal convoluted tubule. \n\nHaving gone through the glomeruli, this blood now has a \n\nlow hydrostatic pressure \n\nhigh solute concentration from the proteins that were left behind in the filtered blood (i.e. high osmotic pressure.) \n\n Water readily reenter the proximal convoluted tubule because of the osmotic gradient caused by the proteins in the remaining blood (and reabsorbed solutes) and because there is little hydrostatic pressure to oppose the movement. Some of this passive type of water reabsorption continues into the loop of Henle. About 80% of the water that was filtered is reabsorbed passively in the proximal tubule. The other 20% now becomes more difficult to recover. \n\nThose items that are good for the body are reabsorbed by a combination of free diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active transport. The proximal convoluted tubule is the primary structure that does this, but the loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule, and collecting duct get heavily involved too, depending upon what is being reabsorbed. \n\nGlucose and all monosaccharides are tenaciously recovered. No monosaccharides should appear in the urine. If they do, the active transport systems were probably overloaded which suggests that there was to much glucose in the blood to start with, which suggests diabetes. \n\nAmino acids are tenaciously reabsorbed with strong active transport mechanisms. \n\nIons are reabsorbed as needed (homeostasis). Hormones help decide what ions are too high or too low and the ions are reabsorbed accordingly (E.g H+, Ca++, Mg++, HPO4-- , Cl-, HCO3- , etc.) . Note that the reabsorption of some of these ions (E.g H+, HPO4-- , HCO3-, etc.) is involved in pH control too. \n\nin other words...reabsorption
X = Y^2 is not a function. It fails the vertical line test. You cannot graph it on a graphing calculator. (At least not a TI-86.)\n\nYou need to break it into two pieces that don't have multiple y values per x value. In this case, x = y^2 breaks nicely into \ny = square root of x\nand y = - square root of x\n\nAs far as I know, you can't graph X as a function to Y on any TI graphing calculators, but I only know up to the TI-89. You can simulate a graph of a f(y) = x equation but you have to convert it into a piecewise function.
"A lipoprotein is a biochemical assembly that contains both proteins and lipids. The lipids or their derivatives may be covalently or non-covalently bound to the proteins. Many enzymes, transporters, structural proteins, antigens, adhesins and toxins are lipoproteins. Examples include the high density and low density lipoproteins of the blood, the transmembrane proteins of the mitochondrion and the chloroplast, and bacterial lipoproteins.\n\nGeneral categories of lipoproteins, listed in order from larger and less dense (more fat than protein) to smaller and more dense (more protein, less fat):\n\nChylomicrons - carry triacylglycerol (fat) from the intestines to the liver and to adipose tissue. \n\nVery low density lipoproteins - carry (newly synthesised) triacylglycerol from the liver to adipose tissue.\n \nIntermediate density lipoproteins - are intermediate between VLDL and LDL. They are not usually detectable in the blood. \nLow density lipoproteins - carry cholesterol from the liver to cells of the body. Sometimes referred to as the ""bad cholesterol"" lipoprotein. \n\nHigh density lipoproteins - collects cholesterol from the body's tissues, and brings it back to the liver. Sometimes referred to as the ""good cholesterol"" lipoprotein. \n\nAlpha and beta\nIt is also possible to classify lipoproteins as ""alpha"" and ""beta"", akin to the classification of proteins in serum protein electrophoresis.

Boiling does not remove anything but gases dissolved in the water. Minerals are actually concentrated by boiling since water is removed, but the dissolved solids remain. So, the correct answer is that the oxygen is driven off. Oxygen has no significant solubility in water that hot.  If you really need to boil the water to kill bacteria or something, you can re-aerate the water with an aquarium air rock designed for this purpose. It releases zillions of tiny bubbles into the water. I'd suggest running it for a day or two for a 20 gal tank before reintroducing the fish.

A windmill is an engine powered by the wind to produce energy, often contained in a large building as in traditional post mills, smock mills and tower mills. The energy windmills produce can be used in many ways, traditionally for grinding grain or spices, pumping water, sawing wood or hammering seeds. Modern wind power machines are used for generating electricity and are more properly called wind turbines.\n\nEarly history\nWindmills have been around for at least 1,300 years. The first windmills had vertical shafts and were reportedly built in Persia around the 7th century AD. Made of six to twelve sails covered in fabric or palm leaves, they were used to grind corn and draw up water. A similar type of vertical shaft windmill can also be found in 13th century China.\n\nIn Europe\n Muttons Mill, one of the many drainage windpumps on the Norfolk Broads (United Kingdom)In Europe, windmills were developed in the Middle Ages. The earliest mills were probably grinding mills. They were mounted on city walls and could not be turned into the wind. The earliest known examples date from early 12th century Paris. Because fixed mills did not suffice for regions with changing wind directions, mill types that could be turned into the wind were developed. With some subsequent development mills became versatile in windy regions for all kind of industry, most notably grain grinding mills, sawmills (late 16th century), threshing, and, by applying Archimedes' screws, pumping mills.\n\nWith the industrial revolution, the importance of windmills as primary industrial energy source was replaced by steam and internal combustion engines. Polder mills were replaced by steam, or diesel engines. The industrial revolution and increased use of Steam and later Diesel power however had a lesser effect on the Mills of the Norfolk Broads in the United Kingdom, these being so isolated (on extensive uninhabitable marshland), therefore some of these mills continued use as drainage pumps till as late as 1959. More recently historic windmills are being preserved for their historic value, which requires regular use because the wooden machinery is likely to be destroyed by woodworm and dry rot when the mill remains stationary for too long.\n\nWith increasing environmental concern, and approaching limits to fossil fuel consumption, wind power has regained interest as a renewable energy source. This new generation of wind mills produce electric power and are more generally referred to as wind turbines.\n\nSee Flood control in the Netherlands#Windmills for use of windmills in land reclamation in the Netherlands.\n\nIn the United States\n Farm windmill, Sheridan County, Kansas, USA, 1939The development of the water-pumping windmill in the USA was the major factor in allowing the farming and ranching of vast areas of North America, which were otherwise devoid of readily accessible water. They contributed to the expansion of rail transport systems throughout the world, by pumping water from wells to supply the needs of the steam locomotives of those early times. They are still used today for the same purpose in some areas of the world where a connection to electric power lines is not a realistic option.\n\nThe multi-bladed wind turbine atop a lattice tower made of wood or steel was, for many years, a fixture of the landscape throughout rural America. These mills, made by a variety of manufacturers, featured a large number of blades so that they would turn slowly but with considerable torque in low winds and be self regulating in high winds. A tower-top gearbox and crankshaft converted the rotary motion into reciprocating strokes carried downward through a pole or rod to the pump cylinder below.\n\nWindmills and related equipment are still manufactured and installed today on farms and ranches, usually in remote parts of the western United States where electric power is not readily available.

Well, my son asked me that today. If the earth's land mass was perfectly spherical, the entire earth would be submerged in 200 feet of ocean, everywhere.  That would be pretty flat and smooth.  Contrary to other posts, the weather would be more homogeneous since it would not have the land/water temperature differences. This would be a completely different world.

you should know that London dispersion forces as well as dipole-dipole interactions between polar molecules are both termed as van der Waals forces in some chemistry environments. this is because instantaneous and permanent dipole interactions have little appreciable difference in strength when compared to other forces that also influence mp/bp like hydrogen, covalent or ionic bonds. this is why the relatively tiny HF can disobey the entire trend(because it has that extra oomph)\n\nalso, the closeness of strengths means that London forces can become stronger than permanent dipole forces within reasonable logic. how easily is this achieved? \n\nhere are some b.ps in celsius obtained from wikipedia:\nI2: 184\nHI: -35\nBr2: 58\nHBr: -66\nCl2: -34\nHCl: -85\n\nfrom here you can observe that for the halogen molecules, bps drop drastically due to an equally drastic fall in Mr and electron cloud size. however, for the hydrogen halides, the decrease is only slight.\n\nthe current logic is that london forces may exceed the polar forces because Mr is allowed to increase greatly across many periods while electronegativity is limited to a small range on the Pauling scale.\n\nthe only way for polar forces to greatly exceed london forces woiuld be if the number of halogen atoms is allowed to increase, thereby increasing electronegativity, for example adding an additional bromine atom on a 1-bromomethane rather than merely changing 1-bromomethane to 1-chloromethane.
The concentration of water inside versus outside.  If there is a greater concentration of water outside, the water will stay into/come into the cell.  If the concentration of the water is greater inside, the water will try to escape to the outside.  Think of it this way, if you put too much air inside a balloon it will grow and grow until it's too full and the air has to escape, and it's similiar with water in a cell, if the cell gets too full the water will want to escape out to where it's not as full.
Reactivity of Group I (Alkali metals) increases down the group. It has nothing to do with how much you are using so even if you add 0.1g of potassium and 1g of lithium to cold water, potassium being more reactive than lithium will react more violently than lithium.\nIt has to do with the electronic configuration. Group I metals tend to give away their 1 valence electron to attain stability with full octet (or duplet for lithium). As you go further down the Group, the atoms get bigger (more shells) and the valence electron gets further away from the attractive force of the nucleus (nucleus contains positively charged protons and neutral neutrons hence nucleus are overall, positively charged. Electrons are negatively charged hence there is a force of attraction between the nucleus and the electrons). Hence it becomes easier for the atom to lose that valence electron to form a stable configuration and the ease of giving away that valence electron translates to mean more reactive and finally, more violent, vigorously, explosively reaction down the group of alkali metals.\n\nHope this helps :)

No.  Earthquakes are caused by tectonic stresses.  Any stress that is applied by weather is dwarfed by tectonic stress.\n\nIt all comes down to stress and strain. It is not 'the plates rubbing together' as many people say; or at least that's a very simplistic view.\n\nPlate tectonics causes stress on the continents and oceans, all over the surface of the earth. In some places, the stress is very small (usually within the plates). Elsewhere, the stress is high, usually where the plates meet each other. Since each plate moves, when two come in contact, the stress each other. They can push on each other and cause compressional stress, they can pull with extensional stress, and they can slide past or shear each other with tensional stress.\n\nFaulting, causing earthquakes, comes from the fact that this stress is building up all the time, but rocks and continents are strong materials. Just like hitting a rock with a small hammer, you do put stress on it, but a small amount. It would take a sledgehammer to put enough strain (effects and accumulation of stress) to build up and cause breakage. In the earth, the area around an active fault builds up strain from the stress of plate tectonics. Most faults become locked, because of this strength, and thus can not release their strain. Away from the fault, the stress produces very small and slow movement of the rock masses as a whole. Eventually, the strain is too much and the rest of the plate has moved too far and the fault releases the strain build-up all at once in a big stress release called an earthquake. This is called the elastic rebound theory, and it explains most (but not all) movements.\n\nThis is why an earthquake's size is relative to the fault size. The bigger the fault, the bigger the strain build up, and the bigger the release in an earthquake. Subduction zones and collision zones, where large portions of plates actually can rub together as a whole, have the really big earthquakes, like the 2004 Sumatra earthquake. In other plate boundaries, the entire plate boundary does not act together, so the faults become spread out and many faults take up the strain from the tectonic stress, like with the San Andreas Fault in California (it only takes up ~3/4 of the stress between the plates).\n\nEarthquakes are really tricky things; there is still so much we need to learn. As of now, there is no way to predict them, but we can say where the danger is highest and about how long between events.

Insects that go through 'complete' metamorphosis are holometabolous and hemimetabolous insects go through 'incomplete' metamorphosis. \nButterflies are the most well known holometabolous insects (Order: Hymenoptera) ie that have larval, pupal and adult stages.\nHemimetabolous species have a number of nymph stages (exoskeleton moults) after hatching from the egg.\nFrom your list cockroaches, cicadas, bed bugs (nasty), termites, dragonflies, beetles, bees and ants are hemimetabolous with only mosquitoes as holometabolous ie they have a riggler (larvae), pupae stage and adult comes out of the pupal case where it splits open along the back of the exoskeleton and the adult pulls itself out.

You have to divide the salary by the number of hours worked to earn it. That's the only way!\n\nIf you get paid $4000 a month and you work 40 hours a week you have worked an AVERAGE of 173.33 hours per month (40 hours/week times 52 weeks per year divided by 12 months), depending on your exact pay period. Thus you would be making  a little more than $23 an hour.\n\nThe 2080 quoted by Zandelia is just 40 hours per week times 52 weeks in a year or the number of hours worked in a standard year. However, as other people pointed out, you might work more than 40 hours weekly on salary... or LESS. What ever the number of hours worked in a pay period, divide the pay for that  period by the hours to get the answer!

Photons are massless, but then do possess momentum.\nA photon's momentum comes from the energy it carries.\nE = mc^2 + pc\nWhere E is the photon's energy, m is its rest mass (= 0), c is the speed of light, and p is the momentum.\np = E / c\n\nIt is possible to use the momentum of light to move objects.  Since momentum must be conserved, a photon's momentum is transferred to the object in a collision, thereby applying a force and causing an acceleration.  The Energies (and this momentums) of single photons are very small, and thus their momentum changing effects on other objects are also very small and difficult to measure under normal circumstances.\n\nNothing with mass can ever travel at, or exceed, the speed of light.  To accelerate a mass to the speed of light it would take an infinite amount of energy, and in the entire universe, there is not an infinite amount of energy.

The molecules would then be recycled within the macrophage. \n\nThere are probably lots of other mechanisms, depending on the situation.  This may include apoptosis, vacoule expansion (in attempts to save the cell), and some other mechanisms which I'm not thinking of right now.\n\nWell, I hope this helps.  I answer in hopes of spreading good karma.  Hope you do the same!

You need to find the moles of H+\n\n38% by mass HCl means that you have 38 g of HCl for every 100 g of solution.\n\nDensity=mass/volume => V=m/d \nUsing this equation you convert the mass of solution to volume and thus you can convert the concentration to g of HCl per 1L of solution.\n\nalso mole=mass/MW where MW is the molecular weight.\nUsing this convert the g HCl/L to mole/L.\n\nHCl is monoprotic (1 molecule gives 1 H+) and it is a strong acid (complete dissociation). So the mole of H+ coming from HCl will be equal to the mole of HCl = M1*V1. M1 you calculated before, V=0.0488 L. Substitute and you find how many moles H+ come from HCl.\n\nIn the same way you find the moles of H+ coming from HNO3 =M2*V2 (Find M2 as you found M1 and V2=0.0175 L)\n\nYour final volume is 1L so the concentration of H+ is \n[H+]= moles H+/Vfinal= (M1V1+M2V2)/Vfinal\n\npH=-log[H+]\n\nand [OH-]=Kw/[H+]= 10^-14 /[H+] or if you prefer\n\npOH=14-pH and [OH-]=10^-pOH

"A Parsec is a parallax-arcsecond, and equal to 3.26 light-years.  It's really *not* a much larger distance than a light-year, but it's a useful one for the following reasons:\n\nIf we look at a close star in January and then in June, the Earth will be on opposite sides of the Sun at each of those times.  Although the Earth's distance to the Sun is only a very small fraction of our distance from the star, it will cause stars to slightly shift in the sky from this ""binocular vision"" perspective effect.  This is what's known as parallax.  Stars which are closer will shift more, and we can use the amount of parallax shift to tell how far away it is.\n\nA star which shifts 1 arcsecond (1/3600th of a degree) will be exactly 1 parsec away.  If it shifts only 1/2 of an arc-second, it's 2 parsecs away, 1/3 of an arc-second, 3 parsecs away, etc.  So, that's one advantage to using it - it makes your parallax to distance conversion really easy.\n\nAnother advantage is that parallax is tied to the Astronomical Unit (AU) which is the distance between the Earth and the Sun.  Because of how the parallax geometry works out, it makes it such that the number of arc-seconds in a radian is exactly equal to the number of AU in a parsec: 206265.  This makes converting between solar system distances and interstellar distances very easy."
Depends if you are asking about carpets or actual steam cleaning as used in industry.  Since you didn't say which I will answer both.\n\n1. Carpets.  Does not use steam but very hot water mixed with a solvent or detergent.  It uses pressure to make sure the solution penetrates deep and then vacuums the solution and removed dirt and hopefully grease into a holding tank for disposal.  A much cheaper and slightly more effective mixture than commercial cleaning fluids is real lemon juice.  The various acids naturally in lemon are a very effective grease cutter and also act as a fabric brightner.  Use the same amount as you would commericial cleaner.  (It can be used pure in a squirt bottle to degrease a dirty engine.  Spray on wait (the time it takes to spray should be long enough) and rinse or spray off.  I suggest spraying off with the same bottle.  That you won't get the wires wet and need to wait before starting the car.\n\n2. Industry.  Actually does steam and requires the user to wear a heat and waterproof suit.  The high temperature and presurre very effectively removes dirt and grease.  Usually it is used on machines heavily caked with grease.\n\nHope this helps

"Beyond question, it was his work as a theorist.  The story about the falling apple is about as apocryphal as the one about George Washington and the cherry tree.\n\nTo appreciate what Newton did, we must realize that he came after Kepler and Galileo.  Kepler, using Tycho's observational data, formulated three laws of planetary motion -- ellipses, equal areas in equal times, and the cube of the orbital radius equals the square of the period.  He did <not> explain why these laws obtained.  That was left to Newton.\n\nGalileo was a great experimenter, observer, and theorist.  His work with the inclined plane and falling objects produced g, the acceleration due to gravity ... but Galileo did not have the calculus, which explains instantaneous motion.  That was left for Newton.\n\nBecause of Kepler and Galileo, Newton had all the data he needed.  His great work -- all theoretical -- was to explain the results obtained by Kepler and Galileo.  Newton's three laws of motion -- uniform linear motion, F = ma, and conservation of momentum -- are all theoretical constructs which, when coupled with the calculus (his invention) and applied to ""action at a distance"" -- universal gravitation -- Kepler's and Galileo's results were derivable.\n\nHis invention of the calculus, described opaquely in the Principia Mathematica, was for use as a tool to support his work on gravitation.\n\nNewton was no slouch as an experimentalist -- sometimes.  He performed top quality leading-edge experiments with optics, backing up his results with theoretical insights.  He also devoted considerable time and energy to the pseudoscience of alchemy -- turning base metals into gold -- with lesser success.\n\nBut it was his theoretical work that established his lasting reputation."
A standard size elevator is 2500 lbs. capacity. The floor area of an elevator of this capacity is 27.1 sq. ft. (about 4.5ft X 6 ft.).  The maximum floor area of a given capacity  elevator is restricted by ASME 17.1 Elevator Safety Code.  This means that a larger elevator must be capable of holding more weight. \nUnder elevator safety code all elevators in public buildings must be able to accommodate a wheel chair. \nThe size and shape of an elevator is determined by their intended use. A hospital elevator may be longer and narrow to accommodate a gurney.  An office building elevator may be square or any other combination of dimensions to meet the code requirement for its size.
Apples or potatoes could also work, but a lemon works better because it is more acidic. The acid in a lemon is what makes it taste sour, by the way.\n\nThe idea is that if you stuck two objects made of different kinds of metal (like a penny and a zinc-coated nail) into different ends of the lemon, you have something that acts like a battery, with a negative and postive pole. The lemon gets its electricity from the chemical reactions between the acid and the metal, which creates a small negative charge on one end, and a small positive charge on the other. \n\nIf you do this, you should never try to eat the lemon or drink its juice because the chemicals created by the reaction between the juice and the metal are poisonous. \n\nAll batteries are basically made in the same way. Most batteries don't have a peel, but they usually have something solid which holds in an acid.  \n\nThe acid in a car battery is much stronger than lemon juice, and you do not want it anywhere near your skin or your eyes! If any kind of battery is leaking, you  want to throw it away very carefully. \n\nIf you throw away batteries in the regular trash, they often end up buried in a landfill, leaking poison into the earth. We hope these chemicals don't end up in your drinking water. \n\nThat's why it's not only cheaper to use rechargeable batteries, but also better for the earth and the people who live there. Rechargeable batteries are even more poisonous than other batteries, but since you use them much longer, you don't throw away as many batteries.\n\nNow, the lemon battery isn't a very good battery. You could not light a light bulb with it because the charge is very weak. I saw one that was hooked up to a clock for about a year. The clock was running the whole time, but the time was wrong because the lemon battery was weaker than the kind you usually buy in the store. \n\nThe websites below may help you or your mom understand the lemon battery better.

For foundation used in residential building cement Portland concrete concrete having f'c 3000ksi @ 28 days is commonly used. Since concrete is delivered from the concrete plant you do not need to specify how to make it. It is mixed in accordance with ASTM (American Society of Testing Materials) standards which are incorporated in virtually all building codes.\nMore important is define that it should be placed on in-excavated soil, that there should not be standing water in the excavation. If you need to get smooth edges, forming is required either in wood or metal forms. Forms shall be lubricated for easy removal. I would suggest that minimum reinforcing steel to be installed. Although it is more expensive steel assures that concrete will not crack during the settlement of the soil. Once at the site, the concrete must be placed and compacted. These two operations are performed almost simultaneously. Placing must be done so that segregation of the various ingredients is avoided and full compaction—with all air bubbles eliminated—can be achieved. Whether chutes or buggies are used, position is important in achieving these goals. The rates of placing and of compaction should be equal; the latter is usually accomplished using internal or external vibrators. To properly cure concrete must be kept damp during the several days it requires to set and harden.

"It all depends on the needs of the animal or species, as well as energy usage.  Prey items such as mice or rabbits put a lot of energy into producing several babies frequently, with less time spent raising them (a month as opposed to a year or more).  This is because they need to keep the population booming, as there is a high mortality rate due to predation.  On the other hand, predators, such as big cats, or larger animals that don't have predators, such as elephants, put less energy into biologically developing a lot of babies, and put more time and energy into raising the few that they have, to ensure that the young are ready/fit to survive.  It's a quantity versus quality issue.  Animals have a limited amount of energy they can devote to reproduction, so they have to make a ""choice.""  It can't be both."

It may help if you clarify your question... Here are some ideas, hope they help:\n1) Balanced diets: The human body requires food for nutrients, which provide energy and replace molecules used in bodily processes in order to function properly. Good health requires moderation and a balanced diet consisting of nutrients taken from all of the six main food groups - carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, vitamins, minerals and water. Suggest possible sources of these e.g. carbohydrates are from cereals, lipids and proteins can be obtained from nuts etc. The amount of component required depends on one's age, gender, weight, occupation and amount of physical activity --- elaborate.\n\n2) Digestion is needed to break down large insoluble polymers into smaller, soluble monomers so that they can be absorbed. They also need to be broken down into a suitable form so that they can be assimilated (become a part of the tissues of the body). Digestion therefore releases nutrients, which can provide energy, especially carbohydrates (main energy source), lipids (most concentrated energy source), and proteins (to some extent, from deamination).\n\nGood luck!

You've got to find the directrix line first. Then a point on the parabola is one that is equidistant from the focus and the directrix.\nThe directrix is always perpendicular to the line passing through the focus and the vertex, and it lies at the same distance from the vertex as the focus does. So, in this case, the directrix is the line y = -3 (draw a diagram). The square of the dist of a point (x, y) from this line is just (y+3)^2. So the equal-dist condition for (x, y) to be on the parabola is \n\n(x-9)^2 + (y-7)^2 = (y+3)^2\n\nwhich expands to \n\ny = (1/20)(x-9)^2 + 2.

"Certain dinosaurs -did- evolve into what are today modern birds. It was not, however, the flying dinosaurs that evolved into birds, rather it was the raptor-like ones (coelurosaurs, which include T. rex). Check out the link below for more info on dinosaur-to-bird evolution.\n\nOne of the misconceptions about evolution is that it has to go somewhere, i.e., monkeys HAVE to evolve into humans eventually because that's the last step in the evolution of primates, or wh don't some other animals have civilizations if they've been evolving for millions of years? This idea is WRONG.\n\nAnother misconception is that ""evolution takes place over millions of years."" That's just simply not true; evolution takes place from generation to generation! Evolution is simply a change in allele frequency, which happens every time a baby is born or a reproductively viable person dies. There are four mechanisms to evolution: gene flow (adding new genes to a population), genetic drift (random sampling of a population that skews gene frequency), mutation (which adds new genes and features to a population), and natural selection (""survival of the fittest,"" so to speak).\n\nTo make a millions-year story short, evolution is not directional. Even humans aren't finished evolving, we're evolving all the time! Complete extinctions do occur when a species is out-competed or when a giant meteor hits the earth and disrupts climate change (like with the poor dinosaurs which were adapted to their climate before the meteor impact ruined it for them).

"Now that you have heard the tired old stuff out there, how about hearing what is going on.  If you will check out www.thunderbolts.info and do a bunch of reading you will begin to get a hint.  The real reason is that the solar ecliptic plane is electrically conductive and as charges travel on the surface of the plane, the whole solar system focuses inside the conductor.  As objects appear coming in from outside the solar system, any deviations are pushed towards the plane.  This is why comets flare up and such. Honestly it is a force 10 E39 times greater than gravity.  The whole system is run by the EM force and Gravity well it just doesn't enter into the equation.  \n\nThere is a whole lot out there that doesn't match up to the sad old worn out tale of the universe forming from a dust nebula. The first thing of this is that a nebula could never form a planet or a star as it lacks enough gravity.   It gets much worse than that.\n\nIf you check out www.4threvolt.com or www.nealadams.com you will learn some more fantastic things.  On Neal Adams site be sure to check out his science stuff.\n\nIn the words of the guy at the 4threvolt site.  If this is so, then ""Everything we know is wrong.""  Well it is just about that wrong in cosmology and I though you might like to know.  It is so far wrong that the IEEE kicked of a whole study effort on cosmology to deal with the discoveries that just don't get along with the tired old nebular theories.  The electrical universe has the data and the science.  The rest just talk a good line.  \n\nBesides: Gravity doesn't exist as a force.  It is a cross product of the EM field force.  In the words of ""Doc"" from the movie ""Back to the Future"" --- This sucker is electrical.  (The whole universe)   Some really great work is coming out of Brazil on this.

Density is more important here, and is the amount of mass per unit volume. A dense object can be physically smaller but contain more mass than a less dense object. That being said, two objects of the same size but having different densities will contain different amounts of mass, and hence have different weights.
The Yellow River, or Huanghe, is the second longest river in China. Tracing to a source high up the majestic Yagradagze mountain in the nation's far west, it loops north, bends south, and flows east for 5,464 km until it empties into the sea, draining a basin of 745,000 sq km, which nourishes 120 million people. \nhttp://www.cis.umassd.edu/~gleung/geofo/geogren.html\nhttp://www.cis.umassd.edu/~gleung/\n---------------\nKnown as the mother river by all the Chinese people, the 5464-kilometer (about 3395 miles) Yellow River is the second longest river in China after the Yangtze River .

It runs through nine provinces and autonomous regions on its way to the Bohai Sea.\nhttp://www.travelchinaguide.com/yellow-river/index.htm
"Gibbon\nGibbons are the small apes that are grouped in the family Hylobatidae. The family is divided into four genera based on their diploid chromosome number: Hylobates (44), Hoolock (38), Nomascus (52), and Symphalangus (50).[2][3] They occur in tropical and subtropical rainforests from northeast India to Indonesia and north to southern China, including the islands of Sumatra, Borneo and Java. The extinct Bunopithecus sericus is an extinct gibbon or gibbon-like ape which, until recently, was thought to be closely related to the Hoolock gibbons.[2]\n\nAlso called the lesser apes, gibbons differ from great apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans and humans) in being smaller, pair-bonded, in not making nests, and in certain anatomical details in which they superficially more closely resemble monkeys than the great apes do. Gibbons are masters of their primary mode of locomotion, brachiation, swinging from branch to branch distances of up to 15 m (50 ft), at speeds as much as 56 km/h (35 mph). They can also make leaps of up to 8 m (27 ft), and walk bipedally with their arms raised for balance.\n\nOne unique aspect of gibbon physiology is that the wrist is composed of a ball and socket joint, allowing for biaxial movement. This greatly reduces the amount of energy needed in the upper arm and torso, while also reducing stress on the shoulder joint. They also have long hands and feet, with a deep cleft between the first and second digits of their hands. Their fur is usually black, gray, or brownish, often with white markings on hands, feet, and face. Some species have an enlarged throat sac, which inflates and serves as a resonating chamber when the animals call. This structure is enormous in a few species, equalling the size of the animal's head.\n\nGibbon skulls resemble those of the great apes, with very short rostra, enlarged braincases, and large orbits that face forward. Gibbons have the typical nose of catarrhine primates with nostrils that are close together and face forward and slightly downward. They lack cheek pouches and their stomach is not sacculated. Their teeth also are similar to the great apes, with molars that are bunodont and lack lophs. The upper molars usually have a cingulum, which is sometimes large. The canines are prominent but not sexually dimorphic\n\nGibbons are social animals. Strongly territorial, gibbons defend their boundaries with vigorous visual and vocal displays. The vocal element, which can often be heard for long distances, consists of a duet between the mated pair, the young animals sometimes joining in. This eerie song can make them an easy find for poachers who engage in the illegal wildlife trade and in sales of body parts for use in traditional medicine.\n\nMost species are threatened or endangered, most importantly from degradation or loss of their forest habitat. Gibbon species include the Siamang, the White-handed or Lar Gibbon, and the Hoolock gibbons. The Siamang, which is the largest of the 13 species, is distinguished by having two fingers on each hand stuck together, hence the generic and species names Symphalangus and syndactylus.\n\nand\n\nBaboon\nThe baboons are some of the largest non-hominid members of the primate order; only the Mandrill and the Drill are larger. In modern scientific use, only members of the genus Papio are called baboons, but previously the closely related Gelada (genus Theropithecus) and two species of Mandrill and Drill (genus Mandrillus) were grouped in the same genus, and these monkeys are still often referred to as baboons in everyday speech. The word ""baboon"" comes from ""babouin"", the name given to them by the French naturalist Buffon. Papio belongs to family Cercopithecidae, in subfamily Cercopithecinae.\n\nPhysiology\nAll baboons have long dog-like muzzles (cynocephalus = dog-head), close-set eyes, heavy powerful jaws, thick fur except on their muzzle, a short tail and rough spots on their protruding hindquarters, called isch"
No, sorry, but your'e kind of off base with your logic.  \n\nFirst off, if you jump out of a crashing helicopter your odds of being killed are much greater.  A helicopter autorotates which acts like a parachute.  If you jump, it will be like jumping out of a plane without a parachute.  Second, if you jump upward from the cockpit of a falling helicopter, your head will be chopped off by the spinning blades.\n\nI remember a case where a guy was flying a helicopter and the engine stalled.  He paniced and jumped out at 300 feet.  He died instantly.  A few minutes later, the pilotless helicopter set down a few hundred feet beside him and only suffered minor damage.  The point being that he would have survived if he had stayed with his helicopter.

The first pass effect is the change (more commonly, decrease) in activity of the drugs in the body after being ingested orally. This is because after absorption in the intestines, the drugs are carried directly to the liver where they are metabolized to other substrates, either more active or inactivated forms of the drug. To avoid this phenomenon, drugs are administered via different routes, like IV and sublingual. Sublingual administration does not decrease the drug effect because the drugs are not carried directly to the liver.
Hello Friend! \n       Let us see a small example. If we are in a moving bus, the trees on the road side appear to be moving fastly in the opposite direction. Even though that the trees are at rest, they appear to move. This is due to the special  theory of relativity. \n       Even though that the earth is rotating with large velocity, the objects stay on the earth. The centripetal and centrifugal forces are responsible for the objects to stay on the earth in rest condition.
"The force (gravity) the moon exerts on the Earth morphs the shape of the entire planet by pulling up on it.  Since the particles that comprise the Earth have mass the gravity acts on them, drawing them towards its ""source"" (the center of mass/center of the moon here).\n\nWater, being fluid, moves more readily than other things like the hard rock that makes up the land masses of the Earth so it seems to be more affected by the moon's gravity.  When the moon is overhead it pulls the water (and less noticably everything else) towards it, creating a high tide (as well as one on the opposite side of the planet).  The sun also affects the tides to a lesser degree."
In the tertiary structure the proteins are folded into their various shapes by the differing bonding caused by the arrangement of amino acids, Hydrogen, disufide and hydrophobic bonding are some of them. Chaperon and chaperonin proteins also reshape not fully folded or misfolded proteins.

Divide by 100.\n\nSo 102% is equal to 1.02\nAnd 180% is equal to 1.80\n\nOr if you need the percent of 102 in 180, you just divide and multiply by 100.\n\n102 / 180 = 0.566666667\n0.566666667 * 100 = 56.6667%\n\nSo 102 is 56.6667% of 180.
"Muscle fibers have long proteins called actin that are disposed as ""railways"" and form a long chain al along the muscle. \nA second protein, miosin, has a movable head that ""crawls"" up the actin, gragging a limited amount of muscle mass with it. The movement of millions of these proteins produces the contraction of the muscle.\nFor this, muscles need two things: Calcium that allows the miosin head to ""glue"" to the actin, and ATP (an energy carrier molecule that is produced by the cellular respiration) that gives it the energy to move one step and be dettached for a new cycle.\nWhen exercising a lot, you might consume all of the cellular oxygen or the glucose (the sugar from which cells extract the enrgy). This means a drop in ATP levels. So theres is calcium, the miosin attaches itself to the actin, but cannot move. This means the muscle gets cramped. This is the explanation for Rigor mortis too.\nThe cramps that occurr by dehidration or lack of salts (including calcium) don't have to do with muscular function. Rather, they stimulate the excitability of the nerves that tell the muscle to contract, so they might spontaneusly and continously produce this state, called tetanus (with equal or very similar symptoms to cramps).\nThe lactic acid acumulation someone told you about earlyer is not a cramp. It rather produces the pain you feel AFTER you exercise and rest your muscle, because this is a very insoluble compound that forms abrsive cristals inside your muscle cells, which are very painfull when you move it. Beware of them, because the more painfull it is, the bigger the cellular damage is. And muscle cells are not that easily replaced. If you feel this pain, try not to force the sore muscle.\nThe cramp and the lactic acid acumulation (don't know the word, in spanish it is ""agujeta"") have, however, teh same origin: An exercise too strong that consumes more energy than the muscular cell can produce by respiration (there's not enough oxygen in the cell to ope with the demand). So if you get a cramp during exercise, very likely you'll get Agujetas the next day."

An exon is a portion of a gene that goes into the final mRNA transcript. Introns would be the sections of DNA that are non-coding. Think of exons as being the parts that don't get snipped out when it comes time to actually make the real part of RNA that gets translated to a protein.\n\nAny number of proteins could be produced from a gene that has three exons. This is because the code contained within the three exons, comprising the coding portion of the gene, could contain several open reading frames (ORFs) within the portion that is transcribed, depending on the size of the gene and the position of the promoters.

"The lithosphere (from the Greek for ""rocky"" sphere) is the solid outermost shell of a rocky planet. On the Earth, the lithosphere includes the crust and the uppermost layer of the mantle (the upper mantle or lower lithosphere) which is joined to the crust.\n\nAs the cooling surface layer of the Earth's convection system, the lithosphere thickens over time. It is fragmented into relatively strong pieces, called tectonic plates (shown in the picture), which move independently relative to one another. This movement of lithospheric plates is described as plate tectonics.\n\nThe distinguishing characteristic of the lithosphere is not composition, but its flow properties. Under the influence of the low-intensity, long-term stresses that drive plate tectonic motions, the lithosphere responds essentially as a rigid shell and thus deforms primarily through brittle failure, whereas the asthenosphere (the layer of the mantle below the lithosphere) is heat-softened and accommodates strain through plastic deformation. Both the crust and upper mantle float on the more plastic asthenosphere. The crust is distinguished from the upper mantle by the change in chemical composition that takes place at the Moho discontinuity.\n\nThere are two types of lithosphere:\n\noceanic lithosphere \ncontinental lithosphere \nOceanic lithosphere is about 70 km thick (but can be as thin as 1.6 km at the mid-ocean ridges), while continental lithosphere is about 150 km thick (and can be considerably thicker at continental collision zones). Oceanic lithosphere consists mainly of mafic and ultramafic rocks and is denser than continental lithosphere, which consists predominantly of felsic rocks. This higher density has the effect that at subduction zones the oceanic plate will invariably sink underneath the continental plate. New oceanic lithosphere is constantly being produced at mid-ocean ridges from mantle material and is recycled back to the mantle at subduction zones. As a result, oceanic lithosphere is much younger than continental lithosphere: the oldest oceanic lithosphere is about 200 million years old, while parts of the continental lithosphere are billions of years old. As oceanic lithosphere grows older, it gets cooler and denser, with the result that if two oceanic plates converge, the older one will subduct below the younger one."
"The term sulfide (sulphide in British English) refers to several types of chemical compounds containing sulfur in its lowest oxidation number of −2.\n\nFormally, ""sulfide"" is the dianion, S2−, which exists in strongly alkaline aqueous solutions formed from H2S or alkali metal salts such as Li2S, Na2S, and K2S. Sulfide is exceptionally basic and, with a pKa > 14, it does not exist in appreciable concentrations even in highly alkaline water. Instead, sulfide combines with protons to form HS−, which is variously called hydrogen sulfide ion, hydrosulfide ion, sulfhydryl ion, or bisulfide ion. At still lower pH's (<7), HS− converts to H2S, hydrogen sulfide. Thus, the exact sulfur species obtained upon dissolving sulfide salts depends on the pH of the final solution."

All of the terrestrial planets have at one time or another had volcanoes and it is also believed that the moon may once have been volcanically active.  However Mercury, Mars and the moon have long gone cold (at least we believe so) inside and are no longer volcanically active.  \nThe Jovian moon Io is volcanically active and it also has a rocky surface.  If one supposes that any body that has had a period of liquefied mantle, then the heavier elements like Iron would settle into the core which means that all of the Terrestrial planets and many of the larger moons of Jupiter possibly even Titan and Triton may have iron cores.\nAs for Titan and Triton, geothermal activity has been seen on Triton in the form of geysers, but no recent evidence of volcanic (liquefied rock) activity.  And since Titan is covered with clouds, no one can really say about it.\nVenus is still hot enough inside to have some geothermal eruptions, but, again, due to the cloud cover, we have not detected any.

"There are no permanently magnetic materials - not even ""permanent"" magnets. The best you can achieve is something that holds the same relative magnetic charge over a range of temperature. This is because all magnets are affected by other magnets (and their fields).\n\nTo magnetize a ferrous material (I""m assuming here that your sheet of material isn't stainless), there's two basic methods.\n\nThe first is to use a known magnetic field (i.e. an existing magnet). In this case, run the magnet from one end of the sheet to the other in even motions. Always go in the same direction, and be sure to cover every possible inch of surface area ... on ONE side of the sheet. The passes also have to be made in the direction of the sheet 'grain' - which means along the path that the molecules of steel tend to line up naturally along.\n\nThe second is to employ electricity. In this case, form the sheet into a tube (either a single layer tube, or an insulated sprial as noted previously). Be sure to insulate the outer surface with a very thin layer of something - like paper. Over the insulation, wrap several turns of wire (insulated or uninsulated - it doesn't matter except that the insulated wire usually takes up more physical space and will carry more current). The wire needs to be applied evenly from one end to the other, always going the same way around the tube of steel. The higher the number of turns, the stronger your magnet will become - therefore you could use multiple layers of wire (either with a connecting single turn to return you to the original starting point, or by making another parallel path. Finally, connect the ends of the wire to a DC voltage source, and allow current to pass through the wire. \n\nYou now have a magnet of (some) strength that will remain a magnet even after you've removed the wire and unrolled the sheet. Remember - other magnetic fields will affect it, so it MAY eventually become demagnetized (or at least have its field strength reduced to the point where it is no longer usable for your purposes)."

Actually, any aquarium pump will work.  To make smaller bubbles, the air should pass through a diffusing element or stone.  This will have small pores and a relatively large surface are to release the air pressure slowly over a larger area.  This results in smaller bubbles. These are available for purchase at a store that sells the aquarium pumps.\n\nYou could also probably make one by plugging the end of the regular aquarium pump hose, and perforating it as much as you need with a needle.  Some testing is required, but you should be able to find the right hole (needle) size, and the number of holes to meet your need.

It all depends how fast you travel! Mars is 35 million miles away from Earth at its closest approach, so you would need a very fast method of transport to cover that distance in an acceptable period of time. Current technology puts the travel time at something like 6-12 months, but the time for the whole journey there and back would be about 2-3 years as you would have to wait on Mars for a year until the Earth was close enough. \nHopefully in the not-to-distant future, new forms of spaceship might cut this journey time down considerably to perhaps just a couple of months.

"Super-heating is correct, but you'd also like to know why it's more likely to happen with a microwave vs. hot plate. In addition to having to be above the boiling point, in order for an actual bubble to form, there needs to be a small particle in the water, or imperfection (such as a scratch) on the surface of the cup for the bubble to form around. This is called ""nucleation"". If you heat water on a hot plate, the water gets hot enough to boil first on the bottom surface, where there are usually lots of microscopic imperfections, and the bubbles form right away. In a microwave, though, the waves ignore the cup and heat the water directly. If the water has been filtered, the temperature can climb significantly above the boiling point away from the surface, but not have any way to boil. Since the cup itself if not being heated, it acts as a heat sink, absorbing heat from the water near the surface. That means the water at the surface can actually be cooler (below the boiling point) than deeper within, where super-heating occurs. The slightest jostle or thermal convection, though, can transport superheated water along the surface, or excite any incipient nucleation points that do exist in the bulk water, causing bubbles to form. Since the water is so hot there, the bubble forms explosively."
"Nature is lazy, just that simple.  It is easier to have the same structure in both men and women (since any such structure has to be written in the DNA, then there is no need for different DNA) and simply have it activated by the few genes that control sex hormones at puberty.\nSuppose that men did not have nipple, then the DNA for NOT having nipple would have to be on the Y chromosome than only men have; and the DNA for describing the nipple would have to be on the X chromosome, but men have ONE X chromosome. The only way to have that would be to have extra code to erase nipples on the Y chromosome, to balance the ""have nipple"" on the X. uch too complicated.  Mother nature likes things to be simpler.\nSo men walk around with unneeded body parts."

It's an important concept to learn.\n\nThe main thing is to get your fractions with a common denominator, then it should be straightforward from there.\n\nIn the future, you may want to ask for the answer and method for a couple problems you have tried, and have someone check your work... but 20 questions for 10 pts (max) is too much work for anyone.
"As far as I know there is no such thing as ""pharmaceutical grade"" for any reagent.  Reagents exist in hundreds of specific and defined 'grades'.  The pharmaceutical industry uses a wide variety of different grades of reagents.  Isopropanol, for example, would probably be used as an 'ACS grade', 'HPLC grade' or 'USP grade'.  The grade required would depend on the specific use or purpose of the reagent.  Is it being used for cleaning?  to dissolve something in solution?  as a reagent in analytical analysis?  As far as I know, there is no general 'pharmaceutical grade.'\nReagent grades specifically define purity and impurity levels of a given reagent.  There are many many different grades!\n\nTry searching ""reagent grades"" on the Internet to get a better idea of all the different grades available."

Divide 100 into 2 numbers, for instance 50 and 2. Write those down. 2 is a prime number, so cannot be divided further. Divide 50 into 2 numbers. Write down all the prime numbers you have. You should end up with 5 x 5 x 2 x 2 for your final answer. If you multiply these prime numbers together, you get 100! Do similar problems the same way.

How safe they are depends on how powerful they are. They radiate in the infrared so the light isn't visible. \n\nYou'll need a tube with electrodes spaced apart a few feet with wires coming in. You'll need a high voltage source, maybe a transformer from a neon light hooked to the wires. \n\nYou'll need a vacuum pump and you'll need to pump the tube down to about 5 mm of pressure while you feed in a mixture of helium, neon and carbon dioxide. You'll have to look up the mixing ratio.\n\nYou'll need something to seal the end of the tube with. Ideally you'll have mirrors but more than likely the mirrors will be external. One will have to be reflective the other should half silvered and of a type that won't absorb the infrared light. Most glass will absorb the light and you won't get any output. Some plastics work and you can always put the mirrors outside the tube  (one with a pin-hole in it) and use Brewster angles (look it up) to seal the end of the tube... No glass on the seals; special plastics or sodium chloride plates work. \n\nThen you'll need an infrared detector; the light is invisible and a lot of patience aligning the mirrors.
One mole of an ideal gas occupies a volume of 22.4 liters  at STP.  We can safely assume that HCl gas under STP conditions behaves pretty much like an idea gas, so 1.1 liter of HCl gas contains 1.1/22.4 moles of HCl.\n\nEach mole of HCl that reacts with NaOH produces one mole of NaCl.  Because we are told that the NaOH is in excess, the amount of NaCl formed will be equal to the amount of HCl gas.  In other words, 1.1/22.4 moles of NaCl will be formed.\n\nThe molecular mass of NaCl is 58.44 grams/mole, so the mass of NaCl formed will be:\n\n58.44 gm/mol * 1.1/22.4 mol = 2.87 grams.

Your first answer is interesting since it assumes one learns about history and geography in school.Of course you do, but you learn much more just from research based on your own interests and curiosities. No.The answer is more complex and relates to the chauvinism that seems to characterise the U.S. When we look at the U.S from the outside, as citizens of other places, it is like experiencing a time warp --- the place looks stuck in the 19th century in terms of political and social attitudes.

"Think about things in the big picture.\n\nAt first, trade and investigation were done on foot (which could include by horse, camel, etc and/or cart). This meant that exploration and trade only occurred with those areas that you could walk to ... which also meant that by the time the Europeans were a working civilization that the continents of North and South America were inaccessible.\n\nHowever, Asia and Africa were not! And thus trade and exploration started from Europe and proceeded EASTWARD, until eventually a connection was made with China and the Far East.\n\nAt about the same time as the trade routes got really established, advances in seafaring were beginning to make a difference in how things were done. Notably, one could now sail somewhere in a few weeks that once took many months of travel on foot. Case in point - again, the transit time to the Far East.\n\nBy now, Europeans had also come to the conclusion that the world was a ball, not a plate. This meant (in theory) that someone could go the other way (WESTWARD), and possibly develop a shorter trip to reach the trade markets of the Orient. Several nations jumped into the act; notable among them were the French, English, Dutch, and Spanish.\n\nEveryone took a slightly different tack, for a couple of reasons. Either they already knew that a route wasn't going to happen (the French didn't have the fleet capacity or the seamanship for extended out-of-land voyages yet), or they wanted to stay away and not let the rest in on the secret (Spain had an advantage; being in the south already, they could cut more-or-less across at the same latitude to find the Orient, whereas the Dutch and English kind of had to try a more northerly route).\n\nThe final outcome was the discovery of ""america"" (in actuality, today's West Indies) by Spain, followed quickly by devlopment of what is now North America by the English and French. The Dutch followed in the Spaniards' footsteps, and found a promising region somewhat south of the Indies (Tortuga, Trinidad/Tobago, etc).\n\nEveryone got into the act of grabbing what they could from the New World ... and eventually someone figured out they hadn't reached the Orient after all. Then came the race for the Northwest Passage, and the southern journeys of Magellan and so on ..."
The only way to know for sure is if they do not hold a charge for any length of time.  Rechargeable batteries can only be recharged a number of times before they will not hold a charge.  When you purchase a new battery, it should state how many times the battery may be recharged before it will no longer hold a charge.  Might be a good idea to keep track of how many times you recharge each battery to know for sure.

Okay, first of all, let's differentiate between DNA replication, transcription and translation.\n\nDNA replication is the process whereby DNA makes an exact replica of itself. In this process, double stranded DNA is first unwound by the enzyme helicase, and each strand of the DNA serves as a template for the building of its complementary strand (at this point, free nucleotides are attached together in order to build the complementary strand - DNA polymerase is the enzyme that takes care of this). Afterwards, the enzyme ligase binds the two original strands to their two newly built complementary strands to give us 2 identical double stranded DNA.\n\nTranscription is the process whereby RNA is produced. As was the case with DNA replication, a double stranded DNA molecule is unwound, but this time only 1 strand gets its complenetary strand built, and that complementary strand becomes an RNA strand (remember that RNA is a single stranded molecule). Also important to note is the fact that for all A's on the single strand of DNA, we get U (uracil) on the RNA strand when the nucleotides are base pairing. \n\nTranslation is the process whereby RNA (or more specifically, mRNA, tRNA and rRNA) build a protein. All of the three different types of RNA I mentioned are made inside the nucleus. They then leave the nucleus through the nuclear pores and go to the ribosome. rRNA (ribosomal RNA) attaches to a ribosome and makes it function (the exact manner in whcih this is carried out is unknown - some say rRNA acts as an enzyme when it's attached to a ribosome).\n\nmRNA (messenger RNA) is carrying out the actual code to build the protein (i.e., it has the nucleotide bases - and as you should know, each three consecutive bases, also called a codon, code for a particular amino acid). mRNA attaches to the ribosome as well, and lastly, tRNA (transfer RNA) reads off the code on mRNA and goes into the cytoplasm to pick up the amino acid the mRNA codes for, and brings them back to the ribosome, where amino acids are attached together in the sequence that will yield the protein that is to be built.\n\nRemember that proteins are simply polymers of amino acids, that means proteins are made up of amino acids attached together - and the order in which the amino acids are attached together is peculiar to a particular protein.
Professional medical people will say that this is an invention of your own mind that came about because of the stress of becoming lost as a child.  They could be correct, indeed.\n\nDo you know what this language you have mentioned is saying?  Or do you not know what the language says?  Do you think that this language is an ancient language that used to be used here and somebody will recognize it?  You could write it and photo it and post the photo on the internet....\n\nIn any case, unless this is interfering with your life and making a living and so on, not to worry about it.  Notice this dream woman does not mention why a being from another world ended up in this one, not even saying it was some kind of accident.  And teaching you this language seems not to have any purpose.\n\nWell, strange things do happen, so I keep an open mind, but so far, it looks like a case of heavy stress during your childhood causing your mind to invent this phenomenon.
Assume the forearm is pointed straight forward, so the force is directed along its long axis. Calculate the force on the arm from F=ma, with m 3.0kg, and a the acceleration 80kph/.0047sec (fix the units so it's all m/sec first). Then you have the force, and you have the cross-sectional area that's bearing that load, so F/A=P to get the pressure or stress. Maybe divide by two if there's two bones.

Stitch welding means that you would weld for a set length, skip another set length, then weld the set length again. Stitch welding usually applies to normal bead welding and not to spot welding (because spot welding by definition is not continuous). The size of the weld and the skip can vary, based on the joint design requirements.

I don't remember that part of Calculus very well but i think that this is the right way of making it.\n\nThe area of the rectangle is 2xy. I multiplied by 2 because xy would only calculate the area of the positive side of x. Since its corners won't go besides the parabola we can use that function  to get y in terms of x in the rectangle. The area of the rectangle will now be 2(x)(12-x^2)\nA = 2x(12-x^2)\nA = 24x-2x^3\nthe derivative of the area is \nA' = 24 - 6x^2\nThe critical points for the area are\n0 = 24 - 6x^2\n6x^2 = 24\nx^2 = 4\nx = 2\nso the biggest area would be A(2) = 24(2) - 2 (2^3)\nA(2) = 48 - 16 = 32
Gimme a minute...\n\nFirst guess is 0.1195 moles of Carbon.\n\nHow? Since you got 5.256 g of CO2, if you divide that with the molecular mass of CO2 you'll get the moles of CO2:\n\n5.256 g X (1 mole of CO2 / 44g of CO2) = 0.1195 moles of CO2\n\n[  44 from C (12g/mole) and O2(2 x 16g/mole)  ]\n\nfrom 0.1195 moles of CO2 multiply that with (1 mole of Carbon per 1 mole of Carbon Dioxide CO2) which makes the number of moles of CO2 = to the number of moles of Carbon. Not a single molecule of Carbon is wasted, so I guess it's safe to assume that's also the number of moles of Carbon in the reactants.
Rain water percolated down through the upper layers of the Earth's crust until it hits bedrock. Normally, it collects there and gradually move downhill into the nearest aquifer.\n\nIf the bedrock is being heated by underlying areas of magma, the pressure builds up and the water finds its way to the surface, where it is released as hot springs, hot mineral pools or geysers.

Well, maybe not what it is *all* about That's a rather large topic.\n\nIn discrete math, numbers are restricted to certain values or, another way of saying the same thing, there is a finite difference between the numbers that can exist. Contrast this with a continuous number system, in which, for any two numbers that are not equal, you can find infinitely many numbers that lie between them in value.\n\nFor example,  the integers are a discrete number system, whereas the reals are a continuous number system.\n\nComputer math is inherently discrete, although it can in many cases form a useful approximation to a continuous system.\n\nThe series that you mention have been developed for continuous number systems, but I believe they have analogues for discrete systems.
Surely there's no way a chimp would win, because the Samoan could kick the chimp in the 'special area' and it would be floored right from the off.

There is more genetic variation between some tribes in Africa than there is between those of African descent and those of European.\n\nAll humans have the same DNA structure. Thus, no, the DNA Structure of a 'black' person is not different than that of 'white' person, they are essentially the same with minute variations. These are so minute in fact, that you and someone with the same skin color could have less biologically in common than you could have with someone of a different skin color.\n\nSkin color is determined by a relatively small set of genes.
"The New Moon is the lunar phase that occurs when the Moon, in its monthly orbital motion around Earth, lies between Earth and the Sun, and is therefore in conjunction with the Sun as seen from Earth. At this time, the illuminated half of the Moon faces directly toward the Sun, and the dark or unilluminated portion of the Moon faces directly toward Earth, so that the Moon is invisible as seen from Earth.\n\nNew Moon is often considered to occur at the time of the appearance of the first visible crescent of the Moon, after conjunction with the Sun. This takes place over the western horizon in a brief period between sunset and moonset, and therefore the precise time and even the date of the appearance of the New Moon by this definition will be influenced by the geographical location of the observer. The astronomical New Moon, sometimes known as the dark moon to avoid confusion, occurs by definition at the moment of conjunction in ecliptic longitude with the Sun, when the Moon is invisible from the Earth. This moment is unique and does not depend on location, and under certain circumstances it may be coincident with a solar eclipse.\n\nThe New Moon is the beginning of the month in lunar calendars such as the Muslim calendar, and in lunisolar calendars such as the Hebrew calendar, Hindu calendars, Buddhist calendar, and Chinese calendar.\n\n\nAn approximate formula for the average time of New Moon N (conjunction) is\n\n, \nwhere D is the number of days (and fractions) since 2000-01-01 00:00:00 TT, and N is an integer.\n\n(Note that the number 29.53.. is the synodic month.)\n\nTo obtain this moment expressed in Universal Time (world clock time) for future events (N>0), apply the following approximate correction:\n\n days \nPeriodic perturbations change the time of true conjunction from these mean values. For all New Moons between 1601 and 2401, the maximum difference is 0.592 days = 14h13m in either direction.\n\nThe duration of a lunation (from New Moon to the next New Moon) varies in this period between 29.272 and 29.833 days, i.e. -0.259d = 6h12m shorter, or +0.302d = 7h15m longer than average. This range is smaller than the difference between mean and true conjunction, because during the lunation the periodic terms cannot all change to their maximum opposite value.\n\nSee the paper on the full moon cycle for a fairly simple method to compute the moment of New Moon more accurately.\n\nThe long-term error of the formula is approximately: 1*cy*cy seconds in TT, and 11*cy*cy seconds in UT (cy is centuries since 2000 — see section Explanation of the formulae for details.)\n\nThe moment of mean conjunction can easily be computed from an expression for the average ecliptic longitude of the Moon minus the average ecliptic longitude of the Sun (Delauney parameter D). The expression given is based on the paper by Chapront et al. [2], with the following corrections:\n\nconstant term:\n\nApplied the constant terms of the aberration to obtain the apparent difference in ecliptic longitudes: \nSun: +20.496"" \nMoon: −0.704"" \nCorrection in conjunction: −0.000451 days. \nFor UT: at 1 Jan. 2000, ΔT was +63.83 s; hence the correction for the clock time of the conjunction is: \n−0.000739 days. \nquadratic term:\n\nIn ELP2000–85 (see [1]), D has a quadratic term of −5.8681""*T2; expressed in lunations N, this yields a correction of +87.403E–12*N2 days to the time of conjunction. The term includes a tidal contribution of 0.5*(−23.8946 ""/cy2). The most current estimate from Lunar Laser Ranging is (see [2]): (−25.858 ±0.003) ""/cy2. Therefore the tidal correction to the quadratic term in D is −0.9817*T2"". The polynomial provided by Chapront et al. (ref. [2]) provides the same value. This translates to a correction of +14.622E−12*N2 days; the quadratic term now is: \n+102.026E−12*N2 days. \nFor UT: analysis of historical observations show that ΔT has a long-term increase of +31 s/cy2.

Not a good idea, but you may not even get close enough before the intense heat kills you, or you may have some kind of cave in. \nAnother theory is the ""Hollow Earth"" theory.

ok herez what i think the answers are.. i've explained with reasons..\n\n\n1) If ur talkin about waves in general then its false because electromagnetic waves can transmit without a medium.. thats how they r transmitted through space..\nBut since most ur questions r related to sound.. I'm assuming ur talkin abt trasmitting sound waves.. then its true.. coz sound waves require a medium\n\n2)false.. sound travels faster through water than through air\n\n3)True... higher temperature means particles have more kinetic energy n thus vibrate faster.. so they pass on the energy at a higher rate.. so sound waves travel faster at higher tempr.. \n\n4)false.. hertz corresponds to frequency.. ie.. the number of waves produced per second.. if ur increasing the frequency, ur producing more waves in the same time.. so the wave length has to be decreased in order to acheive this \nalso, f = v/lambda... frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional to each other..\n\n5) true... Each decibel is one tenth of a bel, which is a unit that measures the intensity of sound.  For every six decibels, the intensity of the sound doubles. \n\n6) True... FM waves are in megahertz while AM are only in kHz ... since E = hf... energy and frequency are directly proportional.. so higher frequency means more energy..

All energy comes from the Big Bang. The nuclear reactions are the source of everything else that came thereafter. There is as much energy in the universe now as there was nanoseconds after the Big Bang.  Energy conservation applies to particle and antiparticle interactions as well, therefore, there is no conflict when refering to quantum fluctuations.
No we do not have any living examples. Why? The answer lies in the ability to catenate.\n\nSilicon does not share the property of being able to catenate (ability to bond to itself) like Carbon. The Si-Si bond is weaker compared to the C-C bond. So you find less Si is a less versatile atom.\nAlso Si does not form pi-bonds as easily as carbon does. Si has a negligible pi-bond overlap compared to C, most probably Si has a larger atomic radius than C, so the pi-bond overlap is less strongly held to the nucleus and hence is a weak bond.

Elder or Elderberry (Sambucus) is a genus of between 5-30 species of fast-growing shrubs or small trees (two species herbaceous), formerly treated in the honeysuckle family Caprifoliaceae, but now shown by genetic evidence to be correctly classified in the moschatel family Adoxaceae. The genus is native to temperate to subtropical regions of both the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere; the genus is more widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, with Southern Hemisphere occurrence restricted to parts of Australasia and South America.\n\nThe leaves are opposite, pinnate, with 5-9 leaflets (rarely 3 or 11), each leaf 5-30 cm long, the leaflets with a serrated margin. They bear large clusters of small white or cream coloured flowers in the late spring, that are followed by clusters of small red, bluish or black (rarely yellow or white) berries. Species have lifespans between 80 and 100 years.\n\nThe berries are a very valuable food resource for many birds. Elders are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Brown-tail, Buff Ermine, Dot Moth, Emperor Moth, The Engrailed, Swallow-tailed Moth and The V-pug. The crushed foliage and immature fruit have a strong foetid smell.\n\nThey are good for cooking too - see link 2

a. I agree with the answerers above about this problem involving the principle of conservation of energy. \n\nAt the point where Tarzan starts his downward swing, he is 3.56m above the bottom of the swing. We get this by solving for the length of the base (adjacent side) of the triangle whose hypotenuse equals the length of the vine, i.e. 23.4m. The length of the base is equal to 23.4cos32=19.84m. Deduct this from 23.4m and we get 3.56. Therefore,\n\nPE=mg*3.56   \n\nand\n\nKE=1/2mv^2\n\nEquate the two based on our conservation of energy principle:\n\nmg*3.56=1/2mv^2\n\n(m cancels out)\n\nv^2=69.77\nv=8.35m/s\n\nb)If he starts with an initial speed, then at that point where  he starts, he has KE in addition to PE.\n\nKE at start=1/2m*2.28^2\n\nKE at bottom of swing=1/2mv^2\n\nPE+KE at start=KE at bottom\n\nmg*3.56+1/2m*2.28^2=1/2mv^2\n\n(m cancels out)\n\n34.88+2.59=1/2v^2\nv^2=37.47*2\n     =74.94\nv=8.66m/s

Im sorry I've not got the sources for this but I've had experience on several rigs. For a start there are two main kinds of rigs.  \n\nFor drilling a mobile rig is usually used (cos theres no garuntee of oil!). This is usually a large floating structure which is held in place with anchors. Barges carefully transport the massive anchors about 3-4km away then they're dropped and winched in until the line is taught. Were talking 20-30 ton anchors and 4 inch thick cable. The anchors have to be in a close to perfect triangle/square as possible.\n\nThis rig will drill down, hopefully strike oil and cap the well.  \n\nThen a production rig will be moved into that place.  The most common technique these days is to have a huge hollow metal cylinder, capped at each end (i cant remember the design name, help me!) about 100-150m long 20-50m wide. This is dragged out to sea then pumped with water until it stands slightly above the surface. Its amazingly stable and can deflect strong currents.(some dynamics principals I can't remember). All the production lines are protected very well inside the cylinder. Sometimes anchorage is used but its rarely neccessary.  \n\nThe production unit/platform is then neatly plonked ontop of the cylinder. \n\nIn the olden days most offshore oil was close enough to the surface you could built a structure from the sea bed up. This almost never happens anymore.\n\nSorry I can't be more precise!

Like silver (used in socks), copper could be used as a biocide to limit fungal growth which causes the stink.  Unlike silver, copper would have side effects and would react with sweat and humidity, mostly oxidizing and turning things blue.  This would limit or eliminate copper's usefulness for this purpose.

Yes,it will.\n\nThe Sun is about halfway through its main-sequence evolution, during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium. Each second, more than 4 million tonnes of matter are converted into energy within the Sun's core, producing neutrinos and solar radiation. The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main sequence star.\n\nThe Sun does not have enough mass to explode as a supernova. Instead, in 4-5 billion years, it will enter a red giant phase, its outer layers expanding as the hydrogen fuel in the core is consumed and the core contracts and heats up. Helium fusion will begin when the core temperature reaches about 3×108 K. While it is likely that the expansion of the outer layers of the Sun will reach the current position of Earth's orbit, recent research suggests that mass lost from the Sun earlier in its red giant phase will cause the Earth's orbit to move further out, preventing it from being engulfed. However, Earth's water and most of the atmosphere will be boiled away.\n\nFollowing the red giant phase, intense thermal pulsations will cause the Sun to throw off its outer layers, forming a planetary nebula. The only object that remains after the outer layers are ejected is the extremely hot stellar core, which will slowly cool and fade as a white dwarf over many billions of years. This stellar evolution scenario is typical of low- to medium-mass stars.\n\nHope that helps =)
"A 5"" telescope has 5"" of aperture. \n\nThe quick answer is, a large telescope would take advantage of the Meade LPI Camera. The camera has an effective magnfication somewhere in the range of an eyepeice that's 6mm in focal length, which means it's high magnification. The larger the telescope is in aperture, the higher the ""resolution"" which means you will be able to obtain better images with high magnification eyepieces.\n\nThat being said, your decision should ultimatly be based on your price range and what type of objects you'd prefer to image and view. An 80mm apochromatic refractor is a nice little quality telescope which will give nice (albeit small) images of planets and using a camera on it such as the Meade LPI will give you nice images, even of things you can barely see, as long as you have the proper mount. 80mm is rather small though and a larger telescope will allow you to be more versitile in your viewing.

First of all, ash isn't pure carbon.  It contains particulates of unburnt material, etc.  Secondly, it doesn't matter what the cleaning agent is made out of that counts.  Just because diamond is carbon, doesn't mean you have to clean it with carbon.  What you need to find out is whether or not a particular agent will dissolve whatever you have on the stone, plus not dissolve the stone itself.  Acetone, alcohol, or most other solvents will do this just fine.\n\nHope this helps.

State variables must be linearly independent; a state variable cannot be a linear combination of other state variables. The minimum number of state variables required to represent a given system, n, is usually equal to the order of the system's defining differential equation. The minimum number of state variables is equal to the order of the transfer function's denominator after it has been reduced to a proper fraction.\n\nIn electronic systems, the number of state variables is the same as the number of energy storage elements in the circuit (capacitors and inductors).

First of all, the face is pixellated and contrasted to determine where the edges of the face and important features (eyes, nose) are located. \n\nNext, the recognition algorithm uses this information to proceed.  A simple algorithm would have the following steps.\n\n1.  Identify and scale distinguishing characteristics\nThese can be the roundness of the face, the position of the eyes, etc.  The roundness can be determined by the uniformity of curvature of the face's outline.  A higher roundness number would mean a rounder face.  The eye position can be the vertical distance from the chin to the pupil.\n\n2.  Map and label the numerical values\nA person's face may have a roundness of 2 (out of 10) and his eyes may be 8 inches above the tip of his chin.  The value (2,8) can be stored in memory with that person's name associated with it.\n\n3.  Determine the importance of each trait\nThis is the tricky part.  A person's face may match 'close enough' with several names in the database based on the measured traits.  Conversely, multiple people can also match a particular stored  data point.  For instance, two people with traits (2.1,8) and (2,8.1) can match the (2,8) data point stored earlier.  However, some traits are more important because they are more useful in distinguishing faces.  In order to determine how important each trait is, the computer must 'learn' through neural network logic.  After much trial and error (i.e. the 'learning' process which occurs as part of the development phase) the algorithm may determine that roundness is more important, and therefore the (2,8.1) person will be identified as being the true match.

a little misinformation above......DNA is made up of Nucleotides, which are normally referred to as bases.  Genes are a linear collection of bases which encode some information (mostly protein AA sequence).  This means that DNA is made up of segments called genes, (or apparently non-coding regions) and genes are made up of nucleotides (bases).

Several methodologies are used in Main Economic Indicators (MEI) to link time series. The preferred method, and the one most widely used, is the 12-month or 4-quarter link method.  This method can be applied when an old and new series (which are being linked) contain data for an overlapping time period of at least one year.\n\nThe 12-month (4-quarter) link method calculates a linking factor as the average of the first common year of observations of the new series divided by the equivalent observations of the old series.  This method is robust, in particular when revisions have been made with the introduction of the new series.  Also, this method ensures as best as possible that consistency is maintained between raw and seasonally adjusted versions of the same series.  An exception to this procedure is made in the case of Price Indices, where use of the first common period link method is preferred.  This method calculates a linking factor as the ratio of the first observation of the new series to the equivalent observation of the old series in the overlapping period.  This method ensures the same monthly growth rate at the link point for the new and old Price Indices and minimises the impact on the long time series if major changes are made to the coverage of the new Price Index. \n\nUse of the first common period link method can cause a spurious relationship between the raw and seasonally adjusted versions of the new series prior to the link point (i.e. after the link has been made), which is the primary reason why the 12-month link method is preferred for most time series.  However this is not an issue for Price Indices as these are generally not seasonally adjusted.  Where a full common year between old and new series provided by a country does not exist, the first common period link method will be used.  Also, if there has been no revision to the new series over the first common year, these two linking methods yield the same result. The choice of preferred linking method was decided after detailed methodological and empirical study by the OECD Secretariat.\n\nThe implicit link method is used to link series which share no explicit overlapping period, but for which a common reference period can be established by inference or deduction.  For example, the method could use the information that for the two series, a common base year value is 100. The two series can then be re-referenced to this common base year and then concatenated (i.e. joined).  Note that the information set which necessitates using this link method is rarely found in practice so its use is infrequent.\n\nSome series expressed in levels (such as monetary series measured in currency and series covering western and later unified Germany) are joined by concatenation. This means that values of the new series replace or are added to the old series from the first observation of the new series. As a result of its construction, this method may produce one or more significant ruptures (i.e. series breaks) in the linked series at the link point(s). However, such ruptures are documented in the publications and the database.\n\nMain Economic Indicators investigates each series on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they should be linked or not. If they should, then the most appropriate method is determined by in-depth analysis. Series with little in common methodologically, or those that exhibit significant differences in their evolution are not linked. Furthermore, different methods may be used for different links within the same series, depending on the nature of the old and new data series being linked at the particular point in time.  In general it is the policy of the MEI to try and maintain long time series, and therefore our preference is to link series wherever possible and provide appropriate metadata to users.
Force = mass times weight.  On earth the mass is constant, because the gravitational pull is constant.\n\nSo the amount of force needed to move an object that is at rest, depends upon the mass.  In other words the heavier the object, the more force needed begin motion.\n\nHOWEVER!.....there is one more factor that is neglected by the above equation.  Newton, tended to do that, most of his laws only apply in a vacuum and on frictionless condition.\n\nThat other factor is the coefficient or friction.\nOn ice its low...and take less force to set an object into motion.\nOn sand paper the coefficient is high!\n\nRECAP!\nHeavier objects on rougher (higher coefficient of friction) surfaces are more difficult to set into motion.\n\nGOOD LUCK!
The median of a triangle connects one vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.  So what you have to do is use the Midpoint Formula to get the coordinates of the side to which the median is drawn, then use the Distance Formula to find the distance between the indicated vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side.

"In physics and chemistry, a plasma is typically an ionized gas, and is usually considered to be a distinct phase of matter in contrast to solids, liquids, and gases because of its unique properties. ""Ionized"" means that at least one electron has been dissociated from a proportion of the atoms or molecules. The free electric charges make the plasma electrically conductive so that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields.\n\nThis fourth state of matter was first identified in a discharge tube (or Crookes tube), and so described by Sir William Crookes in 1879 (he called it ""radiant matter"")]. The nature of the Crookes tube ""cathode ray"" matter was subsequently identified by British physicist Sir J.J. Thomson in 1897], and dubbed ""plasma"" by Irving Langmuir in 1928 ], perhaps because it reminded him of a blood plasma]. Langmuir wrote:\n\n""Except near the electrodes, where there are sheaths containing very few electrons, the ionized gas contains ions and electrons in about equal numbers so that the resultant space charge is very small. We shall use the name plasma to describe this region containing balanced charges of ions and electrons.""\nPlasma typically takes the form of neutral gas-like clouds or charged ion beams, but may also include dust and grains (called dusty plasmas). [5] They are typically formed by heating and ionizing a gas, stripping electrons away from atoms, thereby enabling the positive and negative charges to move freely."

The clavicle of each of these critters has been modified through evolution to suit the critter's particular mode of lifestyle.\n\nThe bat's clavicle is a long, strong bone that articulates with the scapula and the sternum.  It is one of the chief supports of the bat's pectoral girdle, and is important in keeping the thorasic cavity from being crushed when the bat sweeps its wings during flight.  The bat's clavicle is much more mobile than most mammal's, sliding laterally and ventrally during the power stroke of the wing.\n\nThe cat, however, has a very reduced clavicle.  In the felids, the clavicle is barely more than an ossified hunk lodged in the muscle structure of the forelimbs.  This accomodation is due to the narrow and upright stance of the feline body.  It allows for greater freedom of movement, as well as the ability to squeeze through tighter openings than a broad shouldered mammal might be able to.  \n\nThe clavicle of a monkey, or indeed most primates, including humans acts as a strut to stabilize the shoulder joint against the sternum.  This broad shouldered, strong strut support helps increase the strength of arm movements despite the highly flexible and mobile humerus/scapula joint.  This combination of strength and flexibility is what allows primates such as gibbons, chimps, spider monkeys, and to some extent even humans to brachiate, travelling by swinging from branch to branch.  It is also what allows us to throw objects such as rocks, spears, and footballs with both accuracy and power.\n\nThe mole's clavicle is very unusual for a mammal.  It is extremely robust and strong, and articulates directly with the humerus instead of attaching to the scapula.  This helps form an incredibly powerful set of supports for the pectoral girdle and muscles, which moles use for digging deeply and quickly through hardened dirt.

Your question suggests you want an answer that only involves 2 dimensions. This is not possible. If you arrange the sticks in a star shape as has been suggested then once two sticks touch you cannot get any more across the boundary they create. If you are allowed into the 3rd dimension slightly then you can arrange the sticks as follows. Arrange two sticks in a V shape. Insert another stick into the V so it touches the other two sticks but doesn't push them apart. I don't have a character on my keyboard to illustrate but the result will look like the three fingers remaining if you folded your thumb and little finger down. Now do the same but laying the remaining three sticks on top on the three you just put down and making sure the neck of the second V is rotated by 90 degrees with respect to the first.

Nanotechnology is the engineering of tiny machines — the projected ability to build things from the bottom up inside personal nanofactories (PNs), using techniques and tools being developed today to make complete, highly advanced products. Ultimately, nanotechnology will enable control of matter at the nanometer scale, using mechanochemistry. Shortly after this envisioned molecular machinery is created, it will result in a manufacturing revolution, probably causing severe disruption. It also has serious economic, social, environmental, and military implications. \n\nA nanometer is one billionth of a meter, roughly the width of three or four atoms.

I am paying my way through grad school by being a teaching assistant and helping out in the high voltage laboratory.\n\nIf you are looking for other universities that also have excellent programs in the power sector of electrical engineering, MIT, Purdue, U of Illinois (Champaign) and U of Missouri (Columbia) are also well known for their graduate programs in power.

"Can we have an infinite universe for example? The answer is no, the universe is finite. Stephen Hawking in 'A Brief History of Time' (1989 page 44) describes the universe as being ""finite but unbounded"". The simplest answer is that as the universe is known to be expanding, it cannot possibly be infinite. To be precise, the dictionary definition of the word universe is ""all that is. The whole system of things."" In this sense the universe is not expanding into anything other than itself, for whatever it is expanding into is part of the universe, there being nothing else but the universe. However, for the sake of simplicity, I am referring only to our Big Bang expanding universe as 'the universe'. (Even if you happen to disagree with the Big Bang theory, the term 'universe' will still have the same meaning here, as it refers to 'our' universe only, and does not include whatever may or may not exist outside of it.)"
Dascartes rule of signs says that the number of positive roots of a polynomial (with real coefficients and ordered in descending powers) is equal to the number of sign changes between consecutive coefficients or is less than that by an exact multiple of 2 (since double roots are counted twice)  Negative roots are counted by changingthe signs of the coefficients of all odd powers of the variable and counting the sign changes the same as for positive roots.\n\nIn your first problem there are 3 sign changes so there are 3 positive roots (one of which may be a repeated root).  Changing the signs of the x^3 and x terms leads to no sign changes (all of the coefficients are negative) so there are no negative roots and the total is 3 roots, all positive.\n\nIn the 2'nd example, there are 6 sign changes so there are 6 positive roots.  Changing the sign of the x^5, x^3, and x terms leaves no sign changes so there are no negative roots.  Since a polynomial of order n has n roots, there are 8-6 = 2 imaginary or complex roots in the polynomial and 6 real roots (which may contain repeated roots)\n\n\nDoug

You'll need a hammer, a filter and something to boil water in.\n\nYou'll want to pulverise the rocksalt, leave it in water for the salt to dissolve (hot water will speed up the process).. filter it to remove the rock and then boil off the water to leave salt.\n\nI wouldn't recommend actually doing this with random rocks that contain salt to produce salt for consumption.. there will almost certainly be other water soluble materials in there that you wouldn't want to eat.

Blood without oxygen in it is dark blue.  It turns bright red when it contacts oxygen, either by leaving the body through a cut or by recieving oxygen from the lungs.  If you cut a vein (which transports deoxygenated blood to the heart and lungs for refueling) the blood will come out almost black for an instant before it hits the air.\n\nIf you look at your veins in places where they're easily visible, like your wrist, you will see that they appear blue, not red.
1. starch is digested by your saliva which breaks it down into sugars.\n\n2. most of the contents of the small intestine are liquid as broken down food is absorbed by the villi, but large food particles also go through on their way to the large intestine.\n\n3.\n\nAmylase speed up the digestion of STARCH.

Well fat in stool is medically termed steatorrhoea. This may occur in patients with pancreatic insufficiency which may have resulted from any condition. This results to a reduction in fat digestion so that the fat you take in your diet is not absorbed. The pancrease is the key organ in producing lipase, a fat digesting enzyme.\nBut it may also occur in malabsorption syndrome, short bowel syndrom and bacterial overgrowth.\nIn the absence of any symptom the vegetable cells, fat and muscle fibres shouldn't be much of a concern...It's probably from the food you ate.
"CO contains a coordinate covalent bond which allows it to bond with hemo(globin?) in much the same way O2 does, which also contains those bonds. \nCO2, is more stable and unreactive since it contains 2 double bonds. \nLewis structures show these different bonds by showing the sharing of the valence electrons among between the atoms of the CO molecule. Since simply sharing 2 of carbons 4 valence electrons completes the octet of the oxygen atom, it is satisfied. But the carbon atom is left, at this point, lacking two to comlete its octet. Other electrons ""help out"" to complete the process, but make for an unstable configuration, allowing the CO molecule to bond effectively with other molecules."

I would say that interest is a good thing, but that doesn't always land you a good job.  I took classes in botany and chemistry that led to a BS degree in botany with a minor in chemistry.  I loved the classes, got excellent grades, but came out of college to end up taking a job I didn't like to make ends meet.\n\nThis isn't meant to discourage you, but to help you think about the end motivation for going to college.  For most people that is finding a good paying job they really like.  For this reason, I'd encourage you to study more general subjects, like Biology, which with the right classes, prepares you for what you want to do, while having a more general knowledge of the biological sciences that may help you in other ways beside helping you to get a job more easily.\n\nThe classes in Entomology or Myrmecology are much the same for Biology majors as they are for Entomology majors, and if you like the subject are easy.\n\nIf you need to get more specialization and have the background learned well (and can afford it), you can specialize in those subjects beyond the level of the Bio BS degree by earning a Masters or Doctorate in them to help you really specialize.\n\nGood luck!  Just think 20 years from now where you want to be.  Cut out the things that won't help you accomplish that, and embrace the things that will.\n\nIncidentally,  I now have a job I like, but it is as a chemist.  The chemistry minor ended up landing me a Field Chemist/Engineer position that I love and pays well too.

To determine the mass percent of Ca in Ca(CN)2 all you have to do is find the mass of Ca, divide it by the total mass of Ca(CN)2, then multiply by 100.  \n\nTherefore:\n\nmass of Ca = 40.08 amu (or g/mol)\nmass of Ca(CN)2 = 92.10 amu (or g/mol)\n\n(40.08 amu / 92.10 amu) x 100 = 43.52% Ca in Ca(CN)2
"because when the vikings compared it to iceland it was green\nit is a relative measure\nThe name Greenland comes from Scandinavian settlers. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder. He, along with his extended family and thralls, set out in ships to find the land that was rumored to be to the northwest. After settling there, he named the land Grønland (""Greenland""), possibly in order to attract more people to settle there. Greenland was also called Gruntland (""Ground-land"") on early maps. Whether Green is an erroneous transcription of Grunt (""Ground""), which refers to shallow bays, or vice versa, is not known. It should also be noted, however, that the southern portion of Greenland (not covered by glacier) is indeed very green in the summer, and the area likely had even more green vegetation in the Medieval warm period when the name was given."
White light separates into different colours when it goes from air into oil, because red light is  refracted by a lesser angle than blue light. The same happens when light goes again out of the oil into the air.\n\nSpilt oil spreads out in multiple layers only a few molecules thick. When light falls upon it, part of it will be deflected on the top of the oil, directly into your eye. But a large part of the light will go into the oil, scatter back on one of the deeper layers and out again. This part will be spread out and produce a rainbow. \n\nNormally this effect is very tiny and you don't notice it for instance with spilt water where there are no layers. But with oil the effect is enhanced because the light rays can follow multiple paths inside the oil, scattering several times up and down on different layers, before coming out in the air again.

My magic 8 ball says: True
I agree with Kunche and I'm expanding his explanation that's it. \nMilk is highly viscous fliud. So it will always have a dry film on the top of it due to exposure to atmosphere. This dry film will not allow gases or water vapur which come out when heated to escape out. So like a baloon the milk layer expands and rises high. When you disturb that top layer by sprinkling water or blowing air when it is expanding you will see a lot of gases escaping out as though some work has been alloted to them. That is the proof that gases are trapped inside that layer. But coming to water it has very less viscosity. The particles or molecules will move aside freely to allow the water vapour to escape out. That's why there will not be any rise in the layer. That's the very reason why you see more vapuors coming out of water compared to milk.\nLol dan. That's really good one. I couldn't help laughing out in my cabin here. But let the kids learn. Don't discourage them. This questions and answers are the proof for technology helping kids learn fast and getting answers all round the world. Bye.

Not near infinity, just enormously larger than the electron's rest mass.  One way that accelerator experiments demonstrate this is by the fact that as the electron speed reaches closer to the speed of light the bending magnets need to have their current increased in order to deflect the increasingly massive electrons.

Sure... To do this, you need to examine the yield strength of all joints of the cart and what they are rated for.  (For example, Find out what kind of load is placed on the axle and then choose an axel that can withstand that weight...)  The maximum weight that you can hold on the cart is the maximum weight that the WEAKEST link of your cart can withstand.\n\n(Conservatively, one also introduces some factor of safety here. Multiply the maximum yield of the weakest link by a factor of 80-90% to give you some wiggle room in case you dynamically load -- i.e. drop weight on the cart.)

This is the point in the life of a plant that is most fragile.  You can either make or break it at this point.  A seed is extremely resilient to dehydration and all manner of environmental situations.  However, once you plant and water that seed, it will emerge and is extremely vulnerable.  The root system has not developed so it needs steady water.  The seedling is not large enough to store a lot of water or nutrients.  As such, it needs conditions that will be stable until it can establich itself.  It has not developed the layers of tissue to regulated it's temperature that well and if it does not get enough water, it will die and there is no turning back.  It will not regrow, unlike a well established plant that can wilt when dry and then come back to life.

Good question. It's the sort of thing that seems so obvious -- but everyone has a different opinion about just what the correct answer is. In some parts of the world, sunrise happens when you can distinguish between a black thread and a white one - in other words, when the day begins to become light. In other places it isn't until the sun is actually on the horizon. It's pretty spectacular to watch the sun rise in the Grand Canyon -- it literally runs down the walls of the canyon, revealing things you never see at any other time of day, until it hits the bottom of the canyon. \nThe actual definition must have to do with daylight, because if it were when we saw the sun on the horizon, that means there would never be a sunrise on a cloudy or rainy day. \n'But that's just my opinion.
"Since  a mature erythrocyte does not contain a nucleus (not a typical eukaryotic cell) , it is commonly referred to as a corpuscle.\nIn sickle cell anemia the cell takes on a sickle shape, does not carry a sufficient amount of oxygen, and may even clog up arterioles and capillaries. This is an inherited disease , more common with black people of African decent. The individual may be a ""carrier"" in the heterozygous condition, suffering ill effects during exertion or at high altitudes. The full blown disease occurs in the homozygous recessive condition.\nA similar disease, ""Coolies anemia"" (spelling?) is prevalent among people decending from the Mediterranian area."
"You have a problem with your formula. In fact, you should write:\n\nx = A cos(angular speed * t)\nThe phase angle is not relevant to this problem. You are only concerned about complete cycles of the harmonic motion and there is no other particle or timing reference, so the question of phase shift doesn't arise.\n\nThe number to use for ""angular speed"" is derived from the statement that the particle makes 2.5 oscillations/s. One oscillation corresponds to 2*pi of angular motion and takes 0.4 seconds. Therefore you know that every 0.4 seconds, (angular speed)*0.4*n = n*2*pi. So (angular speed) = 2.5*2*pi. Angular speed calculated like this will have units of radians/s. You calculated the right value, 15.71, but you didn't have the right understanding.\n\nNow you can answer the questions. The first falls out directly from getting the right equation for x. And you are correct that the second and third parts are answered by successive differentiations of x, then finding the maximum. So the amplitude for displacement is A; the amplitude for velocity is A*(angular speed); for acceleration it is A*(angular speed)^2.\nSo: a: 20 cm (particle moves from +5 to -5 to +5)\nb: 78.54 cm/s\nc: 1234 cm/s^2 = 12.34 m/s^2"

Work units: Joule, or N-m for mech work\n\nThe rate at which work is performed is power.\nPower units: watts, or Joule/sec\n\nIn physics, energy is said to be the ability to do work; the strict mathematical definition of energy in physics always being the amount of work itself (done by or against specified force).\nEnergy has the same units as work; a force applied through a distance. The SI unit of energy, the joule, equals one newton applied through one meter, for example. Energy has no direction in space, and is therefore considered a scalar quantity.
Can you be a bit more specific? rate of heat transfer depends on a number of factors like temperature gradient, material transfering etc. heat can transfer pretty quickly in metals like copper that have low thermal resistances.

Its value for use in clocks was introduced by physicists during the 17th century, following observations from Galileo.\n\npendulum (plural pendulums or pendula), is a weight (or bob) on the end of a rigid rod (or a string/rope), which, when given an initial push, will swing back and forth under the influence of gravity over its central (lowest) point.

#3  Joule is a electrical term for 1 watt-second. So it is a power rating.\nOne joule is also: The work required to move an electric charge of one coulomb through an electrical potential difference of one volt; or one coulomb volt, with the symbol C·V.\n\nAs for why they use it, I think it is a small enough meaurement that 360 joules is much better than 0.1 Kilowatt Hours\n\n2. Varies. There are a few different waveforms that are used by different manufacturers. Each one is based on different resistances.  Honestly, If the Defib is being used for its intended purpose, it should not matter.  This is because either it is a biphasic (newer model) and using the resistance to figure out proper power or Monophasic and usually will increase in power with each shock (most of the times will max out at 3rd shock of 360 joules)  They figure that the resistance is between 25 and 200 ohms with biphasics shocking the equal to 360 joules at 50 ohms (per Medtronic lifepak 500 stat sheet)\n\n1. Again Varies depending on model (this causes part of the wave form in addition to the length of dischage time) But the current overall will change with change in joules.

What is the sixth category.  Life is put into five categories, monera, fungi, protists, plants and animals.  There are two ways of determining which beings go in which category.  The older way is called the phenetic way, in which animals are categorized based on common traits.  For instance, all mammals have fur.  The more common way of classifying animals is the cladistic way, which groups organisms based on common evolutionary backgrounds.  All mammals at one point in development have gill slits, a notochord, etc.

As an epidemiologist, I have to read medical histories on a regular basis. To help you learn to take good medical Hx, let me offer you my personal wishlist of things I would like to see more of on H&P.\n\nFirst up, if you have a really good idea of what the ailment is, you can focus your questions towards that ailment, particularly RISK FACTORS for that ailment. \n\nFor example, in cases of Vibrio infections, ask the patient about travel history, food history, water exposures.\n\nIf you are working on a possible STD, ask about sexual history -- number of partners, partners incarcerated, injection drug use, etc. If the STD patient is a teen (as most are), ask about home life, age of partner (you may be required to report if the patient is young enough), number of partners, school attendance and so forth.\n\nAnd in general asking about family history, social history, other medical coniditions, medications, illicit drug use , occupational exposures will be helpful.\n\nMuch of the time, I find that doctors forget to ask about food exposures or travel history. Those are key players in many diseases, and it leaves big gaps for researchers like me if I cannot get that information.

To get the answer, you first want to convert everything into the same units. usually the problem is easier when using whole numbers: 1,2,10 etc... With this problem take 5 weeks and turn it into a number of days. 7 days in the week, times 5 weeks, equals 35 days. 7*5=35. Your ratio is then 3:35. \n\nThe lowest common multiple is one. Your answer is already in lowest terms.

Fluids are first passed into the glomerulus, which is the site of fliltration. They are then sent to the Bowman's capsule, which receives the filtered fluids from the glomerulus, and begins its process of being formed into urine.
I think the question you are asking is can something with no mass produce a force on an object. The answer is yes. A photon has no mass but it has energy. It's energy is equal to a constant times the frequency. This might seem a bit odd at first but if you have ever been into a science store they will probably have a light bulb with a vacume inside with a pinwheel going round and round. What is actually pushing the pinwheel is light because light it turns out will cause pressure on an object which we call radation pressure. \n\nYou are probably confused at this point since force = mass*acceleration, but mass is equal to energy -- remember E=mc^2, which we sometimes write as E=m by setting the speed of light equal to one. This means that you can actually create a massive particle from light -- this is called pair creation. It happens when a high energy photon becomes an electron and positron. Also, when fission occur the opposite happens -- part of the mass becomes energy in the form of light.

you don't say if you're in US or UK or somewhere else - your choices depend on that. In UK you will not be able to get into forensic work without a specialist degree, probably doctorate level, whereas in the US I understand that you can.\nWhat about some sort of environmental chemistry work? That at least uses your degree and gets you outdoors, too...monitoring etc obviously needs to take place outside!\nA chemistry degree should show employers that you are numerate so there are many avenues of employment open. My students often go on to work in teaching, lab management, sales, hospital and other labs, chemical production and analysis, environmental monitoring etc but have also gone into actuarial work, statistical analysis and even working in science centres.\nGood luck!
Any surface with air below it becomes colder quicker than others in the absence of solar radiation. Note how water freezes on a bridge before it does on other parts of a road, or how snow accumulates first on a deck before it does on the ground when the temperature is right around freezing. The ground is a good conductor of heat (warmth from below), air is a poor one. Same applies to frost on the blades of grass but not the bare ground in many spots.\n\nAdd to that the fact that especially during a calm, clear night, surfaces such as the top of a car or deck radiate heat to space and become cooler than the air above them. The air cools in response, but at sunrise the temperature of that surface may be 5-10° lower than the air at 2 meters above ground (which is reported).

Because it is separating, there is two main parts to milk, the fat and the milk/water. When you boil the milk the fat rises to the top separating itself from the thiner milk liquid....and then it curdles, so don't eat it too much like that....and use whipping cream instead of milk, it holds much longer, and if your using a cream or a milk base, remember (if it's a soup or a sauce of some sort) to add a little bit of strach, i.e. corn starch or flour, in order to hold it all together, this is called a rue.

Suricates are known for their upright posture and highly sociable behavior.\n\nSuricates typically live in dry, open areas and savannas. Their range extends from southwestern Angola to South Africa. These social animals live in colonies, usually in places with sandy soil where they can dig elaborate underground burrows.\n\nSuricates measure about 25 to 35 cm (10 to 14 in) in length, not including the tail. They are more slender than many mongooses. They have pointed snouts, silvery-brown fur, and irregular dark stripes on the rump. Their faces are white with dark markings on the ears and around the eyes. Unlike most mongooses, suricates have four rather than five toes on each paw.\n\nSuricates forage for food only during the daytime, eating mainly insects, particularly beetles, spiders, and millipedes. They sometimes feed on small vertebrates, eggs, and roots. Suricates typically have two to four young, which are often born in the fall or early winter after a gestational period of about 11 weeks. Both females and males care for, groom, and guard their offspring.\n\nSuricates typically stand up straight on their hind legs or even their toes to sniff the wind and search for attacking vultures. They have excellent vision and are capable of making at least ten types of sounds, including an alarm bark.\n\nBecause suricates can carry rabies, they have been hunted or gassed in their burrows in areas where they pose a threat to humans. This has not reduced their numbers significantly. In South Africa, these affectionate and easily tamed creatures are often kept as pets.\n\nScientific classification: The suricate is a member of the mongoose family, Herpestidae, in the order Carnivora. It is classified as Suricata suricatta.

nope. That makes no sense. What you could do is the semiquantitatve use of the Benedict's test. Benedicts solution is used to test for the presence of sugar. What you would do is the benedicts test on equal samples of each apple. Remembering that Benedict's changes from blue-gree-yellow-brick, red u can use this range of colours as well as the mass of the precipitate formed to determine which apple contains more sugar. (the one with more sugar would lie to the right of this spectrum of colours etc.) U can then place pieces of apples from each specimen (make sure the surface areas exposed and mass are equal) in the air (keep all other parameters such as wind speed, temperature etc constant) and time too see which pieces brown faster. \nWhat do u think?
Im working in the cardiologist line, i can answer your questions.\nYou have to see a cardiologist for a check up, most probably they will do tests like ECG (record ur hearbeat rhythm), Treadmill Stress Test (to see if you have the irregular heart beat during exercise too), Echocardiography/ultrasound of the heart ( to see if you have abnormal valves) and 24 hours Holter (just a smalll device attached on ur body 24 hrs to record ur heartbeatfor a day).\n\nArrhytmias (irregular heart beat) can be caused by several factors, but you are a young boy; so most likely it will be caused by Premature Atrial Complexes or Premature Ventricular Complexes;which is also known as skipped heart beat\nIt has to do with the nerves in your heart muscle.\n\nIt could be inherited, trigger by stress, coffee and tea. Most of the time, its not a life threatening condition, but go and see a cardiologist is my advice. i can go on explaining more about your condition in details but it this answer will ended up so long.\nI hope it help
That's not always the case....\nThe clearness of the water is also due to whatever solids are suspended in the water.  That's called turbidity.  Granted, there are indeed instances where algae will grow at an astonishing rate, but streams don't tend to have overwhelming populations of algae, that in eutrophic lakes.  Take a look at the water on a summer day, on a spring day, heck even a winter day.  I'm betting the difference will be  minimal, but don't get me wrong, heat and sunlight does play a role in water clarity.

"You need to relax.  Science isn't difficult.  You only think it is because you've always been told it is.  Take a deep breath.\n\nImagine that a pure comound, in this case a liquid, is composed of a bunch of tiny balls.  (This analogy only goes so far so don't count on it forever.)  Anyway, you want to apply sufficient heat on these balls to get them popping around (boiling).  So, of three, namely H2S, H2O and HF which ones pop first?  If you said the lightest ones would tke the least energy, you'd be on your way.  Except that some of these balls stick to each other (beware O as it sticks mightily to hydrogens in other atoms.  This is known as ""hydrogen bonding"".)  The answer, I think, would be that HF (MW = 20 Da; BP = -84 C) boils before H2S (MW = 34 Da; BP = -60 C) boils before H2O (MW = 18; BP = 100 C).\n\nThe aim of this question is to get you to see that hydrogen bonding complicates boiling point series, especially for water which is only the most important solvent on earth.  Otherwise, the lighter the molecule the lower the boiling point.\n\nThere's no dissociation involved in boiling points other than that dissolved salts raise boiling points and lower freezing ponts.  Molality has to do with number of particles more than molar mass so it's got to be the number of particles physically interfering with the boiling and freezing processes.  You can actually calculate how much effect a salt has on phase changes given the concentration for the salt but that's a different lesson.\n\nGood luck."

It doesn't yet.  Most current stem cell therapies use adult stem cells from the patients own body.  They are simply extracted from one area and put into another.  They are not genetically altered in any way.  A method currently being developed is to use SCNT to created a 'cloned' stem cell that would match the patient exactly.  Actual gene therapy for humans is a long way off, owing to the difficulty in actually getting any vector to deliver the gene to enough cells in an effective manner.

The first succesful organ transplant was a kidney transplant between twin brothers performed in Boston in 1954.  For many years afterwards, the only transplants done were kidneys between twin siblings.  Being twins made the kidneys genetically identical so there was no chance of rejection since immunosuppresant drugs were not available until the late 60's or early 70's.  In 1967 the first human heart transplant was attempted by Dr. Christian Bernard in Capetown South Africa.  The patient died a few days later.  Within a few years after this, cyclosporine was introduced and organ transplantation became a reality.  This was the first immunosuppresive drug that became available and solved the issue of rejection.  Since that time, transplatation of heart, livers, lungs, kidneys and pancreas have become common place.  New drugs have been developed that are more specific to fighting rejection rathe than suppressing the whole immune system and have fewer side effects.  Research continues into other transplants and better medications.

And we do the following:\n\n\n#111 -( carry section here)\n+0111\n##011\n----------\n#1010 \n\nand 1010 is the answer because   8(1)+(0)4+(1)2+(0)1= 8+2 = 10 decimal \n\nSo 3 decimal which is 011 binary and 7 decimal in binary is 111 when add together is 10 decimal; which in binary is 1010 \n\nand that is how you add numbers in Binary\n\nMulitiply in is the same as multiplication of 1 and 0 \n\nfor example let do 5 times 5 in binary \n\n\nSo 5= 101 binary \n\n\n##101\n#x101\n----------\nStarting with the right column Multiply 101 by 1 which equals 101\n\nSo :\n\n\n##101\n#x101\n----------\n### 101\n\nnow with the next colum from the right multiply the 101 by 0 it equals 0 \n\nSo \n\n\n##101\n#x101\n----------\n### 101\n## 000\n\nnow for the final column multiply 101 by 1 and it equal 101 \n\nSo \n\n\n##101\n#x101\n----------\n### 101\n## 000\n# 101\n-------------\n\n\nAdd the partial additions here to get :\n\n##101\n#x101\n----------\n### 101\n## 000\n# 101\n-------------\n11001 \n\nLet see if this is the right answer \n\n16(1) +8(1) +4(0) +2(0)+1(1) = 16 + 8+1= 25\n\nSo 5 x 5 = 25 \nor 101(5 binary) time 101( 5 binary) = 11001(25 binary ) \nthis check out \n\n\nDivision is a bit more involved but lets do it:\n\n5 divided by 2 \n\nSo 5 =101 and 2= 10 \n\nsetup the problem like so:\n\n\n##___________________\n10/101.00000000000000\n\n\nSo let start by how many 10 will go into 10 the answer 1 \n\nSo \n\n##_1_________________\n10/101.00000000000000\n-10\n----------- \n### 1\n\nhow many 10 will go in to 1 answer 0 So \n\n##_10._________________\n10/101.00000000000000\n-10\n----------- \n####1\n### -0 \n------------\n####10 \n\nPut our decimal point here{ because we reached it } and \nHow many 10 will go into 10 answer 1 \n\nSo :\n\n##_10.1_________________\n10/101.00000000000000\n-10\n----------- \n####1\n### -0 \n------------\n####10 \n### -10\n--------------- \n######0 \n\nNo need to go any farther all the rest are zeros from here\n\nSo the answer is 10.1 binary which is \n\n2(1)+ 1(0) + (1)(1/2) = 2 1/2 decimal which is the correct answer \n\nuse this  to help you :\n\n\n\n\n 4096, 2048, 1024, 512 ,  256 , 128 ,  64 , 32 , 16 , 8, 4, 2  1\n##0####0####0###0####0####1###1###1###1# 1#1#0#1 \n\nput in the 1's and zero's in the 2 place holder like I got above here.\n\nmultiply the 1 and the zeros where they appear in the 2's place holder { I ignore the the leading zeros here} like so:\n\n 128(1)+64(1)+32(1)+ 16(1)+8(1) +4(1) +2(0)+1(1) \n\n128+64+32+16+8+4+1 =  253  \n\nso: 11111101 binary is 253 decimal \n\nthe best way to do this is to set your computer's calulator to Binary by clicking the bin circle enter your binary number and select the dec circle to tell you what the decimal number is \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n\n\nHope this helps
For the most part, I will second gopal's answer with a little bit of detail.\n\nNormally, division by 0 is undefined, so the people who said that are telling the absolute mathematical truth.\n\nBut there are many forms where 0/0 is simply indeterminate.\n\nTake for instance, the limit as x approaches zero of sin(x)/x\n\nBoth the numerator and denominator are defined at x = 0, so the limit would seem to be 0/0. But this doesn't tell the story of what the ratio does as x approaches 0.\n\nTaking x to be a radian measure, let's try a few values for x:\n\nx = 0.1 => sin(x) = 0.099833416\nx = 0.01 => sin(x) = 0.009999833\nx = 0.001 => sin(x) = 0.000999999\n\nWhat you might notice is that x approaches 0, x and sin(x) get closer and closer together. That must mean that as x approaches 0, sin(x)/x approaches 1. The indeterminate form 0/0 doesn't tell us anything about the rate at which both functions approach 0.\n\nOf course, this doesn't mean that all indeterminate forms 0/0 have a value of 1. It depends on what you can figure out about the response of the parts of the ratio as x approaches some value that makes the ratio indeterminate. In calculus, there is a technique called L'hopital's Rule that can be used to find limits of functions that have indeterminate forms like 0/0 and infinity/infinity.
A crises would be a potential or ongoing disaster of very large (possibly global) proportions, like overpopulation and global warming.
the y-intercept is the point at which x=0.\nBut when x=0, ln(x) is undefined because as x approaches 0, ln(x) approaches -infinity. So there is no y-intercept, the appropriate answer would be 'undefined'.
The link you provide is broken.\n\nBut I'll try to answer anyway. Your question is rather peculiar: our choices are the expression of our preferences, so it follows trivially that our preferences bias our choices completely. In fact, without preferences, there are no choices. It's like asking: How much is temperature involved when it is cold?

Vesuvius (vəsū'vēəs) , Ital. Vesuvio, only active volcano on the European mainland, S Italy, on the eastern shore of the Bay of Naples, SE of Naples. The height of the main cone changes with each eruption, varying within a few hundred feet of the 4,000-ft (1,219-m) level; in 1969 the height was 4,190 ft (1,277 m). The second summit, Monte Somma (3,770 ft/1,149 m) is a ridge that half encircles the cone and is separated from it by a valley (c.3 mi/5 km long). The sides of Vesuvius are deeply scarred by lava flow, but its lower slopes are extremely fertile, dotted with villages, and covered with vineyards which produce the famous Lachryma Christi wine. The base of the mountain (circumference c.45 mi/70 km) is encircled by a railroad, and a chairlift reaches almost to the rim of the crater (diameter c.2,300 ft/700 m). On the western slope, at 1,995 ft (608 m), there is a seismological observatory (built 1840–45). The outline of Vesuvius forms part of the backdrop of Naples; it is often surmounted by a faint plume of smoke.\nThe earliest recorded eruption (A.D. 79) was described by Pliny the Younger in two letters to Tacitus; the eruption buried Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Stabiae under cinders, ashes, and mud. Pliny the Elder was killed by the eruption, which he had come to investigate. Frequent eruptions have been recorded since Pompeii was destroyed, notably in 512, in 1631, six times in the 18th cent., eight times in the 19th cent. (notably in 1872), and in 1906, 1929, and 1944. The eruptions vary greatly in severity, but the geological record shows that Vevusius experiences a truly devastating eruption every 2,000–3,000 years.\n\nI had a bundle more info for you but you dont allow e-mails,, sorry\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Occasionally, a second, dimmer secondary rainbow is seen outside the primary bow. Secondary rainbows are caused by a double reflection of sunlight inside the raindrops, and appear at an angle of 50°–53°. As a result of the second reflection, the colours of a secondary rainbow are inverted compared to the primary bow, with blue on the outside and red on the inside. The dark area of unlit sky lying between the primary and secondary bows is called Alexander's band, after Alexander of Aphrodisias who first described it.\n\nHope this helps!
From your question, I can write 2 equations with 2 unknowns. Let x be the mls of 3% and y the mls of 15%. We know x+y=2500 and ,03x+.15y=.1(2500)=250ml. Substitute for x, since x=2500-y to get .03(2500-y)+.15y=250. Expanding and combining yields  75-.03y+.15y=250, then .12y=175, then y=175/.12 =1458+1/3, so x=1041+2/3.

Eubacteria, also known as the true bacteria, have a bad reputation. They are seen as disease causing agents. Every day new products come out adverstising their ability to destroy these microscopic but dangerous creatures. In reality, only a small percentage of these unicellular organisms cause disease. The rest fullfill many important roles in the natural world. Eubacteria can be photoautotrophs, saprophytes, or symbionts.
Many people use working pressure and operating pressure interchangeably. However, I don't believe the ANSI piping codes use the word rated pressure for piping systems. I believe it uses the term design pressure to define the maximum safe pressure at which a system can be operated. \n\nThe only place I can recall the code using the term rated or rating is with regards piping classes or flange ratings. It has been over ten years since I have had reason to look at the ANSI code but I believe I am correct. \n\nThe main point I would like to make is you need to be very careful what terms you use so that they are consistent with the codes you are using.
my guess is it will be about 20cft
Greenhouse effect refers to the manner in which the buildup of certain gases trap a certain percent of the suns rays from reflecting back into space.  This percentage of the suns rays are re-reflected back into the earth's atmosphere, which causes an average overall warming of the earth's climate.  The effect is similar to the way that sunlight is reflected back upon itself within a greenhouse, causing the air inside a greenhouse to be warmer than the air outside.
Put simply, efficiency equals the power you receive divided by the power you put in. You'll need these 4 basic equations.\nPower = work / time\nWork = Force * distance\nForce = Mass * acceleration\nEfficiency = Output/Input (in %)\n\nThe motor is rated at 100w, so that is the power you put in.\nTo lift 50kg, you need to overcome gravity. In this case, Mass = 50kg, gravitational acceleration = 9.81 m/s.\nFrom here you can calculate the force required. Then you can calculate the work done, and then the power. This is the power you receive. From here, you can calculate the efficiency.\n\nTry to work it out on your own. You'll learn more.

"There are 3 main temperature scales.\n\nThe earliest, Fahrenheit, was invented in 1724 by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit, a German Physicist. This scale is still used widely in America.\n\nThe next and most ""metric"" of the scales, Celsius, was invented in 1742 by Sweedish astronomer Anders Celsius. This scale is the standard in Europe.\n\nThe last scale, Kelvin, is the SI standard measurement for temperature. It was invented in 1848 by Lord William Thomas Kelvin. The kelvin scale starts at absolute zero, therefore 0 C/32 F is equivalent to 273.15K"

You've got me... By definition they would have to be positive integers.  So the absolute value of -y, would just be y...\n\nIf they are all prime, how can you represent z as the product of two other primes?  That contradicts your assertion that they are all primes.\n\nThe only way to make this work is to allow 1 to be considered a 'prime' number, but with current definitions of prime, this is not the case, nor can 0 be considered prime...\n\nOr if these are supposed to be the difference of factorials, there's another problem.  Every factorial of a prime (2! or above), will have 2 as a factor.  When you subtract two even numbers, the result is always even.  So the only way be if x! and y! were within 2 of each other.  Using the smallest primes possible (3! and 2!) you have 6 - 2 = 4, which is not 2.\n\nPlease explain what I'm missing...

If God is a construct of how mankind views a supreme existence, and UFO's are a construct of how we percieve the existence of life outside the boundaries of the known realm which we know life exists; then why wouldn't they both exist simultaneously.\n  You're correct that there have been many depictions in a variety of cultures throughout man's recorded presence upon Earth, but what man calls God, has also had a multitude of names and faces.\n\n If God exists, and he created mankind, and mankind has created the machines which we use daily to travel across our planet, to the moon, and beyond. It seems to be that  other beings which God, or perhaps another God that 'manages other property' would also create machines which would accomplish similar tasks.\n\nMaybe the Universe itself is God, and we are just a singular cell of a mighty living organism.
"These lenses are quite similar. D refers to the diameter of the lens, and F is the focal length. Both are two-element lenses, meaning that there are two physical pieces of glass, and ""air spaced"" means that those two pieces are not physically touching (which is common), but slightly separated (which is optically better, but more expensive).\n\nIf money is no object, go with the 150mm lens. In astronomy, aperture is everything. This is a nice six-inch diameter, which will give you fabulous views. Also, since the focal length of your objective is rather long (by modern standards), it's best to start with a long focal-length eyepiece (like 25mm). This will give you lower magnification, but a wider field of view."

It is the Coriolis effect.  When fluids move at a large scale in a rotating frame of reference, they deflect.  The deflection is always to the right in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere.  Air always flows away from high pressure and towards lower pressure.  If the air is moving away in all directions and deflecting to the right (Northern Hemisphere), it rotates clockwise.  If the air is moving away in all directions and deflecting to the left (Southern Hemisphere), it rotates counterclockwise.  The Coriolis effect applies only to large scales, like storm systems.  It does not affect the direction that tubs, sinks, or toilets drain.
Protons carry a positive electric charge.  Electrons carry a negative electric charge.  The magnitude of the charge carried on both the, positive, protons and the, negative, electrons are equal....meaning that the total electric charge on an object is zero only if the number of protons exactly equals the number of electrons.\n\nIn an atom, for example, the net electric charge is zero and there are equal numbers of protons and electrons.  When an atom has an unequal number of protons and electrons (in the case when the atom is oxidized or reduced...loosing electrons or gaining electrons), the atom becomes an ion and has a net charge.\n\nIf something does have an unequal balance between protons and electrons and has a net charge, it will be attracted/repelled to other objects with a net charge as well.  Like charges repel and dissimilar charges attract, so all the + charges will attract all the - charges and vice-versa, eventually forming overall neutral objects.
According to integration by parts\nint(f(x)g(x)) = f(x)int(g(x))-int(f'(x)int(g(x))\nNow, consider \nint (f(x)g''(x) )dx\n=f(x)g'(x)-int(f'(x)g'(x)) since int(f'(x)) = f(x)\n=f(x)g'(x)- { f'(x)g(x) - int(f''(x)g(x)) } limit from 0 to a\n={f(x)g'(x) - f'(x)g(x) + int(f''(x)g(x)) } limit from 0 to a\n={f(a)g'(a) - f'(a)g(a)} - {f(0)g'(0) - f'(0)g(0)} + {int(f''(x)g(x)) } limit from 0 to a\n={f(a)g'(a) - f'(a)g(a)} + {int(f''(x)g(x)) } limit from 0 to a\nSince f(0) = g(0) = 0\n\nThats the proof.

There were more than 18 hurricanes in 2005. However, there was a report released in Science Magazine in September of 2005 that the number of category 4 and 5 hurricanes has nearly doubled (I believe the rise was actually 80%) over the past three decades, to an average of 18 per year. That doesn't exactly answer your question because the year wasn't over when that number came out, and it is an average, but that number made a lot of headlines. I think that annual average number of hurricanes may be your answer. \n\nThis is important because this is being tied to effects of global warming, and the threat of things getting even worse.
Yes, and yes,  Volcanoes do produce sulfur it is actually used to determine the approximate time of an eruption along with seismology, a good example of this is your on a mountain side, and all the trees in an area are drown and there is no sings of birds, or small mammals, this is do to the sulfur gases escaping and killing every thing around it.  As for the relationship to hell the Greeks refereed to the mouth of a volcano to be the gates of Aries him self, do to the heat the, gases, and some of the sulfur formations that where formed by the volcano, (this is a yellowish colors cone that is shooting sulfur gas upward all the time) volcanism refers to theses as vents.  So yes, there is diffidently sulfur gas around volcano's, and yes for the longest time volcano's where referred to as the gates of hell.

I think the previous respondent explained this subject pretty well. I can't really think of any benefits for the consumers in regards to GM food. They have no been sufficiently tested on humans. All the corporations do is briefly test them, and the FDA rubberstamps the new products, acting as though they are exactly the same as a normal produce. Of course for corporations the benefits are quite clear; they may gain patent on certain varieties of seeds. This means corporations can control large portions of the food supply, in effect wiping out small farmers and peasants. The development of terminator seeds, insures that farmers must buy new seed from companies such as Monsanto, each year, rather than using their own. This causes poor farmers to become even furthered indebted, and thus many are forced from farming all together.

There is no such thing as the perpendicular bisector of a triangle. You can, however, find the perpendicular bisector of any of the three sides of the triangle. \n\nSuppose you have a triangle called ABC and you wish to find the perpendicular bisector of the side AB. Simply put the point of a compass at point A and open up the compass so that the pencil end is at point B. Then draw a circle. Now put the point of the compass on point B and the pencil end on point A and draw another circle. The two circles will intersect at two points which you might name E and F. Now draw a line through E and F and passing through AB. This line will be the perpendicular bisector of AB.\n\nEvery triangle has three altitudes. In the triangle ABC, the line drawn from C perpendicular to the side AB is an altitude, so is the line drawn from B perpedicular to the line AC, and so is the line drawn from A perpendicular to the line BC.\n\nThe area of a triangle = 1/2 base times altitude.

Stephen Hawking said the universe is shaped like a pear with the singularity or big bang at the bottom and the curves in space time. However their is also the fecund universe theory. This states that when one universe has a black hole, time does not end inside a black hole but initiates a quantum bounce. This creates a singularity on the other side creating a baby universe. Each new universe the laws of physics are the same but their may be slight variations. The beliefe of our universe being the way it is, is because ours is how universes typicaly develope. This is basicaly the anthropic principle, which states, if our universe was not the way it was we would not be here. Richard Feynman states that a particle will take every single path through space time available. Meaning each universe could be another possible outcome of reality. A final note on one of the particles that exist in the universe (or perhaps multiverses) is the electron. All electrons are the same one curve. Also electrons move backwards in time while positrons move forward. So the electron is a curve on a atomic scale that moves backwards in time. This is all highly theoretical. However I hope my answer was helpful.

I think what is mind boggling about a scientific fact is one's own lack of knowledge in a given area.  That's to say, no matter how smart we are, what we find boggling is specifically what we never took the time to find out more about.\n\nFor instance, I have one that's been bugging me since I was a kid.  We were taught that the definition of water boiling was water reaching the temperature it needed to turn into a gas, steam.  I believe it was 100 Celsius degrees or 212 Fahrenheit degrees.  We were also taught that the cyclical nature of weather patterns frequently had to do with ocean water becoming water vapor which, when gathered together, became precipitation and so on.  Now, even as an adult, while I acknowledge that the words “water vapor” and “steam” MUST mean two different things, and while I also realize that it MUST NOT have anything to do with the fact that lesser pressure at higher altitudes allows lower boiling temperatures, I still cannot shake the feeling that I missed something here.  The ocean is not boiling.  Steam is a gas; water vapor seems to be a gas.  How does the ocean water become gaseous enough to float without boiling?  Ugh.  I feel mentally raped.\n\nHowever, if you are simply asking about scientific facts that have a wow factor, as opposed to my numbskull perceptions, the fact that we actually age infinitesimally slower at higher altitudes always blew my socks off.  Good old Einstein.  \n\nThere's also the fact that philosophically there could only be ten dimensions, as opposed to an unlimited, sci-fi-esque number of dimensions.  You can check that out here...\nhttp://www.tenthdimension.com/\n\nAs far as younger, more childish wow factors were concerned, I've a few.  While we have plenty of single celled organisms we learn about in biology as well as many complex organisms, and while the thought of a bicellular organism then made sense as a transitional existence, I always kind of took pleasure in the bicellular organisms that were still around, almost seemingly for no reason.  Some Hydra are in this group, just taking nutrients in one cell and ridding them of waste through another...\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_%28genus%29\n\nNeutrinos, while popularized by lingo used in Star Trek, are actually quite fascinating to me.  They are tiny, uncharged particles, so small and so neutral in their electromagnetic state that they can pass through a whole planet, completely, without even scraping along any of the atoms that make the world up.  We use neutrino sensitive baths to detect when such particles have traversed terra firma, indicating the birth of a new star.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino\n\nChaos mathematics, formerly chaos theory, has plenty of adult wow factors that too many people just ignore.  My personal favorite is the accomplishment of having found a predictable pattern to background static in telephone lines that later lead to better internet access and signal transfers.\n\nStill, the best parts about science are still firmly in the realm of human perception.  While I once only shared the following notion with those special enough to me to take from it love, I now ask you to consider the following.  Go out into your back yard.  The woods or a beach are better, anything wild, but a back yard will do.  Find a place where the ground is soft or just not harsh enough to rip up your hands.  Dig.  Use your fingers, your nails, get dirty.  Make a nice little hole about big enough to put your heart into.  Now, brush yourself off, sit back, and contemplate.  You have just changed the shape of the entire planet with your single set of bare hands.  THE ENTIRE PLANET just changed because of you!  You!  Hey, if you can do that, you can do anything.

I'll help you with the first part, but unfortunately you were ambiguous with your terminology.  Is R = P(x) [P is a function of x] or R = P*x, i.e., P(x)*x, i.e., the function P times x?  Not only that, you say R = px, lower case p, which strictly means p is another variable you have not mentioned yet.  While that's what you wrote, I doubt that's what you meant.\n\nI'm going to assume you meant R = P(x) - if not, use the same logic by multiplying through by x.\n\nP(x) = sqr(x) - 10x + 25\nR(max) = P'(x) for x = 0 (derivative of P(x) = 0 implies the maximum)\n\nSo take the derivative of P(x) and set P'(x) = 0.  Find x.  Replace this value for x in the original equation and you will have R(max).\n\n2 and 3:  Again, here you literally imply there is a new variable, p.  If that's what you mean there isn't enough info to help.  If you really mean P(x) = 2 and 3, then do the following:\n\nSolve for x in P(x) = 2 and 3\n\nReplace this variable in your Marginal revenue, which you've defined as R' = P'(x) which you found in (1) (or you'll have to recalculate if I misinterpreted your Revenue function).\n\nDo the same in the elasticity function, which you have not written down.

In the sense that gravity is defined as the force of attraction between two bodies, due to their mass, i.e.\n\nF = gm1m2/d^2..............(1)\n\nit would seem that there are only a few ways in which this force could become negative (i.e. repulsive rather than attractive).\n\n1. If there was a universe where g, the universal gravitational constant, was negative rather than positive (not in our known universe).\n\n2. If ONE of the masses was negative (again, not comprehensible in our universe).\n\n3. If the distance between the masses was imaginary. (again, not evidenced in our universe)\n\nSo, it would seem that anti-gravity would violate our current theories.\n\nIn answer to your question, however, no, I have not experienced anti-gravity with the Levitron. Besides it is NOT anti-gravity. Gravity still opposes the force generated by the Levitron, in balance with it.

Yes, considering santa always enters through a chimney (due to him being traditional), even if there is no fire place, he can enter through a microwave oven.  Houses that don't have fireplaces, generally have some sort of small vent which is essentially the chimney.  This would then generally lead to some sort of grating which would be far too small for a man to compress himself and fit through.  \n\nTherefore, santa must teleport.  His mass is converted into energy and then re assembles elsewhere.  Since microwave radiation is a form of energy, he can surely enter a home through a microwave oven

The answer x+2y+z is indeed the correct one if a wall with just three numbers at the bottom is considered, but the general principle can be expanded to a wall with any number of starting values. To see how, just extend the analysis a little:-\n\nFor a wall with one starting value, a, the overall total is clearly a.\n\nFor two start values, a and b, the total is a+b.\n\nFor three values, a b & c, the total is a+2b+c as already stated.\n\nThings start to get messy with four values, but bear with me! The second-row totals are a+b, b+c, c+d, giving third-row totals of a+2b+c and b+2c+d, and thus an overall total of a+3b+3c+d.\n\nJust one more example will help us to derive the general formula so here goes. Starting with abcde the successive totals are a+b, b+c, c+d, d+e then a+2b+c, b+2c+d, c+2d+e then a+3b+3c+d, b+3c+3d+e to give a final total of a+4b+6c+4b+e.\n\nStill with me? Well, if we now consider the numbers in front of the letters (called the co-efficients) and arrange them in a triangle we get:-\n\n....1\n...1 1\n..1 2 1\n.1 3 3 1\n1 4 6 4 1\n\nNotice anything about the numbers? Yes - each is the sum of the two above it. With this principle in mind we can now say that the next row will be 1 5 10 10 5 1.\n\nTo use the triangle to solve our original problem, we just need to find the row that has the same number of values as the number of starting numbers in the wall. We then construct an equation using the values in that row of the triangle as co-efficients, substitute the actual starting values from the wall and then work out the final result - easy! For example, if the wall started 1,2,3,4,5,6 we would take the row containing 6 co-efficients (the one we worked out after deriving the general principle) to give us the equation:-\n1x1 + 5x2 + 10x3 + 10x4 + 5x5 + 1x6 = 112\n\nThe above triangle was discovered long ago and is usually called Pascal's Triangle. It has importance in something called the binomial theorem, which you can find all about in Wikipedia (search for Binomial Theorem or Pascal's Triangle).\n\nGood luck with your wall building (but do tell your teacher how you found the answer!)

Energy (that includes light) can change form.  When light hits a black object for example, the atoms of the object absorb the light, then radiate it back off at a longer wavelength (we feel this as heat).  Plants collect light using their leaves and convert it into chemical energy (food for the plant).  Photocells convert light to electricity.
What's wrong with it is that every number has two square roots. The validity of the manipulation √(xy) →√x√y is derived from the equality (xy)² = x²y². However, this equality also holds for (-xy)², so all you can really say about √x√y is that it is equal to ±√(xy). Thus, all you have managed to prove is that -1=±1, which is true, since -1=-1.

Considering a drop can only keep it's consistency for only a few thousand feet, because it IS only water falling through air, you might be able to get a drop out of a cloud that could measure up to 4 or 5 ounces in volume, or big enough to fill the bottom of a regular glass with water up about 1 1/2 inches before it starts to break up and dissipate. \nFactors could be ceiling height (the bottom of the general cloud cover, that is), temperature, type of cloud, and wind resistance among other things I may not have thought of.\nBut, really, I don't think anyone would actually be capable of proving that.

Yes, with practice it is possible to visualize four dimensional objects. At first it is better to use analogy with lower dimensions. For example, a sphere in three dimensions consists of parallel stacks as follows: a point for the south pole; circles growing until the equator, then shrinking again until you have a point at the north pole. In exactly the same way, a sphere in four dimensions is a stacked collection of three dimensional *spheres*: a point at the north and south poles, spheres growing larger as you move north until the equator (the largest sphere), then shrinking again as you approach the north pole.\n\nAt first, we see the spheres as one sphere expanding and contracting, but if you practice a lot, you can begin to see the whole four dimensional sphere. Similar analogies can be done for 'cubes' in four dimensions and other figures. As others have pointed out, it is possible to use time to help the visualizations. But don't take the 'time is the fourth dimension' stuff too seriously in math. The physics time dimension has properties very different than another space dimension.
The 'electrical' activity of the brain is largely chemical, and is mostly unaffected by magnetic fields.  However, magnetic fields can be used as part of a system to measure what's happening in your brain.  These various scans are a medical diagnostic tool and also a research tool.  Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging can distinguish among differing tissue types.\n\nAnd no, magnetism and electrically are not the same.  They are interdependent, but are both independent of gravity.

"The space between the vocal cords is called the glottis. As the vocal cords vibrate, the resulting vibration produces a ""buzzing"" quality to the speech, called voice or voicing.\n\nSounds production involving only the glottis is called glottal. English has a voiceless glottal fricative spelled ""h"". In many accents of English the glottal stop (made by pressing the folds together) is used as a variant allophone of the phoneme /t/ (and in some dialects, occasionally of /k/ and /p/); in some languages, this sound is a phoneme of its own."

"Well, ""Phase"" is applicable to alternating current, or ""AC"", and describes the relative change in voltage around a central or ""neutral"" level. The term ""earth"" was derived from the potential ( or voltage) of the physical Earth on which we live. Since it is such a large mass, it's electrical potential is considered to be zero volts.\n\nNow, the power stations all generate electricity at a voltage which is relative to earth, and these days is generally of the AC variety (compared to DC, or Direct Current). Anyway, when the power lines are distributed from a power station, they are sent in pairs, one is ""active"" or ""live"" and the other is ""neutral"". The neutral line is connected directly to the earth at the power station. Now either the neutral wire or the physical earth (Earth) can be used as the return path to the power station. In damp earth conditions, the physical Earth does a great job, however in dry conditions, the neutral wire is best, even though there is a small resistance in the power cables back to the power station.\n\nSo, I guess, the difference between neutral and earth is the resistance of the power cables or the conductivity of the Earth.\n\nHope this is not too confusing!"

I think you are referring to POLYGENIC inheritance.  This is the concept of multiple gene expression.  Very simply, Mendelian genetics usually suggests one gene pair or allele for any given phenotype or trait.  However, humans are just a smidge more complicated than a pea plant.  Because of this there is not just one gene pair or allele that dictates eye color.  In fact there are a myriad of genes contributing to human eye color.  That is where the term polygenic comes in.  A person inherits lots of genes coding for a lot of things.  In this particular case a person inherits a lot of genes (polygenic) for one particular thing (eye color).

This question is from the Triola textbook, isn't it?!?\n\nIf the average temperature is 98.6 then u = 98.6 is the null hypothesis.\nThe opposite, u not equal to 98.6 is the alternate.\nWe will consider the null hypothesis disproven if your sample falls in the most extreme 1% of values - either the top 0.5% or the bottom 0.5%.\nTo cut 0.5% off the normal curve, use a z-score of +/-2.57.  (We only need -2.57 since the sample mean is below the null hypothesis mean).\nUse a standard deviation of 0.62/sqrt(106)=0.0602\nz = (x-u)/s\n-2.57 = (x-98.6)/0.0602\nx = 98.6 -2.57*0.0602\nx = 98.44\nis the lowest sample mean we would expect from a population with mean 98.6\nSince our sample mean is lower, we do not accept that the population mean is 98.6\nso we reject the null hypothesis.\nThe mean body temperature of healthy adults is not 98.6\n\nAre you at Nobles, by any chance?

There are no known planets that orbit 40 AU from the Sun. Neptune, the most distant planet, averages just over 30 AU.\n\nHowever, Pluto, a dwarf planet (which, somewhat confusingly, isn't a subcategory of planets), orbits between about 29-49 AU from the Sun, so it averages approximately 40 AU.
Binary is nothing more than powers of two. For example, the number 37 in decimal is 3 * 10 + 7. In binary, it would be 100101, which is 1 * 2^5 + 1 * 2^2 + 1, or 32 + 4 + 1. To convert a number to binary, you need to divide it by two, and then arrange the consecutive remainders in reverse order.

"From the book Dulce by Branton ..... The Feb.-Mar. 1991 issue of 'UFO UNIVERSE' carried an article titled 'THE DEEP DARK SECRET AT DULCE', written by Bill Hamilton and 'TAL' LeVesque. If planet earth is to be the central 'battleground' or staging-ground for a final cosmic battle between galactic superpowers, and if the U.S. is one of the major areas on earth where the 'final outcome' will be decided, and since the Dulce, New Mexico area is considered to be THE MAJOR BASING SITE where human - alien collaboration AND/OR conflict is taking place, then we should focus our attention on what has been going on deep beneath this small southwestern town. More than any other area in the U.S., if not the world... this small town has been the epicenter for nearly ever form of paranormal activity one can imagine, including: UFO sightings, UFO landings, Abductions, Implantation's, Human & Animal mutilations, PSI Warfare studies, Secret Government-Alien interaction, U.S. 'Constitutional' Government vs. Alien Agenda conflicts, 'Reptilian' sightings, Cryptozoological or Bioengineering phenomena [this was the general area where the  famous 'Cabbit', the half cat / half rabbit was captured], Underground bases, Conspiracy scenarios, Alien Infiltration, Deep-Cavern phenomena, Super High-Tech activity, & MIB encounters. In fact a higher CONCENTRATION of such activities has been evident in the vicinity of Dulce than any other area in the world, to the point that the inhabitants of this town have for the most part resigned themselves into acknowledging -- although not necessarily accepting -- the reality of such activity, whether they like it or not. \nBill Hamilton and 'TAL' Levesque take us 'inside' the Hadean-like labyrinths deep within this underground megacomplex, through the eyes of those who have actually been there, so brace yourselves: \n""Dulce is a sleepy little town in northern New Mexico. It's population is about 900 and it is located above 7,000 feet on the Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation. There is one major motel and just a few stores. It is not a resort town and it is not bustling with activity. Yet, according to a few outsiders, Dulce harbors a deep, dark secret. That secret is said to be harbored deep below the tangled brush of Archuleta Mesa. That secret involves a joint government-alien biogenetic laboratory designed to carry out bizarre experiments on humans and animals. \n""New Mexico State Police Officer Gabe Valdez was drawn into the mysteries of Dulce when called out to investigate a mutilated cow on the Manuel Gomez ranch in a pasture 13 miles east of Dulce. Gomez had lost four cattle to mutilations between 1976 and June 1978 (and SEVERAL more in ensuing years. - Branton) when a team of investigators which included Tom Adams arrived from Paris, Texas to examine the site of the carcass. \n""Curious as to how cattle were being selected by the mysterious mutilators, an interesting experiment was conducted on July 5, 1978 by Valdez, Gomez, and retired scientist Howard Burgess. The three penned up about 120 of the Gomez beef cattle and moved them through a squeeze chute under an ultra-violet light. They found a 'glittery substance on the right side of the neck, the right ear, and the right leg.' Samples of the affected hides were removed as well as control samples from the same animals. \n""Some investigators attribute the mutilations to aliens from UFOs. Sightings of strange lights and other aerial phenomena have been reported in many areas where the cows have been found at the time of the reported mutilation. UFOs have been seen frequently around Dulce. \n""I arrived in Dulce on April 19, 1988, to visit with Gabe Valdez and to inquire about the sightings, the mutes, and the rumors of an underground alien base in the area. There was still snow on the ground by the Best Western motel when I checked in and called"

What you have so far is correct. If the problem is asking for two-way distance (call it s) in terms of F, m and v, then you can substitute F/m for a: \ns = vt = v^2/a = mv^2/F\nNote the numerator is twice the kinetic energy, which checks because work = F*distance. The applied force F did .5mv^2 negative work for distance s/2 and the same magnitude positive work for s/2.\nI hope this is what you were looking for, since otherwise I don't know what your question is.

Jewels are used as the bearing surfaces for pivot points and gear axles. They are tiny precious stones.\nBecause they are so hard they do not require lubrication when polished.  \nIn mechanical watches there were always an odd number of jewels due to the single jewel in the escapement. Modern crystal oscillator types have no escapement so the low even number of jewels is because of the reduced number of pivots in the watch compared to old gear driven watches where jewels are used in pairs plus one for the escapement.\nMore jewels usually means a higher quality and more accurate watch.
Yes. A flow of electrons (an electric curent), an isolated proton or electron, or any isolated body with non-zero net charge such as a charged amber, creates an electric force field in the space around it according to Coulumb's Law.\nAccording to classical electromagnetics, a changing magnetic field creates an electric field.

First, calculate the force due to friction, F_f = uN, where u is the coefficient of kinetic friction and N is the normal force on the crate, which is equal to its weight.  In this case, N = mg, so F_f = umg.  The resultant force, F, on the crate will be the applied force, P = 49 N, less the force of friction.  So F = P - F_f = P - umg.  The acceleration is found by using the formula F = ma, or a = F/m, where we were given the mass m and we calculated the resultant force F.

It is a long way from Star Trek, but teleportation - the disembodiment of an object in one location and its reconstruction in another - has been successfully carried out in a physics lab in Australia. \nScientists at the Australian National University (ANU) made a beam of light disappear in one place and reappear in another a short distance away. \n\nWhen physicists teleported photons for the first time in 1997 they had to destroy the photons to be sure that the teleportation had been successful. Now a team at the University of Vienna has managed to teleport photons without destroying them. Jian-Wei Pan and colleagues believe that their method could be the next step towards long-distance quantum communication (J-W Pan et al. 2003 Nature 421 721).\n\nIn quantum teleportation the sender, normally called Alice, instantaneously transfers the quantum state of a particle to a receiver, called Bob. In most experiments so far Alice has teleported the quantum state of a photon - defined in terms of its polarization - to Bob. The photon itself is not transferred: rather Bob’s photon acquires exactly the same polarization as Alice’s. The uncertainty principle means that Alice cannot know the exact state of her photon, but another feature of quantum mechanics called “entanglement” means that this is not an obstacle to teleporting the state to Bob. \n\nQuantum entanglement essentially allows two particles to behave as one, regardless of how far apart they are. Photons can be entangled so that if one is vertically polarized, for instance, then the other photon in the pair is always horizontally polarized. \n\nIn a standard teleportation experiment a laser is directed at a crystal with nonlinear optical properties. Occasionally the photon will be “down-converted” into two lower energy photons, and sometimes these photons will have their polarizations entangled. In a teleportation experiment the beam is reflected back through the crystal to sometimes produce a second pair of entangled photons. By convention the photons in the first pair are labelled 2 and 3 (for mode 2 and mode 3), and those in the second pair are 1 and 4. Photons 1 and 2 are directed to Alice, photon 3 is sent to Bob and photon 4 is used as a trigger. A variety of mirrors, beamsplitters and polarizers are used to direct the photons to four detectors labelled D1, D2, D3 and T (for trigger). \n\nThe aim of the experiment is to transfer, or teleport, the polarization of photon 1 to photon 3. This is normally done by making a joint measurement on photons 1 and 2 which changes the polarization of the latter in such a way that photon 3 - which is entangled with it - always acquires the same polarization as the first photon. In other words the quantum state of photon 1 - which was unknown to Alice - has been teleported to photon 3. \n\nThe experiment was set up such that detectors D1, D2 and T all register photons at the same time when teleportation takes place. However, under certain circumstances - the emission of two photons each into modes 1 and 4 - it is possible for the same three detectors to register events even though there is no photon in mode 3 to teleport to. These spurious events mean that the D3 detector must also register - and destroy - a photon to be sure that teleportation has taken place. \n\nBy using a filter to reduce the intensity of the photons that are going to be teleported the researchers were able to significantly reduce the number of spurious detection events. The Vienna team could be 97% certain that the state had been teleported to photon 3 without actually having to detect it. Such a high accuracy means that the teleported photons could be used in “quantum repeaters” for long distance communication. The team now hopes to combine these results with a technique known as “entanglement purification” to further develop quantum communication over long distances.\n\n\n\nThe achievement confirms that in theory teleportation is possible, at

Hi. Every junk car with a catalytic converter has a bit.
I am an old air craft engine mechanic so things may be a little different now.\nThey use an alternator to generate the AC voltage for the aircraft.\nThe alternator on your car produces AC current and with the use of diodes changes it to DC.\nThe reason for using AC is that the voltage can be changed very easily with a transformer and with a diode to DC to operate just about any kind of electonics.
?
Yes they can. Actually it is a method for inserting plasmids into bacteria called electroporation. \nHowever it does depend on more factors than just the voltage (like the resistance of the medium, amperage of the current) so I cannot really give you the value of lowest voltage that would kill the cells.

The phenotype of an individual organism is either its total physical appearance and constitution or a specific manifestation of a trait, such as size, eye color, or behavior that varies between individuals. Phenotype is determined to some extent by genotype, or by the identity of the alleles that an individual carries at one or more positions on the chromosomes.\n\nThe genotype is the specific genetic makeup (the specific genome) of an individual, in the form of DNA. Together with the environmental variation that influences the individual, it codes for the phenotype of that individual. Non-hereditary mutations are not classically understood as representing the individuals' genotype. Hence, scientists and doctors sometimes talk for example about the (geno)type of a particular cancer, thus separating the disease from the diseased.
Three essential elements form the core of the bonding process, the rubber, the bonding agents and the substrate, figure 1. The selection of the polymer base and the associated compound depends mainly on the product specification. Provided that the rubber can flow into the mould without developing a significant level of cross-linking (less than 2%), a bond can be formed using any rubber compound. There are no restrictions on the use of particular compounding ingredients, although it is best to avoid substances that will bleed rapidly to the surface of the uncured stock. The rubber Compounder therefore needs to concentrate attention to matching the physical requirements of the cured rubber and the processing needs of the moulding process.

"The Yellow River has special importance in the origins of the Chinese civilization. It is referred to as ""the Mother River"" and ""the Cradle of the Chinese civilization"" by Chinese. Traditionally, it is believed that the Chinese civilization originated from the Yellow River basin areas.\n\nDuring the long history of China, the Yellow River has been considered a blessing as well as a curse and has been nicknamed both ""China's Pride"" (Zhōngguó de Jiāoào) and ""China's Sorrow"" (Zhōngguó de Tòng). Records indicate that, from 602 BC to present, the river's course made at least 5 major large-scale changes in direction and its levees were breached more than 1,500 times. A major course change that took place in 1194 took over the Huai River drainage system throughout the next 700 years. The mud in the Yellow River literally blocked the mouth of the Huai River and left thousands homeless. The Yellow River adopted its present course in 1897 after the final course change occurred in 1855. Currently, the Yellow River flows through Jinan, capital of the Shandong province and ends in the Bohai Sea.\n\nThe river gets its yellow color mostly from the fine-grained calcareous silts originated from the Loess Plateau which are carried in the flow. Centuries of silt deposition and diking has caused the river to flow above the surrounding farmland, making flooding a critically dangerous problem. Flooding of the Yellow River has caused some of the highest death tolls in world history, with the 1887 Huang He flood killing 900,000-2,000,000 and the 1931 Huang He flood killing 1,000,000-3,700,000. In 1938, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Nationalist troops under Chiang Kai-Shek broke the levees holding back the Yellow River in order to stop the advancing Japanese troops. The river at that time flooded a huge area and the floodwaters took some 500,000-900,000 lives.\n\nAnother historic source of devastating floods was the collapse of upstream ice dams in Inner Mongolia with their accompanying sudden release of vast quantities of impounded water. There have been 11 such major floods in the past century, each causing tremendous loss of life and property. Nowadays, explosives dropped from aircraft are used to break the ice dams before they become dangerous.\n\nSometimes the Yellow River is poetically called the Zhuo Liu (濁流), or the ""Muddy Flow."" The Chinese expression ""when the Yellow River flows clear"" is similar to the English expression ""when hell freezes over.""\n\nSome of the known flood defenses used in ancient times were the building of ditches, walls (dams), levees, and rebound channels to route floodwaters around a blockage. The main problem was that the solutions were local and sometimes the dams were too small and weak for the impact. If the river broke down the defenses, it would cause far more damage than if no levees had been built.\n\nCharacteristics of the Yellow River\nThe Yellow River is notable for the amount of silt it carries, amounting to 1.6 billion tons annually at the point where it descends from the Loess Plateau. If the river is running to the sea with sufficient volume, 1.4 billion tons are carried to the sea. In modern times, since 1972 when it first went dry, the river has gone dry in its lower reaches, from Jinan to the sea, in most years, in 1997 for 226 days. The low volume of the river is due to increased demands on the river for use in irrigation which has increased by a factor of five since 1950. Water diverted from the river by 1999 served 140 million people and irrigated 74000 km² of land. Highest volume occurs during the rainy season, from July to October, when 60% of the volume of the river flows. Water for irrigation, on the other hand, is needed between March and June. In order to capture excess water for use when needed and for flood control and electricity generation several dams have been built, but due to the hi"

"Fatigue or desensitization.  The sense of smell acts as a warning sign (as does sound and site).  If you are exposed to an awful smell (such as your baboon) and you choose to ignore it, your body soon tires of sending the ""this stinks, lets get away message"" and you literally do not ""smell"" it any more.  Just like having a ticking alarm clock by your bed.  The first night all you here is tick,tick,tick,but soon you don't notice until it stops. But if you are exposed to a chemical that 'numbs' your sense of smell, well then that is self explanitory. case in point. Hydrogen Sulfide, that rotten egg smell, will desensitize your sense of smell.  H2S is toxic and you die if you breath it. People (in mines for example) because they would smell H2S ""Oh no lets get out of here"" and then say ""never mind I don't smell it anymore"", and die.

"The brilliance scale of stars is called magnitudes.  It runs backwards (a star of magnitude 1 is brighter than a star of magnitude 3).  A difference of 5 on the magnitude scale is a factor of 100x in brightness.\n\nNormally, the faintest stars we can see with the unaided eye is magnitude 6.  Some people can see 7 and (in very rare cases) 8.  In town, I feel lucky when I can get down to 4.\n\nLet's say that you can see down to magnitude 6 and that your pupil has a diameter of 7 mm (varies with age and other factors).\n\nThen a 70 mm telescope has a diameter 10 times that of your eye's pupil.  This means that the area of the telescope's objective lens is 100 times that of your pupil (area varies as the square of the diameter).\n\nThe 70 mm telescope then gathers 100 times more light than your unaided eye (and concentrates it in your eye).  Since it makes stars appear 100 times brighter, you should gain 5 steps on the magnitude scale.  In theory, if you see down to magnitude 6 with your eyes, you should see stars down to magnitude 11 with the telescope.  In practice, other factors limit the gain so maybe you'll get to magnitude 9 or 10.\n\nThe diameter also affects ""discrimination"": the ability to separate features that are very close.  Discrimination varies as the diameter, so the image seen through a 70 mm telescope should be 10 times ""crisper"" than with the eye only.  For example, some stars that appear as single with the eye, could be seen as double in the telescope."

"It depends, and it isn't just because of gravity....granted that determines that there is a landslide but it could be because of water seepage, causing the land mass to ""Slump"", also they can happen because of volcanoes that spew out so much lava that there is a huge chasm underneath where it used to be causing the cliff/mountain to just collapse. They don't just happen in one specific area. Although mountainous regions is always a good place to find them."

Essentially the dust particles are in orbit around the sun in the same orbit as the comet (though they do respond to light pressure so it is slightly different) and the gas/plasma tail always streams directly away from the sun.
"This is a question in the arenas of philosophy, psycology and sociology - not biology.  But, here's my opinion.  See also Popper and Kuhn (or is it Kuhne?)\nThe publishing process (assuming peer review - this is NOT always the case!) is intended to ask the tough questions about the way the data was obtained.  The peers are experts who have learned (the hard way) many of the pitfalls and errors which can cause errors in the data.  So, before the evidence is published there is usually several reviews of it (again this ignores the problem of prepublication and on-line publishing).  Some of the analysis attempts to be unbiased but some is clearly subjective.  That is, there is more tendency to accept for publication a paper if the author's name Albert Einstein than if it is Joeseph Stalin.  Pedigree is important.  Number of papers published, thesis advisor, number of citations, institutional affiliations, likeableness (really!), personal acquaintance, awards, prestige,and more all play a part.  Also data which confirms the reviewers opinions also has more tendency to be given a cursory review.\nGenerally the peer review process is expected to determine the quality of the data AND the quality of the interpretation, a most daunting task given that generally all that is known is on paper or in a file in front of the reviewer.  No video tapes of the Ah Hah! moment, no printouts of the calibration history, nothing about how the data was ""really"" acquired.  Thats why there is so much emphasis placed on the trust the editor and reviewers have of the author(s).  Thats why PhD diplomas are often a required part of the pedigree.  Error and fraud still slips through.  The recent S Korean stem cell fiasco, and the failure of the Atmospheric and Earth Science community to realize the OBVIOUS fact that data from satellites is biased if orbital decay is not fully accounted for.\nBoth of these failures were at the editorial peer review stage.  BUT!!\nAfter publication the REAL peer review begins.    Scientists are highly opinionated.  Any data contradicting their pet opinions will be (hopefully) subject to intense review.  Character assination, name calling and fist fights also happen, unfortunately.  The process goes as follows.  Paper is read.  Then the data is studied.  Perhaps questions to the author are sent, others are enlisted.  Sometimes more data or raw data is requested.  Visits to labs (if the scientists are still speaking to one another) are scheduled.  Attempts may be made to duplicate the data (not publishable, so IF it is done it is done with MS or undergraduate talent).  Additional experimentation is done based on the scientists analysis of the paper's implications or flaws or both.\nAt the same time Letters may be written to the Journal's Editors if the scientist believes that there is a substantial error in the paper be it in the data or (more often) in the interpretation.  Many times the Letter is a criticism that the author did not take into account other data (did not cite or address it).  Feelings are hurt, careers are made or broken.\nSo, to answer your question:\n1.  Scientists agree on some data - some of which is wrong\n2.  Scientists disagree on data - lots of which is right.\n3.  Scientists often suspend judgement on data (and interpretation) until there is a preponderance of evidence (data) which is consistent with that data (replication and/or confirmation of the same or similar results or additional experiments which rely on (or contradict) the interpretation (falsifiability) presented by the author).\n4.  Motivated scientists work to confirm or contradict the paper's interpretations, depending on which ""side"" they are on."

The tilt of the earth's axis (relative to the plane of its orbit around the sun) causes the seasons. If it were tilted more, the seasonal changes would be more pronounced.\n\nIn our winter (in the northern hemispher), when the northern hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, a smaller fraction of the area north of the equator is illuminated by the sun, our days are shorter, and the sun is lower on the horizon. All of these factors result in receiving less of the sun's heat during the winter. (This is also true during the fall, but the winter is colder because the northern hemisphere has already been cooling off during the fall, so by the time winter starts (around December 21), we really start missing the sun's warmth.)\n\nIf the earth were tilted more than 23.5 degrees, then the sun would light an even smaller percentage of the northern hemisphere in the winter, would appear even lower on the horizon, and the days would be even shorter. So winter would be colder and darker.\n\nBut in our summer (and spring), the opposite would occur. The sun would rise higher in the sky, would be up for more hours each day, and would illuminate a larger percentage of the northern hemisphere. In fact, if the earth's axis were tilted 90 degrees to its orbit, then on the day of the summer solstice, every place in the northern hemisphere would have 24 hours of sunlight, and the sun would be directly over the north pole all day. Think what THAT would do for melting the polar icecap. And of course the same thing would happen in the southern hemisphere 6 months later, while the entire northern hemisphere was in the dark for the entire 24 hours.\n\nBottom line: Greater tilt means greater seasonal changes.

"Here's one way to look at it:\n\nIce is water where the molecules are moving so slow that they can not overcome the hydrogen bond holding molecules to their neighbors. \n\nHeat is kinetic energy. As you transfer kinetic energy to the H2O molecules in the ice they have enough momentum to escape the potential energy well created by the hydrogen bonds.\n\nImagine the potential wells as half-pipes, and the H2O molecules as skateboarders. As you add ""heat"" you are really speeding up the skateboarder. Once the skateboarder is ""hot"" enough, he can roll all the way up the half-pipe and out. As you heat the ice, more and more of the molecules become free of their ""half-pipes"" they can skate all over the place, and become liquid."

The speed of light is the same as that of all electromagnetic waves.The velocity of the EM wave does not change (in vacuum), and we know that the frequency of the EM wave, f is a function of the velocity v and wavelength, w\n\nv = fw\n\nSince v is constant, a shorter wave length will produce a spectrum of light with greater frequency.

Cc or cc\n\nthus, curly-eared cannot be a recessive trait in this case
Thermal insulation of a building refers to the walls, windows, and doors (anything exposed to the outside elements and atmosphere), and their ability to restrict the passage of heat from the inside out or outside in.  All materials are measured in terms of R value, or thermal resistance.  When calculating the amount of heat allowed to transmit through a wall, window, door, or other building component, the formula to use is Q=UA(Toutside - Tinside) where\n\nQ= the amount of heat transfered expressed in Btus/hr\nU=thermal conductance of building component that the heat is trying to pass through, also U = 1/R\nA= surface area of wall that makes up that component\nToutside = outside air temperature\nTinside = inside air temperature\n\nEach different type of material or component has different abilities to restrict the flow of heat.  Mainly it is due to the amount of air within the component (air within a building wall is a bad transmitter).  What insulation trys to do is break up the wall into numerous small air pockets.  Heat has to first raise the temperature of the first pocket before it can heat up the pocket next to it.  This occurs over and over until there is not enough heat to keep heating up air pockets.  Fiberglass insulation has millions of these air pockets and therefor makes a great insulator.  Stone (brick) or metal on the other hand has none so after you heat up the material, the heat then can begin to heat up the next thing to it, probably the atmosphere.\n\nSo a material with a high R value restricts the flow of heat more than that of one that has a low R value.  Window, since they are normally made up of one or two panels of glass typically are the highest point of heat loss/gain within a structure.  The worst types are the ones constructed of just a single pane of glass.  More high efficient ones are made of glass that has a greater propensity to heat up, and also have a vacum between two panes of glass.  \n\nThere are many types of thermal insulating products available.  See the attached website for a short list.  Mainly the walls are constructed with rolled-insulation (R-19 where the number denotes the R value) up to R-38 rolled-in insulation.  There are sprayed-in the wall cavity insulations where the R-value can be as high as 48.  \n\nThe main type of insulation is not just the insulation, but the type of construction of the wall.  Wall constructed of plywood over 2x4's with rolled in insulation have a lower thermal insulating value than those with Brick over plywood over 2x6's since you can put more insulation within the 2x6 cavity.  As you can see, the type of wall is also very important.

Meiosis takes place in two stages: Meiosis 1 and Meiosis 2.\nAt the end of meiosis 1, you have two haploid cells with double stranded chromosomes.\nAt the end of meiosis 2, you have four haploid cells with single stranded chromosomes.\n\nCrossing over- the stage of meiosis that allows for genetic variability- occurs when the chromatids form tetrads during prophase 1 of meiosis.  This is the only stage that this is able to take place.\n\nSexual reproduction has the benefit of genetic variability.  The coding that will most help the offspring is passed on more frequently than the coding that would give it no selective advantage.\nAsexual reproduction makes exact copies- it would take longer for the organism to adapt to a change in the environment, as it would have to mutate.  This could be very bad for the organism, as the species may die off before the mutation in the genes takes place.
Where is the angle Θ?  Is it at the origin, or is it one of the sides of the trapezoid?\n\nEdit: from your description, it sounds like Θ is at the origin.  And the point at the upper right of the trapezoid would be (x,y).  This point is also (sin(Θ), cos(Θ))\n\nYou have an isosceles trapezoid formed by the points (1,0), (x, y), (-x, y), (-1, 0).  And x = cos(Θ), y = sin(Θ).\n\nThe area of a trapezoid is given by the formula:\n(b1 + b2)/2 * h\n\nIn your case:\nBase 1 goes from from (-1,0) to (1,0) for a length of 2.\nBase 2 goes from (-x,y) to (x,y) for a length of 2x or 2 cos(Θ).\n\nSo the average of these two:\n (2 + 2 cos(Θ))/2\n= 1 + cos(Θ)\n\nAnd the height is y or just sin(Θ).\n\nSo putting it all together, a formula for the area of your trapezoid is:\n\nf(Θ) = sin(Θ) * (1 + cos(Θ) )\n\nAs requested, there is part (a)...\n\nFor part (b) ... take the derivative and set it to zero.  You will get a Θ between 0° and 90° (π/2 radians)... I suspect that the maximum area will be at Θ = 60° (π/3 radians).  Just thinking about it visually, that would be the top half of a regular hexagon...

Be wary of the tech aspect to these degrees they will limit your abilities.  The tech aspect is usually associated with a two year degree and pretty much means that you will be limited to being a technician.  If you are looking for that type of work then the electronics would definitely be the better of the two.  The electronics will open you up to a lot of industries that the cannot.  Plus the pay will usually be a little bit higher.  I would suggest however going all the way with either of the degrees.   You would still be able to do the tech work if you want but the actual engineering R/D type work would also then be available.  I am currently an electrical engineer and know quite a few people who have been limited by that tech part of their degree. \n\nI hope this helps

How's this for a proposal. \nMaybe time travel is possible, but when you travel back or forward in time, the Earth doesn't travel with you. Therefore, you will remain at the same place but the Earth will move in its orbit away from you at 30 km/s, or won't have arrived there yet. The sun would not be in the same place either, it would have moved in its orbit around the centre of the galaxy at about 240 km/s, etc. \n\nUnless we have a way of taking into account the very real movement of the Earth and Sun through space, even a displacement of a few minutes would put us out in space, or well beneath the Earth's surface.\n\nStill think it is possible to travel in time?
The balanced reaction is:\nCaC2 + 2H2O ---> C2H2 + Ca(OH)2\n\nThe molar mass of CaC2 is 64 g/mol so you are starting with 0.5 moles of calcium carbide.  Since water reactions with CaC2 is a 1:2 ratio, you will need twice as much water, or 1.0 moles of water = 18 grams of water.
The first part of the formula is knowing how many watts the appliance uses. The old standard light bulb is the easiest to find out. Just look on the top of the incandescent bulb and it will say: 60, 75 or 100 watts. With appliances you may have to do an extra step. On the back or bottom of the appliance will be a label or plate with data on it. If the watts used are not shown, find how many Amps the appliance uses. Once you know the Amps you can calculate the watts used.\n\nThe formula for finding out how many watts that are being used is: Amps multiply Volts equals Watts

ok...here goes...I'm going to rival all these answers and I would like someone to give me their opinion as this is opinion.\n\nAt high altitude the body knows there is lower o2 levels. So, kidney function increases..causing more frequent urination. This in itself although maybe initially one would become immebriated would rid the body of alcohol faster.\nAlso the body is instructed to increase rbc production to facilitate more oxygen distribution to cells and organs. This would also reason that alcohol although more readily absorbed would be excreted out of the body faster.\nIt is also known that it takes approximately 2 weeks to acclimate to a different climate. So, while it might make sense that intoxication would occur more rapidly initially, one would summise that after acclimation it would be no different

It depends on the rate of decomposition.  Example:  In warm moist areas the body will decompose quickly since bacteria thrive in those conditions. However, in dry or cold conditions, decomposition will take a bit longer.  I have seen a picture of a elephant seal that died in the tundra over 300 years ago  and it is still not decomposed.

Well there are these things called tectonic plates in the earth's crust. They are constantly being moved by the magma in the mantle. Sometimes two of these plates collide. Now the two plates can do one of three things:\n1) create faults : faults are when the two plates are grinding past each other in opposite directions. Sometimes the tension there can cause earthquakes.(San Andreas Fault)\n\n2)Fold: when the two plates are moving toward each other and are the same weight they fold upwards and create ridges like mountains (Himalayan mts)\n\n3) subduction: if one of the two plates is less weight than the other the one with the lesser weight sinks below the other and eventually melts into magma.

Exothermic and endothermic indicate if the reaction produces or requires energy to take place. It has to do with whether the products have lower or higher energy (respectively) than the reactants.\n\nThe rate of the reaction depends on several factors (like nonscientific mentions). In terms of energy, the rate or reaction and the activation energy are associated via the Arrhenius equation k=A*e^(-Ea/RT).\n\nSo in fact the rate of the reaction will depend on the height of the activation energy (that peak you see in the potential energy diagrams for reactions). It doesn't matter where the level of the products is, only the height of the peak.\n\nA very nice example is the reaction of H2 and O2. As we all know it is extremely exothermic but if you just mix 2 volumes of H2 and 1 of O2 practically nothing will happen. The activation energy is so high that the reaction occurs at an extremely low level and too slow pace for you to see it happening. If you light a match you provide enough energy for several molecules to overcome the high activation energy. Because the reaction releases large amounts of heat this helps more molecules overcome the energy barrier and thus you have a violent (in a way autocatalytic) reaction, leading to an explosion.

You are absolutely right---there is a balance between energy in and energy out from the Earth that keeps the total energy content of the Earth (and therefore its temperature) approximately constant.\n\nThe energy inputs are:\n1) Solar heating, primarily at wavelengths between 0.5 microns and 2 microns.\n2) radioactivity inside the Earth---this keeps the interior molten and powers volcanos\n3) kenetic energy from meteorite imacts.\n4) kenetic energy of solar wind particles\n5) plasma waves in the ionosphere, excited by the solar wind\n6) absorption of high-energy particles (cosmic rays) from the Sun, the Galaxy, and extragalactic sources.\nOf these, the first is by far the most important.\n\nThe energy outputs are:\n1) Radiation by the Earth's atmosphere at wavelengths between 5 microns and 100 microns.\n2) Reflection of sunlight from clouds and water\n3) Evaporation of gasses into interplanetary space from the upper atmosphere.\n4) plasma waves in the ionosphere.\n5) a small neutrino flux emitted by radioactive processes inside the Earth\nOf these, the first is by far the most important, and it is sensitive to the amount of greenhouse gases, CO2 in particular.

The required input data for this ? is:\nmass of object\nshape of object\nsize of object\nair density = f(altitude)\n\nI assume we are talking about the terminal velocity, which will not actually be constant, but vary with altitude.\n\nThe shape and size will determine the drag coefficient, Cd.  Cd for various shapes are found in aerodynamic texts.  The aerodynamic drag formula is\nD = Cd*(ρV²/2)*A   where ρ is the density, V the velocity, and A is the reference area the Cd is based on.\nThe driving force for the motion is simply mg, the weight of the object.  At terminal condition, D = mg, and the above eqn becomes\n\nmg = Cd*(ρV²/2)*A  --->V² = 2mg/(Cd*ρ*A)\n\nTo give you some numbers to play with, the Cd of a teardrop shaped object is in the neighborhood of 0.10 based on its cross sectional (┴ to direction of travel) area.  Air density @ 10Kft = .001758 sl/ft³ and at sea level =.00238 sl/ft³.  You can assign any mass and area you like to put in the eqn.  Area is in ft² and mg is pounds.  Velocity will be in feet /sec.\n\nGOOD LUCK!

To observe something you have to see it with photons,but when the photons reflect from the particles you are observing they impart a change in momentum and change its position!

I think the scientific jury is still out on that one, but in my unscientific opinion, the answer is obvious: as the human male brain developed and evolved, so did its sense of beauty which began to include women, and women without facial hair just began to look more beautiful to men than those with it.\n\nIt was and is just one more way to differentiate women from men so to allow the 2 sexes to be attracted to each other.\n\nThat's why homosexuality is so unnatural.\n\nThink about it, if men and women looked almost the same, what would attract us to each other?\n\nIt is our differences that attract the 2 sexes, not similarities.

"The earliest type of medicine in most cultures was the use of plants (Herbalism) and animal parts. This was usually in concert with 'magic' of various kinds in which: animism (the notion of inanimate objects having spirits); spiritualism (here meaning an appeal to gods or communion with ancestor spirits); shamanism (the vesting of an individual with mystic powers); and divination (the supposed obtaining of truth by magic means), played a major role.\n\nThe practice of medicine developed gradually, and separately, in ancient Egypt, India, China, Greece, Persia and elsewhere. Medicine as it is practiced now developed largely in the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century in England (William Harvey, seventeenth century), Germany (Rudolf Virchow) and France (Jean-Martin Charcot, Claude Bernard and others). The new, ""scientific"" medicine (where results are testable and repeatable) replaced early Western traditions of medicine, based on herbalism, the Greek ""four humours"" and other pre-modern theories.[citation needed] The focal points of development of clinical medicine shifted to the United Kingdom and the USA by the early 1900s (Canadian-born)Sir William Osler, Harvey Cushing). Possibly the major shift in medical thinking was the gradual rejection in the 1400's of what may be called the 'traditional authority' approach to science and medicine. This was the notion that because some prominent person in the past said something must be so, then that was the way it was, and anything one observed to the contrary was an anomaly (which was paralleled by a similar shift in European society in general - see Copernicus's rejection of Ptolemy's theories on astronomy). People like Vesalius led the way in improving upon or indeed rejecting the theories of great authorities from the past such as Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna/Ibn Sina, all of whose theories were in time almost totally discredited. Such new attitudes were also only made possible by the weakening of the Roman Catholic church's power in society, especially in the Republic of Venice."

This is to do with the length of the Loops of Henle in the medulla of mammalian kidneys.\nThe loops work as countercurrent multipliers providing a relatively high concentration of solutes deep in the medulla. Long loops generate a very high solute concentration relative to general body tissues and this promotes the reabsorption of water from the glomerular filtrate.\nA desert rat has very long Loops of Henle.\nI'll let you work out the rest!

".  The atoms in the pencil are in motion, but not freely in motion.  The atoms are bound up in molecules which make up crystaline or cellular structures.  The metal atoms in the eraser holder are part of the metal crystaline matrix.  The carbon and other atoms of the eraser are parts of organic molecules which form strands which are interlinked.  The carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms of the wood are parts of cellulose molucules which formed the cell wall of the tree from which the wood was taken.  The ""lead"" of the pencil contains carbon molecules in fractured crystals of graphite, which are mixed with clay, which contains silicon, aluminum and oxygen in a crystaline structure.\n.  If you picture a ping pong ball tethered by a weak rubber band and knocked around by a mild shifting breeze, the ping pong ball would be ""free"" to move, but the rubber band would keep it moving about the same center.  A stronger breeze might have enough energy to break the rubber band and let the ping pong ball be blown wherever the wind goes.\n.  Atoms are of just the size that puts them on the brink of quantum mechanical uncertainty.  They are large enough that the uncertainty about their position is very small, even when their energy is know to a high degree of precision.  In quantum mechanics, this means that the amount they will wander is quite small, small enough that they remain bound to their neighbors in their molecular or crystaline arrangements.  Adding energy in the form of heat both increases the uncertainty about their position and increases the probability that their bonds will be broken."
Earth Quake energy is seimic waves.  \n\nIf the composite of the region is dense and solid these waves can travel further and effect a much larger area.\n\nConversely, if the region is less dense and not solid, these waves will be absorbed and the range of the Earth Quake will be limited.\n\nTo test this, use a table, a large book, a glass of water and a box of cat litter.\n\nSet the box of cat litter on the next to the glass, and slam the book as hard as you can into the kitty litter while your partner watches the water.\n\nNow switch remove the cat litter and repeat with the book hitting the solid table.\n\nYou should see the the water was more disrupted in the second experiment than in the first.
The intrinsically brightest star known is S Doradus, a star in one of the Magellanic Clouds.  It is so far away that it can only be seen with a telescope, and in fact probably no longer exists, since its distance of 180,000 light years exceeds its estimated life expectancy of 160,000 years.  However, you would have needed to be 0.11 lightyear from it to have the same insolation as the Earth gets from the Sun.  Of course, a larger percentage from S Dor would be in the form of ultraviolet, enough to kill in a few hours.  Not recommended for tourist visits by the Galactic Chamber of Commerce.
"The properties of an atom depend ultimately on the number of electrons in the various orbitals, and on the nuclear charge which determines the compactness of the orbitals. In order to relate the properties of the elements to their locations in the periodic table, it is often convenient to make use of a simplified view of the atom in which the nucleus is surrounded by one or more concentric spherical ""shells"", each of which consists of the highest-principal quantum number orbitals (always s- and p-orbitals) that contain at least one electron. The shell model (as with any scientific model) is less a description of the world than a simplified way of looking at it that helps us to understand and correlate diverse phenomena. The principal simplification here is that it deals only with the main group elements of the s- and p-blocks, omitting the d- and f-block elements whose properties tend to be less closely tied to their group numbers. \n\nIn particular, the number of outer-shell electrons (which is given by the rightmost digit in the group number) is a major determinant of an element's ""combining power"", or valence. The general trend is for an atom to gain or lose electrons, either directly (leading to formation of ions) or by sharing electrons with other atoms so as to achieve an outer-shell configuration of s2p6. This configuration, known as an octet, corresponds to that of one of the noble-gas elements of Group 18."

In a gas, the molecules are spaced further apart, and move more quickly than in a liquid. Therefore, in a given space occupied by a gas and a liquid, the gas would contain less molecules than the liquid, making it less dense.

"Comets are, in the phrasing of astronomer Fred C. Whipple, ""dirty snowballs"", that is, they are made of ices (CO2, H2O, frozen NH3 and CH4) with a mixture of various carbons and silicates to make a lump.  Most comets travel in extremely elongated orbit, and spend most of their time far from the Sun (if they din't, the ices would evaporate, and you are left with a meteor shower).\nAsteroids are chunks of rock and metallic material that can be nickel-iron (about 20%), silicate (about half), a mix of nickel iron and silicate (20%) or carbonaceous material (10%).  While the majority of asteroids are found between Mars and Jupiter, there are many known that fall outside those limits.  Some asteroids are known to have their own very small moons."

Simply put: the nervous system is an electrical system.\n\nMore complexly put:  the nervous system is an electro-biochemical system where electrical signals are transported down the neuron to a synapse.  At the synapse, a chemical or hormone neurotransmitter is released.  This neurotransmitter binds to receptors on the nerve downstream, and activates an electrical current which continues to propagate to it's destination.\n\nThe difference between a functioning nerve and a functioning wire... functionally speaking... is none.  Structurally speaking, a wire is made of a conductive metal, surrounded by an insulating sheath of rubber or plastic.  A nerve cell, or neuron, stretches out long processes, called axons, to conduct electricity through the body.  It's insultation is provided by another type of cell, called the Schwann cell.  The Schwann cell, is composed of lipids (fats) which insulate the neuronal axon.

Christina is wrong. When you drop something, it is already rotating along with the earth, and continues to do so as it falls, for there is nothing to stop it.\n\nIn fact, the real Coriolis effect DEPENDS on the fact that an object dropped, or thrown, or shot out of a gun, is rotating along with the earth. Consider this. A spot on the equator is rotating eastward at about 1,000 miles per hour. Places north of that are rotating eastward slower than that. Places near the north pole are rotating eastward very slowly. A circle around the north pole having a circumfrence of 24 miles is rotating eastward at 1 mile per hour.\n\nIf you position a gun on the equator, the bullet contained therein is travelling eastward at 1,000 miles per hour, along with the gun. If you shoot the gun northward, the bullet wlil travel over land that is travelling eastward slower than 1,000 miles per hour. The bullet, however, will continue to travel eastward at 1,000 miles per hour because there is nothing to stop it. The bullet will appear to have an eastward force applied, but there is no such force.

I assume you mean flying gnats. I would use a bug spray. You can go to the store and buy a product called Off that you can spray yourself with and it will keep the bugs away. Just make sure you don't buy On by mistake. A friend of mine did that one time and he was covered in bugs inside ten seconds. Try not to wear dark clothing, they like dark clothing, and avoid being out in the grass during dusk when they are the most active, like with mosquitoes, very similar. There's also special candles you can burn that the smoke drives the bugs away. Unless you really did mean flying nets, which I've never heard of, in which case you could perhaps use fire to destroy the nets which should get rid of them.

You should have been able to find this in any good organic chemistry text.  The number of methods makes listing each one too long for the format of this forum.\n\nThe sites below should give you all of the information that you need:
1. This message occurs when a subaddress is configured. When this subaddress is combined with the X.121 address of the interface, the total address exceeds the limit of 15 characters.\n\n2. The X.25 configuration of the interface is not valid. The existing configuration was not changed.\n\n3. You have attempted an invalid configuration.\n\n4. A virtual circuit has been set up using the default maximum packet sizes, but the data terminal equipment (DTE) and data communications equipment (DCE) are not configured with the same default values. A packet was received that had the M-bit set, signifying that more data follows, but the packet did not carry the maximum number of bytes allowed. Such partial data packets must have the M-bit cleared. The resulting loss of a message boundary might cause problems for the data recipient.\n\n5. An internal software error has occurred.\n\n6. A stacker compression algorithm internal error or a shortage of buffer space was encountered during a compression operation.\n\nNote: This error should never happen.\n\n7. An internal software error has occurred.\n\n8. You have used an invalid configuration ID.\n\n9. The default packet sizes or outgoing packet size facility values of the interface are too large to be carried by Link Access Procedure, Balanced (LAPB). The router will negotiate lower packet size values automatically.\n\n10. A decompression buffer was not available for an incoming compressed packet. This message is a warning only (the compressed packet was not lost). However, an X.25 packet layer RNR (wait) was generated, and packet-level transmission on the logical channel number (LCN) will not resume (RR issued) until a decompression buffer becomes available.\n\n11. An incoming X.25 call specified a protocol that was assigned to a multiprotocol map; the virtual circuit (VC) will not be able to carry the full set of protocols specified by the map.\n\n12.

Nice ideas, but do they keep you up at night? I prefere to think of life as something that may not last, so I go ahead and enjoy it as much as possible. If there is an afterlife, yippee. If not, then I've spent the time I had well. I sleep well at night.
"(there is a stray ""+"" before the ""="" in the first equation -- I'm going to assume it is just a typo and should not be there)\n\nWhat you have is a system of simultaneous equations.  The assumption is that for some value of each of the variables (x, y, and z) all of these equations will be true -- so that this combination of values is the ""solution"" to the system of equations.\n\nThere are two basic techniques used to solve such a system.  The first is through substitution, the second through addition.  Sometimes, the best approach is a combination of both:\n\nWe have 3 equations, all of which are assumed to be true for the ""solution"" values of x, y, and z:\n\n(1): x - 2y + 3z = 9\n(2): -x + 3y = -4\n(3): 2x - 5y + 5z = 17\n\nNow if we look at equation 2, we see it only involves 2 of the 3 variables, x and y.  This means we can re-write it to express each variable in terms of the other:\n\n-x+3y =-4\n-x = -4 - 3y\nx = 3y + 4\n(2a): x = 3y + 4  <<< x defined in terms of y\n\n-x+3y =-4\n3y = -4 + x\ny = (x-4)/3\n(2b): y = (x-4)/3 <<< y defined in terms of x\n\nEquation 2a is definitely cleaner, so SUBSTITUTE that into the other two equations (solving or in this case simplifying by substitution):\n\n(1): x-2y+3z+=9  <<<< Original equation\n3y + 4 - 2y + 3z = 9 <<<< substitute ""3y+4"" for x\ny + 3z + 4 = 9  <<<< combine like terms\ny + 3z = 5 <<<< remove 4 from each side of the equation\n(1a): y + 3z = 5\n\n(3): 2x-5y+5z=17  <<<< Original equation\n2(3y + 4) - 5y + 5z = 17 <<<< substitute ""3y+4"" for x\n6y + 8 -5y + 5z = 17 <<<< distribute the multiplication\ny + 5z + 8 = 17  <<<< combine like terms\ny + 5z = 9 <<<< remove 8 from each side of the equation\n(3a): y + 5z = 9\n\nNow, what happens if we subtract ALL of the terms from equation 1a from ALL of the terms in equation 3a?\n\n. (y + 5z = 9)\n- (y + 3z = 5)\n------------------------\n. (y-y) + (5z-3z) = (9-5)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n2z = 4\n\nTherefore z = 4/2\n\nz = 2  <<<< solution for z\n\nGreat!  Now we have one of the three values solved.  To get the others, first SUBSTITUTE that value AND the definition of x in terms of y (equation 2a) back into either equation 1 or equation 3:\n\n(1): x-2y+3z=9\n3y + 4 - 2y + 3(2) = 9\n3y - 2y + 4 + 6 = 9\ny + 10 = 9\ny = 9 - 10\ny = -1 <<<< solution for y\n\nFinally, substitute that value for y back into equation 2 in order to solve for x:\n\n(2): -x + 3y = -4\n-x +3(-1) = -4\n-x -3 = -4\n-x = -1\nx = 1 <<<< solution for x\n\nNow we have values for x (1), y (-1), and z (2).  All we need to do is check our answers to make sure that these values hold true in all three original equations:\n\n(1): x - 2y + 3z = 9\n1 - 2(-1) + 3(2) = 9 ?\n1 - (-2) + 6 = 9?\n1 + 2 + 6 = 9 ?\n9 = 9 ? *** YES ***\n\n(2): -x + 3y = -4\n-1 + 3(-1) = -4 ?\n-1 + (-3) = -4 ?\n-1 - 3 = -4 ?\n-4 = -4 ? *** YES ***\n\n(3): 2x - 5y + 5z = 17\n2(1) - 5(-1) + 5(2) = 17 ?\n2 - (-5) + 10 = 17 ?\n2 + 5 + 10 = 17 ?\n17 = 17 ? *** YES ***\n\nThe values check out for all of the equations, so that is the correct solution."
I'm not going to give you the answers, because you can really work them out for yourself.\n\nYou need to work out the molecular weight, which is just the sum of the atomic weights in the appropriate proportions. Say that works out to be 100 for a particular molecule: that means that 100g of the substance contains 1 mole (6.022 x 10^23) molecules - so 1 gram contains one hundredth of that, or 6.022 x 10^21 molecules.\n\nApply that to each of the molecules in your questions, and you'll be home and dry.
"How many amino acids are there?  These are the ""monomer"" units, although they're not true monomers since they don't repeat much.  \n\n""R"" symbolizes ""other stuff"" bonded to the peptide functionality.  Different amino acids have different atoms for ""R"".  \n\nCalories per gram depends on the specific material.  I would expect fats to contain the most, since they are mostly C and H, followed by carbohydrates, followed by proteins.  I could be wrong, though."
This paradigm is the plot for lots of movies, (Back to the Future, Somewhere in Time, Dr. Who, etc). however it's not a question worth considering because time travel isn't physically possible nor will the advancement of technology ever make time travel possible.\n\nHere's a couple of reason's why:\n\n1.  If time travel was possible, it would make logical sense that we would have had 'vistors' from the future already.  I'm sure they would have loved to come back and 'fix' a few things.\n2.  The physcial science will not allow it based on time itself.  For you see.. time is relative to the object and/or observer.  This is the addtion to Einstien's theory of relativety where as time consided by Einstein was a set unchangeable measurable 'dimension'.  In fact, time is not only 'bend able' but time is relative and different for each observer.\n\n2.  Now let's talk about 'Imaginary Time'.  This is a proven physic theory that states that each object/person has it's own 'normal time' in which their 'journey' has progressed but their history is unknown because their 'travel' could have gone down multiple paths to reach the point they are at today.\n\n3.  Now let's talk about the physical location.  So.. you want to go back 70 years.  You get this machine set up in your back yard that can time in an instant to 70 years ago.  Poof!  Your sitting out in the middle of space wondering where the oxygen is!   For you see.. not only is the earth spinning and rotating and wobbleing at a somewhat non uniform rate... it's also rotating around the sun... while spinning around the galaxy ... while the galaxy is blasting through space at a million miles and hours.  Your machine would have to be able to calculate exactly where the earth was in it's rotation, wobble, orbit and location in space.  Trow in the time factor... and your screwed.\n\nSorry.. no need to worry our brains about this kind of paradigm as it's not possible now.. nor will be in the future.\n\nHope this helps!

"I attribute evolution to Natural Selection of favorable variations.\n\nCharles Darwin wrote ""Origin of Species"" (""On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life"").  This book took previous thoughts on evolution, including those advanced by his grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, and put the ideas together in a stunning statement that put the variation of life in context.\n\nAnimal breeders long knew how to breed for favorable traits (artificial selection).  Darwin explained that nature, in an undirected manner, would tend to select for those lines that had a subtle advantage over longer spans of time."

"A variant of the wound field DC motor is the universal motor. The name derives from the fact that it may use AC or DC supply current, although in practice they are nearly always used with AC supplies. The principle is that in a wound field DC motor the current in both the field and the armature (and hence the resultant magnetic fields) will alternate (reverse polarity) at the same time, and hence the mechanical force generated is always in the same direction. In practice, the motor must be specially designed to cope with the AC current (impedance must be taken into account, as must the pulsating force), and the resultant motor is generally less efficient than an equivalent pure DC motor. Operating at normal power line frequencies, the maximum output of universal motors is limited and motors exceeding one kilowatt are rare. But universal motors also form the basis of the traditional railway traction motor. In this application, to keep their electrical efficiency high, they were operated from very low frequency AC supplies, with 25 Hz and 16 2/3 hertz operation being common. Because they are universal motors, locomotives using this design were also commonly capable of operating from a third rail powered by DC.\n\nThe advantage of the universal motor is that AC supplies may be used on motors which have the typical characteristics of DC motors, specifically high starting torque and very compact design if high running speeds are used. The negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the commutator. As a result such motors are usually used in AC devices such as food mixers and power tools which are used only intermittently. Continuous speed control of a universal motor running on AC is very easily accomplished using a thyristor circuit, while stepped speed control can be accomplished using multiple taps on the field coil. Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave DC with 0.707 of the RMS voltage of the AC power line).\n\nUnlike AC motors, universal motors can easily exceed one revolution per cycle of the mains current. This makes them useful for appliances such as blenders, vacuum cleaners, and hair dryers where high-speed operation is desired. Many vacuum cleaner and weed trimmer motors will exceed 10,000 RPM, Dremel and other similar miniature grinders will often exceed 30,000 RPM. A theoretical universal motor allowed to operate with no mechanical load will overspeed, which may damage it. In real life, though, various bearing frictions, armature ""windage"", and the load of any integrated cooling fan all act to prevent overspeed.\n\nWith the very low cost of semiconductor rectifiers, some applications that would have previously used a universal motor now use a pure DC motor, usually with a permanent magnet field. This is especially true if the semiconductor circuit is also used for variable-speed control.\n\nThe advantages of the universal motor and alternating-current distribution made installation of a low-frequency traction current distribution system economical for some railway installations. At low enough frequencies, the motor performance is approximately the same as if the motor were operating on DC. Frequencies as low as 162/3 hertz were employed."
Also see the web portals given in the references.\n\nA beam of infra-red light is produced and split into two separate beams. One is passed through the sample, the other passed through a reference which is often the substance the sample is dissolved in. The beams are both reflected back towards a detector, however first they pass through a splitter which quickly alternates which of the two beams enters the detector. The two signals are then compared and a printout is obtained.\n\nA reference is used for two reasons:\n\nThis prevents fluctuations in the output of the source affecting the data \nThis allows the effects of the solvent to be cancelled out (the reference is usually a pure form of the solvent the sample is in)

This is best understood in terms of them both being on the borderline between metals and non-metals - in particular, the fact that their oxides are acidic.\nBoron is quite different to silicon in respect of the fact that its simple covalent compounds are electron-deficient, that is they only have six electrons in the outer level. Thus they are strong Lewis acids.\nSilicon can accept electron pairs, but only by expanding its valency octet.
Ethidium bromide (EB) is an intercalating dye extensively used to induce demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) (1). Demyelination follows the disappearance of neuroglial cells, chiefly astrocytes, in the early hours of intoxication (2,3). The death of astrocytes makes a breach in the glial-limiting membrane through which Schwann cells invade the CNS and repair the lost myelin sheaths (4,5).\n\nNaked axons receive new myelin sheaths built by invading Schwann cells and remaining oligodendrocytes - the latter along the unaffected living tissue (2). Morphological recognition of the new sheaths is based on the thickness of the sheath and on the presence of a Schwann cell wrapping the axon and surrounded by a basal lamina associated with collagen fibers (1).\n\nThe peripheral nervous system (PNS) differs from the CNS in fundamental aspects, i.e., histological composition (6) and regenerating capacity (7,8). In addition, Schwann cells are considered extremely industrious (9) and highly resistant to a broad span of spontaneous and experimental injuries (10). The aim of the present study was to observe Schwann cell reaction to local single and multiple EB injections and to document peripheral nerve responses to multiple challenges with the drug in order to validate this intoxication as an experimental model of demyelination in the PNS.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nMaterial and Methods \n\nThirty-four adult Wistar rats of both sexes were maintained in individual polypropylene cages, with free access to ration and water. The rats were divided into five groups and submitted to intraneural EB injections (Table 1). Two animals from each group received an intraneural saline injection. Stance, gait and social behavior were recorded daily.\n\nDemyelination was induced by single or multiple injections of 1 µl of 0.1% EB in 0.15 M saline along 8 mm on the middle third of the left sciatic nerve. The multiple injections were made at 28-day intervals. All injections were made with a Hamilton syringe and the animals were anesthetized with fentanyl/hypnomidate (Johnson & Johnson, São José dos Campos, SP, Brazil). The localization of the lesions was facilitated by a stitch in the adjacent semitendinous muscle.\n\nThe rats were sacrificed by an ether overdose and samples of the sciatic nerves were removed. The samples were collected 7 and 15 days after injection from the rats that received a single injection (group 1), and 10 days after injection from the rats submitted to multiple injections.\n\nThe samples were cut into three transverse fragments for light and transmission electron microscopy studies. All samples were washed with PBS, fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer for 48 h, post-fixed in osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions, and embedded in Epon 812 resin. Semi-thin sections were obtained with a Reichert Super Nova ultramicrotome with glass knives, stained with methylene blue and observed under a Meiji 2000 light microscope. Thin sections were made with diamond knives, stained with uranyl and lead salts and studied under an EM10 Zeiss transmission electron microscope operated at 60-80 kV.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nResults \n\nThe rats injected with EB did not show any changes in either stance or gait during the experiment.\n\nThe localization of the lesions was facilitated by the stitch on the adjacent semitendinous muscle although a mild thickening of the epineurium was visible to the naked eye. This thickening was due to collagen proliferation observed in all lesions. Although some variation was detected, most of the lesions were 5-8 mm in length. All lesions showed segmental demyelination and extensive remyelination by Schwann cells.\n\nAfter intraneural injection of EB, Schwann cells showed signs of intoxication with a vacuolated cytoplasm and rejection of the mye
A clear cloudless day-time sky is blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light.  When we look towards the sun at sunset, we see red and orange colours because the blue light has been scattered out and away from the line of sight.\n\nThe white light from the sun is a mixture of all colours of the rainbow.  This was demonstrated by Isaac Newton, who used a prism to separate the different colours and so form a spectrum.  The colours of light are distinguished by their different wavelengths.  The visible part of the spectrum ranges from red light with a wavelength of about 720 nm, to violet with a wavelength of about 380 nm, with orange, yellow, green, blue and indigo between.  The three different types of colour receptors in the retina of the human eye respond most strongly to red, green and blue wavelengths, giving us our colour vision.\n\nTyndall Effect\nThe first steps towards correctly explaining the colour of the sky were taken by John Tyndall in 1859.  He discovered that when light passes through a clear fluid holding small particles in suspension, the shorter blue wavelengths are scattered more strongly than the red.  This can be demonstrated by shining a beam of white light through a tank of water with a little milk or soap mixed in.  From the side, the beam can be seen by the blue light it scatters; but the light seen directly from the end is reddened after it has passed through the tank.  The scattered light can also be shown to be polarised using a filter of polarised light, just as the sky appears a deeper blue through polaroid sun glasses.\n\nThis is most correctly called the Tyndall effect, but it is more commonly known to physicists as Rayleigh scattering--after Lord Rayleigh, who studied it in more detail a few years later.  He showed that the amount of light scattered is inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength for sufficiently small particles.  It follows that blue light is scattered more than red light by a factor of (700/400)4 ~= 10.\n\nDust or Molecules?\nTyndall and Rayleigh thought that the blue colour of the sky must be due to small particles of dust and droplets of water vapour in the atmosphere.  Even today, people sometimes incorrectly say that this is the case.  Later scientists realised that if this were true, there would be more variation of sky colour with humidity or haze conditions than was actually observed, so they supposed correctly that the molecules of oxygen and nitrogen in the air are sufficient to account for the scattering.  The case was finally settled by Einstein in 1911, who calculated the detailed formula for the scattering of light from molecules; and this was found to be in agreement with experiment.  He was even able to use the calculation as a further verification of Avogadro's number when compared with observation.  The molecules are able to scatter light because the electromagnetic field of the light waves induces electric dipole moments in the molecules.\n\nWhy not violet?\nIf shorter wavelengths are scattered most strongly, then there is a puzzle as to why the sky does not appear violet, the colour with the shortest visible wavelength.  The spectrum of light emission from the sun is not constant at all wavelengths, and additionally is absorbed by the high atmosphere, so there is less violet in the light.  Our eyes are also less sensitive to violet.  That's part of the answer; yet a rainbow shows that there remains a significant amount of visible light coloured indigo and violet beyond the blue.  The rest of the answer to this puzzle lies in the way our vision works.  We have three types of colour receptors, or cones, in our retina.  They are called red, blue and green because they respond most strongly to light at those wavelengths.  As they are stimulated in different proportions, our visual system constructs the colours we see.\n\nResponse curves for the three types of cone in the human eye\n\nWhen

"Consider that every number after the nth is bounded between x_n and x_(n+1). Therefore, the maximum distance between any two terms after the nth is |x_(n+1) - x_n|, which is 1/(n+1). Since for every ε>0 there exists an n such that 1/(n+1)<ε, this sequence is cauchy.\n\nEdit: ""Now, to prove a sequence is cauchy, you cannot assume a relationship between m and n (ie m=n+1) because the required inequality abs(xn-xm)<epsilon must hold for ALL n,m>=N""\n\nI'm not. I specifically said that _every_ term after the nth is between x_n and x_(n+1). Not that A term after the nth is, that EVERY term is. This is easily proven by induction - first we show that second term after the nth is in the interval [x_n, x_(n+1)] or [x_(n+1), x_n] (x_(n+1) trivially is, since it is an endpoint of the interval), then we suppose that x_(n+m) and x_(n+m+1) are in [x_n, x_(n+1)] or [x_(n+1), x_n], and deduce from this that since x_(n+m+2) lies between x_(n+m) and x_(n+m+1), both of which are already stipulated to lie in [x_n, x_(n+1)] or [x_(n+1), x_n], that x(n+m+2) also lies in that interval. Thus by induction, all terms lie in that interval. The maximum distance between any two numbers in an interval of length L is L, so any two elements after the nth lie closer than 1/(n+1).\n\nI had hoped that you would be able to fill in the missing part of the proof yourself (where you show that all elements after the nth lie between x_n and x_(n+1)), on the grounds that it's intuitively obvious, but tedious to prove. What I didn't expect is for you to fail to read the part where I specifically said EVERY term after then nth and instead give me an insulting lecture about definitions I learned four years ago. I'm sorry I treated you like you were an intelligent human being."
"The inventor, Otis Charles White, was a practicing Dentist in Massachusetts during the days when gas lamps were the top lighting technology. At that time, because there was no source for quality adjustable lamps, Otis White invented and built the first ""gas"" lamp fixture designed specifically for his own use in Dentistry. In the 1880's, Edison incandescent electric lamps began to quickly replace gas lighting. A true visionary in his own field, Doctor White set out to redesign his medical specialty gas lamp fixture by adapting electric components to his fixture. Doctor White understood that Dentistry and other procedures required a special light source that could be easily, quickly, and reliably directed and locked upon the important area of need. Doctor White was familiar with this special requirement because of his early experiments with his first gas Dentist's lamp. He put his skill and attention to detail, and the popularity of his new electric ""Dentist's"" light became the talk of the industry. Colleagues began to request it. To keep up with this new growing demand, Doctor White founded the O.C. White Company in 1894. Immediately O.C. White Company became famous, known worldwide as the maker of the finest professional adjustable specialty lighting fixtures in the 1890's.\n\nFeatures and details: this specialty lamp fixture has a superbly detailed cast iron Victorian base that is approximately eight inches square and three inches high. The base is accented with a beautifully proportioned round two inch cast brass transition ring made in a classic embossed floral design. The smooth brass stem is 1.5"" diameter and 7"" tall up to the second transition. The stem vertical extension is a 10"" x 5/8"" diameter ""barber pole"" brass rope. At the top of the barber pole stem is a brass ball. The adjustable ""boom"" arm has the O. C. White solid cast iron adjustor equipped with their trademark heavy 1.5"" diameter iron knob (cast with eight individual 3/8"" balls equally spaced around the circumference). The adjuster allows the boom arm to be set at a desired angle and moved up and down the vertical stem to change height. The end of the boom arm has a second adjuster made of solid cast iron used to angle the lamp socket. The socket base is furnished with a secondary brass arm that supports the brass lamp hood. The hood shrouds the Edison lamp socket and light bulb. The solid brass hood has a craftsman hammered embossed festoon filigree accent and is attached via a scalloped self tensioned adjustment hinge that allows the illuminating light to be fine tuned and directed as needed. This extraordinary lamp fixture stands 24"" tall is 24"" long and 8"" wide."

This is a rather confused question which has nothing to do with biology. In fact, it's a question about chemistry. You are asking about energy levels of *atoms*, it seems. But what is your questiion?
The 'poly' you are referring to is polyvinyl chloride. It has a number of advantages over iron.\n1. Iron corrodes (rusts) and requires painting every few years to protect it.\n2.  Iron is heavy and so heavier stronger brackets and support is needed and will be physically more difficult to put up.\n3.  Polyvinyl chlride is much easier to cut to any required length.\n3.  Polyvinyl chloride is cheaper than cast iron

It's Jahn-Teller effect, not John Teller.\n\nJahn-Teller distortions occur for transition metal complexes where by distortion of the molecule can result in a lower energy state for the molecule.\n\nIn transition metal chemistry, bonds from ligands to the central metal atom are coordinate covalent, i.e. both electrons come from one atom.  The orbitals which contain those electrons bond with usually the dz2 and dx2-y2 orbitals from the metal, but are lower in energy, so the orbitals based on the metal are essentially anti-bonding orbitals.  The dxz, dyz, and dxy orbitals are mostly non-bonding orbitals, but their energies do go up somewhat upon bonding interaction.  In a typical octahedral bonding arrangement, the dz2 and dx2-y2 are degenate, as are the dxz, dyz, and dxy orbitals (they have the same energy).  In certain electron configurations (the classic example is d9), if the system can make those orbitals non-degenerate by lengthening or shortening bonding interactions along a certain axis, it can lower the overall energy by putting electrons in lower energy orbitals, which is why you will often see Cu2+ complexes where some bond distances are longer than others.
Thermal cameras work in the infrared not in UV.  There are cameras that can sense temperatures below -10 C.  \n\nHowever, these are expensive and require special lens material.  At such long wavelengths glass is no longer transparent.  Materials like germanium (an opaque metal in visible light but transparent in far infrared) are used to make lenses.  \n\nThe cameras also require cooling.  You can imagine that a warm camera trying to see -10C would just see itself.  The lens and the CCD array will glow and wipe out the image unless they are cooled to well below -10C.\n\nThe signal from the cold object is also very weak so the cameras electrical noise becomes a big issue requiring more sophisticated electronics.\n\nThese concerns make such cameras very expensive.

Student #1 represents a factor of 1... in other words, he opens all 1000 lockers (that have 1 as a factor)\nStudent #2 represents a factor of 2... in other words, he toggles all lockers that have 2 as a factor (2, 4, 6, 8, etc.)\nStudent #3 represents a factor of 3... he toggles all lockers that have 3 as a factor...\n\nNow think of a specific locker, say #12.  It has the following factors:\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\nThat's an even number of factors, opened, closed, opened, closed, opened, closed.  So it will end up closed.\n\nTry another locker, say #20.  It has the following factors:\n1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20... again an even number of factors, so it will end up closed.\n\nIn fact, most numbers have an even number of factors.  Generally factors pair up... so for 20 you have:\n1 x 20 = 20\n2 x 10 = 20\n4 x 5 = 20\n\nThe exceptions are the *perfect squares* because they end having one number that doesn't pair up (except with itself).\n\nSo locker #1, for example.  The only factor is 1, so it is open.\nLocker #4, has factors of 1, 2, 4 which is odd.  So again it is open.\nLocker #9, has factors of 1, 3, 9 which is odd.  So again it is open.\nLocker #16, has factors of:\n1 x 16\n2 x 8\n4\nOdd number of factors, so it will be open.\n\nThe answer is only the lockers that are *perfect squares* will be open.  Specifically the open lockers are:\n1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400, 441, 484, 529, 576, 625, 676, 729, 784, 841, 900 and 961.

ATP is generated by the gradient of H+ ions, and then used to power all of the cells basic functions (DNA replication, protein synthesis, membrane synthesis), as well as any specialized functions (contraction in muscle cells, hormone synthesis and secretion, neurotransmitter packaging and release in neurons).  ATP is generated as its needed.
There are only two relevant forces acting on the blocks. The force exerted by the spring which is pushing them apart, and the frictional force which is opposing the spring force.\n\nThe kinetic coefficient of friction is K\n\nThe Spring force = (3.85Newtons/meter)(0.08meters) = 0.308 Newtons\n\nThe frictional force on the left block = (9.8 Newtons/kg)(0.25kg)K = 2.45 K Newtons\n\nThe frictional force on the right block = (9.8 Newtons/kg)(0.50kg)K = 4.90 K Newtons\n\nThe initial acceleration of each block is initial force/mass. Note that the spring force on each block must be greater than the frictional force, or the block wont accelerate (acc=0).\n\nFor the left block, acceleration = (0.308 - 2.45 K) / 0.25\n\nFor the right block, acceleration = (0.308 - 4.90 K) / 0.5\n\nLets plug in the 3 different Ks\n\nk = 0, left block acc. = 1.23 m/s^2, right block acc. = 0.61 m/s^2\nk = 0.1, left block acc. = 0.25 m/s^2, right block acc. = 0.0 m/s^2\nk = 0.462, left block acc. = 0.0 m/s^2, right block acc. = 0.0 m/s^2
Torque is not just force times lever arm length.  It is the lever arm length times the component of force that is perpendicular to the said lever arm.  Also, counter clockwise torques will be positive and clockwise torques will be negative (right hand rule).\n\nFor instance, the torque caused by the 30N force that is located at 5 cm radius and is oriented at 45 degrees would be computed as follows:\n\ntorque1 = (0.05 m) * (30 N) * sine (45 degrees) = 1.0606 Nm\n\nThis torque is positive because it tends to rotate the wheel in a counterclockwise direction.\n\nNotice that there is a force that is oriented radially outward from the disk.  This will have no torque associated with it since there is no component of that force that is perpendicular to the lever arm.  In this case, since the line of the force includes the center of the disk, this force will not cause the disk to rotate.\n\nThe other torques are pretty straightforward:\n\ntorque2  = (.26m) * (-30N) = -7.8 Nm\n\nThis torque is negative since it tends to rotate the wheel in a clockwise direction.\n\ntorque3 = (.05m) * (24N) = 1.2 Nm\n\nNow we just sum up all the torques acting on the disk to get the net torque:\n\ntorque1 + torque2 + torque3 = 1.0606 Nm  -7.8 Nm +1.2 Nm = -5.53  Nm
The resolution of an imaging system is limited by diffraction. The image of a point source, such as a star, has an angular size that is proportional to the wavelength of the light or radio waves, divided by aperture. Light waves are around 500 nanometers (500 x 10^-9 meters), while radio astronomy is typically done at wavelengths of a few centimeters (n x 10^-2 meters). So a radio telescope would have to be around 100,000 times the size of an optical telescope to achieve the same resolution. \n\nRather than build impossibly huge radio dishes, radio astronomy uses synthetic aperture techniques, combining the signals from widely separated dishes to get the resolution of a single dish the diameter of the separation.

ok...well here is a detailed explaination\n\nfirst you need to conver 8 1/4 to an improper fraction,\nin general this means:\na b/c = (a*c +b)/c\n\nin your case \n8 1/4 = (8*4 +1)/4 = (32+1)/4 = 33/4\n\nthen you need to do the same for the second fraction\n5 1/2 = (5*2 +1)/2 = (10+1)/2 = 11/2\n\nnow you have the following\n33/4 -11/2\n\nwell to add this you need to have common denominators (bottoms of the fractions), to do this you need to find the smallest number that both 4 and 2 go into...in this case both of these numbers go into 4...(4*1=4 and 2*2=4)\n\nnow you need to get that second fraction to have a denominator of 4...to do this you notice that 2*2 is 4 so we need to multiply that second fraction by 2/2 (so the top and bottom of the fraction is multiplied by 2.  you would wonder why the top and bottom...the reason is because 2/2 =1  and we can multiply a number by  1 and it doesnt chage its value...we are just making 1 look funny so we can get the same denomintors\n\nnow ...\n\n11/2 * 2/2 = (11*2)/ (2*2) = 22/4 ( we recall we multiply the two top numbers and the two bottom numbers respectively)\n\nnow do your subtraction now that we have common denomintaors\n\n33/4-22/4 = (33-22)/4 (here we only subtract the numerator (top))\n\nso 11/4 is our answer\n\ni hope this helps....\nmatttlocke

A fascinating history, but you haven't yet asked the question. You really can't run out of characters. Just use the Edit question/Add details option on this question to continue, and then I can edit my answer. \nIt looks like, in addition to the question(s), some information is missing like what the braking force was, or what the cars' masses are. Put all the facts in. \nSo far we know:\nV1a (car 1's velocity before braking) = 20 m/s.\nV1 (car 1's velocity before collision) is unknown.\nV2 (car 2's velocity before collision) = 0 m/s.\nVFinal (velocity of both cars after collision) = 10 m/s.\nEDIT: Now we're on track. Call the mass of each car m. Working backward and using conservation of momentum, 2*m*VFinal=m*V1+m*V2, so V1 = (2*m*VFinal-m*V2)/m = 2*VFinal - V2 = 2*VFinal = 20 m/s. So car1 actually didn't do any braking! Are you sure 20 m/s was the velocity before braking?\nI'm going to go ahead assuming the 20 m/s was after braking. Going (actually coasting) down the hill, car 1 would have picked up 25*m*g N-m of energy, but we don't know its velocity V0 at the top of the hill so we don't know its total energy at the bottom of the hill. If V0=0, its velocity would be found from the potential-to-kinetic energy of the hill: 0.5*m*v^2 = 25*m*g, so v = sqrt(50*g) = 22.14 m/s. Then the energy removed from the car by the braking =  0.5*m*22.14^2-0.5*m*20^2 = 0.5*m*(22.14^2-20^2). In the collision the car1 energy loss = 0.5*m*20^2-0.5*m*10^2, and the car2 energy gain = 0.5*m*10^2.\nThe above assumes that the actual scenario was that car1 had zero velocity at the top of the hill and braked down to 20 m/s rather than going 20 m/s before braking. Respond with more info if these assumptions are wrong.\n2ND EDIT: Car1 had 200,000 N-m energy before the collision  and then lost 150,000 N-m, and car2 had no energy and gained 50,000 N-m. Energy wasn't conserved in the collision. Only elastic collisions conserve energy, and if 2 cars collide and don't bounce apart it's not elastic. In fact real collisions bend metal and break things, and this converts mechanical (kinetic) energy to heat energy.

One thing you could do to get an idea of a reasonable minimum age is do tests to quantify erosion rates for moving water over various rock strata, then estimate how long it takes to cut out something like the grand canyon.  The age could of course be much more than this.\n\nAnother method might be to measure the depth of silt on the ocean floor.  Believe it takes about a thousand years to deposit one inch.  Again, just looking for a minimum.  Ice cores in Antarctica can also take you back millions of years by counting up the annual layers.
"Indeed some do as stated above, usually due to the accretion forces of a supermassive black hole, like the 200,000 solar mass one at the center of our galaxy, or the 2,000,000 solar mass one at the center of galaxy M87. Surrounding them are dead stars in the form of dwarves, or even some very ancient population II stars.\n\nA few things that were incorrectly stated, are that galactic rotation CAN be measured, but it is immensely slow (we are talking one rotation across maybe a couple hundred million years or so, for small galaxies).  Considering that our average-sized milky way is 35,000 light years across, travelling linearly down the center, it would take our sun (going 60,000 km/h) 630,000,000 years to reach the other side. Since it is travelling circularly, it would take something closer to a billion or so years. Likely our solar system has completed about one or two ""galactic years,"" but it is a slow, slow process.\n\nFurthermore, not all galaxies rotate, however. Newer galaxies, such as clusters, have no center point nor supermassive black hole, so they are for the most part stationary in terms of rotation.\n\nThe blackhole at the center of our galaxy, as I state above, is closer to 200,000 times the mass of our sun, not the giant underestimation of 1000 times as stated above.\n\nAnd despite what is says below there isn't a ""blackhole at the center of our universe."" They are the centroids of galaxies, not the universe. There is no central, universal rotation point as such. Also the explanation below fails to explain why galaxies are denser in their centers - and even then some aren't. Yet the user still complains about other answers' inaccuracies..."

An increase in pressure causes the boiling point to go up. Think about it like this, at higher pressures, the molecules will be pushed closer together, to the point where intermolecular attractions become significant and the vapor condenses to form a liquid. It takes more energy (i.e. higher temperature) to allow the molecules to break free into the gas phase.\n\nThis is also why the boiling point of water is less at high elevations; there's less pressure, so it's easier to make water boil.\n\nAnother thing to note: The boiling point is defined as the point where the vapor pressure of the substance equals the surrounding pressure. Since vapor pressures generally increase with increasing temperature, an increase in surrounding pressure raises the temperature needed to maintain that equality.

Tooth enamel is naturally white.  Animals that have discolored teeth get that way because of the things they eat.  Generally animals with permanent teeth (mammals) that eat vegetable matter will have the most discolored teeth due to the tannins (same substances that make coffee and tea stain human teeth) in plants.\n\nAs there is nothing in flesh to stain teeth (blood doesn't stain enamel) carnivores tend to have whiter teeth.  \n\nBut with sharks (and other animals that constantly shed their teeth) the teeth never have the chance to get stained as they are replaced so often.

Actually, according to the leading theory, the moon was created when an object approximately the size of Mars collided with Earth and blasted material into orbit, which then coalesced to create the moon. To answer the question though, the moon is actually slowly moving away from us. Some moons that are in retrograde orbit, like Triton (of Neptune) will eventually lose altitude and plunge into the planet's atmosphere. Earth is safe from this fate.

I think it has something to do with side effects of too much of a certain neurotransmitter.  I've heard the term used to reference side effects of a drug (Aricept?).  This drug inhibits the activity of acetylcholinesterase.  This leads to a build-up of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Side effects of this effect are as follows:  S- excess salivation.  L- something involving tear production (can't remember the word) U- excess urination, D- Diarrhea.  The other D I'm not sure about.  Check on that definition for the word.  Good Luck!

The answer requires you to make an assumption about the relative probability of an apprentice compared to a non-apprentice getting injured.  If the chances are equal and independent, then the answer is simply 1/binomial(3,16) = 3!x13!/16!= 1/(7x5x16)\n\nIf the probability of an apprentice being in the wrong place at the wrong time is higher than a non-apprentice, then one can assume that the probability is somewhere between 1/560 and 1.
Mauna Kea is the tallest mountain on Earth as measured from base to summit, with a total height of 10,203 meters (33,474 feet). The base of Mauna Kea on the floor of the Pacific Ocean is 5,998 meters (19,678 feet) below mean sea level and its summit is 4,205 meters (13,796 feet) above mean sea level.\n\nMauna Loa is the most voluminous mountain on Earth with a volume of 74,000 cubic kilometers (17,800 cubic miles), enough material to fill the Grand Canyon more than 18 times. Though 35 meters (116 feet) lower than neighboring Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa is the most massive mountain on Earth.\n\nThe summit of Mount Everest is the highest point on the Earth's surface as measured from sea level at 8,850 meters (29,035 feet) above the Geoid.

"Purely in terms of numbers, sunspots vary with a cycle that is about 11yrs on average, known as the Schwabe cycle. One can't be any more precise than ""about 11yrs"" as the cycle varies somewhat, primarily due to fluctuations in the magnetic field of the sun. A more ""geeky"" answer is 22yrs, however (the Hale cycle), as the magnetic field of the sun reverses polarity each Schwabe cycle and so it takes 22yrs to ""get back to where we started"". This makes no difference to mere humans, as sunspots look the same to us in each phase, but if you were Superman with super-vision perhaps it would!"
Your two basic algebraic equations are:\nmoles Na + moles K = moles Cl \n(g Na+) + (g K+) + (g Cl-) = 6.4100 g\n\nThe mass of the final precipitate means that there are 7.50921 x 10-2 mol of chloride ions present in the initial mixture.\nSee:\nmol Cl = mol AgCl = g AgCl/MW AgCl = 12.7559/169.87 = 7.50921 x 10 -2 mol\n\nThe mass of the chloride component of the starting materials is then determined by:\n\ng Cl = MW Cl x mol Cl = (7.50921 x 10-2 mol) x (35.45 g/mol) = 2.662 g\n\nPlug that back into the second eqn and you get:\n\n(g Na+) + (g K+) + (2.662 g) = 6.4100 g\nor\n(g Na+) + (g K+) = 3.748 g\n\nConvert back to moles and plug that into the first equation and you get:\n\nmoles Na + moles K = 7.50921 x 10 -2 mol\nor\nmoles Na + ((g K+) / (39.1 g/mol)) = 7.50921 x 10 -2 mol\nor\n((g Na+) / (22.99 g/mol)) + ((3.748 - g Na+) / (39.1 g/mol)) = 7.50921 x 10 -2 mol\n\nAnd now solve for g Na + \n\nDivide that by 3.748 g and you're there!

The most important thing in any word problem is figuring out how to set it up.  Our intrepid builder cut a total of 6 boards, and used the longer pieces from all of them, so he used 6x feet of wood.  Additionally, he used 4 of the smaller pieces, each of which is (16 - x) feet long.  This accounts for another 4(16 - x) feet.  This all has to add up to 82 feet of boards, so we get the equation:\n\n6x + 4(16 - x) = 82\n\nThis simplifies as follows:\n\n6x + 64 - 4x = 82\n2x + 64= 82\n\nThe final answer is left as an exercise for the reader.
Their is no loss or gain of atoms, once you balance the equation, so the products weight the same as the reactants.  The fact that H2 and Cl2 are gases doesn't affect the weight of the compounds used, as long as the reaction is done in a closed container and you don't lose any.

Every body of mass produces a force of gravity. The larger the body, the more gravity it produces. The sun is large enough to produce enough gravity to pull Earth towards it. However, at the same time, Earth is in motion. The motion would be straight, but because the sun's gravity pulls Earth towards the sun, the Earth's path of motion is curved around the sun. It is like swinging a ball on the end of a string, with gravity acting like an invisible string.

It is called Bernoulli's principle.  As velocty of a fluid increases, the pressure decreases.  Think of a traffic jam.  As the traffic gets slower, the cars are very close together, but after the site of the accident, the cars speed up and the distance between them is very great.  Fluid molecules are the same, high pressure is an area of high density among particles, they're close together.  Low pressure is an area of relative low density, more space between particles.  It's the same principle that allows airplanes to fly.

Since f''(x) = (1/3)x^(-2/3) - (2/3)x^(-5/3) = 1 > 0 for x = -1 the extreme at x = -1 is minimum.\nd. Since within the given interval the function is final and has only one minimum that is not at the end of the interval the function is concave downward (I would say upward) meaning from f(-8) = 8 monotonically decreases to the minimum f(-1) = -3 and monotonically increases again to f(8) = 24 which is then absolute maximum..\n\nn.b. you can go to excell and plot the function.
heres a basic information\n\n\nDUST can contain a particles of a wide range of sizes. The effect of these particles when ingested into the body depends on the size shape and chemical nature of the particles. There are standard definitions used for dust based on the particle sizes as follows:\n\nTotal Inhalable Dust: This is the fraction of airborne particles which enters the nose and mouth during normal breathing. It is made up of particles of 100 microns diameter and less. This dust fraction is required to be measured in many European jurisdictions.\n\nThoracic Dust: This is the fraction approximately 10 microns diameter and less. This is also referred to as the PM10 in the USA. This fraction will pass through the nose and throat, and reach into the lungs.\n\nRespirable Dust: This fraction is the particles approximately 5 microns and less. It certainly penetrates into the gas exchange region of the lungs, and is therefore the most hazardous particulate size. This fraction is required to be measured in many European jurisdictions.\n\nDUST IN THE WORKPLACE: For many nuisance type dusts the occupational limits are around 10mg/m3 for total dusts and 5 mg/m3 for respirable or PM10 dusts. These are normally measured with small air sampling pumps running for a number of hours, or a quick measure of relative dust levels can be obtained by using a light scattering dust meter.\n\nDUST IN THE ENVIRONMENT (or AMBIENT DUST): In outside areas the levels are usually much lower than in enclosed working areas, but the acceptable levels of dust before they become a nuisance are also set at lower levels than for workplace areas. Because ambient levels are lower they are more difficult to measure. If sampling pumps are used they need to be much larger and run for longer periods in order to collect a weighable amount of dust on the filter. Sometimes a measure of dust deposits on a surface is used to determine the amount of environmental dust.\n\nPERMITTED DUST LEVELS vary in different jurisdictions, and will be lower for hazardous materials.\n AIR SAMPLING PUMPS: These are simple vacuum pumps which draw air through a pre-weighed filter at a fixed flow rate for a known time. The pumps need for run for a number of hours to collect a weighable amount of dust. The filter is re-weighed to determine how much dust is present in a known volume of air. These filters will only collect a few milligrams or less of dust - a very sensitive and expensive balance is required. The filter holder needs to be specially selected to collect the particle size range required - e.g. PM10 or respirable. The filter holders are often only designed to operate at a pre-defined flow rate -if they are to collect the required particle size range. Personal pumps normally operate at about 2 litres/min. Ambient pumps operate at higher level - from 10 l/min - even up to 500 l/min.\n\nDUST DEPOSIT GAUGES: These are used in the UK to monitor Dust Deposits. The Directional Dust Deposit Gaugeto BS.1747 does give some indication of monthly deposit levels in four compass directions. Very inexpensive.\n\nRECORDING MICROBALANCE: Very sensitive device produced by Ruprecht & Pasternicht (USA). A vibrating rod with filter on top. Dust is collected on the filter. The change in the frequency of rod vibration is a measure of mass of dust on the filter. Instant recording. Expensive.\n\nLIGHT SCATTERING DUST METERS: The trouble with Air Sampling Pumps is that the dust level they measure can only be a mean value for a measurement over several hours. Light Scattering Meters measure the light scattered by dust particles and can give an instant dust level measurement. Great care is required in using these. The number on the meter should be calibrated against measurements with an air sampling pump for your dust since they really measure scattered light - and the amount of light scattered by a particle depends on many factors, such as particle size distribution, density, reflectivity etc. NOT a true grav

"That is the ""ideal gas law,"" which is something that you would normally see in a chemistry class. \n\nIn reality, it has applications in both fields. The fields are definitely related in important ways. Long ago, chemistry and physics were very different fields; however, as more was learned about how chemical and physical changes were related, the two fields became related.\n\nSo now there are lots of things that blur the line. However, a fundamental like the ideal gas law will probably FIRST be covered in a chemistry context.\n\nSo if you need to make a classification, then go for ""chemistry."" Generally ""laws"" that govern large systems are typically found in chemistry. Of course, all chemistry can be derived from fundamental physical laws. However, doing chemistry purely at a physical level would be difficult. Chemistry uses special structures and relationships to encapsulate lots and lots of physics into simplifications that can be used to do useful chemistry. The ideal gas law is one such example."

Things that look darker when soaked absorb water. The surface tension of water brings the small particles (fibre of a cloth or sand-dust) close 2 each other. As a result the density of the wet thing increases. This causes the object 2 reflect light of a different (greater?) wavelength & the colour darkens.

The Krebs cycle occurs in the mitochondrial matrix. Pyruvate produced in the glycolysis is first decarboxylated to yield acetyl-CoA. The acetyl-CoA combines with oxaloacetate to yield citrate. Citrate is then converted to isocitrate. Isocitrate is then converted to a-ketoglutarate (first CO2 is lost and the first NADH is produced). A-keto is converted to succinyl-CoA (CO2 produced). At this point the rest of the cycle is to regenerate oxaloacetate. The succinyl-CoA is converted to succinate (producing GTP) which is converted to fumarate (produces FADH2). Fumarate is converted to Malate and finally to Oxaloacetate (NADH produced). Krebs cycle produces a total of 1 GTP, 1 FADH2 and 3 NADH. The FADH2 and NADH enter the electron transport chain. For each molecule of glucose there will be 2 turns of the cycle.
No, time is dependant on your frame of reference according to Einstiens theory of relativity.  The Twins paradox demonstrates this well.  A pair of twins, both born on the same day.  One remains on Earth, the other blasts off in a space ship travelling at 70% of the speed of light.  The space explorer returns after what appears to be one year in space but upon landing finds that the other twin has long since died of old age, so has all his friends.  Time slows down the closer you get to the speed of light.  It also slows down the closer you get to large gravity wells like black holes.

An eclipse of the Moon (or lunar eclipse) can only occur at Full Moon, and only if the Moon passes through some portion of the Earth's shadow. \n\n1. Penumbral Lunar Eclipse \n\nThe Moon passes through Earth's penumbral shadow. \nThese events are of only academic interest since they are subtle and quite difficult to observe. \n2. Partial Lunar Eclipse \n\nA portion of the Moon passes through Earth's umbral shadow. \nThese events are easy to see, even with the unaided eye. \n3. Total Lunar Eclipse \n\nThe entire Moon passes through Earth's umbral shadow. \nThese events are quite striking for the vibrant range of colors the Moon can take on during the total phase (i.e. - totality).

Iron sulfate and sodium borate are ionic. SiC2 is covalent.  (This is due to the proximity, or lack thereof, of each main element in the periodic table.)  The concept of polar/nonpolar is used only with covalent molecules to describe whether or not they have a sufficient dipole moment to interact with other polar/nonpolar molecules.  I don't know the arrangement of atoms in SiC2 but, if the molecule is linear, the moment of the two Si-C bonds cancel out and it is nonpolar.  If SiC2 is bent, it's polar.
your names would be:\nSF6 --> Sulfur hexaoxide \nN2O5--> Dinitrogen pentaoxide\nNF3 ---> Nitrogen trifluoride\nP2S3 ---> Diphosphorus Trisulfide\n\nAll of these are covalently bonded (nonmetal+nonmetal, non-ionic compounds) and are binary (made of two elements), hence, you would use the numerical prefixes for both elements, (mono-, di-, tri, tetra-, etc.)  and the -ide suffix for the ending element. NOTE: you ususally don't use the mono- prefix in the first element of the compound if there is only one the compound. For example, you wouldn't say monosulfur hexaoxide (SF6) nor would you say monocarbon monoxide (CO).

To be the closest point, the line from (3,0) to the point must be normal to the hyperbola.  The slope of the normal is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the curve.  \n\nThe curve is: y = 8/x\nThe curve slope is dy/dx = -8/x^2\nThe slope of the line from (3,0) to the cloest point is: m = (x^2)/8\n\nThe distance from (3,0) to any point (x, y) is D = sqrt((x-3)^2 + y^2)\n\nTo be along the line y = 8/x, the the distance is:\n\nD = sqrt((x-3)^2 + (8/x)^2)\n\nLook at the derivative dD/dx which is how the distance changes with x:\n\ndD/dx =(x - 3 - (64/x^3))/sqrt((x-3)^2 + 64/x^2)\n\nFor the distance to be minimum, the numerator must be zero:\n\n0 =  x - 3 - (64/x^3)\n\nBy inspection, this is solved at x = 4.  The closest point is then (4, 2)
because it is not the distance from the sun that makes out day but how the earth is tilted.\nThe Earth is tilted by 23 1/2 degrees. During the Summer months, \nthe north is pointed toward the Sun allowing more direct sunlight. \nDuring the winter, we are tilted away from the sun so the sunlight \nis more indirect as the sun seems lower in the sky. \nThere are 4 cardinal points in our calender; \nSummer solstice, autumnal equinox, winter solstice and vernal equinox. \nBeginning of summer, fall, winter and spring. This coincides \nwith the position of earth as it goes around the sun. \nEach of the cardinal days can take place over a three day period,\n 20th, 21st, 22nd. On June 22nd, summer solstice, it is the longest \nday of the year. It is also the day that the north pole is pointing \ndirectly at the sun. The next day it will have passed this point \nand start pointing away from the sun, hence, the days will also start \ngetting shorter. For further info, \nfeel free to email me, orion_1812@yahoo.com

There is more to the system than just the man and the wall.  Let's say the wall and man are hovering in space and they push against each other.  They would separate resulting in motion of both man and wall.  \n\nBut on earth, when a man pushes against the wall and visa versa, they are both anchored to the ground.  As the man pushes the wall, the wall would move but the earth is pushing on the wall the opposite direction.  Likewise, as the wall pushes the man, the earth pushes him in the opposite direction through his feet.  This can be illustrated by supposing the man were on ice and had no traction.  He would surely glide away from the wall.  \n\nSo how can there be force with no acceleration?  Let's take the man's perspective.  He is pushing on the wall resulting in a force the opposite direction, but he is also experiencing the earth pushing him towards the wall.  Since both forces are equal and in opposite directions, the man's net force is zero.  The same goes for the wall.  \n\nSo, while your question is technically correct, you didn't take in account that there is more than one force involved, and those two cancel each other out.

"Alright, to answer this question, I'm going to have to make sure you know a few things.\n\n1)  A substance is a solid, liquid or gas depending on how close or far apart the atoms in the substance are.  In solids, the atoms are much more tightly packed.\n\n2)  ""Heat"" is the total amount of kinetic energy on an atomic level.\n\n3)  Heat can only transfer when two atoms (or, for that matter, molecules) interact.\n\nNow picture the following scenario:\n\nYou enter a very crowded room.  You're pushing and shoving like crazy.  Because the room is so crowded, even people on the other side of the room are going to have to start moving to compensate for your boorish behavior.\n\nOR\n\nYou enter a very nearly empty room.  You're still pushing about.  But because it's not at all crowded, you only affect the people who are nearby.  The people on the other side of the room just stare at you funny.\n\nThe people in the room are the molecules of the substance you are trying to transfer heat into.  You are the extra kinetic energy, the heat, entering the system.  You can only transfer energy into something you're able to come into contact with.  In a gas, the heat doesn't have the opportunity to affect the distant molecules.\n\nThis is why, when boiling water, the pot gets REALLY hot, the water takes a longer time to get hot, and the air above the water is still cool enough to touch.\n\nHope this is helpful."

did you know you can actually make glue from milk? The first step of the process is adding the vinegar to the milk, which will cause the milk to seaprate into solid curds and watery whey.  What's happening here? Well, the vinegar is causing the proteins within the milk to bind together, forming the curds. The substance left over is that watery whey protein.  This of course is a chemical reaction because the substance (milk) is converted into a substance with different composition and properties (curds and whey).\n\nFor further reference, contact little Miss Muffet.\n\nHope that helps!!

It is complex with several different regions. To simplify, it has a Mediterranean climate which means it is influenced by the North Atlantic Drift (from the Gulf Stream) in winter, like North-Western Europe, making it milder and wetter than places further east, while in summer it becomes climatically part of the Sahara system, a belt of high pressure hot dry air, so the rainfall is minimal.\n\nThe west is wetter than the east because of the way it sticks out south-eastwards into the sea; the prevailing winds, except in summer, pick up moisture from the western Mediterranean and the mountains running the length of Italy cause it to precipitate mainly on the western side. Because of the alignment in relation to the sea, and the mountains, it gets much more rain in winter than Spain and southern France, and so is much greener, more beautiful and fertile. In my view it's the most scenically lovely country in Europe, except maybe Croatia/Bosnia/Montenegro, which have a similar climate. (I'm British, by the way).\n\nThe northern plain, being circled by mountains, does not get much of the mild air from the sea in winter and is much colder than the peninsular area. The far north consists of the Alps which are extremely cold in winter, and the summits remain snow-covered all year round.
all reactions are going both ways.  for instance, H2 + O2--->H2O ( I know it's not balanced) also goes from H2O---->H2 + O2.  A 100% yield is never acheived because the reaction reaches a state of equilibrium where the reactants are going from H2 + O2--->H2O just as fast as they are going from H2O--->H2 + O2.\n\nAn entire semester of inorganic chemistry is devoted to the concept of equalibrium.

"I think this is referring to the epiphyseal line that forms after full maturation of the bone.  The ""growth plate"" that we have as children (epiphyseal plate, or growth plate) in long bones such as the femur contain cartilage which allows our bones to elongate - making us taller as we grow.  When we reach our maximum height, the epiphyseal plate replaces cartilaginous tissue with bony tissue.  After this transition, the plate is referred to as the epiphyseal line and growth of the bone stops."

"Bacteria are everywhere.  There's many many ways bacteria grows in and on meat in particular, because it's an excellent protein source for growth.  \n\nContamination can come from dirty utensils used to cut and prepare the meat, as well as surface tops, cutting boards, ect..\nAlso, through airborne particles, dirty hands of the person preparing the meat, or even breathing over the meat while it's being prepared.  Also, the animal could have bacteria already in it's system, which is more than likely usually the case.  Animals and humans have billions of bacteria in our intestinal tract especially.  You even have bacteria known as ""normal flora"" on your skin right now! \nMany times, contamination occurs in meat when it is processed in slaughterhouses, because fecal matter from the intestinal tract gets mixed with the meat (sounds gross, but that's where E. Coli comes from, as well as some forms of Serratia) \nThe FDA and USDA actually run tests on the meat before it is sent out though to make sure it isn't contaminated.  They normally do something called a spread plate count or dilution count.  This is where they put a certain quantity of meat, grind it up, mix with sterile water in a sterile blender type instrument and add maybe a milliliter of the substance to test tubes of water that have a measured amount of water in it, and it then gets diluted further the same way in about 4 test tubes.  The first would be a 1:10 ratio, then 1:100, 1:1000, ect.. Then, usually about a milliliter is taken out from those tubes and put on a petri dish with a special type of nutrient agar for the bacteria to form colonies.  After the plates are incubated, they are removed and you count the colonies of bacterial growth.  Then they do a mathematical calculation where they take the colonies seen and multiply it by the dilution factor, this gives them the colony formula units.  If the CFU is over a certain amount per gram, then it is discarded or recalled.  To test for E. Coli in particular, they use something called EMB agar, which is diluted sheep red blood cells. The bacteria is spread onto the petri dish of this agar, and then incubated.  If the petri dish has a bright, metallic green colony growth, it is positive for E. Coli."

Your basic selection criteria start with flow rate @ pressure. This is going to depend on what you are trying to do, but you will find a direct correlation between the horsepower input of the pump motor and the combination of flow at pressure. Note that it is possible to make low flow at high pressure, or low pressure at high flow, but it takes a lot of power to both.\n\nA suggestion is to calculate the amount of power your require (force X distance / unit of time) and convert that to horsepower, then look for an HPU at www.Grainger.com that is about 2X that horsepower.

To have resonance, the sound wave must complete a whole number of cycles when travelling through the pipe. \n\nFor instance, sound travels 340 meters in one second. If you had an organ pipe 340 meters long, sound with a frequency of 1 Hz would resonate the pipe because it completes exactly 1 cycle in 1 second, which is how long it takes the sound to travel 340 meters.\n\nFirst find how long it will take the sound to travel through the pipe:\n\nl / v = t\nWhere l is the length of the pipe and v is the speed of sound.\n\nNext, find the frequency that would allow just one full cycle to be completed while in the pipe:\n\nt * f = r\nWhere t is the time sound takes to travel through the pipe, f is the frequency with which the pipe will resonate, and r is the number of cycles the sound wave will complete. To obtain the frequency f, set r=1 and solve.\n\nBelow is the problem solved:\nt = l / v = 2 / 340 = 1/170 s\nf = r / t = 1 / (1/170) = 170 Hz\n\nI hope this helps!

Polymeric materials like plastic are made up of big molecules, and these very long molecules are disposed in a chaotic way, and there are links between molecules, It's something similar to a spaghetti dish and this structure is defined amorphous because there is no order. When plastic is put under stress these molecules are stretched and in that places the structure become more tidy , so it became crystalline, and crystalline structures are opaque, while amorphous structures are transparent.\nPigments are not important in this phenomenon.

Knowing that, you can imagine how there are gravity gradients surrounding the earth, and it is natural for energy to return to its lowest state, in the case of mass, its lowest state of energy without changing state woud be to locate its self in a position with the lowest potential.\n\nThe location with the lowest potential is the location closest to the center of mass, and given enough time, and the planets have had plenty, the potential will be equally distributed amoung all matter, which results in a circle...\n\nSame as a water droplet in zero gravity.

Discs are thick gelatinous 'washers' between the bones in the vertebral column and act much like a shock absorber to prevent walking or running from jarring the brain (which is also protected by a liquid around the brain and spinal cord). Because of injury or simply aging, the discs wear and one side of the disc bulges outward. The shift in the weight distrubition causes pinching on nerves from the spinal cord and causes pain, numbness, or even loss of motility (as the pain can be overwhelming). For minor instances, bed rest and muscle relaxants and pain medication are used. However more serious events will bring the doctor to suggest fusing or joining the bones together. The operation is not very serious but would take weeks before the patient could return to normal activity. Fusing the bones does reduce flexibility somewhat but a small sacrifice compared to the pain and discomfort. Most of the disc problems occur in the lumbar region of the spine but sometimes can occur in the cervical region (neck). Sometimes a good back brace will provide some relief but it is important to learn good work habits in lifting objects (use the powerful muscles of the legs, not place stress on the back muscles and discs). Long hot baths will help to relax the back muscles but do nothing for the disc. Some people suggest chiropractors as an answer, and while they may do some good, I suggest an orthopaedic surgeon  to manage the problem. This problem is referred to as a 'slipped' disc or a herniated nucleated palposa or a bulging disc.
"No they don't.\n\nIn actual fact, the abnormalities of flight do involve \nquite a number of changes in air pressure as you\nclimb above the surface of the earth and fly through\nvarious manuvers which exert ""G"" forces on your \nbody.\n\nThe human body has two ports for equalization of \ninternal pressures: the throat and the rear end. So\nwhile this might sound a bit humorous, there is a \nlot of burping and pharting involved in flight.\n\nSince the internal atmospheric pressure within\nmost space ships and stations is just slightly \nmore than 1 atmosphere, the gas velocity exiting\nthe rear end during a space phart would be no\nfaster than that of a phart here on earth. Other \nthan a slight lift to release the gas, no actual motion\nwould be detected by an observer during the phart.\n\nOther astronauts in the general vicinity would, however,\nmove away from the immediate area unless restrained\nby the elaborate seat belt arrangements during docking\nor manuvers.\n\nThe real problem which you failed to ask about is the \ninternal climate within a space suit. What happens \ninside there during pharting? Well, I must admit that in\na confined space there is nothing so disturbing as a\nstring of continual pharts.

if you want a proof, here's one by calculus\nwhen the cone is positioned upright, standing on its tip we can find the center of mass by the formulas\n x' = ∫(x*da)/∫(da)\n y' = ∫(y*da)/∫(da) \n---with the limits from\n x = 0 to x = b(base) \n y = 0 to y = h(height)\n\nby intuition center of mass along x = 0\n\nwe can represent the equation of the cone as y = mx, where m is the slope\n\nso finding the center of mass along y we find\n∫yda = ∫y*2πxdy, since da=2πxdy from infinitesimal area A = 2πrh\n = 2π∫(y^2)dy/m\n = 2π(y^3)/3m evaluated from 0 to h\n = 2πh^3/3m, we can find m from y = mx ---> h = mb so m=h/b\n = 2πb(h^2)/3\n\nthen we have to find ∫da\n∫da = ∫2πxdy\n = ∫2πydy / m\n = π(h^2)/m\n = πbh\n\nso y' = ∫(y*da)/∫(da) = 2πb(h^2)/3πbh = 2h/3\nthis means the center of mass along the vertical axis of the cone is 2h/3 when the cone is STANDING ON ITS TIP\ny = 2h/3 and x = 0
Some Falcon species like peregrines and probably kestrels use tall city buidings to hunt and nest on as if they were cliff faces. The buidings, like cliffs, act as good vantage points (provide updrafts) to hunt other birds. As long as there is plenty of prey items like feral pigeons (peregrines) or mice to hunt (kestrels) they probably don't have many problems living in cities. Heavy pollution could be a problem?

Jellyfish are very delicate animals whose bodies are comprised primarily of water (~ 96% of their weight is water) infused throughout a network of tissue. Thus, water provides virtually all of their structural support (it is their bones), allowing them to grow large, and appear robust, without any rigid tissues.\nThe bodies (the bell) of jellyfish is made of a material called mesoglea. Mesoglea is a jelly-like material that is elastic because of there are fibers that connect together in the mesoglea. The other main body part a jellyfish is the gut and it contains mostly water and digestive juices. Since most of the material of a jellyfish is the exact density of water. If you weigh water about the same size as the jellyfish you want to know the weight for, you will get weight of the jellyfish. I suggest you weigh some water at home or school that is about the same size as a jellyfish that interests you and you will get an approximate weight of a jellyfish.\nor The jellyfishes can be grouped with 1 cm intervals and then the number of animals for each size group is recorded. The jellyfish A. aurita can be fixed in 2% buffered formaldehyde. We are proposing the following equation for calculation of biomass of A. aurita, which was developed for A. aurita inhabiting in the Black Sea:\nW= 0.12 L 2.58 where W- wet weight in grams, L- length in mm;\n(measurements range from 6.1 to 151mm)(Mutlu, 2001) \n\nThese equations should also be developed for the Caspian population of A. aurita.\n\n\nIndividual jellies typically enjoy a life span of only weeks or months,It is likely that most jellyfish have quite short lives. It must be remembered that the jellyfish stage is only one stage in the life-cycle of most species. For both the true jellyfish (Class Scyphozoa) and most hydrozoan jellyfish this stage buds off from what is known as a polyp stage. The jellyfish is the sexual stage and is the stage that has mature gametes. The sexes are separate. Since jellyfish roam freely in the plankton it is during this stage that dispersal takes place. The young planula larvae settle and grow into the polyp stage which can live for many years. In temperate waters the growing polyp buds off new jellyfish once a year, often in the spring. The young jellyfish grow rapidly through the summer, spawn then usually die. So most jellyfish live less than 1 year.

Keratins are a family of fibrous structural proteins; tough and insoluble, they form peptide bonds to adjacent protein chains, facilitating their close alignment of the sulfur-containing amino acid cysteine, required for the disulfide bridges that confer additional strength and rigidity by permanent, thermally-stable crosslinking — a role sulfur bridges also play in vulcanized rubber. Human hair is approximately 14% cysteine. The pungent smells of burning hair is due to the sulfur compounds formed. Extensive disulfide bonding contributes to the insolubility of keratins, except in dissociating or reducing agents such as urea.\n\nYou could get more information from the link below...

Angle of incidence = angle of reflection.  This also means that a ray will hit the mirror at the midpoint between origin and destination.\n\nSo, \nfor y to see z the ray must hit the mirror 1 meter from it's center.  That puts it at 1/2 meter from the edge so you're OK.  By symmetry y can also see x.\n\nAlso by symmetry, z can see y.  But can z see x?  The ray from x to z (and z to x) must strike the mirror at its midpoint.  \n\nSo, it looks like all three can see the other two.

To make a bee-line is a follow the example of bees in taking the shortest route from one place to another. The expression comes from the belief that bees return to the high by the shortest possible way after they have gathered their food. And the shortest distance between two points is, of course, a straight line.\n\nBut on their return home, the bees sometimes make lines, which are far from straight. These are dancing movements in the air to inform other members of the colony about their source of supply. They indicate whether the food is pollen or nectar, the direction and distance from the hive and even the colors of the flowers.\n\nThis bee code was discovered by the German naturalist Professor K. von Frisch. He found, for example, that a circular dance says the food source is close to the hive and that a waggle dance indicates longer distances.
"I agree with them , mostly u r taliking about geodes !!! \n\nGeodes (Greek geoides, ""earthlike"") are geological rock formations which occur in sedimentary and certain volcanic rocks. Geodes are essentially rock cavities or vugs with internal crystal formations or concentric banding. The exterior of the most common geodes is generally limestone or a related rock, while the interior contains quartz crystals and/or chalcedony deposits. Other geodes are completely filled with crystal, being solid all the way though. These types of geodes are called nodules.\n\nGeodes can form in any cavity that is buried. These can be gas bubbles in igneous rocks, pockets under tree roots, vesicles in lava after a volcanic eruption, or even animal burrows. Over time, the external wall of the cavity hardens, and dissolved silicates and/or carbonates are deposited on the inside surface. Over time, this slow feed of mineral constituents from groundwater or hydrothermal solutions allows crystals to form inside the hollow chamber. Then, over millions of years, the geode makes its way back to the surface through normal geologic processes.\n\n4 more info and photos try \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geode\n\nhttp://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images?p=Geode&fr=yfp-t-501&toggle=1&cop=mss&ei=UTF-8"

I’d suggest you another approach: (cosx)^2=0.5*(1+cos(2x)); if y’=0 then 1+cos(2x)=0.4*x or cos(2x)=0.4*x-1 (the x=0 is outside of our interval). Now look at the graphs of y1=cos(2x) and that of y2=0.4x-1; |cos(2x)|<=1; ‘start’ point of  y2 is [0,-1], y2 is rather ‘slow-up’ and y2 must be <= than 1, ie 0.4*x-1<=1 or x<=5; thus our interval is not (0,10) any longer, it is (0,5]; \n5=1.59*pi; 1.59 is the # of periods of y1 in 5, because 1 period of y1 is 2x=2*pi and x=pi.\nThus there are only 3 critical points in the interval (0,10)!

Therefore, h = 1.  And also t = 9.

The 1906 San Francisco earthquake was a major earthquake that struck San Francisco and the coast of northern California at 5:12am on Wednesday, April 18, 1906. The most widely accepted magnitude for the earthquake is a moment magnitude (Mw) 7.8; however, other values have been proposed from 7.7 to as high as 8.3.[1] The mainshock epicenter occurred offshore about 2 miles (3 km) from the city. It ruptured along the San Andreas Fault both northward and southward for a total length of 296 miles (477 km).[2] Shaking was felt from Oregon to Los Angeles, and inland as far as central Nevada. The earthquake and resulting fire would be remembered as one of the worst natural disasters in the history of the United States.

The surface of the sun (that which is visible to the naked eye) is roughly 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, while the corona has temperatures in the millions of degrees, as does the interior.  \n\nEventually, a star of the sun's mass will become a red giant, where it will become cooler (but still plenty hot enough to eventually incinerate at least half of the inner planets of the solar system) and much larger.  Then once it has spent its fuel it will collapse into a white dwarf.  At this stage it will still be giving off heat and radiation, but no where near the level it does now.

"1. gravity is acting straight down, centrifugal force is acting towards the wall, and friction is holding her against the wall.  Obviously the centrifugal force and friction together are stronger than the gravity, or she would fall.\n\n2. The book was ""at rest"" -- an object tends to stay at rest unless acted on by an external force (that's inertia).

Once the parachute is opened, the surface area of the skydiver/parachute combination is many times greater than it was, greatly increasing air resistance -- which slows the acceleration due to gravity enough to allow the skydiver to make a soft landing.\n\n:)"

Please find below excerpts:\n\nMarie Curie\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1903 \n\nMarie Curie, née Maria Sklodowska, was born in Warsaw on November 7, 1867, the daughter of a secondary-school teacher. She received a general education in local schools and some scientific training from her father. She became involved in a students' revolutionary organization and found it prudent to leave Warsaw, then in the part of Poland dominated by Russia, for Cracow, which at that time was under Austrian rule. In 1891, she went to Paris to continue her studies at the Sorbonne where she obtained Licenciateships in Physics and the Mathematical Sciences. She met Pierre Curie, Professor in the School of Physics in 1894 and in the following year they were married. She succeeded her husband as Head of the Physics Laboratory at the Sorbonne, gained her Doctor of Science degree in 1903, and following the tragic death of Pierre Curie in 1906, she took his place as Professor of General Physics in the Faculty of Sciences, the first time a woman had held this position. She was also appointed Director of the Curie Laboratory in the Radium Institute of the University of Paris, founded in 1914.\n\nHer early researches, together with her husband, were often performed under difficult conditions, laboratory arrangements were poor and both had to undertake much teaching to earn a livelihood. The discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel in 1896 inspired the Curies in their brilliant researches and analyses which led to the isolation of polonium, named after the country of Marie's birth, and radium. Mme. Curie developed methods for the separation of radium from radioactive residues in sufficient quantities to allow for its characterization and the careful study of its properties, therapeutic properties in particular.\n\nMme. Curie throughout her life actively promoted the use of radium to alleviate suffering and during World War I, assisted by her daughter, Irene, she personally devoted herself to this remedial work. She retained her enthusiasm for science throughout her life and did much to establish a radioactivity laboratory in her native city - in 1929 President Hoover of the United States presented her with a gift of $ 50,000, donated by American friends of science, to purchase radium for use in the laboratory in Warsaw.\n\nMme. Curie, quiet, dignified and unassuming, was held in high esteem and admiration by scientists throughout the world. She was a member of the Conseil du Physique Solvay from 1911 until her death and since 1922 she had been a member of the Committee of Intellectual Co-operation of the League of Nations. Her work is recorded in numerous papers in scientific journals and she is the author of Recherches sur les Substances Radioactives (1904), L'Isotopie et les Éléments Isotopes and the classic Traité' de Radioactivité (1910).\n\nThe importance of Mme. Curie's work is reflected in the numerous awards bestowed on her. She received many honorary science, medicine and law degrees and honorary memberships of learned societies throughout the world. Together with her husband, she was awarded half of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903, for their study into the spontaneous radiation discovered by Becquerel, who was awarded the other half of the Prize. In 1911 she received a second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, in recognition of her work in radioactivity. She also received, jointly with her husband, the Davy Medal of the Royal Society in 1903 and, in 1921, President Harding of the United States, on behalf of the women of America, presented her with one gram of radium in recognition of her service to science.\n\nFor further details, cf. Biography of Pierre Curie. Mme. Curie died in Savoy, France, after a short illness, on July 4, 1934.\n\nFrom Nobel Lectures, Physics 1901-1921, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1967 \n\nThis autobiography/biography was first published in the book series Les Prix Nobel.

Hello Catherine, Your question is a very good one.Now,in the first molecule OF 2, all the valence electrons are used up in bonding and it forms a stable molecule having linear geometry. In the second molecule SCL 2 the same is happening and the molecule is linear in geometry.But, in the last one that is PF 5, the three valence electrons of Phosphorus are used up in bonding with Fluorine electrons,leaving two  electrons of Phosphorus as Lone-pairs,as a  result the molecule has a distorted geometry and the molecule has a Pyramidral shape like that of NH 3. I think I can able to make you understand.Bye.
Wow! 27 pounds is a very large size for a quartz crystal.  I would imagine if it really were quartz that it may be quite valuable.  Since quartz consists mainly of silica (SiO2), an unpolished stone may appear white on the inside.  In fact, sandstone is also composed of silica and since you mention that your stone is rusty yellow, without actually seeing it, I might suggest that it is a variety of sandstone.  There is also a chance that it may be citrine.  Please check out the links below.  There is a photo of rutilated quartz in the third link that sounds similar to what you describe.  If your stone is quartz, it would be great to try to sell it.  Good luck!

Here is a site that discusses the Myths and Facts surrounding giving blood.\n\nhttp://www.lebanonredcross.org/Give_Blood_Facts.htm\n\nPeople should not donate blood if their lifestyles put them at risk for HIV, hepatitis B, malaria or other infections that can be transmitted through blood. \n\nBeing a Homosexual CAN put you in this risk category if the partners involved are NOT monogomous.  The Red Cross defers acceptance of blood from donors in this risk group.. even those in monogomous relationships.  IV drug users, being a or using prostitutes for sexual intercourse are other donor-risk behaviors.\n\nOther factors that would bar you from giving blood include: \n\n** You have had a recent tattoo.  \n\n **You or someone in your family has or had Creuzfeldt-Jakob disease. \n\n** You had an injection of beef insulin made from cattle in the United Kingdom.  \n\n **You recently had malaria.  \n\n **You have lived in the United Kingdom for more than three months or in Europe for more than six months anytime after 1980.  \n\n **You have been treated for syphilis or gonorrhea in the last year.\n\nAbout Blood Donation:\n\nBlood Facts:  http://www.miblood.org/about_blood/facts.html\n\nThe average adult has about 10 pints of blood in his or her body. \n\nThe Need For Blood \n\n4.5 million Americans would die each year without life saving blood transfusions. \nOn average, about 38,000 pints of blood are used each day in the United States. \nEvery three seconds someone needs blood. \nOn average, one out of every 5 hospital patients will need blood. \nAbout three gallons of blood supports the entire nation's blood needs for one minute. \nBlood centers often run short of type O and B blood. \nThe average red blood cell transfusion is 3.4 pints. \n\nHow Blood Helps\n\nOne unit of blood can be separated into several components (red blood cells, white blood cells, plasma, platelets and cryoprecipitate). \nJust one pint of donated blood can help 3-4 people.

You can't solve for X, because that's an expression, not an equation.  You have to have an equal sign in there somewhere to get a value for X.\n\nBTW, no offense to highfive90, but his answer is totally wrong.  x=-10 would make the denominator 0, which is a very bad thing.  If you intended the equation to be 10x/(10+x) = 0, the only solution is x=0.
"Every accident is a little different, but in theory, a few principles apply:\n\n1) The higher the combined speed of the vehicles, the greater the risk.\n2) The greater the ""acceleration"" (meaning rate of change in velocity, and includes ""deceleration"") of a vehicle, the more damage.\n3) The heavier vehicle or the one traveling faster will usually have an advantage.\n\nNow, we can analyze those principles further.  Point #1 combines the vehicle speeds (velocities).  If the vehicles are travelling in exactly opposite directions, this will be at the maximum of simply totalling the two vehicles' individual speeds.  If they are at any other tangent to each other, the math is a little trickier, but it won't be at the maximum when combined.  Point #2 shows that it is the _change_ in speed that causes damage.  From this principle, I would far rather not ""bounce back,"" as this means I would have changed speed all the more.  To simply stop, means I have gone from, say, 60 to 0, or changed 60 mph.  To bounce back means I have gone from 60 to -20, or changed 80 mph (not necessarily those numbers, but you get the idea).  Point #3 is true because the heavier and/or faster vehicle will usually keep going, forcing the slower/lighter vehicle to reverse direction.  Therefore, one vehicle might go 60 to 10 mph (change  of 50) while the other went from 55 to -15 (change of 70).  Having said that, it would be pure foolishness to increase your speed before the accident, owing to principles #1 and #2."

Use conservation of momentum to find the momentum of the pendulum after impact.  From the momentum you can find the energy of the pendulum (be sure to account for the change in mass!).  That kinetic energy become potential energy as the pendulum swings upward.  Use trigonometry to find the horizontal displacement from the vertical displacement.

I don't know how extensive your research should be, but i can tell you the principle of how this works. the name protease already give you a lot of hint, protease is biological enzyme that catalyse the hydrolysis of proteins, the protein comes from the food we eat, say like your white shirt got splattered with some sauce with some meat extract, this stains will be difficult to remove, by degrading the protein within the stains will make the stain easier to be removed. how does protease catalyse hydrolsis of protein? \n\nfor example a serine protease in our clotting activating factors, such enzyem uses its hydroxyl group of its serine residue (the residue of serine amino acid contains a hydroxyl group,) with the lone pair of electron on the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group, it can make neucleophilic attack on the peptide bond carbon atom, as a result the peptide bond is broken, and as you know proteins are made of chains of amino acid connected by peptide bond, thus hydrolysis occurs, i can't give you any more detail of how this mechanism works because i am feeling spleepy right now, good luck any way zzzzzzzzzzzzz
"YES.\n\nThough it depends on what you mean by ""moving""\n\nIf you mean getting from one place to another as fast or faster than light, it is possible though not currently provable.\n\nThere are a few ""workarounds"" for the light speed barrier.  My personal favorite was cooked up by Miguel Alcubierre in 1994.  It is called the Alcubierre Metric, or sometimes the Alcubierre Drive.\n\nIt relies on stretching space time in a wave that would carry a potential vessel faster than light, relative to an outside observer.  It works because relative to the space within the wave, the vessel isn't moving at all.  It also avoids the other problems with light speed travel, time dilation and such.\n\nThe problem is no one knows how to build one, but mankind has overcome every obstacle in its way thus far, I think the light speed barrier will be the same.\n\nThose saying something is impossible are usually interrupted by other people doing it.\n\nMore on the Alcubierre Metric here:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive\n\n- Cai"

The fact that there are 13 of them and they weigh 500 lbs each is irrelevant to this problem. The answer is simply to use the equation:\n\nDistance = Speed * Time\n\nThus, if thhey are traveling at 37 mph for 15 miles, the time required is:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nT = 15 mi / 37 mph = (15/37) h * 60 min/hr\n\nT = 24.32 min.\n\nIf they stop for two minutes to eat, then carry on at the same speed, then two minutes is added to their required time (assuming that their eating time is independant from one anaother):\n\nT = 26.32 min\n\nGood luck! :)
. \nLife abounds throughout the galaxy and we presume as well throughout the universe. Some of it has achieved sentience and several have evolved enough to establish viable breeding populations off their home worlds to ensure species survival in the face of a disaster. Earth, we are afraid, may not make the commitment necessary to accomplish this important step in species evolution and may doom itself to eventual extinction.  Over the centuries, your planet was a curious place to visit once or twice and was not considered very interesting . Sure, your wars showed us how undeveloped you are as a species.  Your infantile,(in cosmic terms) dependence on god concepts does not bode well for you and neither does your penchant to breed beyond your planet's ability to sustain you. We are now showing an interest in you because it is not often that we get to observe a species commit suicide. You are so close to maturing as a sentient species and it will be a shame to see you kill yourselves. There are just not enough of you becoming rational enough to force the issue. You let the least among you determine your fate, so be it.

The world's water, most of which is in the oceans, is distributed primarily by the effects of the Earth's gravity, so it is unevely distributed in a way that is approximately equal and opposite to the unevenness of the land, avoiding the continental masses, which are relatively high in altitude, and settling in the oceanic basins, which are relatively low-lying.

It DEPENDS UPON YOUR PROBLEM.\nArtificiaI Intelligence=AI\nAI divides roughly into two schools of thought: Conventional AI and Computational Intelligence (CI).\n\nConventional AI mostly involves methods now classified as machine learning, characterized by formalism and statistical analysis. This is also known as symbolic AI, logical AI, neat AI and Good Old Fashioned Artificial Intelligence (GOFAI). (Also see semantics.) Methods include:\n\nExpert systems: apply reasoning capabilities to reach a conclusion. An expert system can process large amounts of known information and provide conclusions based on them. \nCase based reasoning \nBayesian networks \nBehavior based AI: a modular method of building AI systems by hand. \nComputational Intelligence involves iterative development or learning (e.g. parameter tuning e.g. in connectionist systems). Learning is based on empirical data and is associated with non-symbolic AI, scruffy AI and soft computing. Methods mainly include:\n\nNeural networks: systems with very strong pattern recognition capabilities. \nFuzzy systems: techniques for reasoning under uncertainty, have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer product control systems. \nEvolutionary computation: applies biologically inspired concepts such as populations, mutation and survival of the fittest to generate increasingly better solutions to the problem. These methods most notably divide into evolutionary algorithms (e.g. genetic algorithms) and swarm intelligence (e.g. ant algorithms). \nWith hybrid intelligent systems attempts are made to combine these two groups. Expert inference rules can be generated through neural network or production rules from statistical learning such as in ACT-R. It is thought that the human brain uses multiple techniques to both formulate and cross-check results. Thus, integration is seen as promising and perhaps necessary for true AI.

First we have to go over what is the advantage of a pully.  a pully destrebutes the forces around the pully, so that you do not have the full force in one single point.  \nThis advantage is present weather the pulley turns or not.  For example rock climbers will wrap a rope around a tree to help pull somebody up a cliff.   \nnow a rock climber would love to use a pulley instead of a tree but the point is the advantage is still there with the tree.  \nSo from this you can get that the friction of the base holding the center of the pulley would effect the advantage of the pulley.  \nbut you would have to also say what do you want?  the more friction there is the harder it is to pull but like in the case of the tree and the rock climber, if he stops pulling the other climber will not fall.  As apposed to having a pulley where the rock climber will be easy pulling up but if he stops pulling the rock climber will fall down.  \nso it comes down to what is the advantage of having a pulley. \n\n\nhope this helps\n-David-

Some species of the Whiptail Lizard reproducing without having sex - not completely unusual in nature, but it is for more complex vertebrates. All of the lizards are females and courtship IS still required - pairs are formed, one playing the role of the male, the other female, even though no copulation takes place. Then they switch places. Baby lizards are born through a process known as 'virgin birth'. I think that is pretty interesting - and whoever said homosexuality is not natural??

aight here goes \nin a nutshell, the comparison is that they both produce chemical energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the difference is that in cellular respiration glucose and oxygen are used up and carbon dioxide and water are produced, and in photosynthesis, light and water and carbon dioxide are used and oxygen and glucose are produced.\n\na little more in depth, heres the description of both\ncellular respiration - occurs in the mitochondria, first a glucose molecule goes through glycolysis, which produced 2 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of pyruvate or pyruvic acid - each one of those either enters the crebs cycle and the electron transport chain, or if there isnt enough oxygen it goes into lactic acid cycle - which doesnt produce much energy and produced lactic acid (runners get this and the lactic acid causes muscle soreness), but anyway if there is enough oxygen, the pyruvate goes into the krebs cycle, in it a bunch of things happen to the pyruvate to turn it into different things, ending up in citric acid (krebs cycle is also called citric acid cycle), the krebs cycle produced some more ATPs and other molecules called NADPH and FADPH, after that it enters the stage that produces the most energy the electron transport chain - in this an electron is transported through a bunch of proteins called cytochromes and during this transport protons (H+ ions) are produced, they create a ph gradient between the sides separated by the cristae (inner wall of the mitochondria), and these ions travel through proteins that they call ATP synthease, while doing that they cause ATP to be made from ADP and inorganic phosphate. the electron transport chain produces 28 ATP molecules, giving the whole cycle a total of 32 ATP from one glucose molecule.\n\nPhotosynthesis - occurs in the chloroplast, first light hits an electron in photosystem II, that excites the electron and it goes through an electron transport chain to reach photosystem I, during which it produces energy same way that the etc in respiration does, after that the electron gets hit by light again this time in photosystem I, it gets excited again ang goes through another etc, producing some more ATP as well as NADPH.  these molecules are then used in the Calvin cycle, in which carbon dioxide is absorbed by the plant from the air and used to form 3 carbon sugars which are then combined to form glucose, oxygen is released as a byproduct of that.\n\n\nHope that helps
wen excercising there is a larger concentration of carbon dioxide in ur blood ...this increased concentration will increase the concentration gradient between blood stream and air in alveoli...increase in concentration gradient will increase the rate of diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen...the function of breathing is exchanging the air which are <used up>.{which means that the air has a very low concentration gradient with blood}exchanging the used up gas with new air to keep the steep concentration gradient between air in lungs and blood stream...as the air is being <used up> faster so it must be exchanged faster to keep oxygen supplied at a steady rate....this is the reason but how this process is induced is not fully understood..(biology is very strange most of its branches are not fully understood)

"This may be more than you wanted, but here goes:\n\nSkeletal muscles contract according to the sliding-filament model:\n\nAn action potential originating in the CNS, reaches the axon of the motor neuron. \nThe action potential activates voltage gated calcium ion channels on the axon, and calcium rushes in. \nThe calcium causes the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, within vesicles in the axon to fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing the acetylcholine into the synapse between the axon and the motor end plate specialization in the sarcolemma of the muscle. \nThe acetylcholine diffuses across the synapse and binds to nicotinic receptors on the motor end plate, opening channels in the membrane for sodium and potassium. Sodium rushes in, while potassium trickles out through the sodium-potassium (Na/K) pump located in the sarcolemma. However, because sodium is more permeable, the muscle fiber membrane becomes more positively charged, triggering an action potential. \nThe action potential spreads through the muscle fibre's network of T tubules, depolarizing the inner portion of the muscle fibre. \nThe depolarization activates voltage-gated calcium channels in the T tubule membrane, which are in close proximity to calcium-release channels in the adjacent sarcoplasmic reticulum. \nActivated voltage-gated calcium channels physically interact with calcium-release channels to activate them, causing the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium. \nThe calcium binds to the troponin C present on the thin filaments of the myofibrils. The troponin then allosterically modulates the tropomyosin. Normally the tropomyosin sterically obstructs binding sites for myosin on the thin filament; once calcium binds to the troponin C and causes an allosteric change in the troponin protein troponin T allows tropomyosin to move, unblocking the binding sites. \nMyosin (which has ADP and inorganic phosphate bound to its nucleotide binding pocket and is in a ready state) binds to the newly uncovered binding sites on the thin filament. Myosin is now bound to actin in the strong binding state. The release of ADP and inorganic phosphate causes the myosin head to turn, causing a ratchet movement (Actin acts as a cofactor in the release of inorganic phosphate, expediting the release). This will pull the Z-bands towards each other. It also shortens the sarcomere and the I-band. \nATP binds myosin, allowing it to release actin and be in the weak binding state. (A lack of ATP makes this step impossible, resulting in rigor mortis.) The myosin then hydrolyzes the ATP and uses the energy to move into the ""cocked back"" state while releasing ADP and inorganic phosphate. In general, evidence indicates (predicted and in vivo evidence) that each skeletal muscle myosin head moves 10-12 nm each power stroke, however there is also evidence (in vitro) of variations (smaller and larger) that appear specific to the myosin isoform. \nSteps 7 and 8 repeat as long as ATP is available and calcium is present on thin filament. \nWhile the above steps are occurring, calcium is actively pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. When calcium is no longer present on the thin filament, the tropomyosin changes conformation back to its previous state so as to block the binding sites again. The myosin ceases binding to the thin filament, and the contractions cease. \nThe calcium ions leave the troponin molecule in order to maintain the calcium ion concentration in the sarcoplasm. The active pumping of calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum creates a deficiency in the fluid around the myofibrils. This causes the removal of calcium ions from the troponin. Thus the tropomyosin-troponin complex again covers the binding sites on the actin fiaments and contraction ceases.\n\nThere are two types of voluntary muscular contractions, eccentric and concentric. In the case of eccentric contraction, the force generated is insufficient to overcome the resistance placed on the muscle and"

It applies directly to DC and only sort of to AC.\n\nThe problem with AC is the power. If you drive a perfect inductor or capacitor, you will have voltage and current, but no power.  In real life, the load of an AC circuit has both reactance (capacitive or inductive) and resistance, so there will be power drawn, but in a more complex manner than simply P=IE.\n\nThe load is complex also, the inductance and capacitance are 180 degrees out of phase with each other and 90 degrees out of phase with a real (resistive) load. So when you add them you need to use trigonometry.\n\nDon't even ask about RF circuits. It is another order of magnitude higher in difficulty.
Actually cats do go into REM sleep and they do dream - of course we don't know if their subjective experience of the dream is the same as ours, but they do show all the same markers of dreaming that we use to tell when a person is dreaming.  As well as knowing from a scientiffic viewpoint that cats do experience REM sleep, I can also most definitely assure you that they are NOT always constantly aware of their surroundings.  I have on many occasions casually approached my sleeping cat and reached out to pat her, only to have her nealry jump out of her skin because she had no idea I was there! Cats spend a lot of time in slow wave sleep and a lot of time resting but awake, but they do sleep deeply too!

Your phrasing makes the question unclear (what goes where?) so I'll just go through the different possibilities.  One is this:\n\n\nsq(5x)*sq(x-4)*sq(5)\n\nYou can multiply together things in square roots.  Let's do this:\n\nsq(5(5x)(x-4)=\nsq(25x(x-4))=\nsq(25x^2-100x)\n\n\nAnother possibility is this:\n\nsq(5x)*sq(x)-4sq(5)=\n\nBring the x out of sq(5x), by making it sq(x) (because you can take out things that are multiplied in square roots, but make sure they are still under a square root sign!)\n\nsq(5)*sq(x)*sq(x)-4sq(5).\n\nsq(x)*sq(x)=x.  We are multiply two square roots, so bring the x's under the same one.  Multiply them, we get x^2.  The square root of x^2 is x.\n\nx(sq(5))-4sq(5)=sq(5)(x-4)\n\nThere's your answer, if that was indeed the way I should have interpreted the question.\n\nHope this helps.

"If you're trying to visualize it, there are a couple of images that you can use as props. Imagine that I have a bowling ball and I drop it into the middle of a mattress. Now imagine that I take a marble and drop it onto that mattress. The path of the marble will be altered by the curvature that (in this case, the weight) of the bowling ball creates along the mattress, and the marble will roll down into the dip that it created.\n\nNow imagine that the universe retains the same qualities of the mattress, but -- to explain it VERY SIMPLY, because there are many more likely dimensions -- it's three dimensional, and when you drop the bowling ball, it's ""suspended"" (like a marble in Jell-O), and the path that it creates along it in space encompasses the entire ball, and becomes greater with mass.\n\nThere you have an extremely short and deceptively simple answer that will help introduce you to the tougher concepts. \n\nPick up a copy of Hyperspace, by Michio Kaku, the cofounder of superstring theory.

Ok, so you have 500 mL of methanol. A specific gravity of .792 g/mL means there are 396 grams of methanol. Concentration (molarity) is moles per liter. So those are theu nits you want. So you take 396 grams of methanol and divide it by the molecular weight (32) to get 12.375 moles. However, that is for 500 mL or .5 L. You want 1 L. So you multiply it by 2. Your answer shoudl be 24.75 moles/liter. \n\nHope this helps and keep up the good work.
Evolution makes more sense.  So...evolving from apes.
Use the fact that angles are the same every 2pi .... in other words 0 = 2pi = 4pi etc., and pi = 3pi = 5pi, etc.  This is because 2pi is the complete rotation of a circle, or 360 degrees.\n\nSo, 17pi is simply the same angle as pi.\n\nSo, tan 17pi = tan pi = 0\n\nSimilarly, 8pi/3 = 8pi/3 - 6pi/3 = 2pi/3\n\nSo, cos 8pi/3 = cos 2pi/3 = -1/2\n\n~ ♥ ~

Well basically in osmosis, there are 3 solutions: hypertonic,hypotonic and isotonic. Drinking saltwater causes a hypertonic solution in your cells. The most basic way to explain this is as you drink saltwater, the salt solutions gather outside your cells. No water comes in and the remaining water gets pushed out causing crenation, shriveling of the cell. You can see it externally when your hands wrinkle when wet for too long right? Imagine it acting through your internal organs so I think its kinda like dehydration from within, which is exactly what people try to avoid  when they drink saltwater out of desperation right? hehe.

If they are anti-retroviral, they target reverse transcriptase.  Reverse transcriptase is the enzyme which converts ssRNA to dsDNA.  \n\nI recall being taught that human cells do not have any reverse transcriptase, and that's why these drugs should work.\n\nHowever, I also recall picking up later the fact that there is some reverse transcriptase activity in humans (one paper is referenced below).\n\nThat being said, viral RTase activity will be way higher than human telomerase (the subject of the paper referenced below), since most of our cells are typically non-dividing.  So targetting RTase activity still works because the viral enzyme is extremely active, and the virus will be greatly disrupted by blocking its activity.  Wheras the human RTase is normally inactive, and non-replicating cells don't need it.
It is absorbed.  It might be re-emitted or the energy could be emitted as smaller energy photons ie heat.
"Previous answer was a little incorrect.  In his example 195/55, 195 is the width and 55 means 55% aspect ratio, ie the depth of the tyre from rin to tread is 55% of the width (thus 107.25 mm in this case).  R refers to speed rating of the tyre.  Depending on where it has been manufactured there may be reference to max inflation pressure or also temperature.  To work out the dia add the wheel dia (16"" in this case) to twice the depth calculated as above, making allowances that wheel dia is normally in inches  and the other dims are in mm.  R 16 does not therefore mean radius 16"" but dia 16"" and the tyre is an R speed rating."
These are just similar ratios:\n\n500 gallons / 20 minutes = x gallons / 30 minutes\n\n500 / 20 = x / 30\n\nNow solve for x (you can cross multiply if you like):\n20x = 15000\nx = 750 gallons.\n\nIt's also rather intuitive to see that you got 500 gallons in 20 minutes.  So in 10 minutes more, you will pump half again as much.  500 + 250 = 750 gallons.
"Minerals are natural compounds formed through geological processes. The term ""mineral"" encompasses not only the material's chemical composition, but also the mineral's structure. Minerals range in composition from pure elements and simple salts to very complex silicates with thousands of known forms (organic compounds are excluded). The study of minerals is called mineralogy. To be classified as a ""true"" mineral, a substance must be a solid and have a crystal structure. It must also be an inorganic, naturally-occurring, homogeneous substance with a defined chemical composition.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNatural resources are naturally occurring substances that are considered valuable in their relatively unmodified (natural) form. A commodity is generally considered a natural resource when the primary activities associated with it are extraction and purification, as opposed to creation. Thus, mining, petroleum extraction, fishing, and forestry are generally considered natural-resource industries, while agriculture is not. Natural resources are often classified into renewable and non-renewable resources."

Yeasts and moulds are fungi - these are fundamentally different from bacteria (about as different as we are from a tree!) - if you're interested check back on what makes different kinds of cell different - eg. plants have a cell wall and animals don't. Fungi produce hyphae (a bit like plant roots) which search for nutrients - these will make the colony look furry. Bacteria are single cell micro-organisms and a colony of them (I'm assuming you're looking at an agar plate) is just a mass of clones of themselves. It will look like a circle (or in liquid suspension a sphere) because cells multiply from the point of infection out. Sometimes they can be blank in the middle where nutrients have run out in the centre so the bacteria there have died (not moved!). That's the main difference - hope that's helped a bit!

"quantum mechanics is a fundamental branch of theoretical physics that replaces classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism at the atomic and subatomic levels. It is the underlying mathematical framework of many fields of physics and chemistry, including condensed matter physics, atomic physics, molecular physics, computational chemistry, quantum chemistry, particle physics, and nuclear physics. Along with general relativity, quantum mechanics is one of the pillars of modern physic\n    \n\nThe term quantum (Latin, ""how much"") refers to discrete units that the theory assigns to certain physical quantities, such as the energy of an atom at rest (see Figure 1, at right). The discovery that waves could be measured in particle-like small packets of energy called quanta led to the branch of physics that deals with atomic and subatomic systems which we today call Quantum Mechanics. The foundations of quantum mechanics were established during the first half of the twentieth century by Werner Heisenberg, Max Planck, Louis de Broglie, Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, Max Born, John von Neumann, Paul Dirac, Albert Einstein, Wolfgang Pauli and others. Some fundamental aspects of the theory are still actively studied.\n\nQuantum mechanics is a more fundamental theory than Newtonian mechanics and classical electromagnetism, in the sense that it provides accurate and precise descriptions for many phenomena that these ""classical"" theories simply cannot explain on the atomic and subatomic level. It is necessary to use quantum mechanics to understand the behavior of systems at atomic length scales and smaller. For example, if Newtonian mechanics governed the workings of an atom, electrons would rapidly travel towards and collide with the nucleus. However, in the natural world the electron normally remains in a stable orbit around a nucleus — seemingly defying classical electromagnetism.\n\nQuantum mechanics was initially developed to explain the atom, especially the spectra of light emitted by different atomic species. The quantum theory of the atom developed as an explanation for the electron's staying in its orbital, which could not be explained by Newton's laws of motion and by classical electromagnetism.\nhope this helps u out....\nhave a great day......"
Easy:  the distance in both directions is exactly the same = 225 miles.  Recall, also, that distance =  speed * time.\n\nAssume the plane's speed is x, wind speed is y, and that both remain constant in both directions:\n\nWith the wind, d = (x + y) * time\nAgainst the wind, d = (x-y) * time\n\nso (x + y) * 2 hours = (x - y) * 3¾ hours\n\n2x + 2y = 225 miles\n\n3¾x - 3¾y = 225 miles\n\nNow, you need to multiply each equation by a factor so that the y's have the same multiplier, thus:\n\n15x + 15y = 1687.5 miles\n15x -  15y = 900 miles\n\nNow, add the two equations together, thus eliminating the Y value:\n\n30x = 2587.5 miles, and thus the plane's speed, x = 86.25 miles/hour\n\nNow, substitute the value for x back into one of the equations to solve for y:\n\n(2 * 86.25 mph) + 2y = 225\n\n172.5 + 2y = 225\n\n2y = 52.5 miles/hour\n\ny = 26.25 miles per hour

"Amount of daylight time is caused by the tilt of the Earth's axis of rotation compared to its orbit around the Sun.  In the summertime (either North or South hemisphere), the axis is pointed toward the Sun, and in the wintertime it is pointed away from the Sun.\n\nThe seasons are ""opposite"" between the hemispheres, because while the axis is pointed away from the Sun in the North, it is pointed toward the Sun in the South.\n\nThe longer daylight hours are what makes summer ""summer"".  Yes, the Southern Hemisphere has longer daylight hours in their summer."

Presuming you mean real space ships operating in a zero-gravity environment and not just fake spaceships on a film set?  Funkymonk is right, gentle accelleration followed by a turn-over mid trip and an equal dceleration would create a sensation of 'gravity' through the soles of the feet.\n\nAlternatively, in (say) a orbital space station, the interplay of centripetal and centrifugal forces created by spinning a structure, with its occupants, about its axis much like in the opening sequences of the film 2001, will create a sensation of gravity (tricky concept, very hard to understand ... serious maths involved) .  A large diameter structure spinning slowly would produce the best effect.\n\nMuscle wasting resulting from long periods in zero gravity is a major impediment to long space journeys, the gravity problem is one that needs to be resolved so that cosmonaughts can survive back in earth gravity once they return.
The beam is at 48 degrees to the horizontal.. Its weight of 588N acts at its middle (0.5L) vertically downwards. There is a load of 1770N at its end (1L). The tension due to the cable acts perpendicular to the beam and at a distance of 0.66L. Now, the basic equation in physics tells that the clockwise moment is balanced by the counter-clockwise moment in a stationary object. So, if 'T' is the tension in the cable;\n\nT*0.66L = 588*0.5L*cos48 + 1770*1L*cos48\n\nsolve this to get the answer to A).\n\nThe answer to B) is got by equating the horizontal forces to zero as the beam is stationary. The equation is:\n\nHR - T*cos(90-48) = 0.\n\nhere HR is the horizontal component of the reaction force by the floor. T is as above\n\nC) The vertical component is got by equating the vertical forces to zero.\n\nVR - 588 - 1770 + T*sin(90-48) = 0

Theoretically, assuming it was possible, the object would oscillate, with an ever decreasing amplitude, due to the conservation of energy. The man would jump in and fall right through, past the middle and towards the otherside of the earth, but would not 'shoot out' of the otherside, because energy would be used overcoming the frictional forces (air resistance) hence he would oscillate with an ever decreasing amplitude until he is finally stationary, where he/it would stay forever. Such motion would be described as damped harmonic motion.

"Immunology is a broad branch of biomedical science that covers the study of all aspects of the immune system in all organisms. It deals with, among other things, the physiological functioning of the immune system in states of both health and disease; malfunctions of the immune system in immunological disorders (autoimmune diseases, hypersensitivities, immune deficiency, allograft rejection); the physical, chemical and physiological characteristics of the components of the immune system in vitro, in situ, and in vivo. Immunology has various applications in several disciplines of science, and as such is further divided.\n\n\n\nEndocrinology is a branch of medicine dealing with disorders of the endocrine system and its specific secretions called hormones. Hormones are molecules that act as signals from one type of cells to another. Most hormones reach their targets via the blood. Although every organ system secretes and responds to hormones (including the brain, lungs, heart, intestine, skin, and the kidney), the clinical specialty of endocrinology focuses primarily on the endocrine organs, meaning the organs whose primary function is hormone secretion. These organs include the pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, ovaries and testes, and pancreas.\n\nAn endocrinologist is a doctor who specializes in treating disorders of the endocrine system, such as diabetes, hyperthyroidism, and many others (see list of diseases below). A disease due to a disorder of the endocrine system is often called a ""hormone imbalance,"" but is technically known as an endocrinopathy or endocrinosis."
Coyotes are carnivores/scavengers.  Members of the dog family have a relatively short digestive system compared to herbivores which need more intestinal length to break down plants.  coyoytes wpold break down protein in their stomach and at the start of their small intestine, then absorb the nutrients (Mostly amino acids).
The CCD in your camera produces electrons in proportion to the amount of light falling on it. But the Sun is so intense it overloads the chip and those pixels just stop working. It's the electronic equivalent of flash blindness, though it recovers quickly.
Viruses are tiny geometric structures that can only reproduce inside a living cell. They range in size from 20 to 250 nanometers (one nanometer is one billionth of a meter). Outside of a living cell, a virus is dormant, but once inside, it takes over the resources of the host cell and begins the production of more virus particles. Viruses are more similar to mechanized bits of information, or robots, than to animal life. \n\nBacteria are one-celled living organisms. The average bacterium is 1,000 nanometers long. (If a bacterium were my size, a typical virus particle would look like a tiny mouse-robot. If an average virus were my size, a bacterium would be the size of a dinosaur over ten stories tall. Bacteria and viruses are not peers!) All bacteria are surrounded by a cell wall. They can reproduce independently, and inhabit virtually every environment on earth, including soil, water, hot springs, ice packs, and the bodies of plants and animals. \n\nMost bacteria are harmless to humans. In fact, many are quite beneficial. The bacteria in the environment are essential for the breakdown of organic waste and the recycling of elements in the biosphere. Bacteria that normally live in humans can prevent infections and produce substances we need, such as vitamin K. Bacteria in the stomachs of cows and sheep are what enable them to digest grass. Bacteria are also essential to the production of yogurt, cheese, and pickles. Some bacteria cause infections in humans. In fact, they are a devastating cause of human disease.
Everyone above is correct, except I do believe that the black hole itself does have infinite gravity (that's the reason the light cannot escape...) because the warping of space-time is infinite at the point of infinite density.
The tension flange acts like the string in an archer's bow and the maximum force that can be developed is limited only by the yield stress of the flange material. \nThe compression flange acts like a strut and is susceptible to buckling before yield stress can be developed. Unless the compression flange is fully restrained then the beam may fail by lateral torsional buckling.

No, nighthawk is an idiot. I'm fairly certain historical records of climate would show an increase in global temperature - but then if you engage your brain for one second you'd realise thats because we'd already started to effect the environment by the time we started recording climate!\n\nTo be honest, the 10 year time window is bull. We're not really sure exactly what is going to happen or when. This isn't because scientists are idiots, its because the Earth is a complex system that has been operating for 4.5 billion years - we're still learning how it works.\n\nWhat we do know is that the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has more than doubled since the industrial revolution, and that can be attributed to humans, not natural processes. I don't think we can reverse what we've done before we see more drastic effects (last years hurricane season was justa  taster).\n\nHowever, the world isn't going to flood overnight. The Earth is actually a very robust system...it will look after itself. Natural buffers in the system will give humanity time to study, learn and then mitigate the hazards of global warming.
The Big Bang theory makes quantitative predictions that can be verified. So do other theories like the now abandoned, Steady State theory. These predictions can be experimentally verified and the results used to kill a theory that made the wrong predictions.\n\nThere are currently no other theories that have such overwhelming supporting evidence as the Big Bang Theory. That doesn´t mean it´s the proven truth. It only means we don´t have anything else that does as good or better.

A rhombic section is a term used mostly in the field of geology. If you cut a rock in half to see a cross section of it, if you find the plane at which you had cut it to look like a rhombus, you have a rhombic section. The term is also used in the topic of feldspars.
The ocean is definitely more interesting. Space is just as the name implies. True, it is mind-boggling to think of such a concept as infinite space, but the ocean is what fascinates me. Humans have been able to venture into space even before we had the ability to explore our own oceans. We still can't chart our oceans, and I think that we should focus on this more before we send out more shuttles to space.

"The word ""latent"" means ""hidden"". Latent energy is the energy required for a substance to change its state. Consider water boiling. The temperature will be constant at 100 degrees Celsius; it will not increase even though energy is being absorbed by the water. This energy is latent energy. It is being used to weaken the inter particle forces. Latent energy however does increase kinetic energy of particles. If it did not do so, particles would not be able to overcome the forces of attraction between them and move away from each other. Substances would not be able to change state."

Williamson is a good way to make unsymmetrical ethers\n\nYou need \n\n-an alcohol (R-OH) , \n-a pretty strong base (B:), \n-and something with a good leaving group such as an alkyl halide or a tosylate/mesylate (R'-X). \n\nYou're R'-X should be primary or secondary because the reaction you will do will be SN2. \n\nThe overall reaction is \nR-OH + B: + R'-X -> R-O-R' + B: + HX\n\nR-O-R' is the ether. Sometimes the side products can be other things such as H2, etc. The base can just be Na for example.\n\n1. R-OH + B: -> R-O-  \n\nthat means that the base abstracts a proton to make the alcohol an alkoxide. \n\n2. R-O- + R'-X -> R-O-R'\n\nThe alkoxide acts as a nucleophile and attack the R'-X. The ether will be your product.
you should know first the conversion factor or equivalent of the two units. Then divide or multilply.
Venous blood goes into the liver through the hepatic portal vein before it enters the major systemic circulation. This blood comes from the digestive system so it is nutrient rich. When it percolates through the liver the cells take the nutrients they need for metabolism and phagocytic cells remove bacteria or foreign matter. The livers glycogen stores are the first glucose reserve and are mobilized quickly to maintain blood sugar levels for hours.

"The anode of a diode is the positive terminal connected to the p-doped silicon.  It is where you would hook the positive voltage in order to forward bias it (or the negative voltage in order to reverse bias it).\n\nThe cathode of a diode is the negative terminal hooked to the n-doped silicon.\n\nAlso, the word ""cathode"" is used for vacuum tubes; the cathode emits electrons and they land on the plate.  (such as in a cathode ray tube or CRT)"
Human blood never rests. It never stops cleansing and feeding each cell in the body from the moment we are born until we die. Each cell is bathed in this cleansing stream throughout its entire life span, and owes its moment-to-moment existence to this never ending supply stream.\nIn the physical body the blood uses a process of exchange to accomplish its work. It goes like this: a red blood cell travels through the lungs until it reaches a very thin membrane which separates the blood from the air moving through the lung. This membrane is so thin that the red blood cell can absorb oxygen from the air through it. The hemoglobin in the red blood cell latches on to the oxygen and holds it for the long journey to the various parts of the body. At this same time the red blood cell is releasing its load of carbon dioxide through the membrane out into the lung to be exhaled. The red blood cell never stops during this process. This process happens while it is moving through the very small vessels in the lung, being pushed along by the force of contraction of the heart beat. The Creator made sure that there would be enough time for all the red blood cells to complete their exchange before they leave the lungs.\n\nOnce they leave the lungs, they travel to every organ, tissue and system in the body, making sure that each cell has its needs met at all times. The path that the red blood cell takes after it leaves the lungs appears to be random, but each red blood cell is guided by the Creator so that each cell in the body can receive its full nourishment of oxygen and can also release its load of carbon dioxide to the red blood cell, so it can be transported back to the lungs to be exhaled. If this nourishing stream ever stops, then the level of carbon dioxide quickly builds up to poisonous levels in the cells. \n\nNow, let me pose what sounds like a silly question. What would happen if the body tissues wanted to hang on to their carbon dioxide and not go through the process of exchange with the blood.? The answer to this question is so obvious that it appears absurd. The body tissues would die and death of the entire body would soon follow. It is obvious what would happen in the human body if any of the body parts refused to allow this exchange through the blood. Now let me ask the same question of the Body of Christ. What happens when a believer refuses to give up his sin to the cleansing power of the Blood? What would happen if he stubbornly refused to release his sin and let the Blood cleanse and renew him? He would loose the only provision God has made for cleansing from sin. Nothing else in the world can substitute for the cleansing power of the Blood of Christ. If a sinner refuses to release his sin and be cleansed by the Blood then he stays in spiritual death. \n\nIn the human blood each cell must release its toxins to the cleansing power of the blood. In the Body of Christ each believer must release his or her own personal sin to the cleansing power of Christ's Blood. In return, he receives not just cleansing, but eternal life, deeper sanctification, and the very presence of Jesus within. Who would not want such an exchange? Anyone foolish enough to want to retain his sin and refuse the exchange of the Blood is a fool indeed.
Most video codecs, like the one in your webcam, use a system of compression that counts on sameness. That is, it only reports that the video needs to change if it percieves a substantial change, like your subject moving.  You might be able to use a webcam or similiar, and write a little code, perhaps in visual basic, that would exploit this trick. Have it give your turret X,Y coordinates of the originally chosen weirdo in red, and stay with that red.\n\nI've seen this implemented on digital cameras for focus tracking.\n\n\nGood luck, this is a doozy.

"Jupiter, while larger than all the other planets in our system put together, is still far too small to have ever been a star in its own rights. Furthermore, stars don't just ""burn out"". Depending on thier mass, they can undergo a number of different evolutions; many will go super-nova, spewing out unimaginable ammounts of heavy atoms and radiation, others will diminish into brown or whites ""dwaves"", still others will form black holes. \n\nIt might be possible (though incredibly unlikely) for a solar system to ""ensnare"" passing planetoids, but they would be unlikely to form stable orbits in the time that our solar system has been around.\n\nIt's an interesting idea, and although jupiter could never have been a star, it is proponderously unlikely, but not impossible, that it could have originated outside of our solar system."

With a teacher that can teach it in a way you can understand it. Anything is very easy once you know how, but most books explain it in complicated ways so it seems complicated. \n\nIf you know how to add, subtract, multiply and divide, then the rest is just applying different rules to change the equations.\n\nI took a college calculus class twice and failed. The first thing the instructors did was take out a ti-85 calculator and we started. The third time I took the class, it was with a Janapese instructor who did not allow calculators in the class. He explained it so easy I couldn't believe it. So a good instructor is your best chance at learning math with ease.
Globes are tilted -- the angle is about 23.5 degrees -- because that is the angle between the axis of rotation of the Earth and the normal of the Ecliptic. The Ecliptic is the orbital plane of the Solar System.\n\nThe tilt is responsible for the seasons. If the angle was zero degrees, the Sun would always travel the same apparent path through the sky (over the equator, of course) and there would be no seasons. The reason the seasons change is in summer, the pole of the Earth is tilted toward the Sun and more light falls on that hemisphere, warming it up. On the opposite hemisphere, pointed more away from the sun, less light falls and it's colder. Since the tilt of the axis remains more or less constant, the seasons change as the Earth orbits the sun, warming up opposite hemispheres alternately.
"There really isn't such a thing as a one-way mirror.  What is referred to as a one-way mirror is simply an arrangement involving a semi-silvered mirror and two rooms, one kept dark, and one kept very bright.  The mirror is set up to reflect most light, but also let a small amount of light pass through to the other side.\n\nIf you're in the brightly-lit room, and you look at the mirror, you see the reflections of the bright objects in the room.  The things in the dimly-lit room don't shine brightly enough to be noticed against the background of the bright reflections.\n\nIf you're in the dark room, there are no distracting reflections from your side of the room, so you see the small amount of light that passes through the mirror.\n\nIt's like mirrored sunglasses, you can see out, because between the glasses and your eyes things are quite dark, but people on the other side of the glasses just see reflections.  Turn your mirrored sunglasses around, and they still work the same way (though the colour of the reflections might change as seen from the outside if the sunglasses are tinted as well as mirrored).\n\nIf you were to take the ""one way mirror"" out of its frame and turn it around, it would not reverse the direction of visibility, because whether or not you can see is a function of the lighting conditions, not any built-in direction in the glass.  Conversely, if you were to turn down the lights in the bright room, and turn on a light in the formerly dark room, people would be able to see through the mirror to the side they were supposed not to see.\n\nNow, on to the question.  There have been various suggestions relating to the visible gap between a finger touching the mirror and its reflection, but these all just measure the thickness of the glass.  The mirror part is not the glass, it's the metal coating on the back.  The glass is there to protect the metal, give it shape, and be smooth.  All common household mirrors are built this way, so all of them will appear to be ""one way glass"" by the test provided.\n\nThe best way to check is to get right up to the mirror, cup your hands around your eyes to block out light, and shine a bright light at a part of the mirror which is outside the piece you've blocked off with your hands.  If it's a one-way mirror, you will be able to see through the glass and will see the spot your light makes on things in the room behind."
If I didn't have to sleep, I probably would anyway - either that or take up meditation - so I could still be able to clear my mind temporarily every day.\n\nI don't think I'd have too much time. As it is now, I don't have enough time, but I'm hoping I'd spend more time working rather than just procrastinating. Of course, procrastinating isn't all that bad. It mainly just means that I'll spend more time trying to help people out here on Yahoo! Answers.

Ocean temperature can increase or decrease temperature & precipitation in an area.\n\nOn a small scale, land & sea breezes are created by differences in temperature of the water & land. At night the water is warmer so low pressure is created, air rises, moves inland, falls, & replaces the rising air by moving back toward the sea. This is a land breeze b/c it comes from the land. The opposite is true during the day, a sea breeze.\n\nOn a larger scale, ocean currents sending water from the equator toward the poles keeps many places in the world warm enough to live in. Europe is kept habitable b/c of this. The warm Gulf Current moving up alongside North America travels toward the coast of Europe. The warm, moist air is brought inland giving them rain & mild temps. W/o this current, most of Northern Europe would be very very cold.\n\nWarmer ocean water is more conducive to storm formation. Areas in the tropics have a plentiful supply of warm moist air. This air rises to form thunderstorms & tropical storms. These areas have more rain b/c of this.\n\nAir is directly influenced by ocean temperatures. Air masses forming over an area, pick up the characteristics of that area. If the area is mostly water then the air mass will be moist, if it is warm, then the air mass will become warm, etc.
Because hot air holds more water.  Hot air also seeks to rise, which pushes down cold air.  As it mingles with the cold air, it loses some of its heat.  When the air reaches a cool enough temperature for the amount of water it has in it - it rains.
"There are 2 views regarding Jatropha , its considered as a miraculous in curing many diseases, while some believe it causes cancer.                                                                                                                   Folk Medicine \nAccording to Hartwell, the extracts are used in folk remedies for cancer. Reported to be abortifacient, anodyne, antiseptic, cicatrizant, depurative, diuretic, emetic, hemostat, lactagogue, narcotic, purgative, rubefacient, styptic, vermifuge, and vulnerary, physic nut is a folk remedy for alopecia, anasorca, ascites, burns, carbuncles, convulsions, cough, dermatitis, diarrhea, dropsy, dysentery, dyspepsia, eczema, erysipelas, fever, gonorrhea, hernia, incontinence, inflammation, jaundice, neuralgia, paralysis, parturition, pleurisy, pneumonia, rash, rheumatism, scabies, sciatica, sores, stomachache, syphilis, tetanus, thrush, tumors, ulcers, uterosis, whitlows, yaws, and yellow fever (Duke and Wain, 1981; List and Horhammer, 1969–1979). Latex applied topically to bee and wasp stings (Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk, 1962). Mauritians massage ascitic limbs with the oil. Cameroon natives apply the leaf decoction in arthritis (Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk, 1962). Colombians drink the leaf decoction for venereal disease (Morton, 1981). Bahamans drink the decoction for heartburn. Costa Ricans poultice leaves onto erysipelas and splenosis. Guatemalans place heated leaves on the breast as a lactagogue. Cubans apply the latex to toothache. Colombians and Costa Ricans apply the latex to burns, hemorrhoids, ringworm, and ulcers. Barbadians use the leaf tea for marasmus, Panamanians for jaundice. Venezuelans take the root decoction for dysentery (Morton, 1981). Seeds are used also for dropsy, gout, paralysis, and skin ailments (Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk, 1962). Leaves are regarded as antiparasitic, applied to scabies; rubefacient for paralysis, rheumatism; also applied to hard tumors (Hartwell, 1967–1971). Latex used to dress sores and ulcers and inflamed tongues (Perry, 1980). Seed is viewed as aperient; the seed oil emetic, laxative, purgative, for skin ailments. Root is used in decoction as a mouthwash for bleeding gums and toothache. Otherwise used for eczema, ringworm, and scabies (Perry, 1980; Duke and Ayensu, 1984). We received a letter from the Medicial Research Center of the University of the West Indies shortly after the death of Jamacian singer Robert Morley, ""I just want you to know that this is not because of Bob Morley's illness, why I am revealing this ... my dream was: this old lady came to me in my sleep with a dish in her hands; she handed the dish to me filled with some nuts. I said to her, ""What were those?"" She did not answer. I said to her, ""PHYSIC NUTS."" She said to me, ""This is the cure for cancer."" We found this Jamaican dream rather interesting. Four antitumor compounds, including jatropham and jatrophone, are reported from other species of Jatropha (Duke and Ayensu, 1984). Homeopathically used for cold sweats, colic, collapse, cramps, cyanosis, diarrhea, leg cramps. \nChemistry\nPer 100 g, the seed is reported to contain 6.6 g H2O, 18.2 g protein, 38.0 g fat, 33.5 g total carbohydrate, 15.5 g fiber, and 4.5 g ash (Duke and Atchley, 1983). Leaves, which show antileukemic activity, contain a-amyrin, b-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and campesterol, 7-keto-b-sitosterol, stigmast-5-ene-3-b, 7-a-diol, and stigmast-5-ene-3 b, 7 b-diol (Morton, 1981). Leaves contain isovitexin and vitexin. From the drug (nut?) saccharose, raffinose, stachyose, glucose, fructose, galactose, protein, and an oil, largely of oleic- and linoleic-acids (List and Horhammer, 1969–1979), curcasin, arachidic-, linoleic-, myristic-, oleic-, palmitic-, and stearic-acids are also reported (Perry, 1980).\n\nThe research in Thailand initially and later around the world have now proved that Jatropha oil can cause skin cancer.

The mountain was given its English name by Andrew Waugh, the British surveyor-general of India. With both Nepal and Tibet closed to foreign travel, he wrote:\n\n…I was taught by my respected chief and predecessor, Colonel Sir Geo. Everest to assign to every geographical object its true local or native appellation. … But here is a mountain, most probably the highest in the world, without any local name that we can discover, whose native appellation, if it has any, will not very likely be ascertained before we are allowed to penetrate into Nepal.… In the meantime the privilege as well as the duty devolves on me to assign…a name whereby it may be known among citizens and geographers and become a household word among civilized nations.\n\nHence Waugh chose to name the mountain after George Everest, first using the spelling Mont Everest, and then Mount Everest.
Respiration is the exchange of gases in the atmosphere with the plants. The plants take in carbon dioxide and give off oxygen.\n\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which plants use the sun's energy to make sugars that they need to survive.
I know this is a homework question, I edited the book your teacher pulled this out off. My first guess is to say read the middle part of the chapter where evolution is discussed but…\n\nStart by thinking about the organism in question, what is it stereo typically known for? \nThe owl has big eyes, the rabbit big ears and milkweed (well that’s the tricky one I’ll let you do on your own but as a hint why do you think they call it Milkweed.).\n\nThen think about what they eat; \nAn owl eats rodents at night, and a rabbit eats tall grass during the day. \n\nThen think about what type of animal they are; \nAn owl is a predator, and a rabbit is pray. \n\nThe reason an owl has big eyes is to better spot it’s pray at night. Since it eats rodents like mice and chipmunks it has to be fast and nimble and have good eye sight. The bigger the eyes the more light they get, the more light they get the more it can see, the more it sees the more it eats, the more it eats the longer it lives, the longer it lives the better chance it has to mate and pass on the trait for bigger eyes.  \n\nNow from what I have told you figure out why rabbits have big ears. \n\nThen think about why a weed would secrete  a milky sap when damaged, and what animal the plant might protect by doing it, and what the benefit might be.

Life originated on Earth - as far as archeologists have figured - by RNA. RNA are a bunch of proteins that line up, and once lined up they perform a function - copy/paste. They split and create identicle RNA. RNA later evolved to DNA - DNA is the double helix, where RNA was a single helix. DNA was smarter and controlled RNA production. RNA is like a blueprint. RNA is believed to have formed in one of two ways. \nOne leading theory believes that microscopic cracks in clay got packed with protein strands, and after a few million years a few of them lined up right and turned into RNA. \nAnother theory that is gaining more credibility with time states that in deep oceans, underwater volcanic vents created high pressure and high energy, and there was a lot of smashing about of proteins down there, and eventually they randomly aligned - again we're talking like millions of years of chance smashings before a few were lined up in a pattern that would survive.\nFrom there, RNA smashed into eachother similarly to the protein strands until two perfectly lined up, and bam: DNA. (Again a few million years time probably went by)\nThis continued, and soon DNA evolved with cell walls into Bacteria, and bacteria absorbed different sorts of RNA and smaller, weaker bacteria, and they used these smaller species as tools to become a stronger whole being, and soon they had absorbed a few different things, formed a strong outer wall, and became cells. \nNeat, huh?

We observe four dimensions everyday, three spatial and time.\nTime is called a dimension because it makes mathematical sense to do so. \n\nBut...theories such as string theory predict that the space we live in has in fact many more dimensions (frequently 10, 11 or 26), but that the universe measured along these additional dimensions is subatomic in size. As a result, we perceive only the three spatial dimensions that have macroscopic size.\n\nThis is not so strange as it sounds, which I'll show with an example. Imagine you are in an airplane, flying over sea. Seen from a height, the sea looks flat, two-dimensional. But when the plane looses height we start to perceive the waves, that move in a third direction we could see before.\n\nThe universe could be the same. Four macroscopic dimensions and a few more, hidden ones. We can only perceive them for instance, by the small effects their existence might have on subatomic particles.\n\nThe Universe obviously can have a shape also if we consider the three macroscopic, spatial dimensions.  But before we take on the three-dimensional Universe first a two-dimensional example.\n\nImagine a two-dimensional plane. An ant walking on it can go in any direction, without finding a boundary. Secondly if it keeps walking in one direction, it will never come back on the same place. The plane is infinite, without bounds.\n\nNext the surface of a two-dimensional sphere. This time the walking ant again will not come to a boundary, but he will, after some time, come back to the some place. The sphere is without bounds, but finite.\n\nWe see that these two ant Universes are different, although a shortsighted ant, would never be able to distinguish the two.\n\nNext lets move to our Universe. We are short-sighted ants too. Our telescopes can not see far enough to distinguish if we are in the three-dimensional equivalent of the sphere of the plane.\n\nAnd it is even worse. As we are living in three dimensions more complicated space are possible. Imagine we are living in a cube, a special one with the following property. As soon as we leave the cube through one side, we enter it again on the side opposite where we left. This space is the 3-dimensional equivalent of a torus.\n\nYou see were we go: in three dimensions much more complicated space are possible.  Implausible? Maybe. Maybe not. At present we really have no way to tell. Just as the short-sighted ant.
First of all linear and angular momentum are two different things altogether.It doesn't follows from what you have said that linear momentum = angular momentum.\nIn any case you will always have to multiply the linear momentum by 'r'  to get the angular momentum.\n\nMomentum = m*v\nEnergy /distance   * time = Force * distance /distance  * time\n=Force * time=mass * acc  * time = mass* velocity \nSo  you are correct dimensionally\n\nEnergy* Space * time=energy *distance * time\n=Force * distance* distance *time\n=mass* vel *distance^2  so this isn't momentum\n\nCurvature of space time will have units of 1/(space time)\n\nFind out yourselves whether next two are correct \n\nCurvature of gravitational mass ??\nYou probably mean curvature caused by mass.\nI am not sure of this part though .In any case curvature will have units of (1/space time)\n\n\nJust remember\nConservation of energy follows from isotropy of time \nConservation of momentum follows from isotropy of space
"The ratio of 1/(4pi epsilon_0) -- the Coulomb constant -- results from nothing more than which unit system you are working in. in some unit systems this fraction is just 1. In the form you present, you're using the MKS system.\n\nthe 4pi is the value of having integrated over all theta from 0 to 2pi and all phi from 0 to pi.\n\nepsilon_0 is the permittivity (aka, dielectric constant, or dielectric function) of free space. Free space is what we think of as being completely empty space. It is also the ""base unit"" of dielectric values. So, for example, if you have a capacitor with a dielectric material inside, the dielectric constant epsilon might be written as epsilon*epsilon_0 where epsilon itself might be say 4 or 5.5, etc. The dielectric constant can be thought of as nothing more than a ""screening parameter"". All it does is scale (or screen) the electric field strength within a system (with respect to the ""unscreened"" values which are obtained in free space -- using epsilon_0)\n\nHere is the value of epsilon_0 (as given by google) Note the units: \nhttp://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=epsilon_0\n\n\nAnd here is the Google Calculator operation for the ""electrostatic constant"": \n\nhttp://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=1%2F%284*pi*epsilon_0%29\n\nSo -- it's all about the unit system in which you do a problem.

"Hydrocodone is a morphine molecule with a methyl group and a hydrogen atom attached to it. Essentialy it is morphine that has to be demethylized by the liver before it attaches to opiod receptor at base of brain. The body normaly produces it's own morphine, called endomorphins. When a person is taking morphine (of any form) it precludes the need for the body to produce it's own morphine, or endomorphine, so the internal system that produces endomorphines shuts down over time. When this person stops taking morphine, they experiance all the terrible things that morphine, or endomorphine is supposed to regulate - like body temperature, intestinal motion, pain perception, dysphoria...etc, and the only way to ""fix"" it is to wait until the endomorphine system starts up again (several months to get back to good condition) or to take more morphine. There are treatments, called medicaly assisted therapies, wherein a patient is prescribed either methadone or suboxone to mediate the withdrawel symptoms. Suboxone is the newest. It is butyl morphine and nalaxone in a pill that one dissolves under the tungue. Butyl morphine is a partial agonist with a high affinity for receptors, so it doesn't switch on the recptors as hard as a regular opiod would, but it sticks to the receptors better than a regular opiod would. The nalaxone is a receptor blocker and only becomes bioavailable if the user crushes and injects the pill - in that case the nalaxone would clean the receptors of any and all opiods and the user would experiance full withdrawel symptoms. The net being that the user who takes suboxone doesn't really get high and if they do try to abuse other opiods they will not get any affect from them. There is also a ""ceiling affect"" with butyl morphine - so if you try to take a lot of it at once to get high, you don't get any additional affect after a certain amount. The addict would take suboxone for 6 months to a year and then taper off by reducing the dose by a half a milligram a week until down to nothing."

I'm pretty sure you mean Johannes Evangelista Purkinje.  He was Professor of Physiology at the University of Prague, where he discovered the phenomenon known as the Pukinje effect (as light intensity decreases, red objects are perceived to fade faster than blue objects of the same brightness). \n\nHe is best known for his discovery, in 1837, of Purkinje cells, large nerve cells with many branching extensions found in the cortex of the cerebral cortex. He is also known for his 1839 discovery of Purkinje fibers, the fibrous tissue that conducts the pacemaker stimulus along the inside walls of the ventricles to all parts of the heart. Purkinje introduced the scientific terms plasma, to describe the clear liquid remaining after blood has been cleared of it’s various corpuscle components, and protoplasm, used to describe young animal embryos. \n\nPurkinje was the first to use the microtome (to slice thin tissue sections), glacial acetic acid, potassium bichromate and Canada balsam in the preparation of tissue samples for microscopic examination. Purkinje described the effects of camphor, opium, belladonna and turpintine on humans in 1829. An early user of the improved compound microscope, he discovered the sweat glands of the skin in 1833, germinal vessicles in 1825, recognized fingerprints as a means of identification in 1823 and noted the protein-digesting power of pancreatic extracts in 1836. \n\nJohannes Evangelista Purkinje was a pioneer to experimental physiology whose investigations in the fields of histology, embryology and pharmacology helped to create a modern understanding of the eye and vision, brain and heart function, mammalian reproduction and the composition of cells.

Lightning will move toward a conductor.  Yes, it can go through a window.  I don't think it's likely, however.  I think it's more likely to strike a conductor outside, since glass doesn't conduct so well.
You are correct.  The tracks are powered by cogged wheels driven by the engine and work like the wheels of a car except they run along the track instead of the road bed.  Look at the wheel when it is moving.  The bottom point is momentarily fixed to the ground and the top point is moving straight ahead with a momentary velocity.  The axel which is half way between the top and bottom is traveling at the average velocity:\n\nVelocity (axel) = (Vtop + Vbottom)/ 2 = (Vtop + 0)/2 = 1/2 Vtop\n\nThe machine moves at the speed of the axel; proving your point.\n\nAn even better illusion is the fact that when a locomotive speeds down a track, part of it is always moving backwards (hint: the part of the wheel flanges below the top surface of the track!).

An X-ray machine is essentially a camera. Instead of visible light, however, it uses X-rays to expose the film. \nX-rays are like light in that they are electromagnetic waves, but they are more energetic so they can penetrate many materials to varying degrees. When the X-rays hit the film, they expose it just as light would. Since bone, fat, muscle, tumors and other masses all absorb X-rays at different levels, the image on the film lets you see different (distinct) structures inside the body because of the different levels of exposure on the film. \n\nIf you want to know how X-rays themselves work try the site below.

The sky in latitudes closer to the equator does appear to be a darker shade of blue, and here's why:\n\nThe blue color of the sky is caused by the scattering of wavelengths as the light from the sun penetrates the atmosphere. When the sun is overhead, short wavelengths (like blue and violet) get scattered the most, because the light has to penetrate less atmosphere to reach us. When the sun is low in the sky, as in during sunset, the light from the sun has to penetrate much more atmosphere than when it is overhead, because it comes in at an angle. As a result, the longer wavelength light (like red) penetrates more easily than the short-wavelength blue, which got scattered way back when the light first hits the atmosphere. This is why sunsets appear to be red. \n\nWith this in mind, consider that at latitudes near the equator are more likely, on average, to have the sun in a position more directly overhead than say, where I live, at about 45 degrees north latitude. Hence, where I live, the short-wavelength light gets filtered out just a little bit more than where you live, creating a lighter-colored sky. I also live at high altitude (about 6500 ft.), which increases the effect. A little long, but hope this helps.

During a C-section the time from the inciscion into the uterus and the baby coming out is within a minute or 2. The doctor will pull the head out and then they will push on your belly on the babies tush to get the rest to come out;  unless the baby is lying on its side then the doctor has to turn it a little and it may take a little longer.  During a normal C-section there is no chance for brain damage unless there is a break in the circulation of blood running thru the cord to the baby.  In an ultimate emergency like a prolasped cord ( when the cord comes out before the babies head and pinching off the blood flow)  where i have worked we have the baby out in a matter of minutes 5-10, and someone has their hand in the vagine holding the baby's head off the cord until the baby is pulled out by C-section.  So.. in most normal C-sections there is little risk for brain damage.

Bartter's syndrome involves a group of symptoms and signs:\n\n    * Enlargement of certain kidney cells\n    * Alkalosis associated with reduced potassium (hypokalemic alkalosis)\n    * Increased production of the hormone aldosterone (see the aldosterone test)\n\nThere is no elevation of blood pressure with Bartter's syndrome, which usually occurs with kidney disease.  Batters syndrome is also known as Potassium wasting.  \n\nThe exact cause of Bartter's syndrome is not known. In some cases, it may be genetic and the condition is present from before birth (congenital).\n\nThe condition is thought to be caused by a defect in the kidney's ability to reabsorb potassium. As a result, an excessive amount of potassium is excreted from the body.

The theoretical maximum efficiency of any heat engine (petrol, diesel, jet, rocket, steam, stirling etc.) is (input temperature minus output temperature)/ output temperature where these are absolute temperatures; that is celsius plus 273 degrees.   Input temperature is the hot part of the engine (the cylinder) and output temperature is the exhaust manifold temperature.   So the most efficient petrol engines have efficiencies of about thirty something percent.

Days are counted as complete turns relative to the sun, so you are always facing the sun at noon. If you did the turns relative to the room you're in, you're modeling sidereal days. A sidereal day is one turn of the earth relative to the stars, 23 hours, 56 minutes, four seconds. If you go you at midnight six months apart, you will see that relative to the stars, you are facing in opposite directions.
"I would assume we are speaking about the scientific purpose for sexual intercourse.  Of course, humans, having advanced brains, have come up with many purposes for sex. \n\nScientfically, humans procreate through sexual intercourse otherwise known as internal fertilization.  Some animals reproduce using external fertilization, such as frogs.  Other organisms such as bacteria reproduce by copying themselves in a process called budding.  This is much like the cell division in our own bodies.  \n\nThe more complex an organism is the more advanced there reproduction is.  Some animals have many offspring to ensure that their DNA propagates through a population.  In other words, there is safety in numbers.  The less complex an organism's reproduction is the less complex the animal is.  Therfore the animal's offspring has a less chance of survival and reproducing themselves.  This is why some animals have so much offspring and why some only have one offspring.\n\nA parent is not environmentally 'fit' if it's offspring do not reproduce.  The animals that survive and have offspring that reproduce, have the DNA that is 'fit' for their environments.  Why do you think parents are so happy when they become ""grandma"" and ""grandpa""?  They have been successful in their reproduction, or for the purpose of this post,  with their sexual intercourse.  Our survival and 'fitness' is not only dependent on DNA but on our ability to survive in our complex social world, which requires a strong supportive environment.  Scholars cannot agree  about how much DNA and the environment play a role in human survival.  I can assure you though that both are very important.\n\nAs for the evoultionary aspect, any organism has to reproduce in order to propagate in the world.  In order for organsims to reproduce there has to be an inate desire to do so.  This desire is controlled by a number of chemicals in our bodies, many of which are hormones.  Phenotypes (appearance) have also evolved to make humans more sexually attractive to each other, which helps ensure that sexual intercourse will take place.  For example, our loss of hair on our faces and bodies is much more aesthetically pleasing and soft to the touch.  This loss of hair also allows us to see many more facial expressions that convey non-verbal messages more clearly to a would be partner. \n\nThe simplest form of life, which we are said to have originated from, is bacteria-like in nature.  As organsims evolved so did their reproduction.  Internal Fertilization is much more successful than external for the simple reason of it taking place 'indoors'.  \n\nEvolution is change, plain and simple.  This change for humans takes thousands of years, but can be noticed in days or even hours in bacteria.  This is the doctrine of uniformitarianism which is used in geology, but can be applied to other fields of science.  This doctrine states that present processes help to explain the past.  If bacteria can change so quickly and adapt and even resist some things that killed their ancestors, this is clearly a sign of change and hence is called 'evolution'.  What you might ask is because bacteria make an exact copy of themselves so how could they ever change?  Usually bacteria make exact copies, however there are millions and millions of bacteria and every so often there is a random genetic mutation in some of them.  It just so happens that they get lucky because that mutation allows them to survive and pass that trait on to their offspring.    \n\nAll organisms are different.  Humans sexually desire each other and have intercourse for many reasons.  But, scientifically there is one reason and one reason only, Internal fertilization (sexual intercourse) is the most successful and advanced means of reproduction and is a result of trial and error (evolution).  It helps to ensure our propagation through the population."
Absolute zero is the point on the thermodynamic (absolute) temperature scale where all kinetic motion in the particles comprising matter ceases and they are at complete rest in the “classic” (non-quantum mechanical) sense. At absolute zero, matter contains no heat energy. By international agreement, absolute zero is a temperature of precisely −273.15 °C (−459.67 °F). Throughout the scientific world where measurements are made in SI units, thermodynamic temperature is measured in kelvins where absolute zero is 0 K. Many engineering fields in the U.S. measure thermodynamic temperature using the Rankine scale where absolute zero is 0 °R.\n\nScientists have made great advancements in achieving temperatures ever closer to absolute zero (where matter exhibits odd quantum effects). In 1994 the NIST achieved a record cold temperature of 700 nK (billionths of a kelvin). In 2003, researchers at MIT established a new record of 0.5 nK.\n\nHope that helped!
There is a temperature probe that controls the compressor. It is usually located on the front of the air condition and it senses the temperature of the air coming into the machine. \nthere are a few things you can do if you want the room cooler.\n\n1) clean the air conditioner, take it out and wash it. make sure the fins are free of dirt and dust. If you can see through them and the look shiny, they are probably clean.\nAlso clean the sponge filter in front\n\nIf any of these are dirty you will not get good airflow and the machine will not cool properly.\n\n2)check to see that the machine in not icing up. if there is too much of a buildup of ice the compressor will also shut off.\nthis is also usually caused by lack of airflow.( clean it!)\nalso make sure the unit is tilted back so the water if flowing out of it properly.\n\n3) turn down the temperature knob. is it at its lowest setting?\nyou can tell what the room temp is by twisting the knob, you will hear a click when it goes by the room temp.\n\n4) move the cool air fins so they direct air away (usually up and to the side a bit) from the A/C unit. sometimes if they are directed down, the unit starts sucking in the air it just cooled, and make it think the room is cool.\n\nThe compressor does have an overheat setting, but if the unit is clean, there should be no reason for it to overheat.\n\ntry turning the unit to the med setting, so that it should run longer at a lower fan speed. that could also help.\n\nThe only other thing I can think of is if the temp sensor went bad,\n\nand remember usually A/C units are made to that the lowest temp is about  18 dgrees C or about 65 degrees F\nit is not made to cool a room more than that.\nAll else fails, call sers service. They have an 800 number.\nbut it is different for different areas, look it up in the phone book \nunder Sears parts and service.

sahara\n\nSahara (suhâr'u) [key][Arab.,=desert], world's largest desert, c.3,500,000 sq mi (9,065,000 sq km), N Africa; the western part of a great arid zone that continues into SW Asia. Extending more than 3,000 mi (4,830 km), from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea, the Sahara is bounded on the N by the Atlas Mts., steppelands, and the Mediterranean Sea; it stretches south c.1,200 mi (1,930 km) to the Sahel, a steppe in W and central Africa that forms its southern border. The desert includes most of Western Sahara, Mauritania, Algeria, Niger, Libya, and Egypt; the southern portions of Morocco and Tunisia; and the northern portions of Senegal, Mali, Chad, and Sudan. The E Sahara is usually divided into three regions—the Libyan Desert, which extends west from the Nile valley through W Egypt and E Libya; the Arabian Desert, or Eastern Desert, which lies between the Nile valley and the Red Sea in Egypt; and the Nubian Desert, which is in NE Sudan.\n\nRegions of sand dunes (erg) occupy only about 15% of the Sahara; “stone deserts,” consisting of plateaus of denuded rock (hammada) or areas of coarse gravel (reg), cover about 70% of the region; mountains, oases, and transition zones account for the remainder. Sparse vegetation is found in most parts of the Sahara, with the exception of the sand dune regions. High mountain massifs rise in the central regions; they are the Ahagger (Hoggar) in S Algeria, which rises to more than 9,000 ft (2,740 m); the Tibesti Massif in N Chad, which rises to more than 11,000 ft (3,350 m); and the Aïr Mountains (Azbine) in N Niger, which rise to more than 6,000 ft (1,830 m). The mountains are deeply dissected and were in the past infamous for the shelter they provided to marauders preying on desert traffic. From west to east the four principal land routes across the desert are from Colomb-Bechar to Dakar; from Colomb-Bechar to Gao and Timbuktu by way of Reganne; from Touggourt to Agadez and Kano by way of In-Salah; and from Tripoli to Ghat.
What happens is that bacteria, which the antibiotics attack, become immune to the antibiotics. Over-prescribing anti-biotics is bad because it causes bacteria to develop resistance. This is why in the past very small quantities of penicillin-type drugs were necessary to treat a bacterial infection, whereas the dosages are now 100s of times greater. This is also why scientists are always struggling to keep up with bacteria which obtain resistance quickly.\n\nThe best strategy is to use antibiotics only when you are sure you need them. If you have a viral illness such as the flu, antibiotics are useless. Also, if you take way too many antibiotics, you risk fungal infections. The reason is because fungi and bacteria are always in competition, and when you eliminate one, the other starts to grow out of hand. Some people have had urinary tract infections from fungi because they took too many antibiotics.  Not a pretty sight. \n\nJust take antibiotics when you have a bacterial infection. If you don't know the origin of your infection (if it is bacterial or viral), your doctor may initially prescribe antibiotics until he can confirm the origin of the infection in lab work.
Mosses have no true roots and no true vascular system (at least not as derived as the higher platns). That means they can't extract nutrients from soil very well, they can't distribute nutrients efficiently, and they can't anchor themselves as firmly to the ground as higher plants. They also require water (mostly splashing rain) for reproduction. These limitation restrict moss to a low growing life-style in moist habitats where they can grow in dense groups for structural support.
mongst the earliest of all known arthropods are the trilobites.  The first species of trilobite are found in rocks of Lower Cambrian age, above the non-trilobite 'Tommotian' Cambrian fauna.  The last known species to have existed are found in the Late Permian.  Throughout their 350 million years of existence in the ancient seas the overall morphology of the earliest and latest trilobites did not vary greatly, however their individual characteristics had many variations and it is these changes that can be studied and used to determine age ( Levi-Setti, 1975).  However it must be remembered that no individual feature is a sufficient guide for classification on its own, it is only with a collection of characteristics that a reliable classification can be made.\n\n Well over 1500 genera are known (Clarkson, 1994) and there are several thousand species, many of which have a stratigraphic value, especially those found within Cambrian and Ordovician rocks.  It is the fact that trilobites are found world wide which makes some of them serve as excellent index fossils, and it is their short life periods which allows precise dates and correlations to be made about the rocks in which they are found.\n\n  Most trilobites were sea floor dwellers, living in the soft sediments, while others were free swimming.  They appear to have been exclusively marine organisms since the fossilized remains of trilobites are always found in rock containing fossils of other salt-water animals, e.g. brachiopods, crinoids and corals.
Most home appliances don't give off enough of an EMF to affect us, at least so far as any studies have been able to determine.  Higher energy appliances like microwaves were once shielded rather badly, resulting in the warning in all the instruction manuals not to stand close to a running microwave if you have a pacemaker or internal defibrillator, because the stray EM could cause it to malfunction (I believe they've solved the shielding problem in modern models, but the warning's still there, just in case)  Just in case, I'd sit back a ways from the TV... luckily, the new LCD computer monitors put out considerably less EM (almost none, really)  These days, there are more hazards from the incidental (or intended) output other than stray EM -- tanning beds put out UV light that can damage skin over the long term or cause blindness if you don't wear the goggles properly, copy machines and faxes create ozone which can damage the lining of the lungs, etc.

"In 1989, Weber & May and Litt & Luty discover microsatellite sequences, demonstrate their high level of polymorphism due to variations in the number of tandem repeats (1 - typical heterozygosities in cattle), abundance and even distribution across the genome.\n\n Microsatellites are genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction (1 ) using primers targetted to the unique sequences flanking the microsatellite motif. PCR can easily be semi-automated (1 )\n\n The resulting PCR products are separated according to size by gel electrophoresis using either agarose gels or more commonly (because of their higher resolution) denaturing polyacrylamide gels (PAGE) (1 ).\n\n PCR products are visualized by:\n\nDirect staining (ethidium bromide or silverstaining)(1 ) \nAutoradiography: \nThe PCR products are labeled either by incorporation of [a -P 32 or 33] dNTPs (1 )or [a -S 35] dNTS during the PCR amplification (1 )(labels the two strands), or by using one end-labeled primer (labels one strand). Primers are end-labeled using [g -P 32 ]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (1 ) . \nAfter gel electrophoresis, an X-ray film is exposed to the gel revealing the position of the PCR products as black spots. A photon of light or a b particle or g ray released from a radioactive molecule ""activate"" silver bromide crystals on the film emulsion. This renders them capable of being reduced through the developing process to form silver metal (a ""grain"").

Herpes zoster, commonly known as shingles, is caused by the same virus responsible for chicken pox.  After the initial exposure, herpes zoster lies dormant in certain nerve fibers.   It may become active as a result of many factors such as:  aging, stress, suppression of the immune system, and certain medication.  Because of the layout of the nerves that herpes zoster resides in, it only affects one side of the body or face during an outbreak.  It begins as a rash that lead to blisters and sores on the skin.  When the nerve branch that supplies the eye is involved, the forehead, nose, and eyelids may also be affected.  Sores on the nose are a key signal of possible eye involvement.   \nHerpes zoster can cause several problems with the eye and surrounding skin that may have long term effects.  Inflammation and scarring of the cornea, along with conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva) and iritis (inflammation of the iris) are typical problems that require treatment.  \nMany who experience this infection find it extremely painful.
"It depends on the type of tube. Hot cathode tubes use thermionic emission - that is, you heat a sample of an easily ionized substance (i.e., low work function) to a high temperature. A very small fraction of the atoms will be stripped away by the electric field.\n\n""Cold cathode"" discharge tubes use very high electric fields to strip the electrons. Again, a very small fraction of electrons will be stripped away from the cathode element. \n\nThe material at the cathode is the source of electrons. Only a very small fraction are ionized. Electrons eventually will be replenished from tiny leakage currents (the gas in the tube, the glass, etc.). The electrons at the anode initially will combine with positively charged ions (electron holes), which will then propogate as a slight current to the source of EMF."

"But K5 means yellow, not blue (somewhat yellower than the sun).  Anyway, assuming K5 is correct, and that HD835 is a main-sequence star, and not something weird like a yellowish ""red"" giant, then it would have an absolute magnitude of around 8, which means it looks like a magnitude 8 star from one parsec distance.  But since it appears a magnitude and a half dimmer, that means it's only one-fourth as bright as it would be at one parsec, so it must be twice as far away (inverse square law).  So its distance is about two parsecs, which equals 7 light-years."
Both science and technology imply a thinking process, both are concerned with causal relationships in the material world, and both employ an experimental methodology that results in empirical demonstrations that can be verified by repetition (see Scientific Method). Science, at least in theory, is less concerned with the practicality of its results and more concerned with the development of general laws, but in practice science and technology are inextricably involved with each other. The varying interplay of the two can be observed in the historical development of such practitioners as chemists, engineers, physicists, astronomers, carpenters, potters, and many other specialists. Differing educational requirements, social status, vocabulary, methodology, and types of rewards, as well as institutional objectives and professional goals, contribute to such distinctions as can be made between the activities of scientists and technologists; but throughout history the practitioners of “pure” science have made many practical as well as theoretical contributions.\n\nIndeed, the concept that science provides the ideas for technological innovations and that pure research is therefore essential for any significant advancement in industrial civilization is essentially a myth. Most of the greatest changes in industrial civilization cannot be traced to the laboratory. Fundamental tools and processes in the fields of mechanics, chemistry, astronomy, metallurgy, and hydraulics were developed before the laws governing their functions were discovered. The steam engine, for example, was commonplace before the science of thermodynamics elucidated the physical principles underlying its operations.\n\nIn recent years a sharp value distinction has grown up between science and technology. Advances in science have frequently had their bitter opponents, but today many people have come to fear technology much more than science. For these people, science may be perceived as a serene, objective source for understanding the eternal laws of nature, whereas the practical manifestations of technology in the modern world now seem to them to be out of control.
it is much easier to use two hoses instead, one for draining the gas, the other a shorter smaller diameter hose used to blow into the tank. blowing into the tank forces gas to come out the larger one. you must seal the tank opening with a rag when doing so . no problems
No.
Large molecules are difficult for the body to absorb into the bloodstream.  By digesting the large molecules into smaller ones, they can be absorbed much more quickly and efficiently.  This lets us get more nutrients out of the food we eat.\n\nAlso, in the case of proteins, the way that amino acids are arranged in proteins doesn't match the arrangement that our body needs for certain things.  The protein is broken down into the amino acids to be absorbed, and then those amino acids can be used to build up proteins that meet the exact specifications that your body needs them to have.

In India, most migratory birds start coming in from September (after the monsoons) and leave by April (or before the monsoons). The migratory birds come to India, to spend the winter because their breeding grounds are low on food, because it would be winter there and almost everything would be frozen. Most of the birds which comes to India are known to come from Europe and Central asia. Some of the famous ones include waterfowl like the Bar-headed Geese and eagles like the Steppe Eagle apart from several wading birds like the common Sandpiper and so on. \n\nWhile winter migrants are most common in India, there are also summer migrants. These are birds which come to India during the summer to breed. Most of them are local migrants (ex:- Indian Pitta), that is, migrate within India.

Neither. The concept of odd and even only applies to whole numbers.
"In short:  Protein is what your body is made of.  Carbohydrate is the main fuel that keeps it going.\n\nTo keep the car analogy going:  Protein is like the fiberglass, plastic and rubber in your car.  Carbohydrate is the gasoline (Fat is another major fuel source for the body).\n\nProteins are VERY complex.  They are the most complex chemical substances in the universe (that we know of).  They are massive molecules made of thousands of atoms all linked together to form atomic loops and chains and blobs.  These special shapes give the protein its special characteristics.  That's why one rigid protein called KERATIN forms the hair and fingernails of many animals including humans, while another goopy protein called COLLAGEN helps to keep your skin flexible.\n\nAll proteins are made of the same 20 building blocks called amino acids.  Just like the same 26 letters can spell out 50,000 different English words, these same 20 amino acids an spell out all of the different proteins required for life on earth.\n\nCARBOHYDRATE is a fancy made-up Greek word for all the various forms of SUGAR.\n\nTable sugar is a chemical called SUCROSE, while apples taste sweet because of FRUCTOSE and GLUCOSE.  Milk tastes good because of LACTOSE.  These are all carbohydrates:  Forms of sugar.\n\nSugar can take other unexpected forms also:  The stuff that makes wood tough is not a protein but actually a carbohydrate called CELLULOSE.  Don't worry, cellulose won't make you fat, because humans can't digest it.  Yes, carrots have cellulose, but that part of the carrot goes right through you.\n\nBut we love potatoes, which are essentially the stored sugar of a hardy plant that miraculously grew in Ireland and the Baltic region.  Potatoes don't taste sweet because the carbohydrate that makes up potatoes is STARCH, a complex carbohydrate.\n\nYour body CAN burn protein as fuel.  But, protein is very inefficient and your body is programmed to do this only if there are no sugar or fats available.  When your body starts burning protein for fuel, it starts with the major muscles, tearing them down for fuel like the crew of a ship wrecked in the arctic might start burning the planks of the vessel for warmth.\n\nThis is why starving people begin to have a ""living skeleton"" appearance (except for the distended belly, which is the result of another chemical process).\n\nMoral of the story:  In spite of what athletes and health nuts tell you, you cannot live off just protein or fiber.\n\nYou crave fat and sugar because your body favors those fuels.  If your car had a brain and had to find its own fuel, it would crave gasoline just like you crave burgers and donuts.\n\nOf course, we have more fat and sugar around than our ancestors could possibly imagine.  Our ancestors also got plenty of exercise, with all the hunting and skinning and chopping and chipping and the warfare.\n\nSince our bodies were designed for the hunter-gatherer lifestyle, and were not designed to sit behind a desk or on a couch eating insane amounts of sugar and fat -- we get sick from doing what feels right."

"The heaviest crocodile in the wild was a salt-water crocodile, which weighed about 4,400 lb. and was 28 ft 4 in long (340 inches)!\n\nA hypothetical white shark having a 340-in fork length would weigh ca. 19,040 lbs; a hypothetical white shark having a 340-in total length would weigh ca. 15,646 lbs.\n\nA 4400-lb white shark will have a fork length about 211 inches (17 ft 7 in) and a total length about 226 inches (18 ft 10 in).\n-----------------------\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nToday, most experts contend that the Great White's ""normal"" maximum size is about 6 m (20 ft), with a maximum weight of about 1900 kg (4200 lb). Any claims much beyond these limits are generally regarded as doubtful, and are closely scrutinized.\n\nEllis and McCosker write that ""it is likely that [Great White] sharks can weigh as much as 2 tons"", but also note that the largest verified examples weigh in at about 1.75 short tons (1.6 metric tons).\n\nThe largest Great White recognized by the International Game Fish Association is one landed by Alf Dean in south Australian waters in 1959, weighing 1208 kg (2664 lb).  Several larger Great Whites caught by anglers have since been verified, but were later disallowed from formal recognition by IGFA monitors for rules violations.\n-----------------------\n\nIt seems implausible that a 4400-lb crocodile attained its weight through lethargy, and I've seen a credible photo of a Mississippi alligator swimming underwater with an adult deer in its mouth.\n\nOn the other hand, crocs and gators typically lie in wait to ambush their prey, then dash quickly forward to seize the prey at the last instant, crippling the victim and drowning it.\n\nA breaching GWS could do great damage to a SWC, simply through the transfer of kinetic energy.  If the GWS attacked a limb, it could perhaps disable the croc long enough for it to bleed out sufficiently for the shark to have a fair shot at eating the SWC.\n\nHowever, even though the GWS is an apex predator, the SWC isn't ordinarily on its menu.  In the warm, (relatively) shallow waters frequented by a SWC, the GWS is disadvantaged; in the frigid waters frequented by the GWS, the SWC would soon die, anyway.\n\nBottom line: whichever way you want to tell the tale, that's the one that wins."

"We can arrive at this by considering some of the simpler cases.  Let's assume that the warden placed only 1 white hat on my head and 99 black hats on everyone else's head.  So at the time when the warden said start, I would look around and see 99 black hats.  Since there has to be at least one 1 hat, I would immediately announce that I had a white hat.  Everyone else would then know that they had black hats and would say so.\n\nNow consider the case where I have a white hat and someone else also has a white hat.  I would look and see 1 white hat.  If I had a black hat, that person would immediately announce that they had a white hat.  But that doesn't happen.  Instead they wait.  Now since neither of us was able to announce right away, we know that there must be 2 white hats.  So we both announce that we have white hats.\n\nYou can follow this pattern with 3 white hats, etc. but it requires that you have a plan in place for timing.  Let's say that everyone will wait ten seconds for every hat they see less of.  So if I see no white hats, I will immediately announce ""WHITE"" after 0 seconds.  Everyone else will follow with ""BLACK"" right after.  Similarly, if I saw 1 white hat, I would plan to say WHITE after 10 seconds.  If no one announced after 0 seconds, I would be correct.  Then everyone else would say ""BLACK"" after that.\n\nIt doesn't matter the number of hats or whether there are more or less of one color as long as we wait a discrete period of time to announce.  I chose periods of 10 seconds so that there wouldn't be a chance of mistakes.\n\nIf there are W white hats and B black hats, then:\nEveryone wearing a white hat will see W-1 white hats and B black hats.\nEveryone wearing a black hat will see B-1 black hats and W white hats.\n\nThere are 3 cases:\nIf W < B then all white hats will say 'White' at the same time (10(W-1) seconds), and everyone else knows they are wearing black. \nIf B < W then all black hats will say 'Black' at the same time (10(B-1) seconds), and everyone else knows they are wearing white. \nIf W = B then all prisoners will know their color at the same time. (10(B-1) seconds, or 10(W-1) seconds, they are equivalent). \n\nLet's take an example.  If there were 51 white hats and 49 black hats, and I was wearing a white hat.  Then I would plan to say ""black"" after 490 seconds.  However, the people in black hats would beat me to the punch saying ""black"" after 480 seconds.  Then I would say ""white"" along with all the rest of the prisoners wearing white hats.\n\nThe ""hat puzzle"" is described in detail at Wikipedia and I've included the link below.  I think the first answerer quoted from there but didn't include the reference."

I assume that you are referring to Fermats Last Theorem - it is very simple : This equation \n\nx to the power of n + y to the power of n equals z the power of n\n\nhas no solution for non-zero integers x, y, and z if n is an integer greater than 2.  \n\nWhat is so controversial about this is Fermat proposed this equation and claimed to have come up with a way to prove that this is correct in the margin of his notes. However, he didn't write down his proof. It was, however finally proved (the 90's I think).\n\n\nNever heard of Harmdats theory though and a quick search on google turns up nothing - are you sure you have the name right?\n\nEDIT : It just occurred to me that you could be refering to Fermats Little Theorem. This is less known but used far more regularly. It is used to test if large numbers are not prime. Basically, it states that, \n\nx to the power of (p-1) = 1 mod p\n\nwhere p is a prime which is not a factor of x and p is greater than a which is greater than or equal to 1. If this is false for any value of x then p is not prime.\n\nAlthough this is true for all primes however it is also true for some non-primes. Therefore this can only be used to prove that a number is definitely NOT a prime, not that it is definitely a prime.

Those are not antennae, LOL. Giraffes, like most Artiodactyls, have paired bony projections at the front of the head (think of deer, cows, antelopes, etc). The horns of giraffes are relatively short and covered with skin and short fur, with tufts of longer hair at the tip.  And some older individuals have a third non-paired horn that grows on the forehead.\nMale giraffes fight for dominance and females during the breeding season; they mostly hit each other with their necks, but they also use their blunt horns. \n\nPhotographs of the skull showing the bony axis of the horns:\nhttp://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/specimens/Giraffidae.html\n\nAn image of the fight:\nhttp://www.dongettyphoto.com/kenya/giraffesfighting.html
As something gets hotter, the molecules and atoms vibrate more.  Vibration of atoms and molecules interfere with the passage of electrical current, hence the resistance goes up.\n\nIf you plot the current versus voltage of a light bulb, you will see the curve is not a straight line; as the filament gets hotter the resistance increases!
"no; according to Wikipedia, the easy on-line source for such information, there are two prevailing theories as to the origins of petroleum, and neither has to do with dinosaur bones:\n\nFormation\n[edit]\nBiogenic theory\nMost geologists view crude oil, like coal and natural gas, as the product of compression and heating of ancient organic materials over geological time scales. According to this theory, it is formed from the decayed remains of prehistoric small marine animals and algae. (Terrestrial plants tend to form coal.) Over millennia this organic matter, mixed with mud, is buried under thick sedimentary layers of material. The resulting high levels of heat and pressure cause the remains to metamorphose, first into a waxy material known as kerogen, and then into liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons in a process known as catagenesis. Because hydrocarbons are less dense than the surrounding rock, these migrate upward through adjacent rock layers until they become trapped beneath impermeable rocks, within porous rocks called reservoirs. Concentration of hydrocarbons in a trap forms an oil field, from which the liquid can be extracted by drilling and pumping.\n\nGeologists also refer to the ""oil window"". This is the temperature range that oil forms in--below the minimum temperature oil does not form, and above the maximum temperature natural gas forms instead. Though this corresponds to different depths for different locations around the world, a 'typical' depth for the oil window might be 4 - 6 km. Note that oil may be trapped at much shallower depths, even if it is not formed there. Three conditions must be present for oil reservoirs to form: a rich source rock, a migration conduit, and a trap (seal) that concentrates the hydrocarbons.\n\nThe reactions that produce oil and natural gas are often modeled as first order breakdown reactions, where kerogen breaks down to oil and natural gas by a large set of parallel reactions, and oil eventually breaks down to natural gas by another set of reactions.\n\n[edit]\nAbiogenic theory\nThe idea of abiogenic petroleum origin was championed in the Western world by astronomer Thomas Gold based on thoughts from Russia, mainly on studies of Nikolai Kudryavtsev. The idea proposes that large amounts of carbon exist naturally in the planet, some in the form of hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are less dense than aqueous pore fluids, and migrate upward through deep fracture networks. Thermophilic, rock-dwelling microbial life-forms are in part responsible for the biomarkers found in petroleum.\n\nThis theory is very much a minority opinion amongst geologists. This theory often pops up when scientists are not able to explain apparent oil inflows into certain oil reservoirs. These instances are rare."

"Carcharodon Megalodon\n\n a big, big shark...\nWhat's the biggest, most aggressive, most fearsome shark you can think of? Well, that would have to be the Great White Shark, White Death, Carcharodon carcharias. A shark measuring up to 23 feet in length, and having teeth up to 2 inches long. Ouch.\n\n \n\nNow, what if this shark was twice as big? Hmmm...\n\nNow, what if this shark was four times as big, or bigger? Gulp.\n\nAnd what if this shark might still be alive?\n\nNow we're talking megalodon.\n\n \n\nCarcharodon megalodon is the Great White Shark's big brother! Estimated to be exactly like the Great White Shark in proportion, but two to six times larger. That's a total of anywhere from 50 to 120 feet in length! And teeth up to 8 inches in length!\n\nOK, so what's all this about this shark being alive? Well, the reason we know that this shark even existed is that we've found its teeth. Its teeth? That's right. Sharks don't have bones­they are made out of cartilage, so they can't leave any bones behind for us to study. But their teeth do fossilize and they hang around for a long time! We've found megalodon's teeth and they are almost exactly like Carcharodon carcharias's teeth, only bigger­ much bigger. And guess what? Some of the teeth we've found weren't fossilized, they were recent! How recent? Ten to twenty years old. Holy smokes! That means that this shark was swimming in our seas as recently as ten to twenty years ago! Has anyone ever seen it? Well, there are lots of eyewitness accounts, some of them estimating the shark at up to 300 feet in length (!), and even some sonar accounts.\n\nBut are they Tall Fish Tales?

"In physics and chemistry, a plasma is typically an ionized gas, and is usually considered to be a distinct phase of matter in contrast to solids, liquids and gases. ""Ionized"" means that at least one electron has been dissociated from a proportion of the atoms or molecules. The free electric charges make the plasma electrically conductive so that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields.\n \n\n  A Bose–Einstein condensate is a phase of matter formed by bosons cooled to temperatures very near to absolute zero. The first such condensate was produced by Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman in 1995 at the University of Colorado at Boulder, using a gas of rubidium atoms cooled to 170 nanokelvins (nK). Under such conditions, a large fraction of the atoms collapse into the lowest quantum state, at which point quantum effects become apparent on a macroscopic scale.\n\n\nThis fourth state of matter was first identified in a discharge tube (or Crookes tube), and so described by Sir William Crookes in 1879 (he called it ""radiant matter"")[1]. The nature of the Crookes tube ""cathode ray"" matter was subsequently identifed by English physicist Sir J.J. Thomson in 1897[2], and dubbed ""plasma"" by Irving Langmuir in 1928 [3], perhaps because it reminded him of a blood plasma [4]. Langmuir wrote:\n\n""Except near the electrodes, where there are sheaths containing very few electrons, the ionized gas contains ions and electrons in about equal numbers so that the resultant space charge is very small. We shall use the name plasma to describe this region containing balanced charges of ions and electrons.""[3] \nMore specifically, a plasma is an electrically conductive collection of charged particles that responds collectively to electromagnetic forces. Plasma typically takes the form of neutral gas-like clouds or charged ion beams, but may also include dust and grains (called dusty plasmas) [5] They are typically formed by heating and ionizing a gas, stripping electrons away from atoms, thereby enabling the positive and negative charges to move freely."
YES! I do remember the weather poodles. i got a similar thing from the Walter Drake catalog. Those things are magic, Schiltzie. Fun fun. jump up and down, clap, smile!! WHEE!!\n\nDid you have a weather bird too? You put colored water in it's glass belly, and the stormier it got, it would slowly tip forward.\n\nIf the water ever came out the beak, you had best be in the basement. You inspired me to write another child of the 60's question....
The Respiratory System consists of organs that deliver oxygen to the circulatory system for transport to all body cells. The goals of the respiratory system are to provide oxygen to the tissues and to remove carbon dioxide.\n\nRespiration includes 2 processes: external respiration and internal respiration. The former involves the absorption of O2 and removal of CO2 from the body as a whole preventing the lethal buildup of this waste product in body tissues. This process involves two major functional events: (1) pulmonary ventilation, which means the inflow and outflow of air between the atmosphere and the lung alveoli; (2) diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the alveoli and the blood (Guyton, 1991). The internal respiration entails the utilization of O2, which is essential for cells to liberate the energy needed for cellular activities and production of CO2 and the gaseous exchanges between the cells and their fluid medium.  It is divided into two major functional events: (3) transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood and body fluids to and from the cells; and (4) regulation of ventilation and other facets of respiration (Guyton, 1991).\n\nThe respiratory and circulatory systems work together to deliver oxygen to cells and remove carbon dioxide in following the two-phase processes as mentioned in the former paragraph. The first phase of respiration begins with breathing in, or inspiration. Inspiration brings air from outside the body into the lungs. Oxygen in the air moves from the lungs through blood vessels to the heart, which pumps the oxygen-rich blood to all parts of the body (Microsoft, 2003). Oxygen then moves from the bloodstream into cells, which completes the first phase of respiration. In the cells, oxygen is used in a separate energy-producing process called cellular respiration, which produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct (Microsoft, 2003). The second phase of respiration begins with the movement of carbon dioxide from the cells to the bloodstream. The bloodstream carries carbon dioxide to the heart, which pumps the carbon dioxide-laden blood to the lungs (Microsoft, 2003). In the lungs, breathing out, or expiration, removes carbon dioxide from the body, thus completing the respiration cycle. \n\nThe respiratory system is made up of a gas-exchanging organ (the lungs) and a pump that ventilates the lungs. The pump consists of: (1) the chest wall; (2) the respiratory muscles, which increase and decrease the size of the thoracic cavity; (3) the areas in the brain that control the muscles; and (4) the tracts and nerves that connect the brain to the muscles (Ganong, 1995). At rest, a normal person breaths 12-15 times a minute. Five hundred milliliters of air per breath, or 6-8 L/min, is inspired and expired (Ganong, 1995). This air mixes with the gas in the alveoli, and by simple diffusion, O2 enters the blood in the pulmonary capillaries while CO2 enters the alveoli.  In this manner, 250 mL of O2 enters the body per minute and 200 mL of CO2 is excreted (Ganong, 1995). During quiet breathing, the decrease in pressure in the chest starts about 2.5 mm Hg (compared to the outside pressure), decreasing to around 6 mm Hg towards the end of inspiration. Strong breathing efforts can produce a pressure decrease (vacuum) in the chest as high as 30 mm Hg. Day-in and day-out, without the prompt of conscious thought, the respiratory system carries out its life-sustaining activities. If the respiratory system’s tasks are interrupted for more than a few minutes, serious, irreversible damage to tissues occurs, followed by the failure of all body systems, and ultimately, death.\n\nThe respiratory system also plays other important roles in the body aside from the intake of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide. It helps regulate the balance of pH (acidity and basicity) in tissues, a process crucial for the normal functioning of cells. It protects the body against disease-causing organisms and toxic substances inha

"Disturbances in layers of the upper atmosphere allow TV and FM band signals to travel through ""ducts"" for several hundred miles.  Sunrise, sunset, and some weather patterns can set up temperature inversions that bend signals back to earth 100-200 miles beyond their source.  On rare occasions the ionospheric layers hundreds of miles up become dense enough to reflect TV and FM signals back to earth--500 to several thousand miles away from their source.  This last kind of DX mechanism is commonplace at lower frequencies."
The outward splaying is from perspective on YOUR end, not on the Sun's. It's true, the rays are almost parallel since they are coming from 93 million miles away, but you are probably only one or two miles away from the mean distance to the clouds. Since the area covered by the speckled clouds is large compared to their distance from you, the pseudo-parallel light beams look like they are dramatically diverging. It's a very powerful illusion and I think it had a lot to do with early man's perception of the Sun (and by extension, all celestial objects) as being much closer to Earth than they really are.
"Basic research into stem cells has the promise of revolutionizing the treatment of disease and the maintenance of destroyed tissues and organs. In addition, it turns out cancer tumors have stem cells too. If you remove a tumor and miss a cancerous stem cell, you still have cancer; one cell can re-grow the entire tumor. But if you leave the tumor and kill just the cancerous stem cells, the tumor is absorbed by the body and you're cured! If we can find out enough about these ""bad"" stem cells, we might just cure certain forms of cancer. We've learned much about the signaling proteins that cells and tumors use but the system is unbelievably complex. It'll take time, money and an enlightened attitude to see us through.\n\nhttp://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/articles/03_03/stem_c.shtml\nhttp://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/Press_releases/2004/11_22_04.html"

There is a relationship between the speed of rotation and how much the object is flattened. The outer edge of the galaxy is moving a a very high rate of speed. Our own solar system is moving at 200 kilometers per second as the galaxy rotates . But Earth is only rotating at around 1600 kilometers per hour, or roughly 0.5km/second, and it is, in fact, bigger at the equator than elsewhere, not a true sphere. It's 6357km radius at the poles, and 6378km at the equator. The spinning makes it oblate. This is true of all the spinning planets. The faster they spin, the flatter they are, overcoming the gravitational attraction.
I assume that you meant for 7xeY + 3x^3 = 5y^4 to mean 7xe^y + 3x^3 = 5y^4.\n\nWe now take dy/dx of both sides:\nD(7x)e^y + D(e^y)7x + D(3x^3) = D(5y^4).  D refers to the derivative.  \nThus we get 7e^y + 7xe^yy' + 9x^2 = 20y^3y'.  \nSimplify this to be 7e^y + 9x^2 = 20y^3y' - 7xe^yy' .  \nNow factor out the y': 7e^y + 9x^2 = y'(20y^3 - 7xe^y).  \n\nSolve for y': The final answer is (7e^y + 9x^2)/(20y^3 - 7xe^y). This is choice d. \n\nMake sure to use proper parentheses.

Both oleic and caprylic acid are long chain fatty acids - measurement of pH will be inaccurate as very little of either acid will actually dissolve in water and neither acid readily dissociates.\n\nI would have thought that you may have seen an initial rise in pH, followed by a slow fall, rather than the other way around. This would make sense as the reaction between oleic/caprylic and sodium hydroxide is not particularly fast.

Yes, 1865W via direct conversion...but its important to remember that the compressors in A/C systems are VERY high inductance, so the voltage waveform leads the current waveform quite a bit, and lowers the power factor. Im not sure how many more watts (its gonna be 100s) the system would use since I dont know the motor specification.\n\nThe best way to determine the power usage is to read the RLA (run load amps) off of the compressor, and multiply that by the input voltage. This still isnt too great of a way, but its better than an HP conversion for sure. \n\nIf the compressor only lists the LRA (locked rotor amps, current flow at 0 back EMF), divide that number by 5 for a rotary compressor (Cylindrical) or 4 for a hermetic sphere compressor (egg like) to get the RLA. Doing this further decreases your accuracy of course. \n\nHope all this helps
"I don't understand it, Japan has said that they have stock piles of whale meat as it is, why do they need to kill more.  Whaling brought most whale populations to the brink of extinction and anything that puts any extra pressure on the slowly recovering populations should be prevented.  At the moment Japan claims its only killing the whales as part of ""scientific research"" but this is absolute c ra p, they are trying to start commercial whaling again and may even ignore international law in their pursuit of this. I think penalties should be very severe if they try to.\nArguements that say whaling is part of japanese heritage and culture are pathetic, Whales are part of the Earths natural heritage and Japan have no right to finish of the last remaining animals."

The inidvidual neurons are effectively digital.\n\nHowever a single neuron will not produce vison, or any reponse at all, in the brain.

It could be possible, although I doubt if you could actually replace relativity with some other theory that could allow that. So for now it's not possible maybe in future. \nI believe that because think about it before relativity we all thought that time was constant. \n\nPlus even if we can't reach speed of light, we might be able to get close to it which can let us travel farther cause of time dilation. I don't think you could go back in time though.
If you mean the air blowing through the nozzle, then yes you can.  The air has to be under pressure and as it flows through the nozzle the pressure drops suddenly which causes a cooling effect.  This is known as the Joules-Thompson effect or J-T for short.  It is used in industrial processes to cool gas streams.  The drawback is that unless you have a large pressure drop ( probably at least 30 or 40 psi) the cooling will not be significant.  The power required to raise the air to that pressure is quite a bit and the noise the nozzle would generate make it unsuitable for much outside the industrial area.  It would not be as efficient or as quiet as your home air conditioner for example.
Rain is generally preceded by a drop in the barometric pressure, right? That's why your old scars or bad knees or whatever ache when rain is coming. Your body is adjusting to the drop in pressure.\n\nSo the idea is that maybe the lower pressure affects a cow's digestive system - all those gasses and juices and stuff in all those stomachs.\n\nSo this kind of puts the cow off its feed, and it doesn't feel like grazing.\n\nBeing a cow and all, it can't think of anything else to do so it lies down.

It comes from calculus called the mean value theorem.
"A side stitch is a piercing sensation just below the ribcage, usually felt when you're running. In the past, several different theories tried to explain the cause: trapped gas, swollen liver, stomach muscle cramps. However a recent and fairly conclusive theory holds that strain on the ligaments connecting the liver to the diaphragm is the cause. \nThe liver ""hangs"" from the diaphragm by fibrous bands called ligaments. Running exerts a steady downward force on your liver, stretching these ligaments. In addition, when you exhale (usually as your left foot hits the ground), your diaphragm is pushed up. That means your liver falls with gravity as your diaphragm rises, placing considerable strain on those poor ligaments. \n\nThe result? A stitch. The cure? Stop running immediately and press your hand just below the pain. This should raise your liver up, relieving the strain on the ligaments. Inhale and exhale evenly as you press down. \n\nAs a preventive measure, take deep, full breaths while running. If you take shallow breaths, your diaphragm is consistently raised, which wreaks havoc on your ligaments. Exercise is great, but remember to be kind to the rubber bands keeping your organs in place."

Oxygen is dissolved enclosed in small cavities in the water which are similar to cavities in the ice structure. The warmer water gets, the less likely these cavities are to persist.\n\nAlso, the warmer the water gets the more likely the gas will move out of those cavities.
it's organic because the cows used to make the milk weren't given hormones to make them produce more milk faster.  UHT is probably too time consuming when trying to get as much milk as possible in the shortest amount of time. If that isn't the case, then the process is too expensive.

There are several ways to build tunnels underwater.\n\nOne way is to build sections of tubes in advance, float them into position using tugboats, sink them, have divers go down and seal the sections together, and then pump the water out.\n\nA more traditional way is to dig a tunnel far enough below the sea bottom that the rock over them keeps out the water.  It's kind of like digging a mine,\n\nIf the rock or soil isn't able to keep out all the water while the tunnel is being dug, sometimes it's possible to pump compressed air into the tunnel, so the pressure inside the tunnel is greater than the water pressure outside, and have workers seal the inside of the tunnel with a concrete or steel lining.

Most substances expand when heated.  Water is the only exception because of it's hydrogen bonds (with oxygen).

"Bedrock is the native consolidated rock underlying the Earth's surface. Above the bedrock is usually an area of broken and weathered unconsolidated rock in the basal subsoil. The term implies that the rock lies in beds, or strata. Under any given location on the surface of the planet, rock will be found. The term bedrock may be somewhat misleading, since in many locations, the bedrock may change over a short distance, or the technical bedrock may be a thin stratum overlying quite different rock.\nGravel is rock that is of a certain grain size range.

More colloquially, when speaking of the last few million years, ice age is used to refer to colder periods with extensive ice sheets over the North American and Eurasian continents: in this sense, the last ice age ended about 10,000 years ago. This article will use the term ice age in the former, glaciological, sense; and use the term glacial periods for colder periods during ice ages and interglacial for the warmer periods.\nMany glacial periods have occurred during the last few million years, initially at 40,000-year frequency but more recently at 100,000-year frequencies. These are the best studied. There have been four major ice ages in the further past.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age\n\ngo to the link below for a documentary\nhttp://a614.g.akamai.net/7/614/2201/v001/aetn.download.akamai.com/2201/thc/classroom/guides/ice_age_study_guide.pdf"
"Honestly, the possibility is there.\n\nMasutatsu (Mas) Oyama (1932-1994) had dispayed his incredible punching and striking power upon 52 bulls.  Three were killed instantly and 49 had their horns broken off with knife-hand chops.  His physical strength and agility could easily silence a tiger in one hit.\n\nIt has been said that if O-Sensei Mas Oyama hit you, YOU BROKE!  His nickname was ""The Godhand.""  His martial arts style is known as Kyokushinkai."

This is agreat question.\n\nCanned air, also called duster or dust off, is a product consisting of liquified difluoroethane, trifluoroethane, or tetrafluoroethane in a spray can, with a very long nozzle that enables the user to direct a precisely focused blast of air. Contrary to popular belief, the cans do not contain compressed air, as inert gases such as tetrafluoroethane are much easier to compress into liquid. Hydrocarbons, like butane, were often used in the past, but their flammability forced manufacturers to use fluorocarbons.\n\nCanned air is usually used to clean or dust delicate or sensitive things such as electronics and computer equipment, as jets of gas are often gentler and sometimes more effective than other cleaning methods. Using gas in spray can form is more convenient than using an air compressor or air tank.\n\nNormally, the liquid in the can immediately changes state into gas when it leaves the nozzle. Gases compressed into liquids absorb much energy upon vaporization, which is why under normal use, the can becomes quite cold to the touch. Turning the can upside-down and spraying does not allow for the liquid to immediately vaporize, and therefore turns the can into a freeze spray.\n\nCanned air is one of many inhalants that can be abused.
Simply put: It's all relative.\n\nKinda like how we're all related (i.e., share a common ancestor).
Time could be defined as a dimension.  We are always subconsciously aware of this time. We use it to define how long things would take. For example we can say that an x program will last for about an hour. So my definition of time would be that it is used to define how long a specific thing or event would take or took. And as long as you are on the earth and not moving really fast, you can say that it is constant meaning the same every where. I don't mean to say that 1 p.m. here is 1 p.m. everywhere. But I mean that an hour here is hour everywhere on earth.
When you begin to exercise, the body's response is to lay down new bone in the front of the shin area.  If you begin slowly, that new bone has time to develop, and harden.  If you push beyond that slow process, the new bone begins to shatter slowly, and microscopically.  The best method to avoid this is to begin your process slowly, so that the bone continues to form, yet not be stressed.  Shin splints are the leading cause of having to back off training of young race horses.  Trainers now know that when shin splints begin (It's called shin bucking) the trick is not to lay the horse up, but to back down on the speed and the amount of work.  If the horse is laid up, the new bone is absorbed.  So the cause of shin splints in horses, as well as humans is too much work, too hard, too fast....

The word CARNIVORE can be used as a taxonomy term (order of mammals) or a diet term......but....\n\nNo, skunks are CARNIVORES and have very sharp canines to tear flesh.  Many carnivores (by their taxonomy) however may be able to eat plants too and are called omnivores.  Bears, like skunks, have very sharp canines, eat flesh, but also can eat berries, etc, so they are omnivores by diet. Our dogs and cats are also carnivores by taxonomy, but their diet is omnivorous esp since the pet food industry adds all sorts of veggies to the pet food. Left wild, undomesticated, many cats and dogs in the wild would perhaps hunt a lot more and eat more meat.\n\nAlso rodent taxon is not a family.  Families end in -dae letters in the latinized term. Rodents are famous for their enlarged incisors that allow them to chisel-gnaw at their foods, typically vegetarian-herbivore. They do not have the emphasized canines found in carnivores.

Dating back to 1400 BC, the Oracle of Delphi was the most important shrine in all Greece, and in theory all Greeks respected its independence. Built around a sacred spring, Delphi was considered to be the omphalos - the center (literally navel) of the world.\n\nPeople came from all over Greece and beyond to have their questions about the future answered by the Pythia, the priestess of Apollo. And her answers, usually cryptic, could determine the course of everything from when a farmer planted his seedlings, to when an empire declared war.
Analytical Chemists measure things.\n\nThis is a very broad generalisation, but essentially an analytical chemist measures a quantity in order to elucidate the composition of a mixture or the structure of an unknown compound. \n\nAnalytical Chemists are found in a broad range of industries and professions. Not all chemists wear white coats, in fact many forensic scientists start out their career as analytical chemists.\n\nSome common tools used by analytical chemists are:\n\n1. Mass Spectra - this technique at a crude level will give you the molecular weight of a compound but on a more elegant level will also allow for some structural elucidation.\n\n2. HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) - this technique allows a chemist to separate the components of a mixture by their affinity to certain substrates packed into a column and provides quantitative information on the amount of each component in a mixture. When coupled to a range of detectors such as Mass Spectrometer, NMR, or even a simple diode array detector can give very powerful technique to elucidate the composition of an unknown mixture.
Otto von Guericke performed the Magdeburg experiment. He created the Magdeburg hemispheres, which were a pair of large copper hemispheres precisely cast so that their rims fit tightly together. When the rims were sealed with grease and the air was pumped out, the resulting sphere contained the world's first artificial vacuum. \n\nGuericke's most famous performance (the Magdeburg Experiment) was carried out on 8 May 1654 before the Emperor Ferdinand III, and attracted crowds from all over Saxony. Before the emperor and a large crowd, Guericke greased the rims of the two hemispheres and carefully fitted them together. Then the local blacksmith began vigorously pumping the air from inside the sealed copper globe. After a while he was joined by his assistants, as the cranking of the pump gradually became more and more laborious.\n\nThe crowd then watched as a team of eight horses harnessed together was led into the square and attached to one hemisphere of the copper globe. Another team of eight horses was then attached to the other hemisphere. At a signal from Guericke, the two teams of horses strained forward in opposite directions, attempting to pull the two hemispheres apart, but no matter how hard they pulled, the horses could not separate the spheres. Guericke told the crowd that all that was holding the hemispheres together was the pressure of the air surrounding them. The vacuum inside the globe meant there was no opposing pressure to balance this great outer force. They were held firmly together by the air pressure of the surrounding atmosphere.\n\nClick on the link below, which shows an illustration of the fantastic experiment.\n\nhttp://www.tau.ac.il/~phchlab/experiments/vacuum/MAGDEB-S.gif\n\nHope this helps!
Hey Jodie, I thought you were supposed to be really smart.  Hydrogen is a gas.  Pi is an abstract concept (the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle).  Multiplying them makes no sense.  \nIt's kind of like asking what is a cardboard box times anxiety.\n\nYes, I sort of figured you weren't the real Jodie Foster (I agree, she is great though).  So what exactly do you mean by the term Pi?\n\nOooh, I found something, it has to do with SETI, check out this web page:  \nhttp://www.setileague.org/askdr/pi.htm
"Have a look at this link with frequencies of blood types in different racial groups\n\nHighest for type 'O' are aboriginal peoples across the globe (e.g. Australia, N. and S. America, Inuits). These would have the ""original"" human blood type, and being isolated from populations in which later mutations ('A' 'B' and 'AB') arose, they remain sometimes pure 'O'\n\nLowest incidence of type 'B' (other than those mentioned above) is in Europe, and the site says ""early European races are characterized by a very low type B frequency"". This suggests to me that type 'B' must have arisen and spread into Europe much more recently. Interesting that type 'A' is so high among Pacific rim races, but also high in Lapps and Norwegians. Maybe it has arisen independently on two separate occasions, or perhaps it confers an evolutionary (survival) advantage on people under certain environmental conditions? The worldwide distribution (except for peoples isolated for tens of thousands of years) suggests type 'A' arose a long time ago\n\nHighest for 'B'  are Kalmuks (41%) and Buryats (38%), who are of Mongolian descent. Other high scores are among the Chuvash (Urals) and Ainu (Japan) whose languages are thought by some to be part of the Altaic group originating from the Mongol language. Romany gypsies also have 35% type 'B'. Tartars, Peking Chinese, Koreans, Indians, Vietnamese and Thais also have ~30%+. This seems to me to be entirely consistent with type 'B' originating in Mongolia fairly recently and spreading East, South and West with the Mongol empire.\n\n'AB' is common in all races with high frequencies of 'B', as 'AB' comes from having parents that are type 'A' and 'B'"

Randomness, or complete unpredictability, in different fields have different meaning and significance. \n\nMany scientific fields are concerned with randomness:\n\nAlgorithmic probability \nChaos theory \nCryptography \nGame theory \nInformation theory \nPattern recognition \nProbability theory \nQuantum mechanics \nStatistics \nStatistical mechanics \n(You can read about this in the first link)\n\nIMHO, there is no way to generate truly random numbers if you are thinking of generating millions of numbers (in any large data set, one is sure to find some kind of statistical pattern). The closest we can get to complete randomness is a hardware pseudorandom process (see second and third link).
Think of a massive star that collapses into a point of singularity due to it's own gravity.  Once the radius of the star has shrunk to below the Schwarzchild radius r = 2GM/c^2, the star is a black hole.\n\nTo give you and idea of how dense that is you would have to fit 11% of the entire Earth's mass into a 1 cubic meter box for it to become a black hole.\n\nOnce this happens, no information can be receive from within the event horizon.  The event horizon is like launching a baseball high in the air.  If you launch it high enough the ball will be able to break free of the Earths gravity.  That distance that the ball has to reach to break from the Earth's gravity is like a black hole's event horizon.  Except that nothing gets past the event horizon, even light.\n\nI'm not sure if it is accept of if it is still debated, but I have heard many times that our galaxy has a black hole at the center and than eventually, all of the stars will be eventually (many billions of years) sucked into it.
Possibly.  My understanding is that CA requires six years of experience to be licensed as a PE.  Four years of experience may come from an undergrad degree in a board approved program.  The remaining two years would come from work experience.  Note that if you wanted to become licensed as a Structural Engineer you would need an additional three years of experience after being licensed as a PE.

"A good analogy here is flipping a fair coin.  So like if you have flipped a coin 5 times and each time came up heads.  What is the probability that the 6th time will be heads as well?  \n\nAnswer: the same as it was the 1st, 2nd, 3rd... 50/50.  Each event is independent of every other event, so the probability is always the same for each individual event.  \n\nNow, if you flip 6 coins simultaneously, and you want to know what the probability of getting at least one head then you use the Binomial Distribution formula:\n\n  b(k;n,p) = (n choose k)(p^k)(1-p)^(n-k)\n\nWhere n = the total number of possible outcomes\nand k = the amount of desired outcomes\nand p = the probability of k occurring\nand 1 - p = the probability of k not occurring\n\nNote: ""n choose k"" is found using the general formula (n!/[(n-k)!k!]\nwhich is like...well say n =5 then n! is 5x4x3x2x1 (in the numerator) and say k = 3 then the denominator is (2x1)(3x2x1).  \n\nIs that clear as mud?"
This very question was the focus of an article in Popular Mechanics about 6 months ago. The glacier in Greenland has been melting twice as fast as it was, only two years ago. The magazine predicted if all the glaciers of the world melted, the result would be a loss of a 100 miles of  coastline in from its present location, all over the world. Small islands would disappear altogether. The increase of water has resulted in a slower jet stream and cooler temperatures despite the claim of global warming. In fact, it's the greenhouse gases that are causing the glaciers to melt in the first place.

Photons are evil.\n\nRemember how scientists were able to slow down light to 17m/s? If photons were massless, they wouldn't slow down becasue they wouldn't need energy to move in the first place can any amount of energy would propel them at the speed of light.\n\nSo does it mean that photons have very little mass? If so, wouldn't they increase in mass when travelling at the speed of light when energy is converted into mass? \n\nTherefore, photons may have other properties no apparent in the 4 dimensions we live in and have other undiscovered properties in other dimensions.\n\nPhotons are indeed evil...
The phrase 'arrow of time' refers to any process that is assymetrical w.r.t. time. I.e. the process happens in one direction and not in the other direction (or more correctly, the reverse process is exceedingly improbable).\n\nThe main arrow of time that we are aware of is related to the physical quantity called 'entropy' and the law of the universe that governs it, the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics.  It would take some space to describe this properly, but to summarize, 'entropy' can be thought of as the amount of disorder or randomness in a closed system (one that is not receiving heat energy from an outside source).  The 2nd Law says that the entropy (disorder or randomness) of that closed system can only go up over time.  I.e. things don't get 'less random' unless some outside energy is available to cause that order.  The 2nd Law is perhaps the most profound law of the universe, and the only one we know of that introduces a time assymetry (an arrow of time).\n\nThe wiki page (see Sources), provides a nice list of different concepts of the arrows of time:\n- The thermodynamic arrow of time (entropy)\n- The cosmological arrow of time\n- The radiative arrow of time\n- The causal arrow of time\n- The weak arrow of time\n- The quantum arrow of time\n- The psychological/perceptual arrow of time\n\nIt sounds like you're interested in the cosmological arrow, and there are two possibilities:\n\nThe first is entropy (the thermodynamic arrow), and the idea that the entropy at the Big Bang was very low, and has slowly been increasing, and will eventually and inevitably lead to the heat death of the universe.\n\nThe second arrow is related to the expansion of the universe, and if gravity eventually causes the universe to stop expanding and begin contracting, the time arrow will be reversed.  The idea that the 2nd Law itself would be reversed is pretty radical.  I.e. ... that as gravity pulls everything together, things will become more and more ordered, and entropy will be *decreasing*.  \n\nIt's not clear how this second arrow will affect perception by intelligent beings.  It may be that we can't tell the difference ... i.e. that mental processes are bound to the thermodynamic arrow (entropy) ... so if this is reversed by the contraction of the universe, we won't know the difference and the universe will always appear (to us) to be expanding.  Maybe that's what has occurred!  :-)\n\nHope that helps.

There would be many more days in a year and since the earth also wobbles, there would be many more but much shorter milder seasons in a year. As it is now, I believe the earth tilts on its axis about 5 degrees of center meaning the spinning rotation and wobble are slowing down. Therefore, a high speed rotation is indicative of the earth's rotation billions of years ago.

Yes and no. The Gravitational Force is given in g = GM / r^2, where G = 6.67*10^-11, M = mass of planet, and r = radius in metres. So the G increases if the mass increases, or the radius decreases. If the moon had the same mass as us, you would weight a lot heavier on it than on Earth. But since it is a lot lighter than smaller than us, the g on the surface of the moon is less than that of ours, and since weight = mass X gravity, you weigh less.

Seems to me that your selective memory is at work - recalling the times it was accurate and forgetting about those it wasn't. Some skill above climatology *may* be shown for the general seasonal trends, but it is certainly impossible to predict weather for specific days a year in advance. The way to test them of course is with verifications. For example, choose a region and use the observed data in it for each month to see how accurate their forecast temperature anomalies are. Do the same thing qualitatively for the daily forecasts (have to develop some accuracy criteria - e.g., if the forecast says cloudy & cool for a 4 day period, what type of weather would be considered accurate). Compare the latter with the zone forecasts from the National Weather Service. That takes quite a bit of effort if done properly, but sure beats an opinion based on a general notion.
The common picture of the universe as a big sphere of space with stars in is an inacurate proposal. It is simply given as a simple method to give an idea of the principles. Think of it as a dumbed down idea to allow people to start to get to grips with an idea that has much higher levels of complexity. The universe is not expanding into space... before the universe there was literally nothing (not even a void) and the universe isn't expanding into anything it is simply expanding. If you set off on a trip to the edge of the universe... even at faster than light speed you would not reach it, you would simply come back to where you began. The dimensions that we are limited to make the image of our universe relative to our movement the euivalent to that of moving over the surface of a sphere, but not through it - here no centre and no edge exists, yet expansion can still occur. \n\nThat doesn't really answer your question but hopefully clarifies some points raised in other answers

A defibrillator is a medical device used in the defibrillation of the heart. It consists of a central unit and a set of two electrodes. The central unit provides a source of power and control. The two electrodes are placed directly on or in the patient. The device is designed to deliver an electric shock to the patient, in an effort to stop ventricular fibrillation.  Ventricular fibrillation is a cardiac condition that consists of a lack of coordination of the contraction of the muscle tissue of the large chambers of the heart that eventually leads to the heart stopping altogether.\n\nAs you can see the defibrillator doesn't actually start a stopped heart, it only corrects the poor pumping action of the heart.

I sure have ... in captivity at Healesville Sanctuary, and in the wild too.  \n\nWe live in Melbourne, and we often go bushwalking in the forests about an hour's drive from Melbourne ... just once, when we were bushwalking along well-defined tracks in the Dandenong Ranges, we had two male lyrebirds run right across the track right in front of us - about three metres from us - and then continue to run in circles, encircling us several times. We could tell they were two males, because they both had magnificent tails (the males have the larger tails than the females) ... they were obviously arguing over females or over territory, because they completely ignored us - they're usually very shy. We stood still, and they continued to chase one another and continued to cross the walking track right in front of us ... it was magical! Thank you for reminding me of this - it was about two years ago. \n\nAnd here's a great site if you're interested in Australian animals - Healesville Sanctuary, part of Melbourne Zoo, and about two hours drive to the east of Melbourne - \nhttp://www.zoo.org.au/visiting.cfm?zoo_id=2\nYou can see lyrebirds at Healesville Sanctuary - \nhttp://www.zoo.org.au/animal_page.cfm?area_id=35&zoo_id=2&animal_id=51
Hands down, the ants will win that one.
The lunar effects on tides are actually quite predominant on the effects of weather and air so to speak it is actually barometric pressure that is affected by not directly my lunar pull. The lunar pull on water affects the variable barometric pressure. The tides also play into this as currents affect wind patterns High and low pressure spots therefor affecting barometric pressure. (the high ad lows are actually descriptives of barometric pressure areas so it is kinda redundant.) You should look at NOAA web sites. You might be able to fine very good layman's answer.

Provided by David Schoppik, HHMI predoctoral fellow, University of California, San Francisco\n\nThe question is something to think about, given that cell phones seem to be everywhere. First, I'll describe a scenario in which cell phones might be expected to cause some damage, using skin cancer as an example, and then I'll review some of the scientific work that has tried to examine this scenario.\n\nThe short answer is, as far as we know, no, cell phone usage can't cause damage to your ears or brain. It has been known for a long time that certain environmental conditions are associated with higher rates of cancer, though. These conditions have led to changes in behavior, since we would all like to avoid cancer.\n\nTake exposure to sunlight. A bronze tan used to be associated with health and vigor. Now it is thought to be healthiest to put on sunscreen because overexposure to the sun's rays is linked to various skin cancers. How does that cancer happen? The sun's rays are a form of energy, which can have different effects on skin. Immediately (and pleasantly), that energy is noticed in the form of heat as our skin warms up. A bit more exposure and the skin changes its pigment (that is, it tans), which changes the amount of sunlight absorbed.\n\nBut repeated, long-term exposure has been shown to be damaging. It turns out that the increased energy, every once in a while, can actually break or change the bonds of some of the molecules that make a skin cell work. Most of the time, these breaks are harmless—the cell just dies, the break is repaired, or it makes no difference because the place where the break occurred isn't all that important.\n\nSometimes, though, the change brought about by the increased energy (coming from the sunlight) is the sort of break that changes the way something in the cell functions—a real mutation. All skin cells normally go through a cycle where they wait for a while, then replicate, and then die. The signal to die is a carefully regulated process that's an important way to make sure we don't end up with old, sick cells (cell death of this kind is usually called apoptosis). If there is a cell with a mutation in the part of the cell's blueprint (the DNA) for the pathway that controls the signals to die, you end up with a cell that may just think it should go on living forever.\n\nAt first glance, that doesn't sound so bad. But what if this same cell also decided to keep on replicating? Each cell that replicated would also live forever and keep replicating forever. You'd end up with a fast-growing immortal bunch of cells, more commonly known as a tumor.\n\nBut what do tumors have to do with cell phones? Well, it turns out that cell phones are quite similar to the sun in that they also emit energy—that's how they can send our conversations over long distances. And while the sun is much stronger, it's also much farther away. So if we hypothesize that the energy from cell phones will be harmful, one thing we can look for is the presence of tumors—either skin tumors on the ears or brain tumors. We can also expose animals to the type of energy that cell phones emit and see if they do worse than animals that haven't had that exposure.\n\nLet's see what scientists have found:\n\nStudy 1: In 2003, a group of British scientists exposed bacteria (special ones that were similar to human brain cells) to energy similar to that emitted by cell phones and found no difference between them and unexposed bacteria. This is a pretty good direct test of our hypothesis.\n\nStudy 2: In 2004, a group in Italy looked at the sorts of damage that usually occur when cells are exposed to large amounts of energy. They found that cells exposed to cell-phone-like energy did not show more damage than cells that weren't exposed.\n\nStudy 3: A group in Sweden showed in 2004 that there was no link between cellular or cordless telephones and tumors in the mouth in human
Lighthouses are navigational markers to ships at sea - they are used to warn of hazards like reefs, to lead the way to port, and to help ships steer through fog or bad weather.\n\nThey're also used as metaphors in Christianity, leading the sinners in to the safe harbor of God's Love.
"The sun's radiant heat, heats the seats, etc.  The glass allows the radiation to penetrate into the car.  However, by convection, the air heats up in the car from the hot surfaces, and then the glass prevents the heat in the air from escaping.  This is a mini model of the ""green house"" effect."
While not conceptually difficult, this is computationally problematic. The problem is that you have to factor x^7 +1. Essentially, we are finding the 7th roots of -1, so the roots are\n-1,\ncos(pi/7)+-i sin(pi/7)\ncos(3pi/7)+-i sin(3pi/7)\ncos(5pi/7)+-i sin(5pi/7).\nThe corresponding factors of x^7 +1 are\nx+1\nx^2 - 2cos(pi/7) x +1\nx^2 -2cos(3pi/7) x +1\nx^2 -2cos(5pi/7) x +1.\nEach of these can be written in the form\n(x-cos(kpi/7) )^2 +sin^2 (kpi/7).\n\nThe next step is to find the partial fraction decomposition of 1/(x^7 +1) using these factors. I would recommend a form looking like\nA/(x+1) for the first term and\n[B(x-cos(kpi/7))+C]/\n[(x-cos(kpi/7)^2 +sin^2(kpi/7)]\nfor the other terms. This will allow easier integration once the\ncoefficients are found.

"I'm glad that you asked this question because I've actually been thinking about this for a long time.\n\nBlack holes. Well, they're basically infinitly dense matter with a gravitational field so strong that it litterally bends space. This is due to the immense matter that is contained within. How? Well imagine a star's gravity. A baby blackhole would have that star's pulling power and as it absorbs more matter, its gravity field and strength would increase exponentially. \nSimply put, as more and more matter is absorbed, the gravity field is so strong that for normal matter to exist in it, it would be virtually impossible which is why i belive that the matter that has once existed has become a form of raw material so densly packed that at the center of it, matter is becomming energy. \n(matter and energy are exchangeable as dictated by einstein's E=MC2 which dictates that E=Energy and M=Mass of an object times the speed of light SQUARED!!!! I mean holy crap man, thats alotta energy, which btw, states that technically, a suger cube can destroy the earth...anyway...)\nAt the center of a black hole, there is a sphere of EXTREMELY dense matter with (given time of course) the gravitation pull of a whole star system. Thus, in theory, a black hole never ceases to stop pulling in more spacial objects in. A black hole itself,however, would never really increase in size since each time it absorbs light and matter, its gravity would increase thus keeping the size at a constant. \nAt some point however, black holes would suck everything in and eventually, there would be alot of black holes left in the universe and they would eventually suck each other in and eventually become one big black hole with an empty universe. When this stage has been reached, the matter, with its gravitational field so strong, would collapse on itself or it would rip space apart. When it collapses, all the matter sucked in would be released in a form of energy and therefore creating a ""Big Bang""."

hey, here goes hope i can help .. take a paper and a pen and draw the lines y=x and y=-x they are basicly the diagonal lines between the x-axis and y-axis that meet at the center .. then u draw the x=1 line which is the line parallel to the y-axis passing through the point (x=1,y=0) so if u look at the region envolved betwen these three lines its basicly a triangle .. and then ur asked to evolve that triangle aroung the y-axis .. the basicly the radius is the distance between the y-axis at the center (x=0,y=0) and the x=1 line which is the side of the triangle ... so basicly the distance=radius=x=1 ... now the height is the length of the side of the triangle that is farthest from the centre .. again thats on theline x=1 ... so to get the thre points of the triangle u can do the intersection between the y=x line and the x=1 line ull get the first point .. and the intersection between the y=-x line and the x=1 line ull get the second point the third one is of course at the center (0,0) ... the if u do the distance between the two other points its basicly equal to 2 ... to do the volume of the whole thing u need to get the volume of the triangle and then multiply it by 2*Π (two pie that is) cause ur revolving a triangle 360 degrees around an axis .. i tried to explain things as much as possible .. hope i could help

Marijuana is psychologically addictive. And no, it is not just weak minds that get addictive behaviors thrust upon them. We truly do not know all the factors. Some say it is the lack of serotonin or the lack of serotonin receptor sites. No one seems sure.\n\nWhat we do know is that very intelligent people can get addicted to many different things. Yes, even to Yahoo Answers.\n\nMarijuana has no nicotine and does not seem to cause an increase in lung cancer (study just came out two weeks ago) however, other inhalation problems like chronic bronchitis may be associated with longterm use. I do know that people who are stoned all the time, and those who use tend to use most of their free time, seem not to accomplish much.\n\nI doubt that I could write or do the photography that I do if I smoked dope. I certainly would lose my job. My clearance at a nuclear power plant demands me being clean and sober. If an accident were to occur, my job is to go out to the Emergency Center and calculate the release rate and advise folks on evacuation routes. Not a job for someone doing ganja.\n\nI know folks who drift along in life, quite happy as long as they can smoke some dope. I do not think they are bad or evil. They do not rob folks, they don't beat folks up. I have not even seen them get in car accidents. I wish them well.  They do spend a lot of time trying to get dope, though, and risk their wellbeing (and jail time) in getting it. \n\nI try to stay clear of gambling halls, myself. *grin* I teach statistics. And yes, I play the stock market. *sigh*

"Some people may be smarter than others because the may have more synaptic conections capable of reaching more neurons in many more parts of the brain. Having access to more ""storage area"" for memories, and being able to retreive more information from these areas. The resulting interconnectivity may produce a math genius, a gifted pianist, a soccer player, or a teacher or a physician. The first years in our life, under the care of our parents, our central nervous system is maturing. What happens then, may help explain your question. Loving, supporting parents, the absence of disease, and very good early education will create more synapsis.  Some of these characteristics may be of importance for the survival of the species, and will be coded in the DNA. So someone may be born smart, but without love and education early in life, may not be able to achieve its greatest potential."

A tropical disturbance is not often associated with a surface low.  So it is not a tropical cyclone.\n(In the Atlantic Basin) As TROPICAL WAVES exit the coast of Africa, the associated thunderstorms are fueled by warm ocean waters.  This means a large area of convection develops.  Again, there is no surface low, so it is not a tropical cyclone.\nStorms continue to grow, usually in a pulse type pattern.  Daytime heating will allow numerous storms to fire, then the convection settles down a bit at night.\nOnce the system has full tropical characteristics, and a surface low pressure.... it is considered a tropical cyclone (depression/storm, depending on estimated, or measured wind speeds.)\n\n\nHope this answers your question.

I would pitch for the incline as I believe efficiency can be calculated in terms of energy lost . Friction would play a higher role when you climb an incline than stairs . Thus loss due to Friction can be considered higher . In an Ideal world , both would mean the same amount of work , from basic principles . \n\nCheers !
Great Irish Famine (1740-1741) due to unseasonble bad weather resulted in poor crops.\n \n\nMany Scots Irish Protestants moved to America before 1776, settling especially in frontier areas of Pennsylvania, Virginia and the Carolinas. Much of the South also shows their historic imprint.\n\nPotato Famine....fungal infection in the potato crop.....\n\nDuring and after the Irish potato famine (or Great Famine (An Gorta Mór)) of 1845-1849, millions of Irish Catholics came to North America. Many arrived in Canada on disease-ridden ships referred to as coffin ships. Some of them remained there, especially in Toronto and Ontario, and became Irish-Canadians; others moved to the United States. Between 1820 and 1860, one third of all immigrants to the United States were Irish Catholics, and in the 1840s, they comprised nearly half of all immigrants

Revolution : The motion of a body around the circumference of a circle (or any object ) is called revolution.\nRotation: The motion of a body revolvoing about its own axis is called rotation.\n\nEarth revolves in an elliptical order around Sun which makes revoloutin of the earth.The gravitational  force exerted by the Sun on earth makes it to revolve earth (or any planet) around Sun. It takes 365 days 6hrs to revolve around Sun.Due to revolution of the earth , we are having different seasons like Summer, winter ,Spring,Rainy .\n\nThe cause of Rotation of the earth is due to the Evolution of the Sun and planets. Initially when Planets were formed they were at higher temperature.At higher temperature, Molecules(or the particles)  of the earth were moving randomly away from Sun, which made them to rotate.Due to rotation of the earth, we are having Day and Night..
never think of it this way... if time was to hold still then while time is holding still there is another time line which is moving okay let me put it this way... we are never still we are always moving u might not think it but it is true.  We are on earth, earth rotates and revoloves around the sun, our solar system is always revolving around in our galaxy and our galaxy always revolving in a cluster so on so we're never still... and time will never stand still... because when it is standing still, it actually still is moving forward damn it i can't find the words to expalin it lol... let me try another way lets say your watching a movie and you pause it at 40min does that mean time is holding still? the answer is no, the time might be still in a sense that it is still on ur dvd but it is still moving in the world... lol i tried to expalin it the best i could lol ... sorry if i didn't help
"Since the sun is a variable star, its solar output varies slightly over short time periods. Solar disturbances such as flares, prominences, and sunspots increase the amount of radiation from the sun. However, no long-term variations in the intensity of solar radiation have been measured at altitudes above Earth’s atmosphere. Solar radiation, at about 1,400 W/m2, varies by no more than 2%. In contrast, the geothermal heat flow from Earth averages only about 0.061 W/m2. Some theories have related climatic changes to sunspot cycles (11 years) and magnetic cycles (22 years), but no clear connection has yet been established between climate and sunspots or magnetic cycles. \n\nThe sun emits energy as electromagnetic radiation. Unlike sound, such radiation requires no medium, therefore this energy is able to travel through the near vacuum of space from the sun to the earth. \n\nMost radiant energy from the sun is concentrated in the visible and near-visible parts of the EM spectrum, and it peaks at about 500 nm, very near the 555 nm visibility peak for Homo sapiens, a result which surely is not a coincidence (and is connected to evolution). Less than 1% of solar radiation is emitted as X-rays, gamma rays, and radio waves. \n\nOnly about 25%, or about 350 W/m2, of incoming solar radiation penetrates the transparent atmosphere of the earth. The remainder is either absorbed by the atmosphere or scattered back into space. There are some latitudinal differences found on Earth. These variations are determined by time of year, by the wavelength of the energy being transmitted, and by the depth and nature of the intervening material. \n\nTerrestrial radiation is produced mainly as a result of reradiation of solar radiation. The energy is absorbed from the sun as the sun’s spectrum but reradiated from Earth at the much longer wavelengths associated with the temperature of Earth. The Wien displacement law, in which the wavelength is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature, provides a comparison of those peak wavelengths. \n\nSince the sun has a surface temperature 20 times greater than that of Earth, the reradiated energy has a spectrum that peaks at a wavelength 20 times longer than the 500 nm for the sun, or at about 10,000 nm, well into the infrared. Since the atmosphere is more absorptive to such long-wavelength terrestrial radiation, the atmosphere is heated from the ground up instead of vice versa. \n\nIn addition, water vapor and carbon dioxide absorb the long wavelengths of radiation from the earth especially well, leading to the so-called ""greenhouse"" effect. (The temperature in real greenhouses rises mainly because the glass prevents the heated air from rising, thereby increasing the temperature inside.) Ozone, on the other hand, absorbs only very short wavelengths, mainly in the ultraviolet range, and therefore forms a shield of sorts, absorbing much of the ultraviolet radiation before it can reach the earth. \n\nRadiation from the sun follows an inverse square law, so that comparisons of the solar constant can be made for other planets if we know their mean distances from the sun in AU. For example, Mars is 1.93 times further from the sun than is Earth. Its solar constant should therefore be about 27% that of Earth, about 374 W/m2. Because there is little atmosphere to absorb the energy, this is about the same as what we receive at the surface of Earth. \n\nSpacecraft have provided us with temperature measurements for both Mars and Venus. Mars has an average temperature of about 5 oC, whereas Venus has a temperature of about 500 oC. Earth is about 1.4 times further away from the sun than is Venus, and we would expect from the inverse square law that it would receive about twice as much radiation. The fact that its temperature is so much greater can be attributed only to greenhouse warming. \n\nWinter and summer seasons on Earth are a consequence not just of the obliquity factor associated with the sun’s r"
The first part of the US-Canada border was first defined in 1783 with  the Treaty of Paris, that marked the border between the new United States of America from British colonies in North America. Because the area was not well mapped, there were some disputes, and minor skirmishes, until the Webster–Ashburton Treaty in 1842 which fixed the border between Maine and New Bruinswick. As both the US and British-run Canada were exanding westward in the 1840's, there was another dispute on where the US-Canada border would exist in the western part of the continent. The Americans wanted to claim everything south of the parallel of latitude of 54' degrees 40 minutes. (leading to the phrase 54-40 or fight!). In 1846, the Oregon Territory treaty was passed, setting the US-Canada border as a continuation of the 49th parallel (where it was set along the Minnesota border). In 1903, the boundaries of Alaska were set by a US-British-Canadian commission.\n\nThere are still some areas under dispute between the US and Canada - along the Maine/New Brunswick border, and the Yukon/Alaska border (see second link)

fire, respiration, and digestion are exergonic because they break down matter, which produces energy. Protein synthesis on the other hand requires energy for the enzymes to put together the amino acid molecules.
I don't think there is terrestrial planets in our galaxy but i do believe there is life in another galaxy. Why would God only made this galaxy. Are we special? i don't think so!!!! Why do people keep seeing UFOs? Is because there's life in another galaxy. Even if people want to be naive about the subject and don't want to admitted that there's something out there beside us. Us Human we think if we don't see it with our own eyes it does not exist. I don't have to see it to beleive it. For eample: It's just like Aids. You will continue having sex until you get it. Is the same with UFOs until you don't see one you will continue thinking there's no life in another galaxy. <;0)

"The structure was built between 1887 and 1889 as the entrance arch for the Exposition Universelle, a World's Fair marking the centennial celebration of the French Revolution. It is located at geographic coordinates 48°51′29″N, 2°17′40″E. The tower was inaugurated on 31 March 1889, and opened on 6 May. Three hundred workers joined together 18,038 pieces of puddled iron (a very pure form of structural iron), using two and a half million rivets, in a structural design by Maurice Koechlin. The risk of accident was great, for unlike modern skyscrapers the tower is an open frame without any intermediate floors except the two platforms. Yet because Eiffel took good care of his workers with movable stagings, guard-rails and screens, only one man died, during the installation of Otis Elevator's lifts.\n\nThe tower was met with resistance from the public when it was built, with many calling it an eyesore (Novelist Guy de Maupassant ate at a restaurant at the tower regularly, because it was the one place in Paris he was sure he wouldn't see it). Today, it is widely considered to be one of the most striking pieces of structural art in the world.\n\nOne of the great Hollywood movie clichés is that the view from a Parisian window always includes the tower. In reality, since zoning restrictions limit the height of most buildings in Paris to a few stories, only the very few taller buildings have a clear view of the tower.\n\nOriginally, Eiffel had a permit for the tower to stand for 20 years(when ownership of it would revert to the City of Paris, who had originally planned to tear it down; part of the original contest rules for designing a tower was that it could be easily torn down), more than recouping his expenses, but as it later proved valuable for communication purposes, it was allowed to remain after the expiry of the permit. The military used it to dispatch Parisian taxis to the front line of the Marne, and it therefore became a victory statue of that battle. It was also used to catch the infamous ""Mata Hari,"" and after this, its demolition became unthinkable to the French population."

A completely unsized sheet of paper, generally used to take up excess ink from hand-written documents, letters, etc. It is also used to absorb moisture from freshly washed or deacidified book and manuscript papers, prints, maps, etc. It is often made from high grade rag or cotton linters, and also from chemical or mechanical wood pulps, or mixtures thereof. The paper is porous, bulky, and has a low finish and little strength. Basis weights generally range from 60 to 140 pounds (19 X 24—500). Aside from its use as an absorbent paper, it can be ground up, mixed with size, and used to fill in worm and other small holes in paper.
"Ive watched this area 51 ordeal since I was fresh out of high school and have had my doubts but I DO know that the government originally denied Lazar ever worked at area 51 only to find out later when the ""Right to Know"" act was passed that documents proving Lazar worked at area 51 did come up. Simply put the government was lying. I also know that ununpentium or element 115 has been created but its shelf life is too short to make it practical. Scientists are still working on finding the plateau where it becomes stable. Why is 115 even shown in the periodic table as a possible element in the first place if there isnt some truth here? More documents have recently been released proving that a military general was involved in creating the reverse engineering of the so called flying saucer at area 51. The general is now retired and has since written a book on the subject and clearly states that the area 51 flying saucer was real. He also states that the aliens arent really aliens but humans from the future! Plot thickens! I would also like to ad from my own observations, why did our military all of a sudden release the stealth aircraft to the public and have sold some of the planes to other countries? We learned once not to let our pants down and have since become one of the sneakiest and ruthless countries in the world when it comes to warfare. I am just wondering what our military has replaced these flying weapons with.....one more item needs to be brought to attention....John Glenns sighting in his first orbital flight saw what appeared to be an object traveling at greater than 25000 mph and then suddenly making a right angle turn which isnt a naturally occuring event is true.

The problem right now is since the first butanol plant isn't yet complete there is no realistic way to answer this question. \n\nChances are some of the ethanol production plants would be able to adapt fairly simply. More than likely the first butanol facilities will be modeled after ethanol facilities. You also have to remember that there are a number of major differences between ethanol production plants.
I demonstrates the duality of wave/particle beahviour that characterises the Universe.\n\nIt is easier to do with electrons.\n\nIf you take two slits, and shine a light at them you will see a diffraction pattern beyond the slits, because the light waves alternately interfere constructively and destructively. \n\nThe same happens with electrons. Which shows that they behaves like waves.\n\nBut with electrons, you can arrange to fire them one at a time at the slits. So how on earth can they interfere? But the pattern seen to develop over time is precisely what is expected with the wave theory.

As other have said, plasma in dried form is a straw or amber colour.\n\nIt does NOT exist as flakes. The proteins and salts in plasma ensure that it dries as a crystalline solid. In terms of everyday objects it looks more like brown sugar than anything else.\n\n\nYou have probably seen dry plasma. If you have ever had a graze or carpet burns you will probably have noticed amber coloured crystals forming a crust at the edge of the wound. That is \nessentially dried plasma escaping from the damaged capillaries.
several courses of action should be taken.\n\nif there is no alternative to the slope, then you should force the water to go a longer distance, and make the slope smaller, like a down hill skier.  reducing the slope and putting in many bends will slow the water down more.  \n\nupstream, a retention pond should be put in, or a sizable pool that will fill with water, slow down the water, and really delay the water form heading downstream all at once.  although if you have monsoons, this may not have maximum effect.\n\nduring the dry season, plant in the streambed and beside it where the water goes.  try to use plants that are typically in or near the water or the stream.  this will slow the water down, and the roots will help hold onto soil to keep it from washing away.\n\nafter these options, a small dam could be put in.  start by placing wooden or metal poles in a line, slightly bowed out going upstream, across the stream bed.  from there, place wooden or metal poles laid down across the perpendicular poles.  then place the soil on top of that.  in the middle of the dam, you will want it open in a v shape going up the dam, to allow water to still pass through.  a v shape will allow the little bit of water to pass when it is dryer, but more to pass when it is wetter.  ideally you should put a layer of concrete over the dam to stop it from eroding, but if not, then just pack it very tightly and put more plants right into the dam.\n\nthough some of this sounds expensive and time consuming, will save in the end if you dont have to truck in the sand.\n\n\n\nif its part of a road, use cement/ brick/ mudbricks over the section that water flows on.  if its a short section, see if it would be possible to install a culvert (pipe) so that water will flow under and not over the road.\n\nwithout additional information, i can only suggest rocks and boulders in the area to slow the water and prevent erosion.  other techniques that you can research that are more specific to your situation may be found on a yahoo search, or if you have some money, invite an engineer (geotechnical or civil) to the site if possible.

Usually, when someone says an equation or other relationship is driven by a particular variable, they mean that variable is dominant to the others.  i.e. changes to that variable will change the output of the function significantly, while changes to other variables may not.\n\nAs for dumped, I believe that it means certain terms of a larger equation are ignored because they are too small to be significant.
I did not know of this.  \n\nI was aware of the debate surrounding the fires after the asteroid hit earth.  The link I have attached is a BBC one discussing that very same thing.\n\nI recently watched a science programme which showed research that clearly indicated that the dinosaurs due to the initial impact, associated fire and the ash debris that covered the earth blocking plant life.  \n\nThe reasons for argument had been focussed on rocks that did not show effects of fire (charcoal).  The programme I saw (which I have forgotten) showed an experiment where the angle of the asteroid at 30 degrees created an effect that they could substantiate with rock findings.  Whereas initial studies surmised a direct hit with equalised spread of damage which the geologists could not support in findings.\n\nTo add to the argument found a great Q&A site regarding the differing academic views - it is still under debate!\n\nWhat did scientists think killed the dinosaurs before the impact theory was put forward?\nBefore the late 1970s, there were any number of different theories to explain the mass extinction, with no real consensus. One theory put it that mammals had eaten all the dinosaurs' eggs, but this has now been largely discredited. Another, much more widely supported, theory was that massive volcanism caused environmental changes which drove the dinosaurs to extinction. Walter and Louis Alvarez first proposed the impact theory in 1979. Soon it would dominate all thinking on the subject. \n\nWhat is iridium? Does it occur naturally on the Earth?\nIridium is an element which is found on Earth, mostly in the molten mantle, the layer beneath the crust. Sometimes it is ejected in volcanic eruptions, but it's still extremely rare. It is found in far higher concentrations in some kinds of asteroids. The impact theory was first put forward when scientists discovered asteroid-type concentrations of iridium in the KT boundary layers.\n\nHow do scientists explain the survival of some groups of animals during and after the impact?\nIt depends on who you ask. Some supporters of the impact theory suggest animals like frogs, turtles, crocodiles and fish survived by immersion in water or mud. This immersion, they argue, protected them from the initial heat wave and from the subsequent cold of an 'impact winter', when dust and atmospheric chemicals blocked out the sun.\n\nMammal species also survived. The theory has it that because most of them were small they could burrow to escape the heat and the cold. \n\nThose who oppose the impact theory argue that the very survival of these kinds of animals, some very sensitive to cold and pollution, undermines the idea that there was a global environmental catastrophe at all.\n\nHow likely is that two massive asteroids could have hit the earth within 300,000 years of each other as Prof Keller suggests?\nThere is evidence that impacts might come in clusters, caused by a lot of debris flying around the solar system at particular times. For example, two huge craters from about 35 million years ago were created about 200,000 years apart: Popigai crater in Russia and Chesapeake Bay crater in the USA. So although it would be unusual, it's certainly not impossible that there were two big impacts at the KT boundary.\n\nHow likely is that Prof Keller's team will find a crater from the second impact that they say coincided with the end of the dinosaurs? \nIt is possible but perhaps not likely. 70% of the Earth's crust has been 'subducted' - pushed back into the mantle by another tectonic plate - over the last 65 million years. Of course, supporters of the single impact theory argue it will never be found, since it doesn't exist!\n\nWhy do Keller's team believe that another impact caused the extinction? Why don't they think it could have been something else?\nThey believe that there were two impacts, one at Chicxulub 300,000 years before the final disappearance of the din
"science is the mechanism which we use to purify generalizations.   the action of science is exactly the replacement of old beliefs with new ones based on incoming evidence, and human determination, and decision, about what is ""fact"".\n but this is only the hard machinery of science, the method, the facilitation of the nature, and the vehicle of the essence of science. i am no prophet, and do not intend to subjectively interpret the universe in the manner of pronouncing some concrete, end-all, answer, so in the spirit of science, let us consider science, make some observations, and stab at some generalizations.\n    while observing science, we humans have come to one of the most startlingly obvious, and startlingly powerful, realizations; that of the principle of natural selection. this principle classically refers to biological evolution, and the ever-present consequences which acts on living things and environments when they interact.\nthe principle more recently has embodied a somewhat more anthropocentric form. richad dawkins [1] was one of the early and explicit proponents of visualizing the effort of natural selection as the ""selfishness"" of genes, and that the driving force of the principle was the expressed selfishness of genes trying to do nothing but replicate themselves, and propagate into the future. the longer that they survive, the more likely it is that they will replicate.  this embodies the cut throat behaviors in nature, as well as the collectivity and cooperativity. this is all very well, and nice, and has been very well recieved in the world of biology  (but not because we are biochauvinists, overly able to relate to something once it is reminicent of human face, but because, the muse of science it the same as the muse of poetry, and imagery enhances scince on a grand scale, so that a better analogies will lead to easier, and better visualization, which will lead to easier and better work). this notion is just precursor to what this question has lead us to. in his book, richard dawkins goes further to introduce the notion of ""memes"" (mee' ms), which are intended to be the analogue of genes, only in the mental realm. they are ideas, tricks, songs, poems, sloagans... truly, anything which can be abstracted, realized, and passed from one mind to another. so that the idea of memes is a meme itself, and it replicated itself from the mind of an author, to my mind, via language, and if  you have not heard of this already, then it has replicated itself again into your mind. very much like genes, memes continue to exist only through replication, and they may mutate as they pass through different minds. yet, unlike genes, a meme can be very sucessful in replication, and yet be very destructive to its host. take for instance, heroin use. it is a learned trick, which has some concrete subjective effect, and yet ultimately has a negative effect on the life of the host, the replication of their genes. for the most part, memes have no regard for genes. this is dangerous for a society which is driven by memes.\n science seems to be the principle of natural selection, but not gene selection in the way of darwin, but a sifting sort of meme selection, acting on a very small class of memes, serving to develop them into the most powerful and planet altering memes that humans have ever seen. because of the power of these things, the careful selection of the memes of scientific principles is very important. the memes which are selected by science are the human interpretations of the principle(s) of the universe. certainly, natural selection existed before it generated the human mind. it was simply left to science to put it into worded interpretation. this did not take very long. not only that, but more than one person came upon the idea, independent of each other. how universal is the action of science then? \n   in a sense, science is a special case of the principle of natural selection, if you g"

"Sound is made by vibrations of the air (or other medium). Vibrations are caused by many means, and a gunfire is one of them. It is called ""explosion"". It moves the air particles at the end of the barrel in random ways, by expulsion of the combusted gun powder gasses and by the movement of the bullet. \n\nThe first reason of the sound is uncontrolled expansion of gasses at the end of the barrel, that cause air particle to vibrate at various frequencies for a short time, while gasses move them apart from one antoher.\n\nThe second reason is the bullet breaking the sound barrier when exiting the barrel. It's average velocity is 450 m/s up to 1200 m/s. If speed of sound at 20oC and 1 atm is cca 340 m/s, it is clear that sound barrier is broken, which causes ""boom"".\n\nSo, mixture of those two sounds make sound of a gun fire."

"TUESDAY, Oct. 11 (HealthDay News) -- Researchers have developed an antimicrobial coating that can be chemically bonded to gauze bandages, socks and hospital bedding and gowns to prevent the spread of dangerous antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nThe coating, which kills the two most common and harmful kinds of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that cause infections in hospitals, works by blocking the bacteria's ability to reach and re-colonize wounds. Bacteria should also have a tough time becoming resistant to the coating, which was designed to thwart such resistance.\n\n""These technologies are especially timely given the threats that are facing the American public, such as antibiotic-resistant bugs occurring in hospitals across the world. This has the potential to be used widely,"" Christopher Batich, a University of Florida (UF) professor of biomedical engineering and one of the coating's inventors, said in a prepared statement.\n\nClinical trials of the coating in gauze will be conducted at UF later this year.\n\nEach year, nearly 2 million people in the United States contract infections while they're in hospital, says the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria cause about 70 percent of those infections."

Spinning the tire will spread the fluid along the outside perimeter of the tire.  The tire pressure will not affect nor disperse the liquid because of the density of the fluid is greater than the density of the air and gravity will keep the denser material on the bottom.  However, the centrifugial force of spinning when greater than the forced of gravity placed on the material will allow the material to spread in the direction of the greater force.  i.e. , as the tire spins the heavier material will spread along the outside preimeter of the tire in the direction of the force both away from the nucleus and in the direction of rotation.

I would like to throw in my two cents to this question. First, in order for actin and myosin to attract, calcium is required. Where does it come from? Well to start a muscle contraction, the neurotransmitter ach must be present at the myoneural junction. Now an action potential will travel down the t-tubules and open gates that allows calcium to leave the sarcoplasmic reticulum . The calcium stored there simply diffuses down its own concentration gradient. Now for the muscle to relax the calcium must be re-stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, now it is against its concentration gradient, and it takes ATP energy to put it back. So to answer your question it takes ATP energy to cause muscle contraction and it takes ATP energy to cause muscles to relax. In fact as ATP stores deplete, it takes muscles a longer period of time to relax. I have actually measured this.
"redish/orange\n\nVenus is the second planet from the Sun. A terrestrial planet, it is sometimes called Earth's ""sister planet"", as the two are very similar in size and bulk composition.\n\nVenus has an atmosphere consisting mainly of carbon dioxide and a small amount of nitrogen, with a pressure at the surface about 90 times that of Earth (a pressure equivalent to a depth of 1 kilometer under Earth's oceans); its atmosphere is also roughly 90 times more massive than ours. This enormously CO2-rich atmosphere results in a strong greenhouse effect that raises the surface temperature more than 400 °C (750 °F) with temperatures at the surface reaching extremes as great as 500 °C (930 °F) in low elevation regions near the planet's equator. This makes Venus's surface hotter than Mercury's, even though Venus is nearly twice as distant from the Sun and only receives 25% of the solar irradiance (2613.9 W/m² in the upper atmosphere, and just 1071.1 W/m² at the surface). Owing to the thermal inertia and convection of its dense atmosphere, the temperature does not vary significantly between the night and day sides of Venus, despite its extremely slow rotation. Upper atmosphere winds circling the planet approximately every 4 Earth-days help distribute the heat to other areas on the surface.\n\nThe solar irradiance is so much lower at the surface of Venus because the planet's thick cloud cover reflects the majority of the sunlight back into space. This prevents most of the sunlight from ever heating the surface. Venus's bolometric albedo is approximately 60%, and its visual light albedo is even greater. Thus, despite being closer to the Sun than Earth, the surface of Venus is not as well heated and even less well lit by the Sun. In the absence of any greenhouse effect, the temperature at the surface of Venus would be quite similar to Earth. A common conceptual misunderstanding regarding Venus is the mistaken belief that its thick cloud cover traps heat, as the opposite is actually true. The cloud cover keeps the planet much cooler than it would be otherwise. The immense quantity of CO2 in the atmosphere is what traps the heat by the greenhouse mechanism.\nSize comparison of terrestrial planets (left to right): Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.\nEnlarge\nSize comparison of terrestrial planets (left to right): Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.\n\nThere are strong 300 km/h (200 mph) winds at the cloud tops, but winds at the surface are very slow, no more than a few miles per hour. However, owing to the high density of the atmosphere at Venus's surface, even such slow winds exert a significant amount of force against obstructions. The clouds are mainly composed of sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid droplets and cover the planet completely, obscuring any surface details from the human eye. The temperature at the tops of these clouds is approximately −45 °C (−50 °F). The mean surface temperature of Venus, as given by NASA, is 864 °F (464 °C). The minimal value of the temperature, listed in the table, refers to cloud tops —the surface temperature is never below 400 °C (750 °F). (This makes the surface temperature hot enough to melt lead.)\n\nThe atmosphere also contains hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and carbonyl sulfide (COS). Hydrogen sulfide reacts with sulfur dioxide, which implies that some process must be creating these components. It is unclear how the carbonyl sulfide could be formed--it is often a sign of biological activity. Some have suggested that microbes exist in the clouds (which also contain droplets of water), and produce these components from water, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide.

"A statement is called biconditional when it expresses the idea that the presence of some property is a necessary and sufficient condition for the presence of some other property. Such a statement is usually phrased in the terms ""P, if and only if Q."" The phrase ""if and only if"" is often abbreviated as iff. Thus:\n\n    He will be president if and only if he wins the presidential election.\n\n...is a biconditional statement. It is unusual that people use statements with such precision in ordinary language, but they are vital in philosophy and mathematics. The label biconditional arises from the fact that the statement ""p iff q"" is really an abbreviated way of saying two conditional statements: ""if p then q"" and ""if q then p."" Thus, the above biconditional really means:\n\nIf he wins the election, he will be president, and if he is president, he has won the election."

"In a round-about way, in the form of Hawking radiation (named for famed physicist Stephen Hawking, its discoverer).

if you were traveling at the speed of light, which would basically make you light itself, time would never pass and you would be unaware of the concept of time.  \nwhen you talk about the light year, that's a measurement of distance- the distance that something traveling at 180,000 miles per second goes in a year.  i know that it's confusing, because then you get into the concepts of proper and coordinate time, and proper and coordinate distance.\nbasically, if you are traveling at exactly the speed of light, which you cannot do, from your perspective it would take no time to travel anywhere, and therefore you would travel no distance.  it's pretty freaky stuff.\nwe look at it a different way because we have a different perspective and travel at a different speed.\ngosh i love relativity.

"You can start a web site like this guy:\nhttp://www.savelivesinmay.com/\n\nHe tried to warn people of a big tsunami on the Atlantic coast on May 26, 2006, based on information from crop circles and messages from extraterrestrials and time travelers.\n\nWhen nothing happened, he updated the page with a press release on June 6, 2006 saying ""Tens of millions of lives saved on May 25, 2006 thanks to the announcement of a giant tsunami for that date!""  Apparently the warnings caused world governments to come together, and ""relations between Iran and the United States have thus miraculously improved.""  This caused the extraterrestrials to spare us at the last minute.  Whew!  That was close!\n\nSo no matter how bizarre your predictions, there are people who will believe you.  \n\nHeck you don't even need a prediction.

Stars do move, as well as rise and set along the horizon just as the sun and moon do.\n\nStars, just like objects in out solar system, orbit the center of their galaxies.  However, most stars are just too far away to tell any discernible movement from day to day.\n\nAs the Earth rotates on its axis during the course of the night, stars will appear to rise and set on the horizon.  If you have a camera with the capability of a very long exposure, you take a picture of the sky over the course of a few hours.  When the picture is developed, you wont see just points of light, but rather streaks across the sky as the stars moved every so slightly.\nAlso, as the Earth revolves around the run throughout the year, certain stars become visible and others not based on out position in the solar system.  Some constellations can only be seen during the summer/winter since the Earth is located on the opposite side of the sun during those times.
"There is no such THING as the PHOTON BELT. In fact it is actually a theory. The only thing like that is a solar flare from the sun. Photons are particles of light and energy and wouldn't effect anything on Earth.\nPS, the photon belt is actually a band of energy from the sun, ie, although it is theoretical I still know a bit about it although it is very little. The sun gives off solar flares but theoretically it gives off a rounded wave or a blast wave that slows down and this band is invisible and orbits around the sun. It isn't actually to do with photons, it is to do with energy although it is on the electromagnetic light spectrum. It contains electrons but is relative to and is related to plasma and energy physics this effects the Earth the same way as a solar flare does so the ""solar wave"" or the so called ""photon belt"" physically a belief of when all equipment went and goes down.\nI beleve there isn't one but we are always make up theories and beliefs of things to understand anomalies."

"Bermuda is a tropical island because of it's climate.  To consider something as ""tropical"" doesn't necessarily depend on how far it's located from the tropics itself.\n\nThe different in temperature across the Atlantic is determined by the current in the Northern Atlantic.  It runs clockwise from the coast of Africa, to the Caribbean, up the East Coast of the US, and towards Western Europe.  Latitude wise, England is farther north than New England, but temperatures are similar due to the climate brought upon by the Atlantic current.  Once the current heads south towards southern Europe, it starts to cool.  Think of the same situation for the West Coast of the US, which is cooler on average than the Philippines or Japan across the Pacific."

"The answer is the is no ""life"" after death.\n\nLife as you know it does not continue. However is there another reality after death, who knows; but the life as you know it today will not be remembered, your memories are gone because the vessel (your brain, your biological computer) can't go with you; the hard drive is erased, the memory is gone.\n\nPerhaps the process of our atoms achieving sentience is pre-ordained; we could return to the state from which we came, where we didn't need these vessels to experience universe's space and time.\n\nWe could be sub-routines for a greater program... ;) So if you can prove that there is a way to upload your memories or the essence of your being before dying, then your memories and potentially the ability to perceive what happens after you die may be intact somewhere.\n\nRemember, without your life experiences to which to compare your new afterlife experience, there is no frame of reference.\n\nThink about a new born, most of us can't remember crap before 2 years of age, it's because we had not learned how to remember because we didn't know the name of things, how they looked, etc.; we simply didn't know how to build a directory yet for retrieval.\n\nI know many of you don't want to hear that, so enjoy the life you have now, it's a short one."
It's very easy to answer this question. We can find the no. of times all the 5 groups met on one and the same day in the first quarter- the New Year's Day excluded- by finding the least common multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. This isn't difficult. It's 60.\nTherefore, the 5 will all meet again on the 61st day.\nAll the 5 groups can meet on the one and same day only once in 60 days. And since there are 90 days in the 1st quarter, it means there can only be one other day on which they all meet.\nNow, coming to the 2nd question, this is positively more difficult to find the answer.\nTo find the answer to this, it is necessary to write down all the no.s from 1 to 90 and then strike out all the days when the Literary Group meets- for eg., the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th etc.\nThen we must cross out the Dramatic Group days- for eg., 4th, 7th, 10th etc.\nThis way, we must cross out the days of the Musical, Dancing and Painting Groups also. Then,the no.s that remain are the days when none of the groups meet.\nWhen we do that, we will find that there are 24 such days- 8 in January (2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24 and 30), 7 in February and nine in March.!!!

The question now is not if we understand your proof. The question is, do u understand what u r doing actually?\n\nI didn't see your proof of N=a^2-b^2 for any number, but I take it as u have done it correctly becos this is true and is, in fact, very obvious. N=a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b)=c.d Any number can be expressed as product of other numbers, this is trivial. Even the nondivisible prime number can be expressed in such way by choosing a and b such that either a+b or a-b is 1.\n\nAs for your proof..\n\na^n = b^n + c^n\n\nu r trying to show ALL numbers can ONLY be written in a^n - b^n when n=2, and not n>2. Since c^n is included in ALL number, hence, there is no a^n = b^n + c^n for n>2.\n\nU started out by stating n=2. a^2-b^2. You then factor this to become (a+b)(a-b), then u restate a and b in term of x, e and d.... a=x+e, b=x+d. you then substitute a and b with x+e and x+d. Then, u found for the product to be equal N, given one side is a+b, the other side must be a-b.... and hence u get back a^2-b^2. Then u conclude, n must be 2 and nothing else.\n\nThe problem is.... u r essentially doing nothing here except, stating a^2-b^2... write in in another form(factor form).... write a and b in another form(x,e,d).... then u do everything in reverse again by turning (x,e,d) back into a and b.... turn factor form into a^2-b^2 form again. see. u r not doing anything at all except taking a u-turn and come back again.\n\nwhen a-b=d, now matter how fancifully u express a and b, their difference is still d.\n\nSo, u dont have to repeat your proof here again and again.
Acceleration towards the Earth is equal to the Earth's geocentric gravitational constant* (3.986 x 10^14 meters^3/sec^2) divided by the square of distance from the center of Earth (6378000 meters)^2.  \n\nIn other words:  (3.986 x 10^14)/(6.378 x 10^6)^2\n\nThat comes to about 9.8 meters/sec^2.\n\nAcceleration away from Earth due to the rotation of the Earth is equal to the square of the velocity divided by the radius of the Earth (6.378 x 10^6 meters). \n\nIn other words, v^2/r.\n\nThe Earth rotates 2(pi) radians per day, or about 7.292115 x 10^-5 rad/sec.  You convert that to a linear velocity by multiplying the radius (6.378 x 10^6 meters) by the angular velocity (7.292115 x10^-5 rad/sec).  At the equator, that comes to 465 meters/sec.\n\nSquaring the linear velocity (465 meters/sec) and dividing by the radius (6.378 x 10^6) gives you an acceleration of only 3.4 cm/sec^2 away from the Earth.\n\nIn other words, the acceleration towards the Earth due to gravity is about 288 times the centripetal acceleration away from the Earth.  It's there, but the force of gravity is much stronger.\n\n* - the geocentric gravitational constant is just the universal gravitational constant multiplied by the mass of the Earth.

"""actually there has been a few recorded cases of male pregnancy and men giving birth twas the inspiration behind a movie starring arnold Schwarzenegger""\n\nI disagree.  The inspiration was that some women have delivered live babies which developed outside the womb; in the peritoneal cavity.  In these cases, the placenta of the ectopic pregnancy embeds itself into the walls of various abdominal organs.\n\nThe situation is very dangerous.  Commonly, ectopic conceptions end in massive haemorrhage, long before the foetus has any chance of surviving outside the mother's body.  Her life is endangered, as the bleeding is huge, and sometimes is hard to diagnose, in time to save her life.\n\nAnyhow, there has been speculation that an embryo from IVF could grow in a man's abdomen; clearly, a uterus is not an absolute requirement.  I think no ethics board could condone such an attempt, as his life would be endangered if the pregnancy ended in haemorrhage preterm.  [Well, it would be endangered anyhow, but it is extra yukky, if the baby dies too; the usual outcome!]\n\nI suspect that a male's body would also be unable to suppress his immune system enough to avoid rejection of the foreign tissues of the conceptus.  I am not sure, but I wonder if females are better able to do this complex immunological trick!\n\nBTW, all these cases must be dealt with surgically; it is major abdominal surgery!"
"Forensic Scientist ($22,000-35,000)\n\nJob Description\nForensic scientists collect and analyze evidence found at crime scenes. Specifically, they analyze blood, saliva, semen, drugs, fingerprints, and firearms and perform reconstructions on skeletal bones. Forensic scientists also confer with law enforcement personnel and attorneys on evidence collection, preserve evidence, write reports, and testify in court. The scientific analysis of evidence often proves critical in determining the innocence or guilt of a person accused of a crime. Thus, forensic scientists play a vital role in the criminal justice process.\n\nEducation\nEntry-level jobs in forensic science require a four-year degree in one of the following: biology, chemistry, physics, microbiology, genetics, or medical technology. Communication arts and law classes are considered helpful. Some crime labs also require laboratory experience.\n\nSpecial Skills\nA forensic scientist works with many different kinds of people, often under stressful circumstances. Thus, it is essential for a person in this field to have good ""people"" skills. Because forensic scientists must complete many reports and make court appearances, they must be capable writers and good speakers. Finally, forensic scientists must be able to manipulate tiny bits of evidence under a microscope that requires excellent hand-eye coordination.\n\nSalary and Benefits\nForensic scientists generally work for state or federal crime laboratories. Because these positions are found primarily in government, some medical and retirement benefits are paid.\nAt the state level, beginning forensic scientists are paid about $1,900 per month. Those who start with laboratory experience may receive as much as $3,000 per month. Depending on the state, experienced workers may eventually earn between $35,000 and $50,000 per year. Federal salaries are usually higher.\n\nWorking Conditions\nAs employees of the government, forensic scientists generally work 40-hour weeks. However, because of increasing caseloads and the need to meet deadlines, they may work extra hours.\nForensic scientists work primarily in the crime lab. However, they also go to the scene of the crime to examine and secure evidence, and they testify in court.\n\nOutlook\nGood forensic scientists are always in demand. However, because of pressures to reduce government funding, beginning positions are usually limited, and competition for them is keen. The job outlook in this area is, at best, fair.\n\nFor More Information\nAmerican Academy of Forensic Sciences\nP.O. Box 669\n410 North 21st St., Suite 203\nColorado Springs, CO 80901"

A fluorescent tube has filaments at each end that have to heat up to vaporize the mercury necessary to start the tube.  Since they start so fast, the starting doesn't really cost that much more in electricity usage.\n\nHowever, the ballast on the twin 40 watt tube fixture uses about 20 watts by itself.  Thus, two 40 watt bulbs require 100 watts to operate.\n\nOnce the tube has started, the filaments are no longer activated and no longer consume power.  Since they burn hot, turning the bulb on and off will shorted the life of the tube.
"Palindrome Geoff is right about how to arrive at the root he described, however, that is not the whole story.\n\nJust as there are TWO numbers that satisfy the meaning of √16 (that is, 4 and -4) there are actually FOUR numbers that satisfy the meaning of √(√(-16)):\n● √2 + i√2\n● -√2 + i√2\n● √2 - i√2\n● -√2 - i√2\n\nGeoff's analysis about ""turning the angle halfway"" toward the positive x axis is a good intuitive way of understanding what is going on. However, what he left out is that it DOESN'T MATTER which direction you turn, clockwise or counter-clockwise. Both directions are equally valid and both should be taken into account.\n\nFor √(-16), turning clockwise gives you 4i, counter-clockwise gives you -4i\n\nFor √(4i), turning clockwise gives you √2 + i√2, counter-clockwise gives you -√2 - i√2 (remember, you are going halfway to the positive x axis the long way)\n\nFor √(-4i), turning clockwise gives you -√2 + i√2, counter-clockwise gives you √2 - i√2"

"""Arrogant"" is correct. To a great extent, Edison was hyping up DC power against Tesla's AC power because he had a significant financial stake in the matter. By the 1880s, all electrical power was supplied by Edison's companies (today's ConEd). Imagine having so many wires, transformers, and power generating stations around. Even in that era, the cost could amount to billions of dollars. These are what economists call ""sunk"" costs (you can't recover them).\n\nTesla's idea to use Alternating Current necessitated an entirely different approach. Tesla was working for a competing company, Westinghouse, which had different equipment. \n\nEdison did slow down progress because DC is inherently more inefficient than AC. DC current is just like the current in a battery circuit. It stays constant. But over long distances, the resistance inerent in all wires (even if they conduct electricity very well) causes much of the power to be lost as heat. To recover the lost power output, step-up transformers are required along the pathways.\n\nOn the other hand, with AC current a high-power current in massive wires produces much less resistance that is lost as heat. The only requirement is that the power be ""stepped-down"" before it arrives at your house.\n\nEdison had some legitimate claims, however. These are:\n\n-AC has the potential to do more bodily damage. The reason is not because AC current is necessarily higher voltage, because two currents of 120 volts, on average, have the same voltage whether they are direct or alternating. But alternating current is only 120 volts on average, it can actually swing much higher since it is produced as a sinusoid (a wave). When we measure the""average"" current we take the average of the peaks. That means that an alternating current can temporarily have much higher voltage.\n\n-AC current requires massive step-down transformers, so you can imagine that if you get a ""zap"" of some of the massive wires carrying high-power electricity from the power generating plants, you're instantly dead. But few of us have the misfortune to ever come into contact with such high-power lines. They mostly pose a problem to maintenance experts who literally sometimes have to arrive by helicopter to service lines."

Different gasses in the tubes produce different colors.\n\nThe initial color source is the inert gas which emits a characteristic color when electricity is applied. The two most common gases are neon which emits a fiery red, and a mixture of argon and minute particles of mercury which emits a subdued blue. Clear glass allows you to see the characteristic colors emitted by the gas. Fluorescent powders may be painted or baked to the inside walls of the glass tubing and the source light is then converted into a multitude of shades such as pink, turquoise, and green. By altering the mixture of elements, subtle differences are possible. For example, white is available in a wide array of color temperatures from warm to cool. \n\nTubing is also produced in colored glass. Deep clear reds, blues, and greens for example produce the richly saturated colors referred to as exotic or Euro glass. Colored glass may also have a fluorescent coating which can change both the quality and color of the light.

MODULUS OF RESILIANCE:\n\nThe ability of a material to absorb energy when deformed elastically and to return it when unloaded is called resilience. This is usually measured by the modulus of resilience, which is the strain energy per unit volume required to stress the material from, zero stress to the yield stress s. The strain energy per unit volume for uniaxial tension is\n\nUθ  = (1/2)*σxex\nFrom the above definition the modulus of resilience is\n\nUR   =  (1/2)*Sθeθ = (1/2)*Sθ*(Sθ/E)  = (Sθ)2/(2E)\n\nThis equation indicates that the ideal material for resisting energy loads in applications where the material must not undergo permanent distortion, such as mechanical springs, is having a high yield stress and a low modulus of elasticity. \n\n\nMODULUS OF TOUGHNESS:\n\nThe toughness of a material is its ability to absorb energy in the plastic range. The ability to withstand occasional, stresses above the yield stress without fracturing is particularly desirable in parts such as freight-car couplings, gears, chains, and crane hooks. Toughness is a commonly used concept, which is difficult to pin down and define. One way of looking at toughness is to consider that it is the total area under the stress-strain curve. This area is an indication of the amount of work per unit volume, which can be done, on the material without causing it to rupture. Figure 1.2 shows the stress-strain curves for high- and low-toughness materials. The high-carbon spring steel has a higher yield strength and tensile strength than the medium-carbon structural steel. However, the structural steel is more ductile and has a greater total elongation. The total area under the stresstrain curve is greater for the structural steel, and therefore it is a tougher material. This illustrates that toughness is a parameter that comprises both strength and ductility. The crosshatched regions in Fig. 1 indicate the modulus of resilience for each steel. Because of its higher yield strength, the spring steel has the greater resilience.\nSeveral mathematical approximations for the area under the stress-strain curve have been suggested. For ductile metals that have a stress-strain curve like that of the structural steel, the area under the curve can be approximated by either of the following equations:\nUT ≈ Su*ef\nUT ≈  ((S0 + Su)/2)*ef  \nFor brittle materials the stress-strain curve is sometimes assumed to be a parabola, and the area under the curve is given by\nUT ≈ (2/3)*Su * ef

The picture which I could see in Wikipedia, after removing the [)] from your link was of Cherenkov Radiation. C.R. happens when light travels faster than it's normal speed IN THAT CERTAIN MEDIUM. The speed of light is not same everywhere. It travels with the fastest speed in vacuum, that is the ultimate speed(3 x 10^8 m/s) of light. In heavy water it travels with a certain slower speed. When light is made to travel faster in heavy water(which is faster than the normal speed in heavy water but still slower than speed of light(c)) C.R is emitted. So, far no one has managed to make light move faster than c.
Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique used to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. It is most generally used to find the composition of a physical sample by generating a mass spectrum representing the masses of sample components.\n\nTandem mass spectrometry involves multiple steps of mass selection or analysis, usually separated by some form of fragmentation. A tandem mass spectrometer is one capable of multiple rounds of mass spectrometry. For example, one mass analyzer can isolate one peptide from many entering a mass spectrometer. A second mass analyzer then stabilizes the peptide ions while they collide with a gas, causing them to fragment by collision-induced dissociation (CID). A third mass analyzer then catalogs the fragments produced from the peptides.

It has to do with the value image for consumers. Odd pricing became common just after the invention of the cash register. At that time, employee theft was a troublesome problem, and it was thought that requiring clerks to ring up each transaction on this new device would reduce theft since it keeps a record of each transaction. But dishonest employees could simply continue to pocket the money while avoiding ringing up the transaction at all. Odd prices would force the salespeople to issue change, making it difficult to pocket the customer's payment without recording the sale. So Macy's New York began the practice of pricing products a few cents below even dollar amounts, and other large retailers soon followed suit.\n\nAnother explanation is that during the 19th century, British goods were thought to be of higher quality than American goods. Conversion of the British pound to American dollars usually resulted in an odd price. Before long, products with an odd price were associated with higher quality.\n\nIronically, the reverse seems to be true today. Odd pricing is more closely associated with discount products, and research shows that products priced in round dollar amounts carry a perception of higher quality. One study of a drug store chain found that rounding prices up to whole dollar amounts not only failed to affect sales, it had a positive effect on the store's image. It was estimated that the chain had been losing approximately $850,000 a year using odd prices. Many upscale restaurants now price their meals without any decimal place at all -- they simply show the even dollar price. This creates the psychological impression that their customers don't quibble over pennies -- pure snob appeal.\n\nHappy Answering,\n~Tia~\nLive from the big, purple brain\nhttp://advision.webevents.yahoo.com/asktheplanet/brain.html\nASK YOUR QUESTIONS, CALL THE BRAIN - 212-382-3592

"The source of the auroras is the sun. The sun gives off high-energy charged particles (also called ions) that travel out into space at speeds of 200 to 440 miles per second. A ""cloud"" or gas of such ions and electrons is called a plasma. The stream of plasma coming from the sun is known as the solar wind. As the solar wind interacts with the fringes of the earth's magnetic field, the particles are ""shocked"" into flowing around the earth. Some of the particles are trapped by the earth's magnetic field. They follow the magnetic lines of force down to the ionosphere. The particles strike the gases in the ionosphere, causing them to glow, the same way electrons passing through the gases in a neon tube make a neon sign light up. The colors correspond to the different gases in the ionosphere. Oxygen atoms give off red and green light, depending on how high they are in the ionosphere. Nitrogen molecules give off blue and violet light."
"that notion came from Carl Sagan, the author of the novel ""Contact"" that was later made into a movie starring Jodie Foster. Now in the book what he actually said was ""we are made of starstuff"". He meant that we are made of what stars are made of, as is anything else in the universe. Meaning we all things in the universe are made of basic chemical or even atomical components that are common to everything in the most basic level. It was not meant to be perceived as ""if i cut my arm off and grind it up to very small pieces it will turn into space dust""."

"Centriptal Force\n\nAny motion in a curved path represents accelerated motion, and requires a force directed toward the center of curvature of the path. This force is called the centripetal force which means ""center seeking"" force. The force has the magnitude\n\nSwinging a mass on a string requires string tension, and the mass will travel off in a tangential straight line if the string breaks.\n\nThe centripetal acceleration can be derived for the case of circular motion since the curved path at any point can be extended to a circle.\n\nNote that the centripetal force is proportional to the square of the velocity, implying that a doubling of speed will require four times the centripetal force to keep the motion in a circle. If the centripetal force must be provided by friction alone on a curve, an increase in speed could lead to an unexpected skid if friction is insufficient."

"If I understand your question: Wrinkles can generally form when the material is in compression - it is a form of buckling, so try looking up 'buckling' or instability as a topic.  Plastics are not isotropic and exhibit different properties in different directions.  (Metals, in contrast, can be isotropic, but are subject to Poisson's ratio and exhibit different behavior depending on ""plane stress"" or ""plane strain"" conditions.)\n\nPlastics for the most part are not true crystalline solids; they are viscoelastic materials with properties of directionality depending on previous processing.  For most all plastics there will be some degree of creep under tensile stress.  Relaxation of the tensile stress allows the elastic component to retract in the opposite direction of the applied tensile stress, but the plastic component (the permanent set or ""visco"" component) won't contract.  Meanwhile, the stress direction at 90° to the tensile stress has likely experienced less stress and so has a larger or more elastic component.  What this means is that as the tensile component exceeds the yield point, the cross direction has not, and may have a tendency to buckle in the cross direction.  It also depends on how you're holding onto the plastic when stretching (biaxial or uniaxial?).  \n\nSome plastics have a strong tendency to align their molecules when stretch, and become more 'crystalline' in nature.  You can see this effect by 'stress whitening' when stretching a plastic grocery shopping bag made from HDPE.\n\nThis is kind of a complicated materials engineering question requiring a little more detail into the stress state, the exact material, even the environmental conditions play a role (how warm is the ambient, humidity level, etc.)\n\nHowever, for the most part, try looking up 'buckling' because that topic may give you more insight into why the wrinkles form."

People have done this.  When I was young, and the environmental movement was just getting off the ground, a group in Massachusetts proposed doing exactly this with recyclable wastes -- such as plastic bottles -- and garbage.  Two things doomed the project: the economics (it cost more to produce oil this way than to pump it from the ground and refine it), and the movement to reduce-reuse-recycle pushed by the ecowarriors.

"The one side of the moon is always facing the earth, so when the moon rotates around the earth one time, it also spins on it's axis one time. It's probably called geosynchronous or something like that.\n\nThe moon also deviates up and down on the horizon, so we do see it's north and south poles a little more or less each time. I remember reading that we've actually seen 59% of the moon facing us.\n\nThe other side is called the ""dark side"" of the moon. But in fact it 'sees' the sun as much as the side that faces us. I guess it just 'dark' to us."

"Squirrel is the common name for rodents of the family Sciuridae (from Greek skia ""shadow"" and oura ""tail"" i.e. ""tail that casts a shadow""). In everyday speech in the English-speaking world it usually refers to members of the genera Sciurus and Tamiasciurus. These typical members of the family are tree squirrels with large bushy tails, and are indigenous to Europe, Asia and the Americas. Similar genera are found in Africa. However, the Sciuridae also include flying squirrels, and ground squirrels such as the chipmunks, prairie dogs, and woodchucks. The unrelated family Anomaluridae also have ""squirrel"" in their common name, though they are usually referred to as ""scaly-tailed flying squirrels"". The word squirrel comes from the Old French esqurial, which itself comes from the Vulgar Latin word scuriolus (squirrel).\n\nThis link has quite a bit of info on squirrels. I used to live in Wisconsin and squirrels generally slept in trees or holes in different things. They don't go anywhere for winter. We would watch them run around through the snow and our dogs used to love to chase them in the snow."
spinach and the like. \nAlso carrots, and better yet - meat products.\n\n\nThere are two sources of dietary vitamin A. Active forms, which are immediately available to the body are obtained from animal products. These are known as retinoids and include retinal and retinol. Precursors, also known as provitamins, which must be converted to active forms by the body, are obtained from fruits and vegetables containing yellow, orange and dark green pigments, known as carotenoids, the most well-known being beta-carotene. For this reason, amounts of vitamin A are measured in Retinal Equivalents (RE). One RE is equivalent to 0.001mg of retinal, or 0.006mg of beta-carotene, or 3.3 International Units of vitamin A.

(m)\n\nLatitude, usually denoted symbolically by the Greek letter φ, gives the location of a place on Earth north or south of the Equator. Latitude is an angular measurement ranging from 0° at the Equator to 90° at the poles (90° N or 90° S). Co-latitude is the complement of latitude.\n\nLongitude, sometimes denoted by the Greek letter λ, describes the location of a place on Earth east or west of a north-south line called the Prime Meridian. Longitude is given as an angular measurement ranging from 0° at the Prime Meridian to +180° eastward and −180° westward. Unlike latitude, which has the equator as a natural starting position, there is no natural starting position for longitude. Therefore, a reference meridian had to be chosen. While British cartographers had long used the Greenwich meridian in London, other references were used elsewhere, including: El Hierro, Rome, Copenhagen, Jerusalem, Saint Petersburg, Pisa, Paris, Philadelphia and Washington. In 1884, the International Meridian Conference adopted the Greenwich meridian as the universal prime meridian or zero point of longitude.

The air conditioner fan utilizes power such that air flows through the duct work and flows into the space to cool you off. You now want to use that air coming out of the vent to turn a fan which turns a shaft which generates power to drive a servo. In order to drive the servo fan, there will be a significant pressure drop in the a/c duct. That will de-rate the a/c fan. Additionally the servo fan will have mechanical losses due to friction. Say you got one tenth of a horsepower out to drive the servo. The a/c fan would supply one tenth horsepower plus mechanical losses. Additionally, since the a/c fan is de-rated it will function less efficiently. And you be hot. Plus the servo will generate heat and warm off the room more.  If you wanted to set the servo generator to the a/c exhaust the same thing. The exhaust fan would be de-rated and the a/c would not function efficiently as the amount of heat driven off would be less. Just plug your servo into the wall. There is no free lunch.

Real artistic, I know. What they are is little bits of protein and whatnot from inside your eyeball that's broken loose (most people have one or two floaters - they break loose when you whack your head on something). If you have a considerable amount of them, do get checked out, but one or two are normal.  Blinking makes them move because it moves your eyeball. And they don't move randomly - they're kind of stationary in your eyeball jelly, so when you move your eyes, it LOOKS like they moved, but that's just because you moved your eyes. I.e., if your floater's in the lower left side of your vision, after you move your eye's focus, the floater will still be in the lower left of your vision, even though it's hanging over a new backdrop."

Yes they are, because all these are phenomena in which energy is transferred between different sources. Our planet receives energy from the Sun (as differente types of waves, including ultraviolet, visible and infrared=heat), and emits radiation back to space. In addition, there's a hot metal core that also releases energy. \nThe movement of masses of air (winds systems), water (oceanic currents), very hot solids (volcanic activity) are the mechanisms to reestablish the energy balance, because they basically distribute energy from high-energy spots to lower-energy spots. \nWhen one of these phenomena is disrupted, others become unbalanced and unpredictable effects follow.\n\nThe issue whether global changes are caused by man or not is a different issue; the answer to your question is Yes.

UVB rays are needed for your skin to produce vitamin D, but it also stimulates melanocytes to darken your skin, which allows less UVB rays in. Vitamin D created by your skin and from diet is activated by the liver and kidneys, then stimulate increased absorption of calcium through in the intestines. Prior to fortification of milk with vitamin D, there was a higher occurrence of rickets amount people of darker complexion and people who didn't get enough sun exposure.
The lymphatic system is a circulatory system that uses the large muscles (those that move your body) to pump white cells - lymphocytes, macrophages, PMNs, etc - around to fight disease. These move through lymph ducts, nodes, and selected lymphatic organs (thymus, bone marrow, etc).\n\nWhat you normally think of as the circulatory system consists of the heart as the pump, arteries, capillaries, veins. It has red cells for oxygen transport but also white cells for fighting disease.\n\nThe bone marrow is the factory that produces all of the prototypes of these cells.

#1) Everything in the universe is affected by gravity but is not held in specific locations. Objects are in motion but under the effects of gravity.\n\n#2) Gravity is a constant with a few rules to follow: the gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to their mass but inversely proportional to their distance from each other. This means that object with more mass have more gravitational force but the gravity that they generate is lessened as two object move farther apart from each other.\n\nScientists speculate whether the universe will eventually succumb to the forces of gravity, causing all matter to eventually be pulled back into where the Big Bang originated, or if the Bang was sufficiently powerful, will all of the matter in the celestial bodies in the universe continue moving outward until the distance between the stars is so great that gravity can't overcome it and each galaxy is left to slowly burn out like sparks from a fireworks display?\n\nFor the last part of your question, people can walk on the Earth and on the Moon. The gravitational pull of our moon is a fraction of the Earth's pull because the moon is a fraction of the Earth's mass (remember the rules in part 1). We can't breathe on the moon because there isn't an atmosphere. The lack of an atmosphere has nothing to do with the moon's size though. It's simply due to the way the moon was formed.\n\nI hope that I was able to explain this to you properly. I'm no scientist.

Electric current is the rate of charge flow past a given point in an electric circuit, measured in coulombs/second which is named amperes.\n\nA transformer is an electrical device that transfers energy from one circuit to another by magnetic coupling with no moving parts. A transformer comprises two or more coupled windings, or a single tapped winding and, in most cases, a magnetic core to concentrate magnetic flux.  Transformers are used to convert between high and low voltages, to change impedance, and to provide electrical isolation between circuits.

Egg shell color is caused by pigment deposition during egg formation in the oviduct and can vary according to breed, from the more common white and brown to pink or speckled blue-green. Although there is no significant link between shell color and nutritional value, there is often a cultural preference for one color over another. For example, in most regions of the United States, eggs are generally white; while in the northeast of that country and in the United Kingdom, eggs are generally light-brown. These habits may be associated with perceptions of greater purity in white-shelled eggs or greater wholesomeness in brown-shelled eggs.
It depends on who is rating it and for what purpose. \n\nGenerally HP is rated at the wheels. This rating is actually ~20% less than the engine HP because of transmission losses, rolling resistance etc.\n\nAll things being equal the more HP the more power the vehicle will have, however more power does not necessarily mean speed especially while getting up to speed and for passing.\n\nTorque is actually more important than HP for speed. A high torque engine is preferred over a high HP, low torque engine. The lower the RPM the engine needs to turn  to obtain maximum torque the fast the vehicle will be able to accelerate and the more efferent the vehicle will be... This is why low HP diesel engines can pull heavy loads... diesels generally have several times the amount of torque of a similar HP gasoline engine and their torque is developed at lower speeds (RPM) than gasoline engines... that is one reason diesels are so fuel efficient vs gasoline engine...\n\nHope this helps.

"Mount Kosciuszko, located in the Snowy Mountains, in Kosciuszko National Park, is the highest mountain in mainland Australia. It was named by the Polish explorer Count Paul Strzelecki in 1840 in honour of the Polish national hero General Tadeusz Kosciuszko.\n\nIt was formerly spelled ""Mount Kosciusko"", an anglicisation; but the version ""Mount Kosciuszko"" was officially adopted in 1997 by the NSW Board of Geographic Names. The spelling adopted by the Board of Geographic Names was the original Polish spelling, ""Kościuszko"", including an accent over the ""s"", but that recommendation has generally been ignored in Australia (since such a character is not a usual feature of Australian language). It should also be noted that the common Australian pronunciation of Kosciuszko, ""kozzy-osko"" or [ˈkɔziˌɔskoʊ] (IPA), is quite different from the pronunciation in Polish, ""kosh-CHOOSH-ko"" or [ˈkoɕˈtɕuʃko].\n\nVarious measurements of the peak originally called by that name showed it to be slightly lower than its neighbour, Mount Townsend, and the names were thereupon transposed by the New South Wales Lands Department, so that Mount Kosciusko still remains the highest peak of Australia, and Mount Townsend ranks as second [1]. The picture by Eugene von Guerard hanging in the National Gallery of Australia titled ""Northeast view from the northern top of Mount Kosciusko"" is actually from Mt Townsend. [2]\n\nLike many of Australia's highest peaks, Mount Kosciuszko is not particularly difficult to climb. There is a road to Charlotte Pass, from which it is a short seven km walk up a path to the summit. Anybody with a very modest level of fitness should be able to climb it. Until the 1960s the road was open to motor vehicles and it was possible to drive close to the summit.\n\nThe peak may also be approached from Thredbo, which is a slightly longer but not very difficult walk and is supported by a chairlift ride year round. From the top of the chairlift there is a raised walkway to protect the native vegetation. Kosciuszko National Park is also the location of the closest downhill skiing ski slopes to Sydney, containing the Thredbo and Perisher Blue ski resorts. Mt Kosciuszko may have been ascended by Indigenous Australians long before the first recorded ascent by Europeans.\n\nHigher peaks exist outside the Australian mainland but within territory administered or claimed by Australia:"
Astronomers have tried to explain what we see in the universe around us. The simplest explanation for everything we know about the universe is called the Big Bang theory. This theory says that in the beginning, everything in the universe was all in one place. Something unknown caused the universe to begin growing. The universe began growing very quickly, and the universe is still growing even today.\n\nAt the beginning, when all the matter in the universe was contained in a very tiny volume, it was very hot. As the universe started to grow, it cooled off very quickly. When the universe was about 500,000 years old, it had cooled enough that it was possible for the atoms that make up stars and galaxies to begin to form. Energy released when the universe was small and dense, the cosmic microwave background radiation, still fills the universe today. By studying this energy, astronomers can learn what the universe was like when stars and galaxies were first able to form.\n\nSo how old is the universe? Astronomers argue about the exact age of the universe for many reasons. But they do agree that it is somewhere between 10 and 20 billion years old.\n\n\nThe answer is that there is no outside matter or space, we are contained within a small bubble that is expanding\nspacially for us but not actually taking the space away from anywhere else.\nletucre slides on the bigbang theory. large file about 2.1mb

I want to assume that you are in some way confused with this, and not trying to get your homework done here by others.\n\nFirst, you have to acknowledge that the triangles are classified as follow:\n1. According to the relative lengths of their sides. This is a visual way to draw a triangle.\n2. According to the size of their largest internal angle. For this, you will have to use a protractor* to measure the angle between the first and 2nd line with the 3rd line. I believe this is the easiest way to draw a triangle, because you will be measuring the exact angle necessary for a specific triangle.\n\nAny way you look at it you will have to read about it eventually, there is no easy way out. My best advice is not to waste your valuable time here, try to hit the book and good luck in your test.
Its called a manometer. A U shaped device half full of water with on end connected to, for example, an air duct and the other end open to the atmosphere.

"I have never heard of an ""elderbridge"". Do you - by any chance - mean a WILDEBEEST ?\n \nThe wildebeest (from Dutch ""wild animal""), also called gnu, is a large hooved (ungulate) mammal, which includes two species, both native to Africa: the Black Wildebeest (C. gnou), and the Blue & White-bearded Wildebeest or Blue Wildebeest (C. taurinus). This large African antelope has a head with horns like an ox and a long tufted tail. \n\nThe gnus belong to the Bovidae family, which includes antelopes, cattle, goats, and other even-toed horned ungulates."

This is not a scientific question-- there is no data that you can measure to quantify an answer to this question.  Its a philisophical/metaphysical inquiry.  A valuable inquiry, but still not a scientific inquiry.  \nMy philosphy: There is no meaning to life.-- but that life is meaningless doesn't mean anything.  The good news is that you get to choose what you want your life to mean-- you can make it up!  Figure out what inspires you and calls you to be fully alive.  And follow that.  \nThe meaning of life for me is to live-- and live fully, making a contribution to others-- causing this to be a world that I can be proud to live in.\nNow, I have no way of proving this, but if you find any of it valuable, use it-- if not, keep searching 'til you find the answer that works best for you.\nHave fun!
Try sound.  The musical scale is a log base 2 scale (A = 440, and 880, and 220), while sound loudness is logarithmic, that's why they use decibels.  Double the power output from an amp and you have a (log of 2 = 0.3, times ten =3dB gain).  Look at the volume control on an amp or radio, its logarithmic, not linear.  Also, try the Beaufort wind scale, this is based on effect, not on a linear scale; earthquakes (again, based on effect); Clouds (no scale at all).  \nTo make it easy why not start with earthquakes.  This is an effect based scale so the students will be able to assess easily the effect on the local population.
"Type in ""roller coaster loop"" into Google or Yahoo and you will get about 5-10 really good sites.  See these sites for free-body diagrams that will explain the forces acting on the coaster train while in the loop.  These sites will also have more details on the stuff I am about to explain.\n\nG-forces are just a force that you feel when you are being accelerated (in the case of the roller coaster or in a car changing direction).  Usually this is expressed as multiples of gravitational acceleration on Earth (eg: pulling 3 G's means you would feel like you weigh 3 times as much as normal).\n\nThe main feature that many people don't know about roller coaster loops is that they are in the shape of a ""clothoid"" (not a circle).  Basically, the coaster train enters the loop at a fairly large radius of curvature (gentle upward slope).  Near the top, the radius of curvature tightens up.  Then, as it exits the loop, the curvature becomes larger again.  You will certainly notice this the next time you look at a coaster loop from the side.\n\nThe reasoning for creating a loop like this is because it subjects the passengers to more uniform forces than with a circular loop.  At the bottom of the loop, the train is moving faster than at the top, so the radius of curvature changes accordingly (smoother at the bottom, tighter at the top).  This design subjects the train to more or less constant ""G-Forces"" and creates a more optimal loop size.\n\nAs a comparison, the first looping roller coasters (way back in the mid 1800's to early 1900's) used circular loops with the same curvature all the way throughout the loop.  With these, you had to either make the loop smaller or send the train through the loop faster in order to make it around the top of the loop (due to slowing down near the top).  Many people complained about the rather large forces they would feel at the entrance and exit of the loop because of having to send them through so fast.\n\nSo that's a bit of info I know about the standard loop.  See the web as I mentioned before to get more detailed info/math if you want.  \n\nBut that is only on the ""standard"" vertical type loop.  In today's coasters (such as in one of my favorites ""The Raptor"" at Cedar Point) there are many upside down variations such as a corkscrew, barrel roll, cobra roll, half-corkscrew and more.  Also, there are ""overbanked"" turns such as on the Millenium Force where you are pretty much tilted upside down, good stuff.  Check out those kinds of roller coaster tricks as well."

There's a map in the link below. However, it doesn't show Alaska and Hawaii. \n\nYou'll see that most of Florida and many other areas in the southeast will be underwater. If all of the ice caps melted, the oceans would rise 215 feet. Since the mean elevation of the United States is about 2500, most of the United States will still be dry. In fact, 21 states would be completely high and dry, as their lowest elevation is greater than 215 feet.\n\nColorado 3,350 feet, lowest point\nWyoming 3,099\nNew Mexico 2,842\nUtah 2,000\nMontana 1,800\nSouth Dakota 966\nNebraska 840\nNorth Dakota 750\nIdaho 710\nKansas 679\nMinnesota 600\nWisconsin 579\nMichigan 572\nIowa 480\nNevada 479\nOhio 455\nIndiana 320\nOklahoma 289\nIllinois 279\nKentucky 257\nWest Virginia 240\nMissouri 230\n\nSome things to note: ice has been melting for 18,000 years, as we are still coming out of the last ice age. At the peak of the ice age, ice volume was ~80,000,000 km3. It is now ~30,000,000 km3. So, it has taken 18,000 years to melt to melt ~50,000,000 km3 of ice. And, it would take thousands of years more to melt the remaining ~30,000,000 km3 of ice, especially when you consider most of the ice is at the very cold south pole.\n \nBy the way, the melting of this ice over the past 18,000 years has been NATURAL. In fact, at times during the past 18,000 years, the rate of ice melting has been much greater than it is now.

Electrophoresis is the process by which more highly charged molecular structures are moved through an electrical field and leave the lesser charged elements behind.  \n\n  In separation processes using polyacrylamide gel, which is the most common matrix and used to separate relatively larger proteins.  The addition of a mildly alkaline pH leaves most of the proteins anionic and causes them to migrate to ionic nodes (much like the allergenic air filters)   \n\n  In summery alkaline pH substances are used to make proteins anionic so they can be separated using an ionic node.  \n\n  (thanks tho finding out stuff about this one was fun ^_^, and good luck)"

You must mean universe, not galaxy.\n\nWe live on planet Earth,  which is in a solar system. A solar system consists of a star (we call ours the sun),  planets which orbit the star, and maybe other debris and gases. Solar systems are in galaxies. Our galaxy is the Milky Way. It's a barred spiral galaxy and it's a big one. Our galaxy is 100,000 light years across. That means, traveling at the speed of light, it'd take you 100,000 years to get from one side to the other if you went straight across the disk.\n\nOutside of the galaxy is mainly empty space (heck, galaxies have trillions of stars and massive clouds of dust and gases and most of it is still mainly empty space). There may be rogue stars or junk that got flug out of a galaxy here and there but they're generally few.\n\nDoes the universe have a boundary? Probably,  but the nature of it probably isn't anything we'd be familiar with...not like a wall or anything. Can we ever get there? No, we are well within the universe and even if we could travel the speed of light and live forever, it's thought the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate so we'd still never get to the edge, and if by change we mysteriously appeared at the edge and move along with it, there may be some physical process which would prevent us from realizing it.
The flame itself is not affected by gravity.  It will burn as long as there is oxygen present in the right quantities.  The difference is that in gravity, hot air rises.  This allows the air to move upward past the flame and causes the flame to stand 'up'.  In zero gravity, the hot air does not rise as there is no 'up'.  The flame is more of a sphere shape and sputters because the oxygen is being consumed by the flame and the air is not moving.  A normal looking flame can be achieved in space if you artificially move the air by blowing on it or with a fan.
It seems to me that you just have to add or remove the negative sign.
Recycling saves energy, landfill space and the planet.  It is necessary on many levels.  Some examples are:  Aluminum cans made from recycled metal only use 5% of the energy that's needed to make that same can from non-recycled metal.  Every ton of paper you recycle is 17 trees that didn't have to be cut down.  So if you look at the amount of stuff we recycle you can see that it really does make a difference.  Also, most of the materials we are currently collecting go back into making the things we buy.  If we didn't use recycled content, we would have less resources to use in manufacturing.

Most simple molecules are much smaller than the micro level. So I assume you mean macromolecules. \n\n      The main macromolecules in biochemistry are DNA, RNA, protiens, carbohydrates, and lipids. They have their chemical routes with enzymes providing regulation and catalysis.\n\n\n\nMolecules in general are formed in many ways but in general it is through chemical reactions with other molecules. The widely accepted theory is that atoms came to be from nuclear reactions and they came together to form molecules and now we just mixing and matching with the molecules we have for the most part.
The equation for a line in slope-intercept form is:\n\ny=mx+b\n\nwhere m is the slope, and b is the y-intercept.\n\nFirst you need to rewrite the given equation to get the slope, because the slope of a line perpendicular is the negative reciprocal:\n\ny= (-14/9) - (7/9)x\n\nSo the slope of the perpendicular line is the negative reciprocal of -7/9, which is +9/7\n\nSo take that slope and the given point, and plug it into the y=mx+b equztion to get your answer:\n\n5=(9/7)(7) + b\n\nb=5-(9/7)(7)\n\nb=-4\n\nEquation:\n\ny=(9/7)x - 4
To date, no signs of Martian life, either present or past, have been found. But we shouldn't give up, as this is not an ultimate answer, it's only what the past measurements and observation told us. Further inquire and more accurate experiments are in preparation by the various space agencies, using robotic probes.\nFor instance, the European Space Agency is preparing two Martian probes: ExoMars and Mars Sample Return.\nExoMars foresees a rover equipped with many experiments for studying the biological features of the Martian environment.\nMars Sample Return will collect soil samples to be returned to Earth for even more accurate laboratory analysis.\nIn both cases, the idea is that Martian microorganisms or some traces of them (if they exist) may have escaped the previous observations.\nYou can find more details at the following links.

"Great Kills is the name of a neighborhood within New York City's borough of Staten Island. It is located on the island's South Shore, and according to many local geographers, it is the South Shore's northernmost community. Kill is an archaic Dutch word with various popular translations, including ""creek"" and ""channel;"" indeed, many small streams dot the neighborhood, and the name can be interpreted as meaning that a great number of such streams can be found there.\n\nThe eastern half of what is today known as Great Kills was originally named Cairedon, while the western half was referred to as Newtown. Later, both came to be known by the single name of Giffords, after Daniel Gifford, a local commissioner and road surveyor — this name surviving in Giffords Lane, the main north-south thoroughfare in what was formerly called Newtown; the Great Kills station on the Staten Island Railway is at the southern end of this street, in the heart of the community's business district. The present name of Great Kills was informally adopted in 1865. Another former place name associated with the area is Honeywood; its precise origin is uncertain, but it was the name of the telephone exchange that served Great Kills and many other upper South Shore communities from the 1920s through the late 1950s.\n\nAt the southeastern corner of the neighborhood is the Staten Island Unit of the Gateway National Recreation Area, which was formerly known as Great Kills Park, and is often still referred to as such by Staten Islanders today. Immediately to the west of this is a harbor and marina, home of the Great Kills Yacht Club. Many hotels and highly-acclaimed seafood restaurants once dominated the shoreline, but steadily increasing pollution of the nearby waters forced most of them out of business by the middle of the 20th Century; the last surviving shoreline restaurant of note, the Shoals Restaurant, was destroyed in a 1968 arson fire, which also claimed the life of an elderly caretaker who had been living on the premises.\n\nLike many other Staten Island neighborhoods, Great Kills experienced massive population growth in the latter third of the 20th Century, largely catalyzed by the opening of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge providing easy access from Brooklyn in November of 1964. Many of the new arrivals have been Italian-Americans, and today they constitute the neighborhood's largest ethnic group.\n\nA small city park — named Crescent Beach Park, alluding to the crescent-shaped harbor formed by the peninsula at the south end of the Gateway National Recreation Area — stands at the southeastern corner of the neighborhood. On September 1, 2003 this park was the scene of an alleged hate crime when a visiting African-American girl, her mother and some of her friends became involved in an altercation with some local youths, which turned violent. Eleven neighborhood youths were ultimately indicted on assault and related charges — an incident which underscored the often hostile relations between African-Americans and Italian-Americans in New York City (and many other American cities east of the Mississippi River) that have prevailed since the mid-1960s.\n\nHylan Boulevard between Nelson Avenue and Richmond Avenue has become one of the island's busiest commercial strips; approximately one mile long, the northeastern half of this strip is considered part of Great Kills while the southwestern half is deemed to be in the adjacent ""town"" of Eltingville. Likewise, another border between Great Kills and Eltingville is Armstrong Avenue, with Great Kills on the eastern side of this north-south road.\n\nThe ZIP Code for Great Kills is 10308, and actor Rick Schroder lived in the community as a child"
REM sleep is initatiated by the 'pons' of your brain.  It releases a chemical acetylcholine, which then causes the other body reactions to begin.
For cloud to ground lightning, it has to make contact with the ground in order for the current to flow.\n\nTo make a long story short, a path is created from the cloud to the ground by negative charges trying to meet with the positive charges on the ground (or building, human, whatever).  When they can finally meet, a channel is created for the negative charges to flow to the ground.  But, what we see as lightning is the the current flowing from the GROUND to the CLOUD.  So what we're seeing is light traveling upward, rather than down.\n\nBut to answer your question, lightning can't just 'strike' midair, it must have a 'connection' on the ground.  This is only for cloud-to-ground lightning, though.

"I think that the factual evidence in the core samples drilled from around the world say that the earth does have warm and cool cycles.  I also believe that it is possible that whatever is inhabiting the earth during these cycles will invariably affect them in some way, be it natural or non-natural emissions and/or by-products.\nI think that if it is ""bad"" or not is all relative to how you look at it.  Will the weather be worse or more extreme? Possibly.  Is the earth trying to correct any imbalances?  Possibly.  Is this good or bad?  I guess it is how it will affect each individual."
A conductor has constant electric potential(under electrostatic conditions). This means that the electric field inside the conductor is  always zero.( E=-gradV)\nNow, draw a Gaussian surface which lies entirely in the conductor. By Gauss's Law, the net charge inside this surface must be zero (since E is zero and hence flux crossing the surface is zero). This is true for any other Gaussian surface *entirely inside* the conductor. Hence charge must be on the surface of the conductor.\nThis is one of the ways to *understand* the phenomena but I guess it does not give the *reason*!
The summer solstice is the longest day of the year, respectively, in the sense that the length of time elapsed between sunrise and sunset on this day is a maximum for the year. Of course, daylight saving time means that the first Sunday in April has 23 hours and the last Sunday in October has 25 hours, but these human meddlings with the calendar and do not correspond to the actual number of daylight hours. In Chicago, there are 15:02 hours of daylight on the summer solstice of June 21, 1999.

About 70% of the world-wide usage of water is in irrigation. Another 15% is industrial usage, like being used as a coolant in power plants. Another 15% is used by households. It is estimated that by the year 2025 much of the world will be facing a water shortage crisis.\n\nAlso when water evaporates over the oceans, like a hurricane or tropical storm, and then hits land it dumps freshwater on land that started out as saltwater. Also when a person drinks water all day they still excrete a substance that is 90% water, animals too, maybe half the amount or more that he or she drank.\n\nI am being misunderstood. The USA and Europe and Russia, according to the picture at the link, will not run out of water. It's places in the middleast and Africa that will be suffering from a water shortage crisis. The water will still be on the planet, they just won't have any to drink. The water won't be able to get there. Thank you to the person two boxes up that pointed out this answer could be misunderstood.
Not to a pendulum but to control oscillations in a circuit sense, on ecould use a phase lock loop (pll).  Its whole life revolves around using a reference oscillator, locking onto it and outputting a new oscillation of frequency f or some multiplier of f.\nThe major components are as follows\n1) Phase Detector:  It determines if you are locked or not\n2) Charge pump: Produces an up or down control signal depending on the output of the Phase Detector to either speed up or down f\n3)Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO):  Takes the up/down control signal from the Charge Pump and produces a new f that is either faster or slower.  This is the output of your new oscillator.\n4)Feedback loop: Taken from the VCO, it is compared with the reference oscillator you started with and determines if the two are locked.  If they are, you have a locked pll and can know that the output from the VCO is a good clean clock.\n\nThis is a reeeeaaaallll basic overview.  Some pll designer will probably come in and correct me!
"When a fuel assembly has been used in a power plant, the assembly is replaced and the old one stored under water in special ponds, or in dry concrete structures or casks.  Here, shielded from people, it is allowed to cool.\n\nAfter being sufficiently cooled, the assembly, along with others, is put into a cask for temporary storage on the nuclear power plant site.  Delaying the final disposal of high-level waste also allows its radioactivity to decay.  Forty years after removal from the reactor, less than one thousandth of its initial radioactivity remains, and it is much easier to handle.\n\nThe ultimate disposal of vitrified wastes, or of spent fuel assemblies without reprocessing, requires their isolation from the environment for long periods.  The most favored method is burial in dry, stable geological formations up to 600 m or more deep.  Several countries are investigating sites that would be technically and publicly acceptable.\n\nThe U.S. considered a number of options for high-level waste disposal, and decided that mined geologic disposal offered the best option for isolation, although research on transmutation of long-lived radionuclides is continuing.  Transmutation involving neutron bombardment has the theoretical possibility of removing isotopes that are radioactive for a long time, thus alleviating disposal issues.\n\nThe plan is that the fuel will eventually be placed in the geologic deep-level repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.  This is a mountain of ""tuff"" -- stable volcanic rock.  This site was selected after years of investigation into other rock forms including granite, layered-salt, salt domes, and basalt.  All had advantages and all would have provided satisfactory final disposal for high level wastes.  The selection of the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada was an expeditious choice based upon the political realities of the day.\n\nThe repository deep in Yucca Mountain will consist of a large number of tunnels or corridors into which the spent fuel will be placed, in the form of fuel rods.  These rods will be sealed in heavy casks of steel, and placed in the mined caverns, which are then sealed with bentonite (a clay that forms a secure seal).  The pictures below show what the repository could look like.\n\nArtist's conception of repository underground facilities and operations\n\nArtist's conception of repository facilities\nHowever, Regulatory bodies have not yet formally approved Yucca Mountain as a high-level waste repository.  Also, Congress has not adequately funded the work, even though all necessary funds have already been collected in the Nuclear Waste Fund as a surcharge on the use of electricity (at 0.1 cent per kWh - for a total of $16 billion).  So, in the meantime, used fuel assemblies are stored temporarily at the power plants in water pools or large dry casks cooled by natural convection.\n\n\nTransuranic Waste\n\nWastes arising from weapons production in the Cold War have their own repository at the Waste Isolation Pilot Project (WIPP) in New Mexico.  This is a repository constructed in layered salt formations and it is been in operation since late 1999, accepting wastes from Government weapons production sites.  The wastes stored there are presently mainly transuranic wastes.  This waste has no connection with commercial electricity generation from the nuclear option."

The carbon dioxide coming out of solution formed bubbles on the gum in tiny little pits that act as nucleation sites for the bubbles to grow.  When there are enough bubbles on the gum and it becomes very buoyant, it floats.  At the top of the glass, the bubbles pop and the gum then sinks and the cycle can repeat.

Here is the rule: you have to have the same number of equations as you have variables to solve.  For example:\n\nx + y = 1\n\nx - y = 1\n\nHere you have two equations and two unknowns.  The process is to solve one equation for one of the variables, and substituting that into the other:\n\nx = 1 - y\n\n(1-y) -y = 1\n\nNow you solve the new equation for y:\n\n-2y = 0\ny = 0\n\nNow you plug y into any of the equations (preferably the easier one), and you get x.\n\nx + 0 = 1\n\nx = 1\n\nOf course this gets more complicated with each new variable and equation, but the process is the same.  You keep substituting until you get one equation with one variable.
"While, dangerous thunderstorms that drop hail and spin up tornadoes seem to be routinely observed as turning green (""going green"" in the movie Twister), scientists are trying to find out what exactly is going on. \n\nThey have confirmed that some thunderstorms do turn green, and have various theories about why. \n\nOne possibility is that thick, thunderstorm clouds, with their water vapor, rain and hail, scatter sunlight in such a way as to give the clouds a blue hue. \n\nWhen the sun is low in the sky, such as before sunset when most severe storms occur, the reddening light of the sun when shining through Earth's atmosphere makes the bluish cloud tint turn green. \n\nOr, maybe storm clouds act as a kind of canvas upon which low sunlight, scattered by particles in the air, paints a greenish color. \n\nBoth of these could be correct, and they may play in concert with each other to create the observed green tint. \n\nIn the spring of 1995, a University of Oklahoma graduate student used a special device called a spectrophotometer to measure the wavelength of light emitted from thunderstorm clouds during Project VORTEX, a major study of tornadoes. (Related: U. of Okla.: Green thunderstorm presentation).\n\nHis research confirmed green, greenish-yellow, and greenish-blue colors of the clouds, while ruling out lush farmland as the source of the green color. \n\nBut the researcher concluded that the actual green color observed may be different for different people. In other words, what may look strikingly green to one person, might be more greenish-blue or greenish-yellow to someone else. Maybe not even green at all. \n\nAll that's known for sure is that green thunderstorms do exist. It's not known whether all green thunderstorms are severe, nor whether all severe thunderstorms turn green.\n\nThe best advice: don't wait to see green clouds before seeking shelter from severe thunderstorms."

there are three main types of thunderstorm groupings\n\nscattered\nembedded\nline\n\nScattered - means that thunderstorms are several miles apart, and can be easily circumnavigated (if flying)\n\nEmbedded -  can be defined as scattered thunderstorms within a large cloud mass (not all thunderstorms, jus tthe Tstorms kind of hiding in the clouds)..much harder to navigate around when flying\n\nand  Line of thunderstorms is when the thunderstorms align themselves usually along a cold front as the cold front pushes up the warm air its replacing and causes the Tstorms\n\nA Squall line...is caused the same way..just the cold front is moving much faster, and its much more violent weather
People are susceptible because people are afraid. Just like everything else in life, they are afraid of their bodies, their minds, their thoughts. When we grow up and realize that we don't have an infinite amount of time of this planet, people turn to what they have been taught. That there is a better life after death but you have to follow a path to get there. Therefore religion steps in and tries to turn your fear of death to faith instead giving hope. However, no one really knows what happens after we die so its a crap shoot.

zori there isn't really any difference between the two. Some universities have only a biology department, while some will have the disciplines divided up into zoology, botany, micro, etc. And now there are molecular biology departments. What matters is the courses you take, and that will depend on what you are interested in. Being in a zoology department - or in a program where that is the department that will grant your degree shouldn't preclude you from taking courses in botany and micro, etc. In fact they may well insist on it. I have an undergraduate degree from a biology department, a master's from a bio department and a PhD from a zoology department. I studied whatever I wanted, didn't think about what the degree was going to say and nobody else did. When looking for a job, your coursework and experience will do the talking not the department or degree name.\n\nGood luck - good to have another biologist/zoologist joining the team!

This is a great question that gets at the root of what our DNA does. People’s hair and eye color can change over time, they can become less tolerant of milk as they get older, etc. What is going on?\n\nThe quick answer is that for people to get the traits encoded in their genes, the genes need to be turned on. You can think of a gene as a recipe. A recipe in a cookbook does you no good until you open the book, get the ingredients and follow the instructions\n\nThe same is true with our genes. In our analogy, the gene is the recipe and the cookbook is the chromosome (a large collection of recipes). The gene needs to be “read” by the cell in order for it to do what it should. An unread brown or black hair recipe will give you blonde hair.\n\nScientists don’t really understand why specifically the eye and hair color genes sometimes turn on later in life. But they do have a pretty good understanding of what is going on with a much simpler case, lactose intolerance. Let’s use lactose intolerance to show how eye and hair color might darken (or lighten) over time.\n\nAll mammals start out life able to digest milk. Later in life, almost all mammals lose this ability.\n\nMammals are able to drink milk as youngsters because they make an enzyme called lactase. Lactase breaks lactose down into more digestible sugars.\n\nSo why do mammals lose the ability to digest milk as they grow older? Because they lose the ability to make lactase—their lactase gene is turned off.\n\nAlmost all genes are simply recipes for specific proteins. In our case, the enzyme lactase is the result of the recipe found in the lactase gene. This is a little like how chocolate chip cookies are the result of a chocolate chip cookie recipe.\n\nSo how are genes turned on and off? Genes get turned on and off with a certain kind of protein called a transcription factor (TF). At their simplest, TFs can either turn genes on or off.\n\nTFs are called activators when they turn genes on. Activators work like a bookmark that leads us to the recipe we want. Activators turn genes on by leading the cellular gene-reading machinery to the recipe.\n\nTFs are called repressors when they work to shut off a gene. Repressors are something like a paperclip that sticks the pages of the recipe together so that we skip right over them in our cookbook. Repressors turn genes off by making the recipe invisible to the cellular gene-reading machinery.\n\nMost mammals stop making lactase later in life because a repressor lands near the lactase gene. The repressor makes the gene unable to be read by the cell so you get no lactase. Where did the repressor come from? For reasons we don’t understand, the repressor gene is turned on by an activator!\n\n(Many adults can drink milk because they have a mutation in their DNA such that the repressor no longer works. The result? Lactase is still made into adulthood. See http://nutrigenomics.ucdavis.edu/lactoseintolerance.htm for more details.)\n\nAs you can see, turning genes on and off is incredibly complicated. Hair and eye color can darken over time because the respective genes are turned on. This can happen either by an activator being turned on or a repressor being turned off
by welding a metal fabrication up in a sequence, the heat produced is spread around the fabrication.  this means that the heat is not concentrated in one area of the metal, it is this concentration of heat that causes metal fabrications to bend and buckle out of shape.
It depends upon your interest. If you love to study further then it is the best option, because here in Pakistan as far as industry is concerned no innovative work is being done in almost all areas (except Militry and Defence). If you choose to work in industry then you are only going to maintain the apparatus already innovated, there is nothing technical in it. However, if you love to enhance your technicalities and importance then it is better for you to go abroad.

These sound like Springtails, an Order called Collembola.\nNot insects but within a group of terrestrial invertebrates called hexapods. A book with a key to the orders of terrestrial invertebrates would help in placing this groups lineage (phylogeny: how animals fit on the family tree). Springtails hang out in the soil feeding on decaying stuff. \nThey probably come out during the rain because the conditions are ideal to breed or they dehydrate less.....many terrestrial invertebrates dehydrate easily and need moisture to get out and about.\nCheers.

"Saturn's largest moon is Titan.Titan is the fifteenth of Saturn's known satellites and the largest.\n        orbit:1,221,830 km from Saturn\n        diameter: 5150 km\n        mass:     1.35e23 kg\nIn Greek mythology the Titans were a family of giants, the children of Uranus and Gaia, who sought to rule the heavens but were overthrown and supplanted by the family of Zeus. \nDiscovered by Christiaan Huygens in 1655. \nIt was long thought that Titan was the largest satellite in the solar system but recent observations have shown that Titan's atmosphere is so thick that its solid surface is slightly smaller than Ganymede's. Titan is nevertheless larger in diameter than Mercury and larger and more massive than Pluto.\n    Surface view One of the principal objectives of the Voyager 1 mission was the study of Titan. Voyager 1 came within 4000 km of the surface. We learned more in the few minutes of that fly-by than in the previous 300 years. Then in late 2004, the Cassini orbiter began a series of close encounters with Titan, taking data with many instruments. And in January 2005, the Huygens probe actually landed on the surface of Titan and sent back images from the surface. \n    Titan is similar in bulk composition to Ganymede, Callisto, Triton and (probably) Pluto, ie about half water ice and half rocky material. It is probably differentiated into several layers with a 3400 km rocky center surrounded by several layers composed of different crystal forms of ice. its interior may still be hot. Though similar in composition to Rhea and the rest of Saturn's moons, it is denser because it is so large that its gravity slightly compresses its interior. \n    Smoggy Titan Alone of all the satellites in the solar system, Titan has a significant atmosphere. At the surface, its pressure is more than 1.5 bar (50% higher than Earth's). It is composed primarily of molecular nitrogen (as is Earth's) with no more than 6% argon and a few percent methane. Interestingly, there are also trace amounts of at least a dozen other organic compounds (i.e. ethane, hydrogen cyanide, carbon dioxide) and water. The organics are formed as methane, which dominates in Titan's upper atmosphere, is destroyed by sunlight. The result is similar to the smog found over large cities, but much thicker. In many ways, this is similar to the conditions on Earth early in its history when life was first getting started. But it is this thick hazy atmosphere that makes it so hard to see Titan's surface. \n    Titan has no magnetic field and sometimes orbits outside Saturn's magnetosphere. It is therefore directly exposed to the solar wind. This may ionize and carry away some molecules from the top of the atmosphere. It may also drive some of Titan's peculiar chemistry. \n    At the surface, Titan's temperature is about 94 K (-290 F). At this temperature water ice does not sublimate and thus there is little water vapor in the atmosphere. Nevertheless, there appears to be a lot of chemistry going on; the end result seems to be a lot like a very thick smog. \n    There are scattered variable clouds in Titan's atmosphere in addition to the overall deep haze. These clouds are probably composed of methane, ethane or other simple organics. Other more complex chemicals in small quantities must be responsible for the orange color as seen from space. Analysis of the Huygens data will tell us a great deal about the details of the atmospheric chemistry. \n    Erosion features Prior to Cassini's arrival, it seemed likely that the clouds would produce a rain of ethane or methane onto the surface perhaps producing an ""ocean"" up to 1000 meters deep. However, this seems not to be the case at least at the present time. There is little doubt that some active processes are occuring on Titan; there are few if any craters visible indicating that the surface must be very young. But it may be that the ""lakes"" are more slushy"
Nobody named Ishmael has ever invented anything.
Solar day is the time to have the sun in the same meridian. Sidereal day is the time to have a star in the same meridian. While Earth is rotating around its axis it also is orbiting around the sun, so to see the sun in the same direction after a rotation the Earth need a further time because meanwhile it is in another position in its orbit.\nSorry for my English\nIt's difficult to explain it in a better way without a picture

Much of this depends on who the proposal is going to, as each organization has its own requirements for research proposals. Read instructions thoroughly and carefully before doing anything.\n\nTHEN\n\n1) Pick an area of research that is relevant and interesting. Relate your research to a disease or some other problem. No one cares about the receptor for some protein if they can't understand what it does or why it's important.\n\n2) Read reviews and cite others' work. The reviewers who read your proposal are likely those who have already contributed to your field, so be sure to give credit where credit is due. Always be respectful and objective, even when you disagree with published results.\n\n3) Organize simply. Break down your proposal into at most 3-4 sections with short and simple titles. Have headings for each subsection which make it easy to follow the logic and design of your proposal. Restate things in each section, just in case they didn't catch it the first time.\n\n4) Get the right people backing you and get it in on time. As glorious as it may sound, independent research is slow and mostly frustrating. You should propose your research with the support and backing of other established scientists. You'll need their experience and resources to finish any really significant research.
Well, DMSO shouldn't smell anyway, if it does that is impurities in the solution like dimethyl sulfide. Anyway, since DMSO is a fairly simple compound with no forces other than covalent holding it together it should be fine at 60C. The shelf life of DMSO I believe is fairly long--as long as its not from the 60s and as long as you keep it in a dark bottle because it is sensitive to light!
"Assuming these are the only restrictions:\n{\n3/10 possibility (3, 6, or 9) for the 2nd digit,\n5/10 possibility (0,2,4,6,8)  for the 5th digit  \n}\nthere are 3*5=15 combinations of those successful outcomes, which is 15% of the number of all possible combinations (00-99).\n\nSince there are as many possible combinations of the other digits  (1000) for successful outcomes as for the general population (also 1000), those digits are irrelevant to determining the proportion of matches to the general population, so leading zeroes don't matter and neither do a 4 and a 2 in 3rd and 4th digits, as long as the overall population shares the restriction.  It's still 15%.\n\nHowever, the manner in which the number is chosen could be relevant for describing the probability; for example, if the number is chosen one digit at a time such that no digit can repeat itself (like a lotto), its probability of matching the desired outcome would be different.\n\n===\n\nIf the value of each digit can only be used once, the overall population size is only 10!/(10-5)! = 10!/5! = 10*9*8*7*6 = 30240.\nIf there are restrictions like ""no leading zeroes"", then multiply by 9/10, but unless there are other rules, matches are still distributed evenly across the other 3 digits.\n\nAs long as the order digits are selected does not matter\n3/10 for digit2\n5/10 for digit5\n(8*7*6)/10 for the remaining digits1,3,4 (start at 8, since two are already taken in order to guarantee the match)\n\nso (3*5*8*7*6)/(10!/5!)  =~ 16.67%\n\nIf leading zero is not allowed, then distribution is\n[\n(8*3*7*6*1) (where digit5 is 0)\n+(7*3*7*6*4) (where digit5 is {2,4,6,8})\n] / (9*9*8*7*6)\n\n==  (8+28) / 216 = ~16.67% \n\nIf each digit is selected in order and may not be re-used, then it's more complicated."
The only harmful byproduct of a hypothetical commercial nuclear fusion reactor would be a radioactive structure after a lifetime of use which is of little harm to humans. The daughter products are also much less dangerous then the products of nuclear fission and are easier to control. Unlike fission reactors, the fuel isn't stored in one large vessel. The fuel would be brought into the reactor instead of having the fuel part of the reactor. Thus, you would only have about a minute of fuel in the reactor at any given time.\n\nThe real danger with fission power plants is the fact that all that radioactive fuel is sitting there in the reactor, years worth. It's daughter products are also dangerous and unpredictable. The reason fusion plants would be less dangerous are because of the small amount of fuel used, the lack of any dangerous byproducts other then the actual reactor structure, and the relatively less dangerous (and possibly inert) reactor fuels used.\n\nOf course, there are ideal reaction methods that use nearly benign fuel and have almost no dangerous byproducts.
I am not sure what your question is but here is some information on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA): \n \nData Envelopment Analysis (DEA). A nonparametric method in operations research and econometrics for multivariate frontier estimation and ranking.\n\nWith the intention of being consistent with microeconomic production theory and when being conscious of the existence of inefficiencies in the production processes, frontier techniques have been developed during the last 30 years.\n\nAmong the different solutions, we can find a nonparametric method called Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which is a linear programming methodology to measure the efficiency of multiple Decision Maker Units (DMUs) when the production process presents a structure of multiple inputs and outputs.\n\nThen, some of the benefits of it are: (1) there is no need to explicitly specify a mathematical form for the production function, (2) it has proven to be useful in uncovering relationships that remain hidden for other methodologies, (3) is capable of handling multiple inputs and outputs, (4) it can be used with any input-output measurement, (5) the sources of inefficiency can be analysed and quantified for every evaluated unit.

As a geologist I would have to combine both. There is ample evidence of catastrophic events such as meteor strikes that have caused major extinction events in the earth's history, yet I believe that plate tectonics is a cyclical process that has been the basis of most earth processes. I would argue that earthquakes, most floods, and most volcanic eruptions are part of the uniformitarianist view, since they take place on our planet on a daily (even hourly) basis and are driven by the slow process of plate tectonics. Some floods, such as the filling of the Mediterranean or the Black Sea were more likely catastrophic, but did very little to change the earth in the big picture. Some major volcanic events may have changed the earth's climate for a period of decades afterwards, but are still minor over geologic time. Only when large numbers of volcanoes were erupting together over long time periods did they have potential to change the planet, and this fits easily into uniformitarianism.   \n\nThere is growing evidence that climate change may be more catastrophic than previously believed. Past climate change appears to have been quite sudden at times. This may be due to the nature of feedback within climatic systems that causes several factors to react together to accelerate the overall effects. For example, melting icecaps could shut down or alter major ocean currents, which in turn would accelerate atmospheric circulation patterns that cause warming. Some of these past warming events may have happened quite suddenly, yet much of climatic change has been related to plate tectonic motion (Wilson Cycles) and to Milankovitch cycles in the Earth's orbit that are quite regular. Slow movement of tectonic plates does cause changes in oceanic and atmospheric patterns such as ocean currents and even the jet streams so many of the factors of change are quite slow and gradual, making uniformitarianism as valid as catastrophism and pretty much requiring acceptance of both.
Desert Plant Adaptations\nDesert plants have adapted to the extremes of heat and aridity by using both physical and behavioral mechanisms, much like desert animals.\n\nPlants that have adapted by altering their physical structure are called xerophytes. Xerophytes, such as cacti, usually have special means of storing and conserving water. They often have few or no leaves, which reduces transpiration.\n\nPhreatophytes are plants that have adapted to arid environments by growing extremely long roots, allowing them to acquire moisture at or near the water table.\n\nOther desert plants, using behavioral adaptations, have developed a lifestyle in conformance with the seasons of greatest moisture and/or coolest temperatures. These type of plants are usually (and inaccurately) referred to as perennials, plants that live for several years, and annuals, plants that live for only a season.\n\nDesert perennials often survive by remaining dormant during dry periods of the year, then springing to life when water becomes available.\n\nMost annual desert plants germinate only after heavy seasonal rain, then complete their reproductive cycle very quickly. They bloom prodigiously for a few weeks in the spring, accounting for most of the annual wildflower explosions of the deserts. Their heat- and drought-resistant seeds remain dormant in the soil until the next year's annual rains.\n\nXerophytes\nThe physical and behavioral adaptations of desert plants are as numerous and innovative as those of desert animals. Xerophytes, plants that have altered their physical structure to survive extreme heat and lack of water, are the largest group of such plants living in the deserts of the American Southwest.\n\nEach of the four southwestern deserts offers habitats in which most xerophytic plants survive. But each is characterized by specific plants that seem to thrive there. The Great Basin Desert is noted for vast rolling stands of Sagebrush and Saltbush, while in the Mojave Desert, Joshua Trees, Creosote Bush, and Burroweed predominate. The Sonoran Desert is home to an incredible variety of succulents, including the giant Saguaro Cactus, as well as shrubs and trees like mesquite, Paloverde, and Ironwood. The Chihuahuan Desert is noted for mesquite ground cover and shrubby undergrowth, such as Yucca and Prickly Pear Cactus.\n\nCactus, xerophytic adaptations of the rose family, are among the most drought-resistant plants on the planet due to their absence of leaves, shallow root systems, ability to store water in their stems, spines for shade and waxy skin to seal in moisture. Cacti originated in the West Indies and migrated to many parts of the New World, populating the deserts of the Southwest with hundreds of varieties, such as the Beavertail Cactus and Jumping Cholla.\n\nCacti depend on chlorophyll in the outer tissue of their skin and stems to conduct photosynthesis for the manufacture of food. Spines protect the plant from animals, shade it from the sun and also collect moisture. Extensive shallow root systems are usually radial, allowing for the quick acquisition of large quantities of water when it rains. Because they store water in the core of both stems and roots, cacti are well-suited to dry climates and can survive years of drought on the water collected from a single rainfall.\n\nMany other desert trees and shrubs have also adapted by eliminating leaves -- replacing them with thorns, not spines -- or by greatly reducing leaf size to eliminate transpiration (loss of water to the air). Such plants also usually have smooth, green bark on stems and trunks serving to both produce food and seal in moisture.\n\nPhreatophytes\nPhreatophytes, like the mesquite tree, have adapted to desert conditions by developing extremely long root systems to draw water from deep underground near the water table. The mesquite's roots are considered the longest of any desert plant and have been recorded as long as 80 feet. Botanists do not agree on the exact c

This is a valid question, and should be one that is on the list of many government disaster preparation plans. Fortunately, it would be unlikely to take anyone by surprise, as most volcanic eruptions are preceded by periods of earthquake activity. However, a large eruption would require huge evacuations and would disable travel and transport for much of North America for days or weeks, so it is not an insignificant risk. It would also probably shut down all air transport almost worldwide for some period. It might be a small probability, but so are most natural disasters. \n\nThe best analog example for a Yellowstone eruption would be the Long Valley Caldera, which might actually erupt again before Yellowstone ever does. The Long Valley Caldera last had a major eruption about 760,000 years ago. About 140 cubic miles of rock and ash were ejected. Ash covered most of the western United States, as far east as Missouri. \n\nHere is a USGS map of the area affected:\nhttp://lvo.wr.usgs.gov/GeologicMap.html\n\nThe USGS has a page discussing the possible eruption scenarios at:\nhttp://lvo.wr.usgs.gov/eruptions.html\n\nThey estimate the probability of an eruption of some size in any given year to be one in a few hundred, which is about the same probability as a major earthquake on the San Andreas fault. The area has seen signs of activity since 1980, and has experienced tree kills from volcanic gases rising through the soil, and a large dome has been growing outside the town of Mammoth Lakes. \n\nHere is the home page for the Long Valley Observatory:\nhttp://lvo.wr.usgs.gov/index.html\n\nThe Yellowstone Observatory of the USGS has lots more material that you will be interested in. There have been satellite measurements of rising elevations in the area, and here is the map:\nhttp://volcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/2006/uplift.html\n\nThere is a map showing the area affected by the last major eruption of Yellowstone about 2.1 mybp here, as well as many examples of recent volcanic activity in the area:\nhttp://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2005/3024/\n\nThe home page for the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory is here:\nhttp://volcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/index.html\n\nAs far as climate effects go, in North America the jet stream travels eastward, so much of the ash from any volcanic eruption, whether from Long Valley, Yellowstone, or the Cascade Range, will travel eastward. The largest ash falls are likely to range as far east as the Mississippi River, maybe further, and at some times of year may be pushed southward as well, leaving the Midwestern US and the Southern US as the most vulnerable areas outside of the immediate area. A large eruption could leave ash falls of several feet over much of that area. The polar jet stream that crosses North America averages between 50 and 100 mph so the spread of ash would take less than a day for most of the US. \n\nhttp://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/elements/jetstream1.htm\n\nThe Mt Pinatubo eruption in 1991 spread a plume of sulfuric acid across one hemisphere in about 9 days. Here is a map of that plume.\nhttp://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/mandias/lia/possible_causes.html \nThe overall climate effects of such an eruption would likely be global cooling of a few degrees and would affect the northern hemisphere more severely, depending on the size of the eruption. The Pinatubo eruption is said to have had a greater effect on global climate during the two years after its eruption than either El Nino, or anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Here is the data:\nhttp://www.cmar.csiro.au/e-print/open/greenhouse_2000e.htm\n\nI'm sure you can go a lot further with this research. There is lots of material out there on the effects of volcanic eruptions. USGS, the Hawaiian, Alaska, and Cascade Volcano Observatories, as the Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program have a wealth of m

No such beast exists. The book was simply lying.\n\nOliver is a plain old chimpanzee that has been tortured and abused so gullible people will pay money to see him and read books about him.\n\nA female chimpanzee was shot in a rainforest in Africa so her baby could be captured. The baby then had several of his teeth pulled out so his jaw would grow deformed. His head was burned with acid so the hair would not grow properly. The animal was then trained, almost certainly with excessive cruelty, to walk upright.\n\nHe was then displayed to gullible people as a monster. The only monsters were the people who did that to a helpless animal.\n\nGenetic tests have shown that Oliver is just a plain chimpanzee. In fact genetic tests have even confirmed which tribe in Africa he was stolen from.\n\nInterestingly since he started living with kinder owners his hair has largely regrown and he no longer shows a strong inclination to walk upright. \n\nPoor old Oliver is just a badly abused and cruelly mistreated animal. He has the same number of chromosomes as any other chimpanzee.\n\nNone of this is a secret, there are countless websites that will confirm this. This is why I can safely say the people who wrote that book knew all this and simply lied about it.

The properties all vertebrates share are that they are all chordates from the phylum chordata.  At some time in their life they have a notochord, a dorsal nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, an endostyle, and a muscular tail.  \n\nA notachord is a rod shape structure found in the embryos.\n\nPharyngeal slit is used in feeding and found in the pharynx.\n\nAn endostyle is a longitudinal ciliated groove on the ventral wall of the pharynx which produces mucus to gather food particles.\n\nChordata is broken down into three subpylums; Urochordata, Cephalochordata, and of course Vertebrata.\n\nThe Vertebrates are known as the animals with true back bones and spinal cord.  Due to the vertebrates having a skeleton structure they are able to grow to larger sizes than most invertebrates.  Lastly, All have the dorsal hollow nerve cord surrounded with cartilaginous or bony vertebrae with the notochord generally reduced which is not the case with the other two subpylums Urochordata and Cephalochrodata.  \n\nThere are roughly about 50,000 species of vertebrates which fish make up 50% of them with just over 25,000 known species.  The rest are mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians.

Characteristics of Red Sprites\n\nSprites are massive but weak luminous flashes that appear directly above an active thunderstorm system and are coincident with cloud-to-ground or intracloud lightning strokes. Their spatial structures range from small single or multiple vertically elongated spots, to spots with faint extrusions above and below, to bright groupings which extend from the cloud tops to altitudes up to about 95 km. Sprites are predominantly red. The brightest region lies in the altitude range 65-75 km, above which there is often a faint red glow or wispy structure that extends to about 90 km. Below the bright red region, blue tendril-like filamentary structures often extend downward to as low as 40 km. Sprites rarely appear singly, usually occurring in clusters of two, three or more. Some of the very large events, such as shown in Figure 1, seem to be tightly packed clusters of many individual sprites. Other events are more loosely packed and may extend across horizontal distances of 50 km or more and occupy atmospheric volumes in excess of 10,000 cubic km. \n\nHigh speed photometer measurements show that the duration of sprites is only a few ms. Current evidence strongly suggests that sprites preferentially occur in decaying portions of thunderstorms and are correlated with large positive cloud-to-ground lightning strokes. The optical intensity of sprite clusters, estimated by comparison with tabulated stellar intensities, is comparable to a moderately bright auroral arc. The optical energy is roughly 10-50 kJ per event, with a corresponding optical power of 5-25 MW. Assuming that optical energy constitutes 1/1000 of the total for the event, the energy and power are on the order of 10-100 MJ and 5-50 GW, respectively.\n\nIf sprites are only barely detectable by the unaided human eye, in intensified television images obtained from the ground and from aircraft they appear as dazzlingly complex structures that assume a variety of forms\n\nCharacteristics of Blue Jets\n\nBlue jets are a second high altitude optical phenomenon, distinct from sprites, observed above thunderstorms using low light television systems. As their name implies, blue jets are optical ejections from the top of the electrically active core regions of thunderstorms. Following their emergence from the top of the thundercloud, they typically propagate upward in narrow cones of about 15 degrees full width at vertical speeds of roughly 100 km/s (Mach 300), fanning out and disappearing at heights of about 40-50 km. Their intensities are on the order of 800 kR near the base, decreasing to about 10 kR near the upper terminus. These correspond to an estimated optical energy of about 4 kJ, a total energy of about 30 MJ, and an energy density on the order of a few mJ/m^3. Blue jets are not aligned with the local magnetic field.
I cannot speak on the air of formality as far as if the dust from the shell is toxic to the point that it can kill you, however I do have some personal experience with the dust.  In the pursuit of making some earrings, I inhaled a very small amount of dust into my lungs.  I could immedietly taste the calcium (similar taste and smell to your teeth getting drilled) and became nausious.  After about fifteen minutes I was having a hard time breathing altogether and ended up going to the hospital.  The doctors said that the dust has very small amounts of toxin in it, as does the meat of the abalone and both are extremely dangerous in large amounts.\n\nso my advice to you, and this is what i do now, is to wear a simple gas mask.

"nanotechnology\n\nThe science of developing materials at the atomic and molecular level in order to imbue them with special electrical and chemical properties.

In an excerpted article from the March 2003 Nanotech Report, he compared nanotechnology with the microelectronics industry. Bock said that ""a single chemistry graduate student can create novel devices and device architectures not even imaginable or manufacturable by today's biggest microprocessor companies. That is because these devices are fabricated chemically, or from the bottom up. Existing microelectronics technology is fabricated by etching wafers, or from the top down.""

"So many questions...\nThe human brain has its limits. It's restricted by the brain's cooling system. The more we think the more we use energy, which creates heat, which has to be dissipated.\nAlso the neurons have to be fed. Cheetos has the most brain food per pound. That's why ""Geeks"" favor them so much.\nTo answer the other questions: The human brain is very slow in linear speed, but quick due to the trillions of parrallel connections of dendrites. Some of this technology will be applied to computers, but the computers will be able to work much faster. At some point the computers will out-think our human brains.\nYour idea of connecting the computers to our brains using blue tooth is a good one. It will enable us to increase our thinking by an unlimited amount. Thus the smart will become smarter and the dumb will become dumber. This will create an even bigger gap in our society.

The reason for strict program formatting is consistency. Once you have a format that works, use it. If you use the same format (or structure) for all programs you write, you will be able to repeat past successes. If all programmers in your company use the same format for a given CNC machine, each programmer will be easily able to work on another's program.
A Bachelor's degree is what is awarded after four years of study at a university.  A graduate degree refers to completion of two more years of graduate school and is also called a Master's degree.
That's a pretty self-centered view of the universe-- if I can't see it, it doesn't exist...\n\nThe way I understand it, a point is just an abstraction, but it is a useful idea, so I don't see it as pointless.  While you'll never be able to exactly measure the location of a point, you can get to the right area, within experimental precision, so even though you can't see the point, you can know about where it is, so it's useful.\n\nAs for the mass question-- the universe is not limited by the resolution of your measuring devices.  Just because we can't measure a mass, doesn't mean it doesn't exist-- only that we can't measure it.  But. we may be able to someday, whether directly, or by some other, trickier method.
You can do it, but with some modifications:\n\n1. You need to replace tyres... the ones with air wont work there.\n2. You need to refit body parts of super light weight materials... the weight is crucial in space program, the heavier, the more fuel it will require to lift it off the ground\n3. You will have to dissassemble the entire machine including the engine to fit it into the space shuttle. Then you need an engineer to assemble it back\n4. You will need to modify the design to withstand the air preasure in mars. It is not like earth.\n5. You will need special fuel to run it on mars... the ones they sent ran on batteries. So another huge load of batteries required.\n\nWell from the looks of it... you already have a shuttle that can travel in space and withstand high preasure... you already have the fuel in the shuttle to make it run. You already have tyres that withstand high and low preasures.... you already have the heat shields in place... you already have people who know how to fly it.... you already have the material that will require to be remolded and refitted... well... all you need to do is modify the shuttle to look like a bigfoot monster truck.
The moon will not escape Earth orbit. It is currently moving away from us at only 38 mm/year, due to energy transferred by tidal forces. The energy transfer is also causing Earth's day to become longer (currently it is increasing by 15 microseconds each year).\n\nTheoretically, the moon's orbit would increase until the Earth's day slows to match the Moon's orbital period. After this point, solar tides will dominate and the Moon will start moving closer to Earth.\n\nBefore this happens, the Sun will become a red giant (5 billion years from now).
From what I remember in geometry class, the 4th dimension was simply time.  And just like the other three, length, width, and height, it can be measured in various forms - seconds, minutes, hours, etc..

The rotational speed of the Earth at the equator is about 1,038 miles per hour.\n\nIt actuallt depends on where on Earth you are standing. At the poles, the Earth hardly spins at all, but as you travel towards the equator, the rotational speed picks up. This makes sense -- as the circumference of a circle increases, a single point along it has to travel faster to complete a revolution in the same amount of time. \nThe rotational speed of the Earth at the equator is about 1,038 miles per hour. The atmosphere at the equator is also slightly thicker due to rotation, and you weigh slightly less. At mid-latitudes, the speed of the Earth's rotation decreases to 700 to 900 miles per hour. \n\nIf the Earth were to stop spinning suddenly, the atmosphere would still be zipping along nicely at around 1,000 miles an hour. As a result, everything not attached to bedrock would pretty much be scoured clean. \n\nIf you have any more questions about the Earth's rotation, check out this nifty Ask a Space Scientist page. Looking for a cosmic perspective on how fast the earth is moving? Remember that all questions about motion or speed are only complete with an appropriate frame of reference.
The formula will be determined by several factors.\n\nFirstly you need to quantify the paralax of your electrodes when taken as a constant, then select your test apmere rate. This must be kept constant to give your results continuity.\n\nThe geometric factor can be determined either as a spacial value or a multi-dimensional cascade equation using the derivative of the base line through force as emitted by the polarised ion array under the radial effect of the ipnosis effect which can be detected using the omnidirectional fortence analyser (if available)\n\nWhen these values are determined you must apply the correct formula which, as I have a standard keyboard which doesn't allow formulaic typing, I'm not going to tell you.
The law of universal gravitation tells us that, though gravitational force decreases exponentally with distance from a given mass, it neven completely ends. Therefore, never.

Betelgeuse (in Orion) is a red giant that is so large that its diameter is the size of the orbit of Jupiter i.e. about 10 AU acrooss (930,000,000 miles) and this is 650 Solar Diameters across.\n\nBut this is just a weedy titch compared to the biggest 3 which are\n\nVV Cephei 1900 Solar Diameters\nV354 Cephei 1520 Solar Diameters\nKW Sagitarii 1460 Solar Diameters\n\nThe brightest 3 by Absolute Magnitude (how bright they would look at a distance of 10 parsecs) are\n\n(Star, Magnitude, Luminosity compared to the Sun =1)\nLBV 1806-20 −14.2 40,000,000 \nThe Pistol Star   −13.2 16,000,000 \nCyg OB2-12   −12.2 6,300,000 \n\nThe heaviest stars: the top 3 are: \n\nEta Carinae 150 Solar Masses \nPistol Star 150 Solar Masses \nLBV 1806-20 130 Solar Masses \n\nStellar mass is the most important attribute of a star.

The orbital period is about 27 years, with an eclipse duration of about 18 months. The visible companion is a yellowish (F-class) supergiant. The type of the other star is not known. ζ Aurigae has a period of 970 days, the primary is a (K-class) supergiant and the secondary is a (B-class) main sequence star. Both these systems present a rare stage of binary evolution, as the components are in a short and active evolutionary stage.

lets talk animal & plant ecology\n\nfirst, let's say, all different types of animals & plants live in the same area (maybe  near a river)  in a sense, each animal can depend on each other. For example, the main staple for bears is salmon. let's say man pollutes a river and the fish die. The bear no longer having fish to eat, eat more plants instead. This results in a dramatic decrease of let's say berry plants in one particular area. If you were to move 10 miles upstream, you would be in a separate ecology where the salmons did not die, the bears had a blanced diet and the berry plants were abundant.\n\nBigger ecologies (let's a lake) can literally fall apart and result in the extinction of a particular plant that only grows at that lake.\n\nI hope this was helpful
For secx:\n?Multiply and divide by (secx+tanx). Therefore now we have to integrate ratio of (sec^2 of x + secx * tanx) to (secx+tanx). Now put (secx+tanx= t) ,dt=  (sec^2 of x + secx * tanx). \nnow we have to integrate (1/t) which is log t  and substitute value of 't'.\n\nFor cosec x\nMultiply and divide by (cosecx-cotx). Therefore now we have to integrate ratio of (cosec ^2 of  x - cosecx * cotx) to \n(cosecx-cotx). Now put (cosecx-cotx= t) ,\ndt=  (cosec^2 of x - cosecx * cotx). \nnow we have to integrate (1/t) which is log t  and substitute value of 't'.\n\nI have given detailed explanation. plz choose my answer as best .

5.25g of silver, in terms of volume is  (5.25g)/(105g/cm3) = 0.05 cm3 volume of silver is present.  Since its a solid and does not mix with the water, the volume should be additive, so the volume should increase by 0.05mL
Traditionally, salt is removed  from sugar containing solutions by passing the syrup through  columns packed with ion-exchange resin beads. The beads bind the Na and Cl ions and the effluent passing through will be the sugar water solution. If you wasn to recover the Na or the Cl ions then the beeds are rinsed with either a strong acid or base and quantitave recoveries can be made.

We can synthesize water but to get the component hydrogen and oxygen from the easiest sources means breaking down water to get it. If you're wondering about getting water from another source, that we can do, but it's extremely expensive in terms of power--- desalination plants to remove salt from sea water to make potable water is costly but is done in places like Saudi Arabia.

"You mean 3^2 = 5^2 - 4^2 ... dimensionally this works.  For examples, if the units are feet, then you can take a bunch of one foot by one foot ceramic floor tiles, and arrange them in a 5 by 5 square, then take away a 4 by 4 square chunk of that, and rearrange what remains into a 3 by 3 square of tiles.  Translated into inches, you get (3*12)^2 = (5*12)^2 - (4*12)^2: if you have a whole lot of one inch by one inch tiles, and you make a big 60 by 60 square out of then and remove a 48 by 48 subsquare, then you can rearraqnge the remaining little tiles into a 36 by 36 square.\n\nNow consider 3^5 = 243 = (122 + 121)*(122 - 121) = 122^ - 121^2, again in feet.  When you translate that into inches, it doesn't scale the same way: the left hand side is multiplied by 12^5 but the right hand side is only multiplied by 12^2.  What kind of geometrical figure do you want to use given that it does not scale?  ""Take a bunch of little one by one by one by one by one foot hypercubes, and arrange them in five space ... then when you project along the ... the result looks like ..."" ??? ""... but subdivide each hypercube into 12^5 little one inch by ... hypercubes and what you just did no longer works"".  Is that really what you are looking for?"
I hope so since I have a Bachleor's in Biotechnology. Right now the job market is very good, but like Stephanie said science jobs pay very little, I know that better than anybody. :( \n\nIn regards to if it will last that depends on what field of biotechnology you are refering to. From the way you worded your question I am assuming you are talking about the more controversial areas and I'd have to say since this country is so conservative that will probably continue to stand in the way of our advancement in the scientific field. This is unfortunate because we will probably find the U.S. falling behind the rest of the world in this aspect.

Cold, concentrated sulfuric acid is used with neutral, water-insoluble compoinds containing no elements other than carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.  If the compound is unsaturated, is readily sulfonated, or possesses a functional group containing oxygen, it will dissolve in cold concentrated sulfuric acid.  This is frequently accompanied by a reaction such as sulfonation, polymerization, dehydration, or addition of the sulfuric acid to olefinic or acetylenic linkages.  In many cases, however, the solute may be covered by dilution with ice water.

The earth is bombarded with ~ 1000 metric tons of meteroite PER DAY, so this is not an 'exceptional event' on a global basis.  Remember that 70% of the earth is uninhabited and not under surveillance.\n\nAs to comparing it with 'Hiroshima', this is a typical media exaggeration.  My calculations show that with a 100 kg meterorite traveling at 11000 m/s (the maximum speed it could attain coming from outer space), the energy would be about 1/14000th of the nuclear energy released from the conversion of 0.1 gram of uranium into energy by the Einstein relationship E = mc^2
"(m)\n\nBioinformatics and computational biology involve the use of techniques from applied mathematics, informatics, statistics, and computer science to solve biological problems. Research in computational biology often overlaps with systems biology. Major research efforts in the field include sequence alignment, gene finding, genome assembly, protein structure alignment, protein structure prediction, prediction of gene expression and protein-protein interactions, and the modeling of evolution.\n\nThe terms bioinformatics and computational biology are often used interchangeably, although the former typically focuses on algorithm development and specific computational methods, while the latter focuses more on hypothesis testing and discovery in the biological domain. Although this distinction is used by National Institutes of Health in their working definitions of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, it is clear that there is a tight coupling of developments and knowledge between the more hypothesis-driven research in computational biology and technique-driven research in bioinformatics. Computational biology also includes lesser known but equally important subdisciplines such as computational biochemistry and computational biophysics.\n\nA common thread in projects in bioinformatics and computational biology is the use of mathematical tools to extract useful information from noisy data produced by high-throughput biological techniques such as genomics (The field of data mining overlaps with computational biology in this regard). A representative problem in bioinformatics is the assembly of high-quality DNA sequences from fragmentary ""shotgun"" DNA sequencing, while in computational biology, a representative problem might be statistical testing of a hypothesis of common gene regulation using data from mRNA microarrays or mass spectrometry."
lets look at this..\nouter hull design is impractical, and non functional?\n\nhumm gotta differ with you on this, the ORIGINAL enterprise NCC-1701 is very practical, The crew is housed in the saucer section (which gives max area inside while maintaining minimum outer surface area and material, very practical) The saucer section is away from the secondary hull which contains most of the equipment, power, recyling, and the warp engines. This means it can separate from it in emergencies and people are away from any dangerous padiation leaks, if they occur.(I would call that functional)\n\nflimsy? well being in space there is no need for aerodynamics, a brick wall would fly just as well as an arrow. So I don't see your point there.\n\nfull of design weaknesses? ok, how about you name some?\nHow about some of the reasons it was designed that way. The saucer is made so that the entire bridge can be swapped out for a new bridge, depending on the mission. As can the weapons systems on the lower side of the saucer. This means it is easily upgraded (a good desing feature) The engines on the naucells are made to be upgraded and exchanged without having to disassemble the ship, we saw this happen severl times throughout the series( would you not call this practical and functional) If some of the ship were too far damaged, the other parts are made to be easily placed on newer parts.\n\nall of this sounds nothing like a design flaw to me.\n\nAs for the romulan and klingon designs, well we saw them blow up alot, so I would have to say they had some major weaknesses.\n\nAbby, where did you get that the klingon ships have only one engine? they have two! one on each side, like the bird of prey. Are you referring to the rear photon torpedo tube below the impulse engines

"I can tell you this much, anyone who gets gonorrhea more than once certainly must have a hearing problem (and possibly a mental problem) also because they should have listened when the person at the Health Department told them to use CONDOMS!\n\nHere's a good field trip for you, go down to your local family planning clinic or Health Dept. where they treat people who suspect they may have an STD (sexually transmitted disease). Interview some of the staff (if they have time to talk to you).  Find out as a ""person on the spot"" how the exam and the process goes, and you can probably also pick up some good pahphletts or sheets of information about the various sexually transmitted diseases and the tests and treatments!  The local Health Department can direct you to the proper place, because they are in the STD business!\n\nSo not funny!  This little field trip may help save your life, and give you a new perspective on why it is so important to be careful with all things sexual (even oral contact).  When they test most people for Gonorrhea, they also do throat swabs too, because they often find that a person who is infected in their genitals, may also be infected in their throats (sometimes only infected in their throats because they consider oral contact to be ""harmless"")!\n\nDysfunctions of the ear, I guess you could have infections, wax build up, difficulties with hearing certain sounds, ringing or what is called ""Tinnitus"" of the ear or progressive hearing loss associated with age, or noise exposure. Honestly the ear and STDs are very far apart from where I sit.  Unless the ear could be affected from a Gonorreal infection of the throat, or something?   \n\nI think next time you should give us more than one day of notice on your exam subjects. I have been known to tutor when I was in HS and University, but I need a bit of notice, since neither of these is my particular area of expertise. \n\nIn these days and times I think everyone should be well informed on the subject of STDs! The more you know, and the smarter you are with your own sexual practices, the better your chances are for living a long healthy and happy life! \n\nGood luck with the test!"

In ethics, deontological ethics or deontology (Greek: Deon meaning obligation or duty) is a theory holding that decisions should be made solely or primarily by considering one's duties and the rights of others. Deontology posits the existence of a priori moral obligations, further suggesting that people ought to live by a set of defined principles that do not change merely as a result of a change in circumstances (ie. situational ethics).\n\nOne of the most important implications of deontology is that praiseworthy goals can never justify immoral actions, in contrast to doctrines that claim the ends justify the means. Deontology is directly in opposition to consequentialism, an ethical theory in which the ends can justify the means because decisions are judged primarily in terms of their consequences.

4 years ago I worked on carbon sequestration projects in Australia and internationally. This included researching biological, geological and ocean sequestration of CO2. \n\nThere are pros and cons of all these processes, but I see many more pros.  You only have to look at Statoil's Sleipner Project in Norway - They have been sequestering CO2 into high saline aquifers since 1996.\n\nThey have, in fact stopped 1 million tonnes of CO2 from entering the atmosphere per year, the equivalent emissions of a 150MW  coal fired power plant in the US.\n\nI think it is a great solution until we can move towards a hydrogen economy.

"Frogs and toads display some of the most amazingly varied breeding behaviors and mechanisms :-)\nThe Surinam toad (Pipa pipa) is an aquatic species in which the eggs, after being fertilized during a complex courtship,  are placed with the aid of the male on the back of the female, embedded in the skin. The eggs do not undergo indirect developmet as in most frogs (they don't hatch as tadpoles), instead, after 3/5 months they emerge as young juvenile frogs. \nMore Information from Animal Diversity Web:\nhttp://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Pipa_pipa.html\n\nIn addition, there are some frogs in South America known as ""marsupial frogs"". These are tree frogs in which the female has a dorsal pouch of skin on her back, and the eggs develop inside this pouch. After hatching, they come out of the pouch opening that opens posterodorsally. \nThis is what the female with the eggs looks like:\nhttp://nature.berkeley.edu/~screws/trinidad%20dir/images/IMG_1411.jpg\n\nAnd there's another amazing frog here in Argentina: the tiny green Darwin frog that lives in the southwestern forests. In this species, the male takes the eggs after they've been fertilized and puts them in his vocal sacs (the pouches at his throat that he uses to produce sounds). They stay in the vocal sacs until they're more developed and can come out and go on growing by themselves.\nhttp://www.globalamphibians.org/images/rhinoderma_copyrighted.jpg\nI know this has nothing to do with the question, but I think these are so interesting! :-)"

A very interesting question, really.\n\nFirstly, we need to look at what causes the blood clot.  The answer lies in the platelet.  An irregularly shaped, colorless body that is present in the blood.  It survives for 7-10 days before being broken down in the liver/spleen by phagocytes.  \n\nIndeed, blood clots when it is exposed to air.  The body has amazingly found a loophole in blood being exposed to air (for the 2 conditions)  This loophole lies in the loss of blood.  If the body detects a loss of blood and the presence of air at the same time, the platelets immediately kick into action.  The tiny platelets immediately rush to the wound, form a layer (scab) by bursting and spilling its contents.  Its contents, along with calcium, the vitamin K and a protein, fibrinogen, forms a clot.  \n\nAll these components forms a clot by first forming fibrin.  These fibrin are actually tiny threads which later form a wire-like mesh.  This mesh help to hold the red blood cells inside the body.  This explains why our scab is red initially but turn brown; such is the color of our blood.

"A beam splitter is an optical device that splits a beam of light in two. It is the crucial part of most interferometers.\n\nIn its most common form, it is a cube, made from two triangular glass prisms which are glued together at their base using Canada balsam. The thickness of the resin layer is adjusted such that (for a certain wavelength) half of the light incident through one ""port"" (i.e. face of the cube) is reflected and the other half is transmitted. Polarizing beam splitters, such as the Wollaston prism, use birefringent materials, splitting light into beams of differing polarization.\n\nAnother design is the use of a half-silvered mirror. This is a plate of glass with a thin coating of aluminum (usually deposited from aluminum vapour) with the thickness of the aluminum coating such that, of light incident at a 45 degree angle, one half is transmitted and one half is reflected. Instead of a metallic coating, a dielectric optical coating may be used. Similarly, a very thin pellicle film may also be used as a beam splitter.\n\nA third version of the beam splitter is a dichroic mirrored prism assembly which uses dichroic optical coatings to split the incoming light into three beams, one each of red, green and blue. Such a device was used in multi-tube colour television cameras and also in the 3 film Technicolor movie cameras.\n\nIn Physics, the beam splitter is famous for its use in the Michelson-Morley experiment in 1887."
If you look at it as similar to english on a billiard ball, then backspin should result in more ground balls, while a forespin should tend towards more fly balls.\n\nBut in slow pitch, it's hard to get enough spin to get much movement on the ball.

To see an excellent explanation and illustrations of how greenhouse gases absorb infrared energy go to:\nhttp://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html\n\nThe principle operates the same here on Earth as it does on Venus, it is just that Venus has some other effects that have exacerbated the atmospheric content of CO2, along with its much higher atmospheric pressures. Most of the Russian Venera probes to Venus lasted about an hour on the surface, at a temperature of about 850 F. and pressures equal to about 3000 ft below the sea (90 times earth's atmosphere)."
According to the conservation of energy, your answer is negative. The effort that biker put in each case is consumed to resist both the friction and the work needed against gravity. On flat path, no vertical work is made so his energy (name it E) is totally consumed for resisting friction (f) against movement of him (M) and his bike (m) along the path (L):\nE=(M+m)*g*f*L\nNow suppose a terrain path (LL) which is surely longer than the straight one (L) which have a max vertical difference of H. The work he must do to move to the top is (M+m)*g*H plus the work needed against alongside friction. The energy will change back to kinetic form during descend session, and therefore cancels the initial effort put. The only work that is to be done is resisting against friction over the longer path, which is certainly more than the straight (shortest) path.
It does happen.\n\nBut remember that most thunderstorms come from pockets of warm air meeting pockets of cold air.  So it's probably a little harder to attain a thunderstorm when it's cold enough to snow.\n\nI'll go check my facts and edit this msg if I'm wrong.\n\n---\nEdit: Wikipedia has a whole article on this:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundersnow\n\nThundersnow.

Wishful thinking.
The way science progresses is by postulating possible options, it doesn't mean that any one of them is the answer, only that it is a possible answer. From all the possible answers peer review will pick the most likely explanation and accept it temporarily in a 'conditional' mode until it can be demonstrated that in fact this is the correct answer. Otherwise it gets thrown out. \n\nEverything is accepted as a possible answer, not as the answer.
"Very good question.....\n\nThe universe ""mocks"" itself. \n\nThe sun does act somewhat like a nucleus, the planets like electrons.....you can transfer this idea to the galaxies also. If we live in an atom.......\nI actually am quite confident that we do.\nIt's the only kind of theory that makes any sense.\n\nIt's explains the big bang theory-( an eternal atomic level matter antimatter reaction that plays it little game until a new bang start's a new universe and so on)\n\nIt also would help to understand the idea of infinite dimensions much better. ( If we live in an atom, then we are part of a system that is part of a bigger system that is part of a universe that is an atom.....etc.\n\nYou are really on to something here. \nRemember that all and I mean every truly great scientist that ever was got the ""laugh"". Keep thinking about it.\n\nAnd as for the physics(engineer) geeks..........with your android minds........For the 30 years you have done nothing to advance the science.......Instead of trying to build a better ""bolt"", try and invent something that disposes of the need of a ""bolt"" in the first place.....Nuff said!"
"997 is correct.  Start at 999 and go backwards.  \n999 is divisible by 3\n998 is divisible by 2\n997 is prime, because it's not divisible by 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31, or 37.  We only have to check up to 37 because 37 * 37 = 1369, which is bigger than a 3 digit number.  If a prime number bigger than 37 would divide into 997, then the quotient would be less than 37, and that quotient would divide 997, but we checked and no numbers less than 37 divide 997, do 997 is prime.\n\nThat is known as the ""sieve of eratosthenes""."

If you have a small compus, as used by the early age sailors, you will see the north is indicated at northen pole, even if you make it rorate, it will come back to its position again and show the north direction. Once you reach the exact north pole, then the compus will not work, it will keep rotating as the magnetic lines will pass through and thus you will know that you are at exact north pole.... and same is true for south pole as well ... hope I have answered your question... :)
Transition metals have high melting points because they are metals! All metals have high melting points! But some transition metals have exceptionally high melting points like Vanadium and Nickiel because they form a partially half filled 3-d subshell (for Vanadium) and a fully filled 3-d orbital (for Nickiel), which adds to an extra stability to the element. Hence, it is more difficult to remove the electron and thus result in the high melting point. \n\n\nSince transition metals are all in the 4th period, its Ar would be large too. Since Ar is large, naturally density would be high. \n\nBecause mass=no. of molecules x Ar \n\nAnd density is defined as mass / volume. \n\n\nThe specialty of transition mentals is that the energy levels of the orbitals are close enough to overlap each other. When electrons of a transition metal gains energy and is excited, it is promoted to the 4s orbital. \n\n\nHowever, it is unstable at that level and soon drops back to the 3d-orbital. In order to return to the 3d-orbital, it must remove some of its energy, and the energy is light. That is why there are different colours in transition metals. Because it only releases a specific amount of energy, which relects different colours of light. This process is also known as d-d transition.
hm. al-sharafia is a district of the port city Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. Jeddah is one of the top 3 cities in saudi arabia. Sharafia is in the news a lot because of a prison/detainee camp for mostly non-muslims. Jeddah population is 3.5 million, with around one million in al-sharafia.\n\nOK?
Faraday's constant (F) is the charge carried by one mole of electrons.
"Serum (Latin for ""whey"") may refer to:\n\n    * Blood plasma with its clotting factors removed.\n    * Any clear bodily fluid, see serous fluid.\n    * Any medication derived from an animal's blood or serous fluid, often involving antibodies, such as an antidote, antivenom, or antiviral drug. Commonly used as a plot device in fiction to cure someone at the last moment.\n\n\nSerum is the same as blood plasma except that clotting factors (such as fibrin) have been removed. Blood plasma contains fibrinogen.\n\nPlasma resembles whey in appearance (transparent with a faint straw colour). It is mainly composed of water, blood proteins, and inorganic electrolytes. It serves as transport medium for glucose, lipids, hormones, metabolic end products, carbon dioxide and oxygen. (Oxygen transport capacity of plasma is much lower than that of the hemoglobin in the red blood cells; it may increase under hyperbaric conditions.) Plasma is the storage and transport of clotting factors and its protein content is necessary to maintain the oncotic pressure of the blood."
Under normal conditions, a water molecule in liquid water will form 4 hydrogen bonds with other water molecules.  Two of these bonds involve the two hydrogens in the water molecule, and the other two bonds involve the two lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom.

It is an illusion. People tend to perceive objects on the horizon as larger than they really are, but you can destroy the illusion by looking at the horizon upside down. Really! I have tried it. And it is not only the Moon, but trees and buildings too. As you tilt your head more and more things on the horizon start to look smaller. I notice that sideways is enough tilt for me to see things on the horizon as noticeable smaller than when looking upright. The usual suggestion is to bend over and look at the horizon between your legs, but that is just to embarrassing for me so I tilt my head sideways until I am looking upside down to one side of my legs and notice the size changing when I am about half Way to being upside down. Try it, it is easy!
>>> We also know that they never reach the nucleus except in\n>>> extreme occasion like a dying star. \n\n\nWell that's a major flaw right there. Electrons quite often anhihilate themselves via collision with the nucleus. This is the cause of radioactive decay via electron capture. There are literally millions of electrons falling into their atomic nuclei within 3 feet of where you are every second of every day.
In practice, a lot will depend on the available volumetric glassware and microvolume measuring and dispensing devices (pipettes).  \n\nLet C1 = initial concentration (50 micromolar) \nLet V1 = the volume you want to dilute WITH (could be all of your 50 micromolar solution or only a part of it) \nLet C2 = the final concentration (100 nM or 0.1 micromolar) \nLet V2 = the volume you want to dilute TO (the final volume you want to end up with) \n\nThe equation is C1 x V1 = C2 x V2 (we must conserve mass)\n\nYou'll have to choose either V1 or V2, then solve for the other one.

Bromocriptine is a semi-synthetic derivative of the ergo group of ergot alkaloids is a dopamine receptor agonist and a prolactin inhibitor.  It is a potent D2 agonist but also displays partial action on D1 receptors) and a prolactin inhibitor.   \n\nIts first major anti-aging use is the enhancement of dopamine, (a key brain neurotransmitter that undergoes an age-related decline). Accordingly, some neurologists have stated that “if we all live long enough we shall all become senile.”  This is due to the fact that abnormally low levels of dopamine (70% to 80% loss) are then diagnosed as Parkinson’s disease, hence protection and enhancement of the dopamine producing neurons is a key strategy for anti-aging medicine.  Not surprisingly, bromocriptine is used in conjunction with drugs such as deprenyl and L-dopa in the management of Parkinson’s disease and senile disorder.  But bromocriptine can be used for anti-aging purposes and memory enhancer also.
"Well  as Wikipedia mentions: ""The term halogen was coined to mean elements which produce salt in union with a metal""\n\nIn Greek ""alas"" is salt\nand ""genno"" means to give birth to\n\nAs roots with latin characters they are spelled a bit differerently, so you have the ""halo-"" part for salt and -""gen"" for giving birth to. \n\nSo halogens were named after their property to react with metals, producing salt, like oxygen was named after its property to produce acid  (oxos=acid) and hydrogen  (hydor=water) to produce water.\n\nThe first halogen to be discovered was chlorine, by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1774. However Scheele believed it was a compound containing oxygen and in 1810 Sir Humphry Davy proved that chlorine was actually an element. \nI don't know though, when and who exactly came up with the term ""halogen""."

I don't know what the dream means.. maybe it has something to do with your signs. Your sign represents one of the planets and you will collide and marry somebody who has the other sign...\n\nAnyways.. but in reality, Neptune's moon is actually not only rotating around Neptune, but it's actually spiraralling towards it. It is inevitable that one day the moon and neptune will collide.
Definition for NH3-N\nAmmonia Nitrogen - an inorganic, dissolved form of nitrogen that can be found in water, but in the presence of oxygen will convert to nitrate.\n\nAmmonia (NH3-N) \nan inorganic form of nitrogen, is contained in fertilizers, septic system effluent, and animal wastes. It is also a product of bacterial decomposition of organic matter. Ammonia NH3-N (NH3-N) becomes a concern if high levels of the un-ionized form are present. In this form NH3-N can be toxic to aquatic organisms. The presence of un-ionized ammonia is a function of the NH3-N concentration, pH, and temperature. Conversion of NH3-N to nitrite nitrogen by nitrification requires large quantities of oxygen which can kill aquatic organisms due to the lowered dissolved oxygen concentrations in water. NH3-N concentrations are reported in mg/L NH3-N.

The orbit of the moon is distorted by the earth and vice versa.  The orbits are also distorted slightly by the other planets. However, the distance between the earth and the moon is about 1/400 of the distance from the earth to the sun. Because of that, the moons orbit is always curved towards the sun even though it isn't a perfect ellipse.
