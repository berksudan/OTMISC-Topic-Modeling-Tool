"No.  there is no penetration and you neither see nor touch the person you're ""cybering"" with.  It takes place in your mind, whereas actual sex involves the meeting of (at least) two minds and bodies."
Kurds (kûrds, kʊrds) , a non-Arab Middle Eastern minority population that inhabits the region known as Kurdistan, an extensive plateau and mountain area in SW Asia (c.74,000 sq mi/191,660 sq km), including parts of E Turkey, NE Iraq, and NW Iran and smaller sections of NE Syria and Armenia. The region lies astride the Zagros Mts. (Iran) and the eastern extension of the Taurus Mts. (Turkey) and extends in the south across the Mesopotamian plain and includes the upper reaches of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.\nAs of the late 1990s, there were estimated to be more than 20 million Kurds, about half of them in Turkey, where, making up more than 20% of the population, they dwell near the Iranian frontier around Lake Van, as well as in the vicinity of Diyarbakir and Erzurum. The Kurds in Iran, who constitute some 10% of its people, live principally in Azerbaijan and Khorasan, with some in Fars. The Iraqi Kurds, about 23% of its population, live mostly in the vicinity of Dahuk (Dohuk), Mosul, Erbil, Kirkuk, and Sulaimaniyah.\n\nEthnically close to the Iranians, the Kurds were traditionally nomadic herders but are now mostly seminomadic or sedentary. The majority of Kurds are Sunni Muslims. Kurdish dialects belong to the northwestern branch of the Iranian languages. The Kurds have traditionally resisted subjugation by other nations. Despite their lack of political unity throughout history, the Kurds, as individuals and in small groups, have had a lasting impact on developments in SW Asia. Saladin, who gained fame during the Crusades, is perhaps the most famous of all Kurds.

"Not sure why I ran across your question, but it's a good one. For a clear path, we all need a dream and a vision. \n\nAre you a Christian? Definitely pray. Seek and you will find. He will give you the desires of your heart. \n\nBasics for tonight and tomorrow . . . Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Also, find a non-denominational Bible-based community church. Go tomorrow. God will meet you there.\n\nI really loved ""Your Best Life Now"" by Joel Osteen. This book offers a lot of hope and gives a thinking outside of the box perspective.\n\nA great book for purpose and path . . . ""The Purpose-Driven Life"" by Rick Warren. He guides and gives perspective in this book. Remember, it's not about you. It's about what you can give. (Take care of yourself, though!)\n\nI heard Bruce Wilkinson speak last year . . . he had a book called THE DREAM GIVER. He also wrote the Prayer of Jabez. He can motivate anyone to find their dream. It's inside you already.\n\nI heard Matthew Barnett speak last month about how he started The Dream Center in L.A. to help people of all kinds turn their lives around. He said once you start serving, you won't want to be served again.\n\nAnother great teacher on vision and leadership is John Maxwell. He has books on leadership that include ""vision casting"" and building a team. Check out www.injoy.com\n\nYou are on the right path if you are seeking your path! God bless you and keep you and make His face to shine upon you and give you peace."

Congrats on your success with Latin.  70% of the Western Indo-European languages are based on Latin.  \n\nWhich means that all languages that were native to the European continent in times past are mostly derivative from the Latin language.\n\nThat to say, Italian is immersed in the Latin language. So is the French.  Russian is less so but I don't know a lot about the origin of Russian but it probably has more Eastern influence than Italian.\n\nEastern languages (e.g., Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Hebrew, etc.) are more based in pictographic language forms (or pictures).  These are far from the Latin base of languages.
I was born into a world of God's love.  Before I was old enough to understand what it was, I was learning about God in Sunday school.  By the time I was old enough to make up my own mind about what I believed, I realized I couldn't imagine a world without God in it.\n\nAs an adult, I have felt the presence of the Holy Spirit in me, have heard what I believed to be God speaking to me, and have seen what I believed to be God's will at work in circumstances that could not be logically explained.  That is why I believe in God.
"Kwanzaa (Kwaanza) is a week-long secular holiday honoring African-American heritage, observed from December 26 to January 1 each year, almost exclusively by African-Americans in the United States of America, though Africans of the diaspora in many countries have begun to practice its observances as well.\n\nKwanzaa consists of seven days of celebration, featuring activities such as candle-lighting and pouring of libations, and culminating in a feast and gift-giving. It was founded by black nationalist Dr. Ron ""Maulana"" Karenga, and first celebrated from December 26, 1966, to January 1, 1967. Karenga calls Kwanzaa the African American branch of ""first fruits"" celebrations of classical African cultures."

Even though C.S. Lewis insisted that the Chronicles of Narnia were not allegorical with reference to the Bible, there are several clear parallels that can be drawn:\n-Aslan is a lion king who has temporarily lost power to the white witch, and Jesus is referred to as the Lion of Judah. In the Christian faith, He is also the rightful King, though Satan controls earth for now.\n-Aslan offers himself willingly as a sacrifice in the place of Edmund, who is supposed to die according to the deep magic. Jesus offers Himself as a substitute for mankind when He dies on the Cross.\n-Like Aslan, Jesus is amazingly resurrected even though He was slain by His enemy.\n-Aslan breathes life into those creatures that were frozen by the white witch, and they live again. Because of Jesus Christ, the dead will rise again at the Resurrection.
I believe there is no God, is just the ignorance, when our ancestors watch the sun they believe it was God, now we know it is just a star. \nWhen someone did not understand something they bring magic ideas like Gods and Designers.\nI just accept that I do not know everything, and I am happy with it.
"One cannot teach another to love, but if you wanna be closer to Him spiritually...\n\n~You should to read your Bible everyday, not only does it allow you to become closer to Him and know more about Him, it shows you how to be closer to Him.\n~You should talk with Him and seek His face through prayer. \n1 Thessalonians 5:17 ""Pray continually!""\n2 Chronicles 7:14 ""If my people...will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways ...""\n~Ask Him to help you become closer to Him.\n\nHope this helps:)"
"Historically, around the turn of the century, no countries fought on Christmas Day. World War I & II both took a ""break"" on Christmas day. Just out of respect for each other and the season. I'm not sure who the people are that are so bent up about this Christmas thing. As we celebrate it now it is a pagan holiday, not a Christian one. Christians moved the celebration to December to combat what the felt was a day that was too much about carnal fulfillment. Guess that didn't work out so hot."

It is the name they use for the person that almost every family has... \n\nIt doesnt necc. mean a bad thing but it is that one person who always goes his or her own way...whichis often the opposite way that everyone else went..\n\nExample: Father was a Navy man, his father was a Navy man, and six fathers before him... all your borthers join the Navy but as soon as you get out of HS you apply to Art School insisting you are creative and dont want to be trained to kill\n\nWhile there is nothing wrong with that becasue you were following your own path you totally went against the generations of standards in the family... hence your the black sheep....
This is actually very easy to answer, based on evolution the egg had to come first. Evolution works like this: There are slight changes in the genetic information of the sex cells (i.e. eggs and sperm) of individuals that are passed on to the offspring of any two parents. These changes in the genetic makeup are called mutations. Mutations can either have: 1) A deleterious effect on the offspring (genetic disorders may arise, many times these are lethal); 2) sometimes these mutations may be advantageous, making an individual more fit than its neighbors (this is sometimes referred to as conferring an advantage); or 3) these mutations can have no effect, making no change from parent to progeny.\n\nIn the case of the chicken, it must have evolved from something else that became less fit than the chicken and eventually becoming extinct. The chicken became a chicken from this other organism through mutations that built up over time in subsequent generations. However, whatever the genetic makeup that finally became defined as a chicken, that individual was first conceived and developed in an egg before being hatched. The egg and sperm that fused to produce the chicken didn't bypass the period of gestation within an egg that had developed in the bird family millions of years before the chicken came along.\n\nSo the simple answer to this question is the egg came first -- unless you believe in fairy tales?

"That is a very difficult question.... Besides personal factors (""beauty in the eye of the beholder""), if one were to use some religious or spiritual criteria in this forum, there probably could be a basis for a consensus. History has shown that societies go through phases. Over-simplified: struggling, great, & past-their-prime. The Roman Empire is amazing history, Great Britain had a world empire, the USA has had a been a virtuous experiment... but it appears that the glory days, culturally, for USA is in the past. Whatever moral values one has (religious or secular), the direction of the government & entertainment (to name to major factors) has been going downhill since WWII. As have the developed countries, in general.\n\nI have wondered if I will want to stay in the US after I retire. It is becoming more & more difficult to maintain a Christian lifestyle - for even a nominal Christian - with all the worldly assaults & temptations, everywhere, all the time.\n\nSo the question becomes, for me, where do the people live in harmony with Christian values? (And, secondarily, have a healthy & pleasant environs.) I think I'll check Iceland... there is no heaven on earth - that's what I want."
Why, you, of course.\nSilly question.

Ambrosius Blarer died in Winterthur
"The question can best be answered by stating that John penned the book of Revelation, while our Lord Jesus is the Author.  The correct title of the book comes at the very beginning, ""The Revelation of Jesus Christ.""  John was shown what to write.  He received Revelation while imprisoned on the Isle of Patmos.\n\nThe strongest evidence for dating any ancient historical document is internal.  The second evidence is written tradition, a way of refering to non-scripture.  We know that unlike other apostles, John did not die a martyrs death.\n\nThe first history of the church, outside of the first century book of Acts (by Luke who also wrote Luke), was that of Eusebius in the 4th century.  Eusebius relates the story of John being carried to church in his old age, telling fellow Christians to love one another, for in that all was fulfilled.\n\nDates given for the writing vary, but scholars set a late date of being during the Roman Emperor Domitian's reign.  This is said to be about AD 95-96.  This is highly significant as it would be the very last ""theopneustos"" (God breathed) scripture written.\n\nIt is also significant, because the REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST serves as the expounder and capstone of the prophetic writings.  It could be said that the most vital book to understanding Revelation is the book of Daniel, because this book is the only one which not only gives the events, but also the times (this is noted by Josephus in his description of Daniel).\n\nSince the author, our Lord Jesus, is eternal (Rev. 21:6), it could be said that His Revelation not only was written, but that it is and always has been written, and the book carries a great curse for whoever adds to it -- REVELATION ADDS ALL THE PLAGUES OF THE BOOK!!!  To those who take away -- IT SAYS GOD SHALL TAKE AWAY HIS PART OF THE BOOK OF LIFE, AND OUT OF THE HOLY CITY, AND FROM THE THINGS WHICH ARE WRITTEN IN THIS BOOK.\n\nYears ago, an old mentor of mine showed me a greek version of Revelation he had.  It showed the variants (places where somehow different manuscripts disagree).  Nevertheless, certain variants do not cast doubt upon the reliability of transmission.\n\nMy study of Revelation has revealed that a concordance, careful study, and reverence for Almighty God reveal the same exact themes found in varying scriptures, both old and new, (also helpful are the book of Enoch and also Yashir ""Jasher"").  Someone who is truly up to such a task shall find that only the Omniscient Creator could tie such a sweeping exposition of scripture into a dispersed narrative of the end of the age and the renewal of all things under Messiah.\n\nOur Lord Jesus Christ is the Author.  John wrote the book.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nTake care,\nMark"

"Because for them without Jesus there is no Christianity, there is no *Christian* faith, there is no Christian-style 'salvation'. Jesus is all they have.\n\nImagine Buddhism without the Buddha.\n\nFor much of Christianity's history, it is/was a proselytising faith set up to spread much like the Borg of the delta quadrant fame.  You will be assimilated - resistance is futile.\n\nAnd for centuries, resistance was largely futile, until the renaissance period. \n\nYou should forgive most proselytisers. Most do not comprehend that their proselytising ways are often highly insulting and/or offensive to people of other religions and ways of life. They just can't see it.\n\nTo them, assimilating you into the collective is a good thing and they get the kudos of having 'saved you'.\n\nThe best way to respond is to ask them lots of questions about their faith's inconsistencies, most of which either hav no answers or have answers that involve an industrial-sized spinning machine. And always check out that their Bible quotes are correct as much gets mistranslated (from Greek/Hebrew into English) and/or taken out of its biblical context. And then you can find out if you're dealing with someone who's ignorant of the authentic biblical texts or someone who's wilfully trying to mislead you.\n\nA quick search on Yahoo for ""response to christian missionaries"" came up with this site:\nhttp://www.karaites-usa.org/Responding_To_Missionaries/\n\n\nHope  that helps."

"American English suffers ""colonial lag"", meaning that the English that is spoken in America has roots in the 17th century and then diverged. British English evolved in ways that American English did not. \n\nThere's sentence structures Americans use that British do not. Like ""have gotten"", that ""en"" ending with ""have"" is an old form of English.\n\nYou'll see that in the French of Montreal, Quebeq, Canada too. \n\nI see it in my mother's Japanese, it's very pre WWII and she taught me ""old fashioned"" Japanese that make modern Japanese people laugh. ""You sound like my grandmother."" They would say. Hey! I was taught by a grandmother. \n\nIreland has colonial lag too. If you read Shakespear with an Irish accent the rhymes would work. \n\nIn England there's a class system. So one's station in life can be deduced by the accent one has. Changing one's class is more difficult because one's accent would show where someone came from. I think that's why there are so many different accents in England and smaller pockets of the population that speak them. There's history behind it. \n\nAmericans don't have a class system like that. There's a lot of movement up and down the social ladder caused by wealth or the loss of wealth. I think that national TV is blurring the lines of the accents in America. There are classes on how to loose a regional accent when going into business. What is the dominant accent... watch the TV News. The ""Walter Cronkite"" accent.  \n\nThe slang in England and America will be different and that's the most difficult thing for a non-native speaker to learn. You would not call a small pack worn with a belt around your waist a ""fanny pack"" in England. That's very naughty. It's not naughty in America. Americans don't call a cigarette a ""f a g"". That comes from ""faggot"" which lit the fuse on cannons. In America it means a homosexual. \n\nBritish speakers of English have difficult with the slang in Australia. Australians with Americans. We all share English but after the colonies were established the English evolved in different directions. \n\nThe main difference between British and American use of English will be seen with the vowels. I'd focus on that if I were you.  Speakers of British English don't open their mouths as wide as Americans. Reading their lips is a little more difficult.\n\nIf you have a DVD player, get a movie that is made in English, put on the English Captions, listen to the movie and look at how the words are spelled out. That's the cheapest way to learn a language. To witness it in action, in a situation, because language is more than the words, it's gestures, eye contact, how close you stand to someone when speaking.\n\nJust look at the French when they shrug their shoulders. Both shoulders are used, their hands go up, they pucker their lips, tilt their head. It's a full body ""I don't know"" motion. What you hear may be just a ""pffft"" sound. \n\nSo watching movies will help in the non-verbal communication. \n\nYou're going to be using a different side of your head reading English. Chinese characters come in the brain like art, sounds of birds, that sort of thing because they are pictures that have meaning. Alphabets that make words that are used in sentences use the other side of the brain, where math is processed. \n\nYou got your work cut out for you. Good luck."
Tradition can also be based on religion. The original 12 days of Christmas started on Christmas and ended on January 6, the Feast of the Epiphany, or 3 Kings. The celebration of when the 3 Kings would have arrived to celebrate the Christ Child's birth, so the religious tradition is to keep the decorations up until that day.

Sadly, especially in my family, I find that my older Filipino family members are prejudiced against black people or other non-white or Filipino people.  I don't know the logic behind it.  Maybe it was the way they were brought up, a lack of understanding and tolerance.  Don't despair.  Keep in mind that it isn't you that is the problem.  It's their ignorance that causes you to get that vibe from them.  Nothing you can do about it.  It won't change their minds.

"Celibacy is defined as not only ""Abstinence from sexual intercourse, especially by reason of religious vows"" but also is ""The condition of being unmarried."" So I don't think it's about declaring the sex is unholy/unhuman but rather about a ""voluntary refusal to enter the married state"".\n\nIn 1 Corinthians 7:32-34a it says that ""I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs—how he can please the Lord. But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world—how he can please his wife—and his interests are divided.""\n\nI think that the reason for celibacy as it is stated in the previous passage that getting married forces you to balance two things, your relationship with God and your wife (I'm sure this is a universal truth that all married men understand how demanding a wife can be). However, it doesn't necessarily imply that Priests shouldn't be married."
"Yes there ever can be peace on earth. My assertion can happen but not without the mutual efforts of civilize societies to eradicate religious extremism which breeds terrorism. There is need for educating many religious zealots - ""extremists"", who think they are the best in culture/tradition and so their religion is the best and most perfect. Thus they choose to call them of other religious sects or them without religious affiliations as infidels. These religious extremists are trully ignorant and don't use their education little or enough to enhance their social standing. They are always not curious or anxious to pry their holy books but are at the mercy of their religious leaders to brainwash them - ""MASTER says"". May I suggest that civil religious persons and society - both christians, moslems, hindus, budhists, etc should know noone was created infidel by God. God scales noone infidel. The extremists should be taught to respect everyone's social or religious standing. The whole civilize world should educate rather than support these zealots and there ever will be peace on earth."
English doesn't have a 'neutral' gender; historically, the default gender for pronouns in English has been masculine.\n\nGerman is one language that does have a neutral gender: nouns/pronouns can be masculine, feminine, or neutral.\n\nNote that the linguistic concept of gender doesn't necessarily equate to natural sex (male/female).

"Piccadilly (pĭk'ədĭl'ē) , street of the City of Westminster borough, London, England. Starting at Piccadilly Circus (London's center of traffic and amusement), it runs to Hyde Park Corner. The street is lined with shops, hotels, and clubs. The Albany, a club, was the residence of T. B. Macaulay, W. E. Gladstone, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, and George Canning.\n\nThe name arises from a tailor named Robert Baker, who owned a shop in The Strand in the late 16th century and early 17th century. He amassed a large fortune by making and selling picadils (stiff collars with scalloped edges and a broad laced or perforated border), that were then in fashion. With his great fortune he purchased a large tract of what was then open country to the west of London and in about 1612 he built a large house there. The mansion soon became known as Piccadilly Hall.\n\nThere was a British film made in 1929 called ""Piccadilly"".\n\n\nPiccadilly is a major London street, running from Hyde Park Corner in the west to Piccadilly Circus in the east. The street is part of the A4 road, London's main western artery, and runs alongside a number of famous buildings and sites, including Green Park.\n\nIt is the location of Fortnum & Mason, the Royal Academy and The Ritz Hotel. Simpson, once amongst the nation's leading clothing stores, opened on Piccadilly in the 1930s. The store closed in 1999 and the site is now occupied by the booksellers Waterstones.\n\nThe Piccadilly Line of the London Underground takes its name from Piccadilly and part of the line travels under Piccadilly. Green Park, Hyde Park Corner and Piccadilly Circus tube stations all have entrances either on or near to Piccadilly.\n\n\nPiccadilly (1929) was a British film directed by Ewald André Dupont, written by Arnold Bennett and starring Anna May Wong, Gilda Gray and Jameson Thomas. It has been re-released by Milestone Films after an extensive restoration. It appeared in theatres in 2004 at film festivals nationwide, and in 2005 it was released on DVD."

No, no, no. What you are referring to is social Darwinism or eugenics, where people believe in the superiority of one race, and that this superiority justifies cruelty to other groups.

Dr. Clausenstein invented the first prototype Santa in 1798 out of used human parts that he assembled in a secret laboratory in the alps. While the original Kris Kringle was a disaster, killing eight deer and seriously harming four small children, the very next attempt was a complete success, never harming another soul or animal. Although inconceivable today, Dr. Clausenstein was never granted a patent for his creation and was subsequently hanged for abominable crimes against humanity, forcing the monster Satan Claus (as he was known after the trial) to flee to the north pole.

Of course, legally you can do what you want, but please keep in mind that there's usually a big difference in maturity level between an 18-year-old and a 25-year-old.  You might find that in a couple of years you've changed and you don't want the same things you wanted before.  Of course, the person you feel this way about will probably change in that time too.  So choose carefully, knowing that both of you will be growing up...\n\nDon't do the sex before marriage thing, please.
"Simple answer: The ""sinful"" condition of homosexuality can not be proven or disproven, one way or another.\n\nComplex Answer: Sin is a concept presented by religion, which is based in faith, not science. By using the word ""proof"" you are asking for scientific evidence to support a faith based concept, which is not only impossible, but unnecessary. If you have faith, you need no proof.\n\nHomosexuality as a sin (or not a sin) is something that can no more be proven than the ""fact"" that Jesus rose from the dead on the third day. This is not to say that this didn't happen, but what we need to understand is that this is something that we take on as faith.\n\nHebrews 11:1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\n\nHomosexuality is labeled a sin in Leviticus 13 (somewhere), and only by this account does the Christian world understand it to be a sin. However, none of this can be tested and proven through scientific testing."
John 1\n1In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2He was with God in the beginning.  3Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. 4In him was life, and that life was the light of men. 5The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it.\n\n6There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John. 7He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe. 8He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. 9The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world.\n\n10He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. 11He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. 12Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God—13children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God.\n\n14The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.\n\nJesus is The Word.
"A ""ball"" is a party where everyone dresses elegantly and dances.  They are big events where everything looks beautiful.  So if you are having a ball, i.e. throwing a big party, you are probably enjoying yourself a lot."
Do you?
Depends on what you want to study and where you want to study.
i am really glad to hear from you this question, sister you should cover the hair and wear non tight clothes, only hands and face can be non covered, wish you all the best sister :)
Valentine's Day is a big deal because we live in a capitalist country where retail stores make a fortune off getting people to buy useless crap through advertising. Then they bill it as a holiday so that you are a bad person if you criticize it according to them. Like how at Christmas if you aren't willing to go in debt buying everybody stuff you are called Scrooge or how if you don't shell out dough for July 4'th you aren't patriotic etc. etc.
it is a charity that builds housing for poor people, they are all over the country, and really helping out with hurricane Katrina. you dont even need special skills to help. go to http://www.habitat.org/default2.aspx
I think that it means if you get to 3rd and 16, you better pray, or else you will end up punting!   :o)  Maybe John is the patron saint of 3rd down conversions...
yeah. whats not to believe about it?

"I don't know how you come across in person, but on-line you sound like a jerk who'll kidnap me and make me do this stuff without any reward.\n\nI belive you're just desparate to find you dream though so I'll share ways to get this information without looking like a serial killing jerk:\n\n1.  Don't point blank ask, ""Can you cook clean and sew."" Instead, re-phrase this as:  ""It's been so long since I've had a good home cooked meal.""  If she's good at cooking, she'll want to show off for you, and she'll offer to cook you that meal.  If you get her to cook that meal for you, then acidently <wink-wink> pop a button from your shirt.  If she's good and caring, again, she'll lovingly offer to help you repair it.\n\n2.  Don't demand this.  Remember, not all woman have these talents.  In fact, with the high divorse rates, many woman were raised by men, or working mom's.  Many of us feel inadequite because we don't have these skills < like how a man feels without an income or how he feels if he has small male genetiles >...it's a hurtful subject to certain people, so be respectful <thx>.  Plus, our educational system does not provide training for this anymore.  Be kind and respectful to the woman who arn't skilled in this.  Maybe you'll get a lawyer/accountant/CEO FRIEND who'll help in in the future.  I belive you can never have enough friends.\n\nGood luck and best wishes."
"I think he has a good heart, and he's trying to provide a service to thos ewho are hurting and in financial turmoil.  However, his ""name-it-claim-it"" message can sometimes be a little misleading.  Obviously, if it's God's will for me to go through the trial without extra finances, then I should pray more for the strength to get through tis time and the wisdom to avoid it the next time, not jsut for God to take it away or bless me with more, more, more."
Alot of Christians (not all) feel there as to be a show.  They are christian so therefore they feel there is a certain way to act and be.  whether it be in just public or in private life as well.  It is difficult to go to church and try to get right with god.  They see your faults and you feel as though they are looking down on you.  There are quite a few of them out there.  However I know that there are plenty who are not.  from my experience there is a face they where.  to show sinners the way to be. (though it doesnt actually work this way) my advice is to try to find a church or a christian group which you feel comfortable with and try to grow and learn with them,  as i said they arent all like that some times you just need to sift through the mess to find them.
Yes. Water baptism is only a symbolic gesture, even if you believe it to be a very important part in a Christian's life or not, it's ultimately only symbolic. As far as works, these are an expression of Christ's love through a Christian to others, not something that can be done to gain entrance to heaven. The Bible only cites that belief in Jesus is the only requirement for eternal life.\n\nAnd I'm 23, not quite a teenager anymore, but still young enough. :)

i think that when he refers to fresh water he means rivers not fresh without salt...but like that you can ask another question! How did man survive the ice age, how can people survive 14 days under ruins without food or water?By adapting or by inexplicable resistence under extreme conditions!perhaps they went to the place from where the river sprinkled from the mountain..who knows.
Well some people would say why would you limit yourself to half the candy in the box!\n\nBut there have actually been studies of men who think of themselves as bisexual as far as what gets them aroused, and nearly all of the men in the study had s distinct preference as far as what they reacted to.  And most in the study who said they were Bi responded more positively to females, although a few seemed to prefer men.\n\nThe same study was performed on heterosexual and gay males and they found that the heterosexuals became more aroused when presented with images of women and gay men tended to react much more strongly to men, as you would expect.\n\nIn my experience women who are bi get a much warmer reception (except among lesbians) and men who are are sometimes shunned by both Gay and Straight people.  \n\nI will try to find an article about the study and post it below.
Hi divalicious,\nI dont think he's gay just because he is expecting a gift for Valentines day. Just as I would not think women are gay because they expect a gift also. Good Luck: Blueladybug
The supernatural cannot be proven, that's why it is supernatural. Super is Latin for above, so supernatural means 'above nature'. Since we are governed by the laws of nature, we cannot step outside of those boundaries and prove the supernatural. However, we cannot disprove it either.
That can be tricky, especially if you were good friends with any of them.\nThe best thing to do is to just be honest.  Tell them that you have changed, and your interests have changed, and you just do not feel that you have anything in common with them anymore.  Let them know that you do not have anything against them, you just need to be on your own for a while, you want to meet othet people and explore other options.\n\nGood luck.

"In what regard? Many school districts define ""gifted"" children as those with an IQ above a certain level, such as 135. You can be a ""gifted"" artist, musician, or writer, meaning those things tend to come naturally to you. The same thing goes for sports or acting or anything, really."

No, the Internet is not only a way to cheat.  In terms of education, it can allow a child whose parents did not go to college an even break with those who do.\nThis is a new form of communication and sharing.

There was not an authentic Medieval Code of Chivalry as such - it was a moral system which went beyond rules of combat and introduced the concept of Chivalrous conduct - qualities idealized by knighthood, such as bravery, courtesy, honor, and gallantry toward women. The Medieval Code of Chivalry was understood by all but a Code of Chivalry was documented in 'The Song of Roland' in the early Medieval period of William the Conqueror. The 'Song of Roland' describes the 8th century Knights and battles of the Emperor Charlemagne and has been described as Charlemagne's Code of Chivalry. The idea of the Code of Chivalry were emphasised by the oaths that were sworn in Knighthood ceremonies. These sacred oaths were combined with the ideals of chivalry and with strict rules of etiquette and conduct. The idea and ideals of a Medieval Code of Chivalry was publicised in the poems, ballads, writings and literary works of Medieval authors. The myths of Arthurian Legends featuring King Arthur, Camelot and the Knights of the Round Table further strengthen the idea of a Medieval Code of Chivalry. The Arthurian legend revolves around the Code of Chivalry followed by the Knights of the Round Table - Honour, Honesty, Valour and Loyalty.\n\nThe Song of Roland - Charlemagne's Code of Chivalry\nA Code of Chivalry was documented in 'The Song of Roland' in the early 11th Century Medieval period of William the Conqueror. The 'Song of Roland' describes the 8th Century Knights and battles of the Emperor Charlemagne and has been described as Charlemagne's Code of Chivalry. The duties of a Knight were described as follows:\n\nTo fear God and maintain His Church\nTo serve the liege lord in valour and faith\nTo protect the weak and defenceless\nTo give succour to widows and orphans\nTo refrain from the wanton giving of offence\nTo live by honour and for glory\nTo despise pecuniary reward\nTo fight for the welfare of all\nTo obey those placed in authority\nTo guard the honour of fellow knights\nTo eschew unfairness, meanness and deceit\nTo keep faith\nAt all times to speak the truth\nTo persevere to the end in any enterprise begun\nTo respect the honour of women\nNever to refuse a challenge from an equal\nNever to turn the back upon a foe.\n\nMedieval Code of Chivalry - the Rules of Courtly Love\nThe following rules of Courtly Love were written by the 12th Century Frenchman, Andreas Capellanus. These 31 rules describe the pure romance of love but also describe love for another man's wife. This 'Courtly Love' is illustrated in the fictional story of Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere. But these rules of Courtly Love led to the downfall and execution of Queen Anne Boleyn, the wife of King Henry VIII - who lived his entire life putting in to practise the 'Rules of Courtly Love'.\n\nI. Marriage is no real excuse for not loving.\nII. He who is not jealous cannot love.\nIII. No one can be bound by a double love.\nIV. It is well known that love is always increasing or decreasing.\nV. That which a lover takes against the will of his beloved has no relish.\nVI. Boys do not love until they arrive at the age of maturity.\nVII. When one lover dies, a widowhood of two years is required of the survivor.\nVIII. No one should be deprived of love without the very best of reasons.\nIX. No one can love unless he is impelled by the persuasion of love.\nX. Love is always a stranger in the home of avarice.\nXI. It is not proper to love any woman whom one would be ashamed to seek to marry.\nXII. A true lover does not desire to embrace in love anyone except his beloved.\nXIII. When made public love rarely endures.\nXIV. The easy attainment of love makes it of little value; difficulty of attainment makes it prized.\nXV. Every lover regularly turns pale in the presence of his beloved.\nXVI. When a lover suddenly catches sight of his beloved, his heart palpitates.\nXVII. A new love puts to flight an old one.\nXVIII.

Make fun of the guys wearing Abercrombie & Fitch $50 polo shirts, then walk to the other end of the mall, buy a $50 'I am not a consumer whore' t-shirt from Hot Topic, then parade around the mall -- a bastion of capitalism and conformity -- wearing your new shirt and talking loudly about how you're stickin' it to the 'establishment'.  Follow up with high-priced fasion accessories, and makeup to further confirm with the 'non-conformists'.
Only if its you!  ;)
"""Ca m'est égal"" means it's all the same to me, where ""je m'en fou"" basically means I don't give a damn.  You can use them both in different situations- there is no ONE way to say ""I don't care."""
Yeah, I broke my nose tring to kickflip some stairs, then I missed a flight, and then the worst thing I missed my favorite Show The O.C!!!!!!!!!!
fencebender2002 has it right. Also, there are two judgement seats, the Great White Throne judgment where God will judge the nations, and the Bema seat of Christ where Jesus will reward those who ran the good race. Not to confuse you more, just wanted to make that clear. ;)

It can be really fun to do and he will get a laugh!"
If there are any people who still admire the Republicans and the Bush Administration after every lie, deceit, inhumanitarian activity, and appearance of impropriety that they have been caught in, then I would say yes, there are probaly some Democrats as well who don't blame the administration for their problems.
No, everyone makes their choices in life. I am not the one who should be judging them, they are the ones that must judge themselves and what they believe is right in their lives. If we would all just except that, then I think alot of people would be happier.
<*> Not two jesus' but two natures of jesus the god man.

If you read the bible and believe what you see in print to be the 100% truth of earth and human history, then you have to believe that god made some others too in some lands not so far away, because we're told that Cain found a wife other than Eve with whom to sire some offsprings, or else, he did sex with a sister.  In that case we all would be descendant of incest.  Now, doesn't that just make you feel all warm and fuzzy!\n\nIf, indeed, god made some more people in some lands near and far away, we're told nothing about when it was done,  nor of anthing else concerning them.
"I'm guessing it's actually お前どうですか [Omae dou desu ka] pronounced like ""oh-my-eh doh dehs kah.""  This generally means ""How about you?"" or ""What about you?""  Context is important to determine the exact meaning.  Ex: これらの詩はどうですか [kore-ra no shi wa dou desu ka] means ""How do you like these poems?"""
"Yes, many times. It seems that I am the spiritual gatekeeper for the family. My grandmother visited me for a full six months after her passing; I finally had to ask her to stop since I wasn't getting any sleep because of it! The only two people in my entire family who have not made personal visits are my Dad's mother &, believe it or not, my Dad. I did see him once in connection with my mother's Dad & believe that I learned why I haven't been visited by him, alone, but am still not certain that I understood what was happening perfectly.\n\nIf this happens to you, try to go with the flow as it is a very powerful gift &, once your family understand that it happens to you, one that can bring a measure of peace to those who are grieving. Just don't be surprised if most people don't understand it or claim that they don't believe it as this is perfectly normal for those who have never had it happen to them personally.\n\nWhat has happened over the course of my life & losses is that my family - while some of them still don't fully believe that this happens to me - has come to be the realization that I am wise beyond my years. To clarify, there are things that I have said or done in relation to information that has been passed on to me that there is no other explanation for but, since some members of the family choose not to believe that I've been contacted, they pay respect to my talent by their belief that I am ""wise"".\n\nPersonally, I have learned to phrase anything I might say to the family in ways that tend to indicate that it could have been prior knowledge. This helps ease them into the idea that I know some things that they know fully well I shouldn't be aware of. I've learned to phrase what I know from contacts with the family who has passed in such a way as to present it as logical...""I wouldn't think that Grandma would - whatever - since she never liked - whatever..."" This also helps to add information to the conversation & get the point across while not drawing attention to what I tend to call my ""ether"" knowledge.\n\nI don't really blame some of my family for having problems, however. After all, it is hard enough on one of my uncles that I now look exactly like his mother...add to this that my voice has the same timber, I have the same type of personality & such & it is easy to understand his issues with my other talents :) Poor man nearly fainted the first time I walked into his house & he saw me with glasses...\n\nEdited for Fred: Are you okay or are you intentionally rude because you have the strange idea that it is funny? Here's a newsflash for you: It isn't! If you can't answer a question in the vein it has been asked, please don't insult everyone involved by your rude comments! Thank you!"
"I believe ""When in Rome..."".  Most Americans practice some version of Christianity.  Of course there are large Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist and other religious groups that make-up the true fabric and character of this place.  Many friends of mine are Muslim.  When Ramadan arrives, I wish them 'Happy Ramadan'.  For my Jewish friends, it's 'Happy Hanukkah' and so forth.  What bothers me about this political correctness we seem to be stuck on is that it does not take into account how intelligent the average person is.  The only people I know of that are offended by Merry Christmas are big idiots.  If someone said Happy Hanukkah or Happy Ramadan or any other seasonal greeting I wouldn't take offense.  Heck, I would be happy that people of whatever faith or culture thought enough of me to grace me with a sweet greeting! In America December 25th is a major holiday called Christmas!  Other holidays overlap this time of year but people are smart enough to know what's going on. We need to lighten up and just enjoy the 'Holidays' by any name.  Thanks for the question."
That would depend on the consequences. And whether those consequences affect you. Getting arrested for indecent exposure is not all that funny. Seeing a friend get arrested for indecent exposure can be funny!. But again, there are consequences to think about. Getting the crap beat out of you by your best pal for laughing at his arrest is not so funny.
Hope these help!!
Haram is what Allah has forbidden, for example, Pork, adultery, and so on.\nMakrooh is what is discouraged. For example, oral sex (yes, this is fact.) is makrooh because the human fluids are considered dirty and that's why you have to wash yourself (Ablution) before prayer to cleanse yourself if you have ingested, spilt, dispensed, any bodily fluids whether you have commited intercourse or not.\n\nThere has been some debate about smoking being haram or makrooh. My Saudi friend tells me it is actually haram, because what is addictive and harms your health is definately haram.
I don't think lonely millionaires know WHAT they want, really.  Money does that to people.
Christians believe because they are uninformed and encouraged NOT to explore or question their faith.  Jesus was believed to have said not to doubt him, or you will go to hell.  It seems as though Christianity does not sell well with the educated, but back then no one else could read and write but the few who passed on the teachings of the early Church from generation to generation.  Simplistically, most people who believe in God do so because of the many instabilities in their life and the necessity to latch on to something, even if mythical, that comforts them.  Too bad they can't find that trust within themselves, instead of a conflicting cartoon character in the sky.

Think the dirty, rags-wearing, hobo bit is an act? they really drove to their corner in a Lexus and have a Razr cell phone in their pocket?

We don't know when exactly when Jesus was born(could be the summer) and that case even the year. The bible is not persice when it comes to this matter so the do the early christian leaders do was genius. They want to mark a specific date to rebemer Jesus birth and they want to convert people aslo so.  So they pick a roman pagan holiday that was at the end of each year and replace it with the christain holiday christmas.  Christanity is very flexable at incorparting new thing to convert people. How do you thing the Christmas tree got started?
Where I live those of us who attend Open Circle in a public use park literally had to get a court order so we could evict people who were there to do nothign but harrass us because of our faith.  We have been called every foul name in the book and been accused of things that are wholy unbelievable.  Several us, after leaving one night, were followed by people who had a mic hooked up to a loudspeaker in their car and they trailed us shouting scripture and all manner of other things to us eventhough we ignored them and didn't say anything back.  By far these are the minority for sure but for the most part chruches do nothing to curb these so-called 'enthusiastic' members.  Leaders of churches have publicly denounced Wiccans and have called us the tools of the devil and denounced us from pulpits.  It seems that since Wicca has made a comeback it has become a favorite whipping boy of Christians.  For example, some of the worst things you can accuse someone of us practicing the occult.  When someone wants to denounce someone that is what they pull out.  Not that they are wrong or bad for other reasons but because they 'practice the occult'.  Most cults have been accused of it as well because they are religions they don't agree with.  Most major christan religions have warned of the danger of Wicca and the occult and saying it is nothing but the practice of the devil.  There are even entire books out there about the 'dangers of occult practices and how to keep your kids away from it or they may be sacrificing their soul'.  None of that sounds like tolerance to me, more like biggotry.  Yet none of the major christian factions have denounced this or tried to curb it in the name of tolerance.  Isn't silence in this matter as good and condoning it?\n\nWhereas, the difference is, Wiccans teach tolerance and acceptance of EVERYONE, no matter their religion, race, creed or sexual orientation. \n\nThink about it...

yes, i saw this movie.\n\nyes, i enjoyed it, because I found it to be the most accurate visual account of the suffering Jesus endured before, during, and after his crucifix on the cross, when compared to other movies done on the life of Christ's death...and I believe that this visual presentation of Christ's crucifiction is EXACTLY what Mel Gibson wanted to portray in this film, and he was successful...and I believe this movie will remain on top because of this reason.\n\nNo, i'm not pentecostal
Baptism doesn't save you, only God/Jesus/The Spirit does that.  Baptism is an open declaration of your love and submission to God.  If you want to reaffirm your statement to your church and friends, they will always let you do so, and if you want to be rebaptised, talk to your pastor to see if he is comfortable with doing so.  I can't see why he wouldn't, and if it will help give you peace, I say go ahead, but please know, if you have given your life to God, you are saved, and baptism is only to show others of your promise to God.

"Honestly i blame the female population. Yes males are genetically inferior to female, we die easier when in an embryo and yes we are emotionally retarded in some aspects of life, such as color perception and taste, but at the end of the day i believe it comes down to sex. Not sexual intercouse, but the influence females have on males. The infamous aphorism ""behind every great man, thier's a female"" is given an entirely new meaning when, applied to society nowadays. As you stated early females suppress males in a lot of aspect. Studys have shown that females are mainly attracted to males of a more rough exterior, because during the ""primitive era"" those were the type of men that could hunt and provide, so forth and so on. Its because of this that females seek this in men, and a man seeking a female will alter his mannerism in ways to attract her. So yea, i feel what can lead to aggression is the suppression of our emotion, even though males have testosterone, so do females. Not as much, but testosterone none the less. And i'll tell you this, i've seen some pretty aggressive females to the point of it being scary, so genes can't take all the blame. At the end of the day, woman are the real creators of society, as a male im willing to say, that a lot of the things males strive for are in the pursuit for females."
"Not in the least.  Evolution is a scientific theory.  There are certainly atheist materialists that have tried to say that the only logical conclusion of evolution is atheism, but they are fools and liars, one and all.  The fact is that the tehory of evolution by natural selection is a) scientifically founded and b) not at odds with a belief in God.\n\nIf you don't agree with eveolution being taught, then quite frankly, you don't agree with the idea of teaching science at all.  It is all consostent with scientific methodology.  If that's the case, then oppose all science, and don't just pick-and-choose which findings you're going to take issue with.\n\n*********edit*********\nWHAT'S WITH THIS ""EQUAL TIME"" CRAP?!?!?  Would you guys suggest equal time for alchemy and chemistry?  For astrology and astronomy?  For Newtonian physics and psychokinetics?\n\nWhat you all are missing is that even if ID/Creationism is correct, it has NO USE TO HUMANS.  Period.  I cannot manipulate the theory of creationism to create a vaccine, the way I can manipulate evolution.  School is not about some sort of all-out investigation into Divine Truth; it is meant to be practical.  And like it or not, the theory of evolution by natural selection has practical applications.  We do not teach how to use the ALTAIR computer, because it's pointless; not because the functioning of it is any ""less true"" than the modern PC.  We do not teach basket weaving or bricklaying in school, because they have very little usefulness.  But every person who ever takes antibiotics or who ever uses a disinfectant on the kitchen counter can learn something useful about the nature of evolution.  This ""choice"" notion is utterly ridiculous.  Should phrenology be taught side-by-side with classical conditioning?  Should Swahili be taught with the same regularity that Spanish is taught?  You people are talking nonsense.\n\nDo you really want the national dialogue on the nature of God to be controlled by the Federal Government?  Do you have the faintest idea how detrimental that would be to the American Christian community? THINK!!!!!\n\nFor Schneb: random variation is only a PART of evolution.  Natural Selection is an entirely non-random process.  I'd wager a few thousand dollars that one could easily make a program that would randomly trigger pixels on the monitor, and select and retain pixels that had some resemblance of the WIndows logo, and in time, one would get a refined and accurate Windows logo.  Randomness in variation is only a part of the picture, and you ideologues have decided to cling to that part of the theory and ignore the rest--especially ignoring the vast amount of biochemical support for the theory, none of which could have been known to Darwin--in order to distort the case for the theory, which is very, very strong.\n\nDo you realize how long a billion years really is?  Life has been around for ~3.5 BILLION years.  Today you will pass 100 billion to 10 trillion E. coli into the toilet.  Think about the size of these numbers!  Think about the number of generations in the vast, vast oceans!  These sorts of statistically ""impossible"" things happne all the time.  Do you realize that the entire function of the neurons that let you read this depend on trillions of random moleculra collisions that eventually reach the right spot?  It's all random, Brownian motion that allows ions to diffuse in and out of the channels, that makes the gates open and close, that makes the synaptobrevin and synatotagmin and SNAP-25 proteins collide and fuse the cells membranes to spill the neurotransmitter into the cleft where it will randomly bump around the synapse and then randomly bind to a post-synaptic receptor, all before randomly bouncing around until it hits the reuptake proteins that will sequester the neurotransmitter.  I'm not making any of that up, and it happnes billions and billions of times just "
I think whom made this war ...if its there ...ppl againest the GOD ...bcs all the relgions what ever was asking for one goal its folow the GOD whom creat us...\n\nWhy must be war ..if the all relgions ask for thats ... but i think whom find thats concept ( war of religious) they did for some benifets for them self ...\n\nFor islam asked us to respect and believe all the other relgions and thier profets and thier holy books ...bcs all of them came from GOD \n\nSo should evry one respect his won religion what ever was and in the same time respect the other religions ..and thats what islam teach us
I know that very few Japanese women take drugs to ease labor pains.  Doctors very rarely will give them to women. It is highly discouraged. I live in Okinawa, Japan on a military base and had my baby at the military hospital where I could have had drugs but opted not to.  I went to prenatal classes with Japanese women and they told me all about it.  They're also told to gain only 12-16 pounds during pregnancy!!!  CRAZY!

In the U.S., a state court has jurisdiction over disputes which occur in a state. Cases are heard and evidence presented in a trial court, usually located in a courthouse in the county seat.\n\nIf one of the litigants is unsatisfied with the decision of the lower court, the matter may be taken on appeal (but an acquittal in a criminal trial may not be appealed due to the Fifth Amendment protection against double jeopardy). An intermediate appellate court, often called the state court of appeals, will review the decision of the trial court. If still unsatisfied, the litigant can appeal to the highest appellate court in the state, usually called the state supreme court.
The Hazara ethnic group resides mainly in the central Afghanistan mountain region called 'Hazarajat or Hazaristan'. They make up anywhere between 19-25% of Afghanistan's population, but an accurate census has not been taken in decades so there is little information to verify at present. There are also significant populations of Hazaras in Pakistan and Iran.

I think humans are definitely capable of forgiveness!  If they weren't there wouldn't be many relationship out there....we all need to be forgiven every now and then and we need to forgive as well!!  Of coarse it is reasonable to go to hell if you don't repent for your sins, learn from them, and believe in God and ask him to help guide you thru your life here on earth!!!

It's both a societal and ego thing.  They are afraid of being percieved as gay then they wonder if they aren't 'macho' enough if they are being hit on by another guy.  Once society stops stigmatizing homosexuality and gains a bit more acceptance about this alot of it will fall by the wayside.\n\nThe flip side is, however, women don't seem to have the same problem as a majority.

A couple years ago, I had a friend whom I hadn't seen in almost a year because he had developed a serious drug habit and I had a not quite one year old daughter to take care of, and was starting to get my own life together. One day I heard his name on the radio- he had been shot seven times in the back of his head and his body was found in a dumpster outside a recycling plant. I later found out from my daughter's father, who still saw my friend on a pretty regular basis, that two weeks before he was murdered, my friend had become a Christian. The reason he had been killed was because he was trying to get out of his old lifestyle and away from his old friends and start a new life following Christ. His former friends apparently thought he was really just trying to make an excuse to go and tell the police about them and their drug use, so they killed him. From the story I heard of what happened that night, the people who shot him had asked him to go somewhere with him, and he was scared to go because he knew they were up to something. But, despite the fact that he was afraid, I think he was ready to give up his life because he had accepted Jesus as his savior before he died. Chances are, although I can't say for sure, you will not be killed for your faith, but even if you are, you are already ready because of your faith.
what a great question! Personally I would if i was a guy (but \nI'm not, lol) BUT I honestly dont think it is necessary UNLESS the woman is older or pregnant. ALSO as a woman I would not only give my seat to them but even to a child or an older man, I am a fit strong woman and I think a little standing wouldnt hurt me!
"It seems to me that, in the case of Christianity, you have to consider a couple of things:\n\nFirst, you base your spiritual belief on what YOU HEAR: ""So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God."" Rom 10:17)\n1 John 5:10 (King James Version)\nKing James Version (KJV)\n\nThen, if you have faith, you'll have the withness IN YOURSELF:\n""He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son."" (1 John 5:10). This refers to the Holy Ghost. As a matter of fact, the HOLY GHOST is our source of spiritual knowledge:\n""But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you."" (John 14:26)\n\nThe Bible is the repository of the Word of God. It is a coded book, you need the ""key"" of faith and the  understanding given by the Holy Ghost to be able to ""decode"" the message in it.\n\nIn my opinion, it is the Holy Ghost who gives you assurance that what the Bible says is true... So although externally we base our spiritual belief on what the Bible says, the Holy Ghost tells us that what is in the Bible is true.\n\nPlease remember that some translations could be wrong, I believe that only the original scriptures are without errors. The Holy Ghost can guide us through all this errors to the Truth (if we let Him to teach us, I mean if we listen to Him).\n\nIN SUMMARY, I do base my spiritual beliefs on the Bible, but with the aid of the Holy Ghost, who guides me and teachs me what is true and what is not true about what I read from the different existing translations of the Bible, AND from the different interpretations that people (e.g. pastors) may have  on what the Bible says."

"OK first, answer this question\nHow much of a ""people person am I?""\nsecond, are you willing to sacrifice for others.\nThe best witness of the gospel is to become the living gospel by living it out daily infront of others.\nI have tried preaching but a life lived out for all to see works sometimes way better.\nLove beyond and exceedingly no matter what. nothing and I mean absolutly nothing tells the gospel better than true love!\nAlso here's a piece of advice, Look up 1 Corinthians 13 and for every word where it sais ""Love"" replace it with God and you get an idea of His true nature and charactor. next do the same but place your name in there and see if you are all those things. Patient, Kind, believeing, hopeing and so on. Learn to love and develope your heart for God and for others. Get close to God daily."
Something MEANINGFUL.  If you are giving flowers, for example, give her a quantity that MEANS something to both of you... the number of months you've been together (or days or hours... if it has been a rather short relation).  It is not the thing you give, is the fact that you were thinking on something special while you picked up the gift.

I think that the problem a lot of people have with Christianity is that a large segment of Christians try to translate the Bible literally.  This only leads to kind of a joking atmosphere when discussing certain aspects of Christianity and makes it very hard to take the good parts as, well, good parts.  Since some of these people, who believe so completely that the literal translations are the correction translations, feel compelled to constantly, repeatedly and forcefully enlighten others as to their beliefs, it burns bridges for everyone who falls under the banner of Christianity.  Consequently, those who see the teachings of the Bible as simple lessons of morals are not able to spread that understanding because most listeners have become cynical whenever they are preached at.  It is a shame that all that people hear and see is the inherent holes yelled at them by sidewalk prophets and not the plain belief that the Bible is a list of good ideas set to a classic storied theme.  So, just try to take the Bible as a good story with some ideas and morals to try to live by.  Anything more and you will become disenfranchised when something is proven to be incorrect or unbelievable.

it's customary for married couples to give out ang pao (hong pao) because 'married couples' are considered adults.\nang pao signifies 'good luck' & 'may you grow up asap'...\nin the 1960s & way way before that, majority of the chinese are poor people or peasants. so, during chinese new year, the adults gave out ang pao so that the unmarried adults may have good luck in love or career (or good harvest) , to get married soon. then they gave children ang pao, so that they can grow up strongly & taller for that year, & join in their parents to work in the fields.

I abandoned someone I loved and who loved me when the person most needed me. I have never really forgiven myself for what I did. I worry that a situation will occur that I can't deal with and will leave again. So I wonder if I can trust myself or if others can trust me. This one act has affected me for thirty years. I should have gotten counseling a long time ago, so I could forgive myself and move on. You sound really hurt by what you did, so you did not screw up because you don't care about other people. People can do really bad things, see the light, and learn better ways of taking care of themselves and others. You can't change the past, so get help, find ways to forgive yourself, seek, if you can, the forgiveness of the people you hurt, and try not to be so stupid, selfish, or out of control (whatever fits) in the future. The only thing you need to give up is your identification of yourself as a bad person. Practice trying to think about what you are doing and whether it's the right thing. My way of deciding ethical questions is simple: what would the world be like if everybody did what (ever) I am contemplating doing? If it is not a place I would want to be, I don't do it. Please find help (if you don't have money, try county mental health). See a priest or rabbi, talk to your mom or a favorite relative, see a doctor - do something. If what you did is related to drugs or alcohol, you may be able to get help through AA. Talk to someone so you can get perspective of what happened. You don't have to be afraid, it doesn't have to haunt you or ruin your future. Seek another path. Peace.

Uncle Tom's Cabin is a novel by American abolitionist author Harriet Beecher Stowe which treats slavery as a central theme. The work was first published on March 20, 1852. The story focuses on the tale of Uncle Tom, a long-suffering African American slave, the central character around whose life the other characters—both fellow slaves and white slave owners—revolve. The novel dramatizes the harsh reality of slavery while also showing that Christian love and faith can overcome even something as evil as enslavement of fellow human beings.\n\nUncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel of the 19th century (and the second best-selling book of the century after the Bible)[1] and is credited with both helping to start the American Civil War and helping to fuel the abolitionist cause in the United States.\n\nDespite these positive effects, the book also helped create and spread common stereotypes about African Americans, many of which endure to this day. Among the stereotypes in the book include the affectionate, dark-skinned mammy; the pickanniny stereotype of black children; and the Uncle Tom, or dutiful, long-suffering servant faithful to his white master or mistress. In recent years, these negative associations with Uncle Tom's Cabin have to a large degree overshadowed the historical impact of the book.
Why of course CHICAGO. We have hundreds of fancy resturants downtown located on the infamous Magnificent Mile ( Michigan Ave) with hundreds of stores and boutiques such as Eddie Bauer, A disney Store , Coach, Steve Madden and Stacy Adams, Tiffany's and Even a Victoria Secret( Vicky's Secret). We have many attractions such as Navy Pier, Art Institute, Millenium Park ( newest attraction), and a lot of other famous Attraction. Let's not forget the Sears Tower and Water Tower. So I strongly advise to visit Chicago
I know this question was ment for non-muslims but I couldn't ignore Schneb's reply and I felt obliged to comment on what he said.\n\n1- I wounder where did he get the idea that churchs are not built in muslim countries?!! I've never heard about christian's attempted failed in any country to build churchs.. I guess this information means that he personally never been to a muslim counrty.\n\n2- Again, which UN is he talking about??!! I had to check if it were changed, as the one - and the only one that is there - Doesn't have a majorty of muslims and with records, every time the UN votes for a law or a desicion against Israel one of the 5 countries intiteled to use the veto, stopes the desicion..!! have anyone heard about UN troops in Israel to stop Israel's actions against palastanians, although Isreal troops uses weapons and bombs and distroy palastenian's house and the palastenians to defend their country which was invaded and stolen by Israel uses stones and have to bomb themselves sometimes in desperation..!! I bet not.. \nBut everyone heared about the punishments Libya had to go through when it's leader made a desicion that the USA didn't approve, or the invasion of Iraqe under the false flag of democracy or the threatens that syria is having these days..etc.\n\n3- Never ever in Sudan or in any other place on earth people are killed to conver to Islam.. I think you know quite well what the christians are doing there.\n\nI hope I lightened some parts that were not clear and I hope your minds are open to hear the others view of the truth
The bahai are trying and failing miserably, calling themself the one world religion (but the word cult is more accurate).  Belief systems are too different to ever succeed in that one.
According to the bible the earth is about 6000 years old. Sceintists really don't know how old the earth is.  They guess, and then then present their theories as fact, which is unscientific behavior. They try to use carbon dating but that is not accurate. It also assumes time is linear.  Time is non-linear. Scientists put dinosaurs before man, but there is proof that they co-existed..
Yeah it's tough dealing with those people. \nWhenever they quote Levetawhatever, I just let them know that it also says that wearing clothing of a cotton blend is also something spoken against in that chapter, then they go running back to their Coach purses and adorable little sports jerseys that they love so much. \nSome things are messed up in the Bible, go figure, it's the word of MAN. We need to pick and choose what is right (since, well, Christians already do), and homosexuality has been shown to be innate (and shown also in other species) rather than a choice. SO a better question may be: Why would God make homosexuals? Just to send them to Hell? I think not.
"Research into the origin of life is a limited field of research despite its profound impact on biology and human understanding of the natural world. Progress in this field is generally slow and sporadic, though it still draws the attention of many due to the gravity of the question being investigated. A few facts give insight into the conditions in which life may have emerged, but the mechanisms by which non-life became life are still elusive.\n\nFor the observed evolution of life on earth, see the timeline of life.\n\nResearch into the origin of life is the modern incarnation of the ancient concept of abiogenesis. Abiogenesis, in its most general sense, is the generation of life from non-living matter. The term is primarily used in the context of biology and the origin of life. Abiogenesis was long considered to be a very common occurrence until the Law of Biogenesis (omne vivum ex ovo or ""all life from an egg"") became firmly established in modern biology as a result of the work of Louis Pasteur.\n\nCharles Darwin in a letter to J.D. Hooker of February 1st 1871, made the suggestion that life may have begun in a ""warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, lights, heat, electricity, etc. present, that a protein compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes, at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed."" Thus, it is the presence of life itself, operating in an oxygen rich atmosphere, itself a product of life, which prevents ""spontaneous generation"" from occurring on Earth today.\n\nThis modern definition of abiogenesis is concerned with the formation of the simplest forms of life from primordial chemicals, in an environment regarded as similar to that at the time shortly after the formation of the Earth. This is significantly different from the concept of Aristotelian abiogenesis, which postulated the formation of complex organisms. This article reviews different hypotheses for modern abiogenetic processes that are currently under debate.\n\nThere is no truly ""standard"" model of the origin of life, however most currently accepted models build in one way or another upon a number of discoveries concerning the origin of molecular and cellular components for life, which are listed in a rough order of postulated emergence:\n\nPlausible pre-biotic conditions result in the creation of certain basic small molecules (monomers) of life, such as amino acids. This was demonstrated in the Urey-Miller experiment by Stanley L. Miller and Harold C. Urey in 1953. \nPhospholipids (of an appropriate length) can spontaneously form lipid bilayers, one of the two basic components of a cell membrane. \nThe polymerization of nucleotides into random RNA molecules might have resulted in self-replicating ribozymes (RNA world hypothesis). \nSelection pressures for catalytic efficiency and diversity result in ribozymes which catalyse peptidyl transfer (hence formation of small proteins), since oligopeptides complex with RNA to form better catalysts. Thus the first ribosome is born, and protein synthesis becomes more prevalent. \nProteins outcompete ribozymes in catalytic ability, and therefore become the dominant biopolymer. Nucleic acids are restricted to predominantly genomic use. \nThe origin (see Origin of organic molecules) of the basic biomolecules, while not settled, is less controversial than the significance and order of steps 2 and 3. The basic inorganic chemicals from which life was formed are methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), water (H2O), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbon dioxide (CO2), and phosphate (PO43-). As of 2004, no one has yet synthesized a ""protocell"" using basic components which has the necessary properties of life (the so-called ""bottom-up-approach""). Without such a proof-of-principle, explanations have tended to be short on specifics"

"My question to you is where does it say that he does NOT do it in two trips. God sent his Son as a gift of salvation but if some don't accept this gift then why should they expect to reap the benefits of His gift. The Messiah is not coming back to ""Fix what he did wrong the first time"". The Messiah is coming back the second time to take all of us that have accepted his glorious gift back with him to spend eternity in Glory. And just so that you know, for those of us that have accepted this awesome gift, we do have peace. It is those that do not want to accept it that can't experience the peace that he brought the first time, but it is never too late to accept His gift and begin living with the peace and happiness that so many of us have! You're in my prayers."
I not only cotemplated, I tried suicide.  Trust me, it's a real eye opener.  I too found church boring, but when I really started studying the Word, I realized I was full of pride.  I wasn't bored with the word or church, I was bored with me.  You got to realize that you can't judge a church by a few people.

If you force someone to love you then can that compare to someone loving you with all their body, mind and words? So God is supremely merciful and all loving that he patiently gives and arranges opportunities for us to develope pure love for him. If we make mistakes, or are even averse to him, then like a loving father or mother will correct us and show us that what we are doing is wrong, and one day we will realize how God is supremely merciful upon us. Even if we have to go to hell for sometime, like a prisoner doing 'time', it is for the greater good - we will learn from our mistakes and it will bring us closer to our own happiness, and Gods happiness which is full of eterity, knowledge and bliss. \n\nGod who is very sad and unhappy to see his own near and dear loved ones seperate from himself, struggling with birth and death and so many miseries in this material world, but yet he wont interefere with your own free will, otherwise what would be the difference between us living beings and inert objects? \n\nSo actually real love comes from the heart and does not rise out of fear. Love arsing out of the fear that, 'after death I will go to hell and not heaven', is weak and enfeebled love - not pure sponateous love arsing from the absorbtion of the object of ones love. \n\nIf you are going to live with someone for the rest of eternity dont you want it to be out of love and not the fear that 'If i dont love this person he will send me to hell'?

In a given geographic region, the Stone Age normally predated the invention or spread of metalworking technology. Human groups in different parts of the world began using stone tools at different times and abandoned stone for metal tools at different times. Broadly speaking, however, the Stone Age began roughly 2.5 million years ago, ended in some parts of the world 5,000 years ago, and ended in other regions much more recently. Today only a few isolated human populations rely largely on stone for their technologies, and that reliance is rapidly vanishing with the introduction of tools from the modern industrialized world.\n\nHuman ancestors living before the Stone Age likely used objects as tools, a behavior that scientists find today among chimpanzees. Wild chimpanzees in Africa exhibit a range of tool-using behaviors. For example, they use bent twigs to fish for termites, chewed wads of leaves to soak up liquid, and branches and stones as hammers, anvils, missiles, or clubs. However, when prehistoric humans began to make stone tools they became dramatically distinct from the rest of the animal world. Although other animals may use stone objects as simple tools, the intentional modification of stone into tools, as well as using tools to make other tools, appear to be behaviors unique to humans. This stone toolmaking and tool-using behavior became central to the way early humans adapted to their environment and almost certainly had a profound effect on human evolution.\n\nArchaeologists believe the Stone Age began about 2.5 million years ago because that marks the age of the earliest stone tool remnants ever discovered. The earliest recognizable stone artifacts mark the beginnings of the archaeological record—that is, the sum total of material remnants of ancient human activities. As recently as 5,000 years ago all human societies on the face of the earth were essentially still living in the Stone Age. Therefore, over 99.8 percent of humans’ time as toolmakers—from 2.5 million years ago to 5,000 years ago—took place during the Stone Age. During the Stone Age our ancestors went through many different stages of biological and cultural evolution. It was long after our lineage became anatomically modern that we began to experiment with new innovations such as metallurgy, heralding the end of the Stone Age.\nII\nStudy of the Stone Age\n\nThe term Stone Age has been used since the early 1800s as a designation for an earlier, prehistoric stage of human culture, one in which stone rather than metal tools were used. By the early 1800s various archaeological sites had been found in Europe that contained mysterious items from evidently earlier, prehistoric times. Christian Thomsen, curator of the National Museum in Copenhagen, Denmark, developed a classification scheme to organize the museum’s growing collections into three successive technological stages in the human past: Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. This three-age classification was quickly adopted and spread not only among museums in Europe but also among excavators, who were able to identify Stone Age remnants that were found below Bronze Age remnants, which were in turn found below Iron Age remnants as they dug down through layers of deposits at their sites. The fact that Stone Age remnants were found at the bottom layers indicated that they were the oldest.\n\n\nThe study of the Stone Age falls under the fields of anthropolog
Friends,\n\nSpiritually, I am of Israel.  Spiritually, Abraham is my forefather.  I believe and know that God’s New Covenant brings Israel and the Gentiles together through the Messiah Jesus.  My testimony is very long…\n\nI was born as a result of a promise, that my Mother made to God.  She prayed saying that if God would give her a baby girl, she would bring her up, teaching her about him… and that she would be for his work.  And so, here I am.\n\nShe never told me of this promise, until I accepted Jesus.  And I do believe that the evil spirits, namely, Satan, heard of this promise concerning me… in the presence of the Lord… as in the case of Job.  For all of my life, I have been persecuted by peoples, and I have known many demon-possessed persons, who have tried to led me further astray, into Wicca, so forth.    Nevertheless, I was a rebellious person, and I did not trust in Jesus… until I was thirteen. \n\nAs a teenager I was restless in heart.  I find that I was fearful of true Christianity… fearful to put my trust in Jesus.  I wondered if Jesus were truly real… even if God was real… but if God were not real, I wondered… why did anything exist… why did I exist… as ‘complicated’ as I am… what was I to do… where would I go after death… in my mind I am so real… how could I only cease to exist after I died?\n\nWith horrifying thoughts plaguing me more and more… I could not sleep… my heart was so restless… with wondering about religions, views… and Jesus.  \n\nThis was how the nights were until one Sunday morning.  My parents and I went to a place where a Congregation gathered for worship.  At the end of the service… the Spirit of God began convicting me… showing me that I was a sinner… calling to me… to come and accept his sacrifice and be justified… calling me to be his Disciple.  I was afraid… afraid of the call… afraid of being persecuted… extremely fearful.  And I resisted.  \n\nOh, and the week was misery and restlessness.\n\nThe next Sunday, God who is full of mercy and compassion… convicted me again… calling me to him… and I being fearful… did not know what to do… how could I resist him?  He is so loving and full of compassion… and then was the temptation of the evil one (I didn’t know it was his minions to begin with)… “you don’t need to accept… the people will laugh… they will stare at you for accepting.”  But there was the first step… and afterward the temptation fled… I believed in my heart that Jesus was Lord… I confessed that Jesus is Lord… believing that God raised him from the dead.  \n\nAnd so, I was justified in the sight of God. \n\nBut, instead of continuing in my sanctification… I became lukewarm.  No one taught about God’s image… no one taught about knowing God personally… they only preached what they wanted to hear about the Gospel.  \n\nNevertheless, I became tired of the ignorance around me.  Mainly… tired of MY ignorance.  I began praying, searching for God… asking God “where are you,” “what are you like?”  and praying “Lord, I really want to know you, I want to know you as Father, Son, and Spirit, I want to KNOW you.”  My prayers were constantly before the Father and intense in emotion.  Because I wanted to know his living and active words, I wanted to hear him, I wanted to really know him.  I wanted him to ‘be’ my Wonderful Counselor.  My human father had died, and I wanted my HEAVENLY FATHER.\n\nI knew that if the Prophets and the Apostles heard God… I could too.  I knew that if the Holy Spirit poured out the love of God into the hearts of the early Christians… he could pour out his love into my heart. (Romans 5:5)\n\nI became more and more aware of the spiritual part of our world… and I became closer and closer to God, through Jesus my Messiah.  God began to be nigh because I wanted to be nigh to him.  God really does speak.  I can call out “Abba” and he has said “H

Yes and no. I can forgive people for things they've done to me, and they can do likewise. \n\nBut if you're asking whether humans can take away someone's guilt by forgiving them, then no. When we sin against someone, we also sin against God, because we're rebelling against the way He made us. So only God can forgive us and take away our guilt.\n\nIs this what you were asking? If not, let me know.

This was on discovery channel, incidentally, when I chanced upon your question.\n\nIn the past as cavemen, the Chinese people had discovered rice for quite a while, using various ways to cook rice or meat, such as hollow bamboo, mud, and leaves.\nWhen it was hot, they probably used sticks: two sticks like a pair of tongs to hold the packet or the bamboo together.\nSlowly, it evolved from sticks, to wood, and as the Chinese flourished into a civilisation, it was decorated with laquer, made from jade, carved from Ivory, and it's uses increased from just being a tool to pick up food, to being used in quick cooking like stir-frying, to picking scraps of food off the plates, to even cutting chunks of food at the table or in the wok through a skillful manipulation of the fingers and wrists.\nThis ubiquitous tool spread to Korea, Japan and to many parts of Asia where the Chinese migrated, and brought their culture along with them.

The worst for me was the way things were done.  College isn't high school and isn't done the same way.  It is a lot harder and takes some getting used to.  Also, you some times end up with assignments that are totally against what you believe and you have to do them or not pass.  In high school that isn't done.

I think the kind of christians he is refering to are those who are born in a country where christianity is the state relgion and you are automatically born as a christian like Finland etc. So there you will find many people who are regestered as christians but who are actually athiests or only visit the church when its for their own convenience or when there is some special function like christmas etc. Also these kinds of christians like to visit churches only on sunday to confess their sins because they feel guilty for all the shameful activities they have done during the past week.\n\nIn every religion you will find sincere followers and those who follow just for the sake of following. And because Christianity is the biggest world religion you find more of these kind of people. By percentage I cant say though...
"God says that he is a merciful God. To answer your question I would say ""NO"". God knows there are people out there who haven't heard of him. God sees every human's heart and mind and knows what kind of person they are. God reserves judgment unto himself. But another question is--what is hell? The Greek word Hades referrs to a hole in the ground where all man goes when he dies. The burning hell you are referring to is the Lake of Fire where those who have received God's judgment go. All mankind have to stand before God Almighty when it's their time. God opens the book of life and the rewards He has written in there are given to the people whose names are written in His book."
He has performed as many miracles as God or Jesus... and that would be zero.

It was the women who FIRST saw the risen Lord. Why? Because they were in the process of serving at the time--to annoint the body of the ""dead"".

Caps please.  The Holy Spirit is God's Spirit... a part of God's person.  When you are justified... Jesus’ Spirit comes and lives inside your heart.  Jesus’ Spirit is the Holy Spirit.  So, you have Jesus living in your heart, if you are saved.  The Holy Spirit is the Wonderful Counselor... he speaks God's Word to the Disciples.\n\n1CO 2:10 but God has revealed it to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.\n1CO 2:11 For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit within him? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.\n\nGod's Spirit is the part of the Person of God... who knows God's thoughts... that is why it is said... we (Christians) have the mind of Christ with us.\n\nBut... in order to know the Spirit of Jesus... you must be close to God... through praying... and seeking for him... in your heart.\n\nThe Spirit of Jesus is Person...  God's image is Father, Son, and Spirit.  And of course, the whole Person of God is real.

I also explained to her that there are too many busy bodies at church and they are there to check out outfits and jewelry and gosip.  I told her God is too busy for this nonesence so I choose to pray at home and always keep Jesus and God in my heart.

"This is a very emotional topic for me. I have read some of ur answers and questions and that is the reason why im responding to this. It may be a little long so please bare with me. I asked Jesus into my heart when I was 7 years old... I asked him into my heart cuz I was sick of watching my dad be mean to my mother... and my mother act as tho i was not supposed to be born. I was always told u will go to hell if u dont accept him. So that night I did.\nAs i was growing up I was raised in a home where my Father was a Christian (or claimed to be) and a Wiccan Mother. I was outcasted pretty much since the day I was born because I was not born a boy. Growing up I was beat, molested by my father and the pastor of my church then later in life after i had finished high school I was 14 years old and was gang raped and got pregnant. The guys that did it to me found out and beat me so bad that I was in a coma for 2 months and miscarried twins. I wanted so bad to have a child. I just wanted someone to love me without judging me. My whole life I saw my father drinking, doing drugs and cheating on my mother left n right. I always promised myself that I would be better then that. I pretty much raised myself since I was 10 years old cuz my family had no morals what so ever. I did the best that I could with very little to go on and NO adult role models to look at. When I was 15 years old I was told that I had Cancer. Now when I was born I was born with Tourettes syndrome and a hole in my heart and was not supposed to live past the age of 17 yrs old.    \nMy mother found out that I had cancer and with her being a doctor and having such great insurance she was told that I could have a surgery to have it removed so that it wouldnt become terminal but they would have to do it right away... My mother refused to do it. I have prayed to Jesus everyday since I was 12 years old that he take my life. Take me away from everything especially if no one loved me anyways and all i do is screw things up.I thought this was his way of finaly letting me have my wish.\nI continued to do as I was told. I worked 3 jobs, home schooled my brother, and volunteered at many places like the American Cancer foundation, AIDS Awareness, Retirement homes, Alzheimers Assoc. etc. just doing what i could to never be home and do what I could to help as many ppl as I could. I figured that the more ppl I helped and the happier I acted, the faster Jesus would let me die.\nI made it to the age of 17 when I met my husband. I had t6o get out of the house cuz i was being beat so bad and since i was done with High school I was working 3 jobs to support my fathers Drug/drinking habbit and home schooling my little brother as well.\nI had no choice. I married a man that I knew for 1 month. He was older, and my mother being a doctor and the kind of doctor that she is was treating me that if i didnt work and give them all the money and if i tried to ever go back to college (which I had done right after high school for a degree in Psychology till they made me stop to work) that she would have me thrown into a psych. unit and she would make it so that i could never get out and so i'd never see my little brother again. So anyways I married the first thing that came around. I was married to him for 6 years. He beat me and hurt me so bad. I never had sex with him cause of my past and he atleast respected me that much not to take it from me. I suffered depression by that time so bad that I had gained so much weight. It was so bad that I couldnt walk, i couldnt get up to go in the next room, i couldnt do anything.... except eat. I finaly told my husband that we were moving within 6 months. Either hes going with me or without me. I took those 6 months and I prayed so hard. ""Jesus either help me to fight this crap or help me to die plz""! Jesus Helped me walk! I started studing Property Management. I finished with flying colors so that when we moved I could get a job being the property m"

"Before I answer this question, I just want you to know I am not either religion, but my religion encompasses all religions (my beliefs come from studying all religions, so I believe in a lot of stuff from multiple religions including both Christianity and Muslem).\n\nMany people can't find God in the same way, so God has formed many religions, so that more people can find him and know how to treat others, ourselfs, and him.  \n\nIt's just like some people don't see Jesus Crist as the savior, that why he said, ""forgive them for they no not what they are doing"".  In my opinion he said that not because they were killing the son of God, but because they killed him for no just cause.\n\nLook at both religions and you will find simular teachings, just done in a different way."

We moved from a big city to a rural area about 8 years ago. I didn't expect that I would miss some of the things I miss about living in town. I guess I just didn't think much about them until they were gone. \n\nI miss the incredible library system to take my kids too that we used to have. We went every week and loved it! The lone libarary building in our county houses a mere 2% of what we used to have access to. They don't even interlibrary loan there. We have had to get an out of county card ($$$) to get access to a slightly larger library with interlibrary loan that we drive 120 miles round trip to access. Needless to say, long gone are the weekly library visits.\n\nI miss having businesses within a quick drive. Driving so far to get anywhere can really become tiresome when you live way out. It is about 60 miles round trip to the grocery store. Want to see a movie? The nearest theater is 120 miles round trip. Now that I have two kids in the church youth group, I find that the time I spend on the road has increased or I have to tell them no to some of the church events because of the 60 mile round trip drive.\n\nI worry about whether my children will be able to live nearby when they are grown because job oprtunities are few here.\n\nOK, now what do I love about the country. \n\nI love the wildlife moments. I love seeing deer come up and drink from the stream that cuts through our yard in front of our living room window. I love the experiences like hearing a noice on the front porch and stepping out to find yourself 4 feet away from a fox or an armidillo - right there on the porch with you! I love hearing and watching the hawks that perch on the kid's swingset in the rain as they watch for crayfish, snakes, lizards, rabbits, and mice that stir in the yard or the edge of the woods. I love the 8 month study of stream life we did two summers ago where we monitored our stream daily, caught tadpoles, minnows, and crayfish for study in our indoor tank before releasing them full grown to create the next generation of crayfish and frogs. I love being surrounded by woods and enjoying the cool of them on hot summer days.\n\nI love the people of the Southern countryside. On average they are so much more humble, friendly, and willing to love you than the average city dweller. A retired lady two doors down calls me darlin', and hun' and always says goodbye with 'I love you.'\n\nI love that we live in a 2000 sq. foot house with a nice big yard and it only cost $40K. We watched one of those home shows on PBS last week and our jaws dropped at the prices they said that moderate priced houses in DC go for. Yikes! How can anyone but the ultra rich ever survive there?\n\nOne warning about rural country life though, when you move to the country they pay you welcome visits even before 8 am in the morning. Not one, not two, but about twelve neighbors and church members paid visits in our first two weeks after moving in to our house all before 10am in the morning. Mornings in the country are an active time of the day.\n\nSo what do I prefer, country life or big city life? I guess after eight years in the country I must be adjusting pretty well now. I guess I will take the long drives to access the conveniences I once enjoyed mere miles and minutes away for the love of country neighbors, the wonder of God's creation, and a morgage that we can afford and still have a life after.
"Honey, that reverend has addressed himself properly unless he is the vampire hunter on Dark Shadows.  Then maybe he should name himself vampire hunter or something else.  I saw that entire discussion about him an hour ago.  While I find it all funny, I think Apostate was correct.  It IS in the dictionary and often it is better to change with the times.  As Apostate said before, it's a matter of a person's age, ridigity or flexibility, and openness to accept change.\n\nApostate said Catholics call their priest ""Father"" (as a sign of respect), so it is quite correct and acceptable when other Christians  address their ministers as ""Reverend"" on an INFORMAL basis.  In this 21st century, it IS NOW acceptable in the English language for certain Christians to use the word ""Reverend"" in an informal greeting, though it is used the way you state in a newspaper article.

"For the most part, because people are lazy. That's why you'll hear ""I just have to accept the Lord, Jesus into my heart and that's all I need"". Garbage like that, which they delude themselves into thinking is true, is simply their excuse for not doing what they need to be doing. You may also hear of their claims that they preach through their various car washes, bake sales, and etc...etc...they put on several times a year. It's more garbage. If anyone is claiming to be a Christian, then they MUST follow all of Jesus' commands for his Christian disciples, including that of preaching the good news of the kingdom from door-to-door and from town-to-town, wherever people are. \n\nIt's not simply a command that Jesus laid upon his followers, it's a Christian obligation to go out and preach about God's kingdom to other people.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses VOLUNTEER their time and effort to do just this very work, and as their annual reports show, their active 6.5 million members are putting in over 1 billion hours EACH YEAR to help others come to know the truth."

The expression has in origins in the medical profession. Doctors in Britain were not permitted to work on dead bodies until an Act of Parliament permitting them to do so was passed in 1832. Prior to this date the only bodies they could dissect for medical purposes were those of executed criminals. Although the execution of criminals was far from rare in 18th century Britain, it was very unlikely that a doctor would come across many corpses during his working life. It was therefore common practice for a doctor who had the good fortune to dissect the corpse of an executed criminal to keep the skeleton for research purposes. Public opinion would not permit doctors to keep skeletons on open view in their surgeries so they had to hide them. Even if they couldn’t actually see them, most people suspected that doctors kept skeletons somewhere and the most logical place was the cupboard. The expression has now moved on from its literal sense!
People with Down's syndrome probably do not all look alike to those who know them personally. There are, however, physical characteristics that they have in common. Down's syndrome is a genetic disorder that was established at the moment of conception. Normally, there are 23 pairs of chromosomes that make up the fertilized egg. One of each pair is from the sperm and the other from the egg. In Down's there is an extra chromosome 21. The medical term is trisomy 21. This is the usual reason for Down's syndrome. \n\nThe most obvious consequenses of having an extra chromosome 21 are an epicanthal fold around the eyes, short stature, dental deformaties, broad chest (that's why they seem to look alike) and mental retardation. The epicanthal fold about the eyes give them an Asiatic or Mongoloian appearance, hence, the older term mongoloid. \n\nAs in any group of people, those with Down's exhibit different personalities and varied abilities.

Mesopotamia was never a nation, it's a geographical area and was part of the ancient Persia. Persia included not only present-day Iran, but a vast area stretching from the Nile in the west to India in the east.\nLoads of info can be found on the net, of course.

Not only are they wrong, but at the core of the protests, the organizers are downright malicious in their intent.  This isn't about cartoons, it is about the rule of the mob vs. the rule of reason.  It is about people who want to destroy our rights as an individuals to live our lives in freedom and peace.  These people wish to control our thoughts and actions in the worst totalitarian way and like the cold war of the 20th century, this 'culture war' of the 21st century is all about good vs. evil.
HM KING CONSTANTINE     \n \n\nBorn: 2 June 1940 at Psychiko, Athens \nParents: Their Majesties King Paul and Queen Frederica of the Hellenes \nEducation: Anavryta High School, Athens\n3 Military Academies \nAthens University (Law)\n \nAccession: 6 March 1964 \nMarried: 18 September 1964, Athens,\nHRH Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark \nChildren: Alexia, b 10 July 1965\nPavlos, b 20 May 1967\nNikolaos, b 1 October 1969\nTheodora, b 9 June 1983\nPhilippos, b 26 April 1986\n \nInterests: Sailing - Olympic Gold Medallist 1960 (Dragon Class)\nPresident of Honour, International Sailing Federation\nHonorary Member of the International Olympic Committee\nPatron and Chairman of Round Square Association of Schools\nFounder The Hellenic College of London\n \n\n\n\n\nHM King Constantine, only son of King Paul I and Queen Frederica, was born on 2 June, 1940, at Villa Psychiko, Athens.\n\nSoon after his birth, the Royal Family left Athens and went to Crete where they were caught in the Nazi invasion. The family was under threat of capture by the German Army. So King George II instructed his brother Crown Prince Paul and his family to leave for Alexandria, while he stayed behind and fought throughout the Battle of Crete with the Greek, British, Australian and New Zealand Armies - eventually escaping across the mountains. \n\nFrom Alexandria, Prince Constantine's family moved to Capetown in South Africa, to live in the 'Grooteschuur House' of the South African Prime Minister, Jan Christian Smuts. King Constantine's first memories are of holding the hand of the South African leader and chasing a cow off a bed of tall flowers across the well-manicured lawns. \n\nHis younger sister, Princess Irene was born in South Africa on 11 May, 1942.\n\nThe Royal Family returned to Alexandria, where Constantine remembers talking fluent Arabic with those working for the family. \n\nAfter World War II, Greece was in turmoil. In 1946, after a General Election, a Referendum was held and King George II and the family returned. \n\nKing George II died in 1947 and Constantine's father, King Paul I, ascended the throne. As Crown Prince, Constantine attended the funeral of his Uncle King George II, holding his father's hand in the procession.\n\nFrom 1949, Crown Prince Constantine attended Anavryta High School in Athens - a school based on the educational principles of Professor Kurt Hahn and modelled on Hahn's own creation, Salem School in Germany (like Gordonstoun in Scotland). \n\nKing Constantine says that he loved the camaraderie of boarding school, and associating with other children - most of whom have become lifelong friends. His class (now bankers, businessmen, professors and doctors) meets for a reunion every year. He was good at sport (hockey, volleyball, high jump) and became Head Boy. He acted in school plays, and remembers playing Mark Anthony in Shakespeare's 'Julius Caesar' (he can still quote large sections of the play). \n\nDuring his time at the school, he had military training every weekend and, after school, attended the three military academies - the army, navy and air force. On his 18th birthday, as the only son of his parents, he took an oath of allegiance in each of the armed forces.\n\nIn 1960, he became the first Greek to win an Olympic Gold Medal since 1912. He achieved this in Sailing (Dragon Class) as helmsman on the 'Nereus' in the Bay of Naples. \n\nHis sister Sofia (now Queen of Spain) was a member of the substitute crew, but trained as intensively as her brother. On his return, he received a public welcome in Athens. \n\nIn 1960, Constantine went to Athens University to study Law. He also visited the USA to see military and industrial establishments. \n\nDuring these school years, he attended many State visits with King Paul and Queen Frederica - Italy, UK, West Germany, Lebanon, Ethiopia, India, Thailand. \n\nHe met World leaders, including President Tito of Yugoslavia - when he had an

An increase in minimum wage means that many people would loose their jobs.\n\nThe cost of continuing to employ the same number of people would increase when the minimum wage is increased in certain types of companies.  When the price of hiring more people (or keeping the ones you have) increases, your demand for those people goes down.  Many companies would hire less people, if not fire some that alread have.

Schneb called it right, Isaiah 14:12-15 tells how Lucifer became Satan.

maybe what rev. trask needs is a horn on his head, the guy is and idiot, i cannot imagine anyone wanting this person for their spiritual leader.\n\nDoes the Bible support the existence of unicorns, which are mentioned in some versions?\n\nThe King James, Douay, and other versions, mention unicorns. But that is not so with modern versions that accurately render the Hebrew.—Psalm 22:21; 29:6; 92:10 (21:22; 28:6; 91:11, Douay).\n\n“People once believed that the unicorn’s horn contained an antidote for poison, and during the Middle Ages, powders supposedly made from such horns sold for extremely high prices. Most scholars believe the image of the unicorn was derived from hearsay European accounts of the rhinoceros.” (The World Book Encyclopedia) Certain Assyrian and Babylonian monuments showed one-horned animals. These are now recognized as stags, ibex, cows, and bulls depicted from the side, a view that did not show both horns.\n\nTranslators were long uncertain as to what animal was meant. The Greek Septuagint rendered re´em´ with the sense ‘of one horn,’ or unicorn. The Latin Vulgate often translates it as “rhinoceros.” Other versions use ‘wild ox,’ ‘wild beasts,’ or ‘buffalo.’ Robert Young simply transliterates the Hebrew into English as “Reem,” basically leaving the reader in the dark.\n\nModern scholars, though, have eliminated much confusion over the re´em´. Lexicographers Ludwig Koehler and Walter Baumgartner show that it means “wild oxen,” with the scientific identification Bos primigenius. This is a “subfamily of the large horned ungulate family.” The New Encyclopædia Britannica explains:\n\n“Certain poetical passages of the Old Testament refer to a strong and splendid horned animal called re´em´. This word is translated ‘unicorn’ or ‘rhinoceros’ in many versions, but many modern translations prefer ‘wild ox’ (aurochs), which is the correct meaning of the Hebrew re´em´.”\n\nSince in current English “ox” has the sense of a castrated male, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures consistently and correctly renders re´em´ “wild bull.” The aurochs (wild ox, or bull) seems to have become extinct by the 17th century, but scientists have deduced that it was quite different from the unicorn of legend. The ancient aurochs had a body height of about six feet [1.8 m], and a length of some ten feet [3 m]. It might weigh 2,000 pounds [900 kg], and each of its two horns could be over 30 inches [75 cm] long.\n\nThis certainly accords with the Biblical mention of the re´em´, or wild bull. It was noted for its strength and intractable disposition (Job 39:10, 11) as well as its swiftness. (Numbers 23:22; 24:8) Evidently it had two horns, not one horn like the legendary unicorn. Moses referred to its horns when illustrating the two powerful tribes that would spring from Joseph’s two sons.—Deuteronomy 33:17.\n\nSo the Bible does not support the idea of unicorns as renowned in legend. It does draw an accurate, though limited, picture of the massive and fear-inspiring aurochs, or wild bull, that existed in Biblical times and down into the not-too-distant past.\n\nNO UNICORNS, PROBABLY NOAH WAS WAITING FOR THE TURTLES TO GET ON BOARD

I bet he takes you for granted in other areas, right??  I bet you are the one that is holding up the relationship.  I bet this is not the first time he dissed you.  Hope for the best -- expect a big surprise -- but also be ready to kick him to the curb!  Respect youself or he never will.
"The very first thing to do would be to controll the people that claim to represent Islam. As long as any group is perceived to be violent, racist, and criminal because of the people that represent it, other people will continue to see it that way. You can't burn down a man's house, and rape his daughter, kidnap his wife and torture his son on T.V. and expect people to understand your ""good side"" Your religion as a whole needs to excomunicate the criminal faction, and refuse to allow them to call themselves followers of the true islam. Seperate yourselves from hatred and violence! That is the only way to swing public opinion to your side."
MATTHIAS\n\nThe disciple selected by lot to replace Judas Iscariot as an apostle. After Jesus’ ascension to heaven, Peter, noting that not only had the psalmist David foretold Judas’ deflection (Ps 41:9) but David had also written (Ps 109:8) “his office of oversight let someone else take,” proposed to the approximately 120 disciples gathered together that the vacancy of office be filled. Joseph Barsabbas and Matthias were put up for selection; after prayer, lots were cast, and Matthias was chosen. Occurring just a few days prior to the outpouring of holy spirit, this is the last instance reported in the Bible of the lots being resorted to in determining Jehovah’s choice in a matter.—Ac 1:15-26.\n\nAccording to Peter’s words (Ac 1:21, 22), Matthias had been a follower of Christ throughout Jesus’ three-and-a-half-year ministry, had been closely associated with the apostles, and was quite likely one of the 70 disciples or evangelists whom Jesus sent out to preach. (Lu 10:1) After his selection, he was “reckoned along with the eleven apostles” by the congregation (Ac 1:26), and when the book of Acts immediately thereafter speaks of “the apostles” or “the twelve,” Matthias was included.

Hey you cannot really argue against material gifts (i.e. flowers, chocolate, electronics, special clothing items, jewelry, watches, movie, dinner, etc.) – especially personalized stuff.    If you can afford it, give her as many as you can.   But remember the basic rule:  It’s usually better to give one really cool/classy gift than 2 or 3 “cheap” ones.   However, to stand out, make a real impression and go above and beyond the crowd you MUST give her an emotionally romantic gift too.    I leave it up to you to think what would be more appropriate in this case; after all, no one knows her as well as you do.    But if you want my opinion, I would suggest you hold her hands close to your heart, look deep into her pretty eyes and just say something to the effect like:  “I AM NUTS ABOUT YOU”.    A word of caution:  If you don’t really feel it do NOT say it (unless of course you are a darn good actor!)    By the way, I’m specifically using the word “NUTS” here since, at your still tender age of 17, saying phrases like I LOVE YOU in the above context might just come across as a bit too strong, intimidating and/or pretentious.
I can definitely sense that you will be finding your true love very soon.  That person may already be in your life.

"Early Christians. The roots of Mardi Gras, Easter, and Christmas celebrations can be traced back to ancient Roman celebrations. As the Christian religion was forming, it was easier to bring converts from other religions if the major celebrations were kept intact, but given new Christian meanings. It is clear from the Bible that the Nativity didn't happen in winter (lambs aren't born then nor do shepherds tend them in the fields). The Roman feast of Saturnalia which included decorating with evergreen boughs and giving presents in an effort to entice the sun to return for another year was transformed into a celebration of the birth of Christ. The Roman feast of Oestre in the springtime, a celebration of fertility that included rabbits and eggs, was transformed by the Christians into Easter. \n\nLent is a 40 day period of abstinence prior to Easter. As one last blow-out, a celebration was held prior to the beginning of Lent. As the Lenten festival devloped over the centuries, it spread from 12th Night (supposedly the night the Wise Men arrived at Nazareth, actually the 12th night after Christmas) and lasted until Fat Tuesday, the day before the 40 days of Lent began.\n\n""Mardi Gras"" is French for Fat Tuesday. The festival has had other names in other languages. It cemented in our culture due to a 1699 French explorer who landed at a point in Louisiana on Fat Tuesday and named the place Point du Mardi Gras in honor of the celebration taking place in his native country."
"Look to those who have glimpsed beyond this reality, the ones who have returned with a little more knowledge.  When this ""reality"" ends, you will see that it was just a dream."
The purpose of the Virgin Birth story in regards to Jesus was to give him a miracle birth like all the other dying/saving  man/gods of the ancient world. Many of them were born of a human mother and a god for a father. Even Hercules had a human mother, Elcmene, and Zeus for a father. Dionysus had Semele for his human mother and, again, Zeus for his father, and the death of Dionysus was seen by his follers as dying for their sins.\n\nWhat everyone forgets is that IF Jesus was born of a virgin, then he cannot trace his lineage back to King David, and he therefore could not have been the Messiah! Some might say that this was to prevent him from being a descendant of Jehoikim, Jeconiah, or Shealtiel whose descendants, like Joseph, were cursed and would preclude a descendant of them from being the Messiah. But you cant have your cake and eat it too. He cant get the benefit from being a descendant of David through Joseph, without the curse that comes from being a descendant of those three, if he is to claim being from the House of David through Joseph.\n\nFurthermore, the Bible makes it clear that the Real Messiah is not adopted into the Davidic Line, but must be a direct bloodline descendant through his own human father back to King David, through Solomon.\n\nAnd if one were to actually pick up the Bible and read it, one would see that every single genealogy in the Bible traces the lineage through the father. If a mother is mentioned it is because she was famous, but the lineage still goes through her husband and not her. This is also true in the Christians' New Testament, where both Matthew and Luke trace Jesus's lineage through the males. This means that even if Mary was a descendant of King David, it would not matter because one's lineage is traced through one's father, not one's mother.

Love is not something that can be owned.. its unquantifiable and unexplained... its selfless and forever giving.... love is something within all of us... in whichever context we try to interpert it in...;)... do we own ourselves or can someone ever own us..? ... its a multitude of emotions and feelings not limited or bounded by human constraints...;)...its the key to our inner spirit that cannot be captured or sold...
I think it is because People tend to become accustomed to a particular style of living, regardless of their level of income.  For those who are making less than that same level, they are comparing two different frames of reference.  It is easier for others to see it as 'unappreciated' while the person with that level of income may just see it as 'commonplace'.\n\nIt is almost like moving from a minimum-wage paying job to one that may pay 25k - 30k a year.  You will find yourself most likely spending your money to buy more items that you like, while those making minimum wage will have less.  You may become accustomed to those things and may not be as occupied with them, while others do not have them.  This may soon lead them to think that you do not appreciate the things that you have.\n\nPeople do tend to appreciate the things that they worked hard to attain, even if their attitude may suggest that they do not.  It is just that their lifestyle is in a different frame of reference.

Shrove Tuesday is the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday which is the first day of Lent. It's a day of penitence, to clean the soul, and a day of celebration as the last chance to feast before Lent begins.\n\nShrove Tuesday is probably the Christian festival that the family enjoys most, after Christmas, of course.\n\nBut there's more to Shrove Tuesday than pigging out on pancakes or taking part in a public pancake race. The pancakes themselves are part of an ancient custom with deeply religious roots. \n\nPenitence \nShrove Tuesday gets its name from the ritual of shriving that Christians used to undergo in the past. In shriving, a person confesses their sins and receives absolution for them.\n\nWhen a person receives absolution for their sins, they are forgiven for them and released from the guilt and pain that they have caused them.\n\nIn the Catholic or Orthodox context, the absolution is pronounced by a priest. \n\nThis tradition is very old. Over 1000 years ago a monk wrote in the Anglo-Saxon Ecclesiastical Institutes: \n\nIn the week immediately before Lent everyone shall go to his confessor and confess his deeds and the confessor shall so shrive him.\n\nShrove Tuesday celebrations \nShrove Tuesday is a day of celebration as well as penitence, because it's the last day before Lent. \n\nLent is a time of abstinence, of giving things up. So Shrove Tuesday is the last chance to indulge yourself, and to use up the foods that aren't allowed in Lent.\n\nGiving up foods: but not wasting them \nIn the old days there were many foods that observant Christians would not eat during Lent: foods such as meat and fish, fats, eggs, and milky foods.\n\nSo that no food was wasted, families would have a feast on the shriving Tuesday, and eat up all the foods that wouldn't last the forty days of Lent without going off.\n\nThe need to eat up the fats gave rise to the French name Mardi Gras; meaning fat tuesday. Pancakes became associated with Shrove Tuesday as they were a dish that could use up all the eggs, fats and milk in the house with just the addition of flour.\n\nThe origin of pancake racing \nPancake races are thought to have begun in 1445. A woman had lost track of the time on Shrove Tuesday, and was busy cooking pancakes in her kitchen.\n\nSuddenly she heard the church bell ringing to call the faithful to church for confession. The woman raced out of her house and ran all the way to church; still holding her frying pan and wearing her apron.\n\n\nGoing for gold in the pancake olympics \nOne of the most famous pancake races is held at Olney in Buckinghamshire over a 415 yard course. The rules are strict; contestants have to toss their pancake at both the start and the finish, as well as wearing an apron and a scarf. The race is followed by a church service.\n\nSince 1950 Olney has competed with Liberal in Kansas, which holds an identical race, to see which town can produce the fastest competitor. After the 2000 race, Liberal was leading with 26 wins to Olney's 24.
"Hard to generalize about plastic surgeons -- ""who"" is best qualified, and ""who"" isn't !  A little bit probably wouldn't hurt someone with self-esteem issues, as many people with large noses, big stomachs, protruding chins and lopsided breasts STILL MANAGE TO GO THROUGH LIFE without going under the knife.  But, as shown on some of these ""investigative"" TV SHOWS, many people (especially women, who constitute the majority of candidates for surgery) tend to get ""addicted"" to the whole false idea of ""perfection"" through surgery.  Especially models, actresses, and just plain ""vain"" types (who actually aren't vain, again (in my opinion) just ""low self-esteem"" masquerading as ""beauty improvements"".  Why else do so many female candidates ""buy into"" this whole ""beauty myth"" trip ?"
My guess is some people are just rude by nature.  Others may just be pretentious and think people want to listen to what they have to say.

Never, would you like it if your hubby had an affair?
No. As a rule, it shouldn't but there are conditions that can make it a painful experience. You should talk to your doctor about this. No one here can give you a full answer like he/she can. Check this site to see if your symptoms are listed anywhere. This will help you have an informed conversation with your doctor about the pain.
I spend about $20 a week, but I'm not claiming to be average.  Let's see what everyone else says.
Nope but I bet it would be hilarious. I am a woman myself and I agree that women are the worst drivers. I'm sure the chase wouldn't last long, she'd prolly still be puttin lip gloss on so she'd look cute when they finally caught her. LOL
It depends - do you cook? or are you wanting to go out? Out - my pick is Simply Fondue.  It's romantic with the high back booths for privacy, and cooking and eating out of the same pot leads to feeding each other, etc.  Cooking - I always go for steak - it always pleases a man - with a Bernaise sauce, and maybe a little seafood (in the sauce or on the side).  Finish with a chocolate dessert like a Chocolate Lava Cake with vanilla sauce or ice cream. There are plenty of cooking websites that can give you great recipes.

It would be about the Prodigal son. It would contain a verse about his loving, forgiving father and his unforgiving, self-righteous older brother. \n\n     It would explain how he was happy to suffer the consequences of having squandered his life and wealth because he knew he deserved those consequences, but he was HOME and forgiven.\n     \n     When people sang it they would see themselves as one of those two boys, be convicted, and seek God's face and ask for His mercy.\n\n     Then...........they would find the same peace I have found when I did.

"The first interpretation has this celebration originating as a pagan tradition in the third century. During this time hordes of hungry wolves roamed outside of Rome where shepherds kept their flocks. The God Lupercus, was said to watch over the shepherds and their flocks and keep them from the wolves. Every February the Romans celebrated a feast called Lupercalia to honor Lupercus so that no harm would come to the shepherds and their flocks. Also during Lupercalia, but in honor of the goddess Juno Februata, the names of young women were put into a box and names were drawn by lot. The boys and girls who were matched would be considered partners for the year, which began in March. This celebration continued long after wolves were a problem to Rome.\n\nAs Christianity became prevalent, priests attempted to replace old heathen practices. To Christianize the ancient pagan celebration of the Feast of Lubercus, the church officials changed the name to St. Valentine's Day. To give the celebration further meaning and eliminate pagan traditions, priests substituted the drawing of Saints names for the names of the girls. On St. Valentine's Day the priest placed saint's names into an urn or box. The young people then drew a name from the container. In the following year, the youth was supposed to emulate the life of the saint whose name he had drawn. \n\nBy the fourteenth century they reverted back to the use of girl's names. In the sixteenth century they once again tried to have saintly valentines but it was as unsuccessful as the first attempt.\n\nWhile it can't be proved historically, there were seven men named Valentine who were honored with feasts on February 14th. Of these men, two stories link incidents that could have given our present day meaning to St. Valentine's Day.\n\nOne of these men named Valentine was a priest during the reign of Emperor Claudius. Valentine was revered by the young and old, rich and poor, with people of all walks of life attending his services. At this time Emperor Claudius was heavily recruiting men to serve as soldiers for his wars without much success. The men preferred not to leave their wives, families and sweethearts to fight in foreign lands. Claudius became angry and declared that no more marriages could be performed and all engagements were cancelled.\n\nValentine thought this to be unfair and secretly married several couples. When Claudius found out, he threw Valentine in prison where he died. Friends of the priest retrieved his body and buried it in a churchyard in Rome.\n\nAnother version had St. Valentine jailed for helping Christians. While Valentine was in prison he cured a jailer's daughter of blindness. Claudius became enraged and had Valentine clubbed and beheaded on February 14, 269 A.D. \n\nYet another story claims that Valentine fell in love with the jailer's daughter and wrote her letters that were signed ""From your Valentine.""\n\nAll of the seven Valentines eventually evolved into one. In 496 Pope Gelasius declared the day in honor of St. Valentine. Through the centuries the Christian holiday became a time to exchange love messages and St. Valentine became the patron saint of lovers. Lovers' quarrels come under his jurisdiction and, naturally, he is the patron saint of engaged couples and of anyone wishing to marry. \n\n:-)"

"No, the verse is not wrong.  ""All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness"".\nMany individuals I've seen answering/asking questions are completely anti-God/anti-Christian, and therefore will answer negatively to any question about scripture.\nThe more appropriate question is, ""Why do those that only seek to mock the faith of others bother visiting the Religion & Spirituality section?""."
This expression often comes with 'strictly' - e.g. 'This plan is strictly for the birds' and it means that it is useless, worth nothing.

At one time, about 100 years ago, the mormon church advocated polygomy... that is having more than one wife.  The mormon church no longer condones that practice.  But, there are sects of the religion in the Western U.S. that still do practice polygamy.  However, it is important to understand that the church they associate with does not condone their actions.

"I know that I have written several responses to this question. However, I now have too many answers to sort through and find the ones I'm thinking of. (New features needed!)\n\nSo, I'll start from scratch.\n\nFirst of all, I resent being lumped in with ""assorted scoffers."" I believe that I have been nothing but curteous to the people of faith here. I openly deny their belief-system. They openly deny mine. That's fine. We have, however, engaged in some very respectful debate, much to the benefit (I hope) of both sides. I know that my beliefs have not changed, but my preconceptions about young-Earth Christians have been shattered by some of the people I have found here. I think that they are wrong, but I am thrilled to have the opportunity to debate with them without resorting to name-calling or rudeness.\n\nGranted, this requires an openness on both our parts. I think that their faith is ""wrong."" They think that my lack of faith is ""wrong."" This is where most people get hung up and debate can go no further. If someone disagreeing with you is ""offensive,"" you're stuck. Once you accept this disagreement, you are quite free to exchange ideas. This is what I have found here (for the most part.)\n\nAs for why I spend so much time in the religion and spirituality forum, I see faith as playing a huge role in the lives of everyone in the world, be they moderate Muslims, fundamentalist Christians, Pagans, or Atheists like myself.\n\nIn my supposedly free country I see gays discriminated against due to faith. People who would never think of using the N-word openly hate and criticize homosexuals for what they are, not who they are. \n\nI see medical advances that could help millions of people stymied by arguments that have their basis in faith. Stem cell research could potentially ease the suffering of billions around the globe, but people of faith stand in the way.\n\nWe are currently involved in what may or may not be a holy war. This is an issue of faith.\n\nOur current government supports ""faith-based initiatives"" in what may be a breach of The Constitution itself.\n\nI know that faith helps people sleep at night. This doesn't undo the tremendous amount of suffering it has inflicted at every turn of history. \n\nI see faith as a problem, and would like to encourage people to put aside their myths and embrace reason. However, I realize that this is futile. As Jonathan Swift said, ""It is useless to attempt to reason a man out of a thing he was never reasoned into.""\n\nThat said, I think that Yahoo Answers provides a wonderful opportunity to try to see where other people are coming from. I disagree with the Christians (and Muslims and Pagans...), but I think it is very important for me to try to understand them. I would hope that they will try to understand me. Once we find some common ground and some mutual respect, we can truly start to talk about things.\n\nI hate the name-calling. The largest problem I have with religion is that it is divisive. I feel that this is the most important aspect of faith that needs to be removed from the equation. Name-calling is also divisive and does not fit into my attempts to act reasonably.\n\nI feel that I deny, but do not scoff. I embrace and enjoy open debate. I think that the things discussed here are important. I'd like to think that some of the things I have to say are pertinent. \n\nIf you want a place for only Christians (for example) to exchange ideas, there are plenty of places on the web for that. However, I think that this exclusion of other mindsets and worldviews does a disservice to those who would seek such a closed system.\n\nThat's why, as an atheist, I show up on the religion thread."
"Practice makes perfect :) If you want to be a people person practice at it \n\nThe thing that made me a people person is getting out and working with the public and socializing. \n\nYou learn to understand and respect others. \nLearn to treat people the way you expect to be treated. \nLearn to say ""good morning, afternoon, evening or night to a stranger passing by. You would be amazed at how much people like that. :)\nTell the person that waits on you at the store or restaurant thankyou and have a good day. \n\nstrike a conversation with someone who you may end up sitting by on a bus or airplane(if you ever travel)\n\nBe pleasant. \nDon't be shy (if you are) get out there and socialize and make friends. Often times in social settings, you have to make yourself known by walking up and talking to people. :)"
I agree with Overlyfriend, your supposes to love your enemies, pray for those who despitefuly use you. Return good for evil. And by the way, the Bible says that if you call ANYONE a fool, you are in danger of hell fire. So what we really should do is pray for them.

"yea i know what you mean about being baptized...i'm also catholic =P...uhh well i don't know the customs of other christian branches but catholics have a set of symbolic ceremonies. well im guessing you know wat the ""original"" sin was...the whole adam and eve thing...the ceremony is just symbolic for washing away that sin and joining the catholic church...there's like ""first communion"" and finally your ""confirmation"" into the catholic faith...as i said alot of ceremonies. it's just the many ways to verify your faith throughout your life and accepting God. i think its understandable that you feel you're denouncing your previous faith but you shouldn't feel that way though. i don't know what you're going through because i was born into it but maybe if you become more involved in the church you'll feel a better connection with God. besides thats all that matters right? your connection with God? there's no shame in being baptised at 24 =). having the same religion as your husband will probobly be nice for when you have children you know...cuz then you would be going to church together. i know alot of people who don't share their spouse's religion and their children are a bit lost and usually don't believe in anything at all. well good luck!"
approx, two thousand years, and my evidence is the gospel that narrates the passion and death of our lord Jesus Christ.
God created us to be ourselves.  What we are, the choices we make, the ways we grow and change and experience life are all part of who we are.  God doesn't want robots.  The thing that he does want is for us to know Him.  When we know Him, we will make different types of choices, grow and change in different ways, and experience life differently.  And it will all be in the context of who we are in relation to who God is.

Hi, i am a muslim girl and thank you for respecting my religion. you see, in Islam we have the right to choose. Those who cover their whole face probably doesnt want their face to be seen. Mostly they wear this as their desire,but some wear because maybe their family are very strict and demand that they wear it.me, i dont cover my face but i do cover my hair.we cover these specified parts of our body for a reason.our(woman) body parts are consider precious and should not be seen by men,if they do, its a sin to both the woman and also the man.But the main part that should be cover are the whole body except hands,feet,and face.so those who covers face are consider better.men also have to cover their body parts but they are not as strict as the woman.however there are some that doesnt follow these rules.

An unconventional lifestyle, you say?  Well, whose to say?  Unconventional to society as a whole?  To a religious group?  In general, one can argue that all lifestyles can be classified as unconventional.\n\nSociety tends to hold the idea of an unconventional lifestyle as one that is separated from society.  Loving art, nature, etc. more that wealth, success, etc. is a good example.  For Bohemians, they rejected private property and materialism by having no permanent residence anywhere and by surviving on little material wealth. They also rejected strict moral values by living carefree lives of alcohol and drug use, as well as open sexual freedom. \nThey rejected the pursuit of wealth by living solely for art and literature's sake, pursuing their passions regardless of whether they gained an income, which they usually did not. \nTo most societies, this is an unconventional lifestyle.

Faith, as it is found in Christianity, is a cop out to really trying to understand the nature of the universe.  In Buddhism, the monks tell you not to take anything without evidence.  Why?  Because they are seeking the truth.  And, you do not find the truth by following things without evidence.  Spirituality, is developed when you discover a little more about the nature of our relationship to the infinite.

lack of love & care between the family members...
I am sorry you lost your father and you are right, your father's soul and spirit are still living. I think we cry when someone dies because we miss them so much right now. It is okay to cry when someone dies. I am sure the person who has died has cried when they have lost someone dear to them too. Crying is a way to begin healing from OUR loss. It is healthier to cry and let our feelings out. Of course, praying is a good way too. Again, I am sorry for your loss.

Jesus answered this by saying that if a man looks at a woman with lustful intent, he has already committed adultery with her in his heart. So it is a sin for man to engage in any activity which stirs up sexual thoughts about any woman to whom he is not married.\nSex is not at all dirty or evil - God invented the idea! and it is holy, pure and an incredible gift from God - to those who are married!\nGod put that limit on sexual relations for our own good - He is NOT just out to deprive single people!

THere are alot of varibles when it comes to men 30-35.  I however find, that no matter what the age, getting something hold meaning for the person is the best.  What are his interests?  If he is way into the outdoors, for example,  a book about all the best campsites around might be good.   If he is way into cars, then perhaps a subscription to a magazine about cars.  The key is haveing some knowlegde about what that person likes, and finding a gift that shows you know them, is better than something really expensive.\n\n\nOff hand, I would say that 30-35 year olds are pretty set in most of the things they are interested in.  Whats his favorite band?    Would he enjoy you cooking dinner for him.   MAybe work is stressful and a masssage would be a  good thing.
"dajjal is an evil figure in Islamic eschatology, who will appear before Yaum al-Qiyamah (Day of the Resurrection). He is highly similar to the Antichrist in Christianity.\nVarious hadith, or traditions, are preserved about the attributes of ad-Dajjal like the following:\n\n1.He will be physically misshapen, and have one eye. There will be skin covering the area where the other eye is supposed to be .\n2.He will deceive the faithful, teaching them that Heaven is Hell and vice versa. \n3.He will have the power to work miracles in order to mislead believers. \n4.He will try to put Man on God's throne. \n5.He will have the Arabic letters kaf, fa and ra (kafir) -meaning unbeliever- branded on his forehead. \n6.He will have the ability to revive the dead, and consequently claim to be God. \n7.Some traditions of Islam relate that he will appear at Isfahan, and that he will rally the Isfahan Jews and many women to his support.\nThe Prophet Muhammad asked his followers to recite the first and last ten verses of Chapter 'The Cave' as protection from the Dajjal. These verses deal with the beliefs and activities of the Christian nations. He also taught his followers to pray, ""O Allah! I seek refuge in Thee from the trial of the Dajjal."" He also said, There is no tribulation greater than that of the Dajjal from the creation of Adam to the day of resurrection.\nThe occurrence of the Dajjal will correspond with the appearance of the Imam Mahdi, who will rally the faithful on earth to oppose him. Eventually, Isa (the name of Jesus in Arabic) will return from Heaven and slay the Dajjal. According to many interpretations this will occur near The Gate of Ludd (ancient city of Lydda) [1]. This will be followed by a Golden Age for Islam (not to be confused with the separate Islamic Golden Age) in which there are only true believers and almost everyone converts to Islam. Eventually decline will set in and by the will of Allah the End will come for Man. This is similar to a retelling of the Christian apocalypse where the end comes with the return of Jesus and Judgment Day.\nHe is mentioned in Chapter 16 of ""The Arabian Nights"": ""Sinbad Voyage 1"" or ""First Voyage""\n\n""Also to while away the time of waiting I explored a little island named Cassel, which belonged to King Mihrage, and which was supposed to be inhabited by a spirit named Deggial. Indeed, the sailors assured me that often at night the playing of timbals could be heard upon it."""

"I have had and worn scaves amost of my life. Scarves were fashion until recently. This is what i found on a website noted in the sources section below.\n\n""a lost art...wearing headscarves...what today is sometimes called head wraps. Back in the 1950's, 60's, and early 70's, wearing headscarves was fashionable...even with teenage girls. So what happened? \n\nThree turns of fate...\n\nFirst, the Catholic Church stopped requiring that women cover their heads in church. Second, the carmakers stopped making convertibles (they make them again, but the damage is done). Finally (and worst of all), the Iranian takeover of the US Embassy (in Iran) in 1979. Headscarves were linked with religion again, but this time (in what Western countries perceived) in a negative way. Of course, there were changes in hairstyles and other factors, but these were the big three...particularly the last.  Of course, the September 11th attack and the war with Iraq has once again provided an unfair negative focus on headscarves.""\n\nIn the Western world (except for the Catholic Church) the scarf was a fashion accessory, not religious clothing."
The Tao Te Ching does not translate into live languages well.  The concepts are usually too foreign.  I do not know why you think that you need a Latin translation, but you will not find one online and I doubt that anyone who could perform this would do justice to the text.\nTranslation is not the changing of a work into the words of another language.  It is the transmitting of the concepts of the original into another language.  Latin does not have the words to do this adequately.
I'm lovin your questions !\n\nLOL... My dog doesn't need to talk to lie.. He does it by trying to hide his destructiveness. No kidding, he'll pull a towel off the wall, to cover a chewed up shoe... That's just one example..
to beleive that you would have to also beleive in reincarnation,who knows what happens when we die,only a dead person could tell you.and i have seen children who talk at a very early age some seem to have all the answeres.i refer to them as old souls,i think im not the only one who thinks this way.
so what if he's not cute? Does that matter? Beauty comes in all colors - maybe you don't find him cute outside but there's something cute about him that made you like him. If he is in a relationship, and he's happy in it, it isn't your right to destroy that just because you liked the guy. THat's selfish. You have to try put your feet into the shoes of the other girl. If he knows, then leave it that way. The choice is his - if he likes you, too, then it's his move - let him resolve his issues with his gf first. but if he doesn't, then it isn't proper that you disturb them.
Charles I\nAs king was unable to control foreign conflict and problems at home, and by 1640 was in heated arguments with Parliament. Both sides went to war in 1642, and Charles was defeated in 1645. He was beheaded in 1649.
Try advertising at local tack shops in the area, most will have bulletin boards or send out mailers. There is a PetSmart/State Line Tack in Ocala as well (State Line Tack is the horse supply portion of PetSmart). You could also try advertising in equestrian magazines such as Horse and Rider, Horse Illustrated, etc. Check the phone book for local stables and/or equestrian centers. Good luck!
Long ago, in our terms of time, those in political power were closely tied to those in religious power. (Still are).  Kings manipulated scriptural writings, twisting the words to make God seem frightening.  What better way to control people than to make them afraid of this dark deity who flies into fits of temper, and destroys people just for being people?

There isn't really hard evidence to suggest that it does affect our society in any tangible sense. There are studies which show that children who watch violent TV programs tend to show higher rates of violent behavior soon afterwards. But I don't believe there is anything to suggest that this is sustained over longer periods of time. Additionally, I'm not aware of any similar studies involving adults. It's been hypothesized that it could desensitize us to violence, thus making us more accepting of it. But, the opposite could also be true. Good question, but I'm afraid the jury's still out on that.
Oh church lady, you adorable sweet grandma, don't they have a law forbidding the taking of blood (can't take blood transfusion either); or maybe I'm mixing them up with someone else.  I am newly reborn and don't know much about things of a religious nature yet.  Before I found Jesus on Sunday night, I was a witch.  Yep, dear lady, a witch.  So don't faint.

Univision dates its origins to 1961, when KWEX began broadcasting to the Hispanic community in San Antonio, Texas. That station was part of the Spanish International Network (SIN), Univision's predecessor. It was owned by Telesistema Mexicano, Mexico's largest private broadcaster and the forerunner of Televisa.\n\nIn 1986, the Federal Communications Commission forced Televisa to sell SIN because of federal laws against foreign ownership of American TV stations. SIN was sold to Hallmark Cards and renamed Univision. Under Hallmark's ownership, about half of its programming was rebroadcasts of telenovelas and other programming from Televisa, and half was original programming produced in Miami. When Hallmark sold Univision in 1992, its present owners cut a third of the Miami staff and reverted to a schedule based mostly on Televisa programs. Henry Cisneros, a former U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development official under President Bill Clinton, became president of Univision.\n\nThe company's stock has been traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 1996; it became part of the S&P 500 in February 2001.\n\nIn 2002, Univision entered into a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Raycom Media to operate two television stations in Puerto Rico: WLII in Caguas and WSUR-TV in Ponce. At the time, WLII had a longtime LMA with another Puerto Rican station, WSTE, which Univision honored. Both WLII and WSUR-TV were sold to Univision in 2005.\n\nIn late 2004, a feud began between Univision's chairman, 78-year old Italian entertainment guru Jerrold Perechino, and the 32-year old head of Televisa, Emilio Azcarraga Jean. The dispute is about Univision's continual censoring of Televisa's programming, and failure to pay for transmission of Televisa prodcued sports and specials. The feud has intensified to the point where Televisa's most famous stars have been banned from appearing on any Univision-produced shows and specials. In addition, Televisa has also has filed a lawsuit against Univision for breach of contract.\n\nIn recent years, Univision has also lost several key on air personalities to Telemundo, including long time weekend news anchor Maria Antonieta Collins, and news anchor Maria Celeste Arraras.\n\nOn February 9, 2006 Univision Communications confirmed that it is putting itself up for sale. Rupert Murdoch, chairman of the News Corporation, has stated that his company is considering buying Univision. Other expected bidders are Time Warner, CBS, Walt Disney, Grupo Televisa of Mexico and several private equity firms. [1]
I have read that it is auspicious to have water ponds and slow-moving streams in the front of the home to collect beneficial chi.\n\nI know this may not be feasible for you, but I have read this from more than one source on feng shui.  \n\nThis is even more apparent to me because we have a pond in the backyard with a small circulating waterfall.  To me, it is a bit too close to the house and causes a bit of insecure feelings to build up.  Other than that, is is sometimes a very beautiful pond to see.  \n\nGood luck fellow feng shui enthusiest!
Listen to BBC as much as possible. And look out for the intonation of words! You know, the word 'intonation' can be 'divided' into two parts when you pronounce it, and it is marked with an ' (apostrophe) in the phonetic spelling. \n\nI cannot type phonetically here, but the word 'intonation' (for example) can be divided like this: \ninto'nation\n\nI think it's a very good idea to learn British English! I used to speak American English but my pronounciation was terrible and I wouldn't speak British English because I hated it at that time. I thought that American English hided my Hungarian accent but it didn't but accentuated it the more. So I switched to British English and it suits me very well and I think think that my pronounciation has improved a lot.\n\nOtherwise, I have noticed that certain nationalities are likely to speak American English better than BrE. For example the Portuguese and the Chinese excel with AmE but they are not that good with BrE. But Hungarians, Indians and Czechs get on with BrE much better than with AmE...\n\nAnd get an audio online dictionary!

I was in the so called true religion and I found out it was a major sham. Some people are so scared of being alone they can't face the fact that their religion and organization is NOT perfect. They shut their eyes and turn their heads and make up excuses cause they don't have the guts to see what is right in front of them! They need someone else to control everything they do and make all their choices for them. (Churchofjohnnycash couldn't have said it better) I got out, even though I was scared and I payed a big price, I lost my family and everyone I knew, but I couldn't be happier, I couldn't live a lie, could you? Who would want a family or friends that were nothing but a sham.

Be creative! Valentine's day is not like Christmas where you have to give actual presents, it's about showing your love for your significant other.\n\nHere are some ideas:\n\n- Visit a local art museum alone, learn about the works with romantic themes, and bring your wife/ girlfriend/ boyfriend/ husband back for a personal tour.\n\n- Go for a mystery ride to an unannounced destination. Keep your husband/ wife/ girlfriend/ boyfriend guessing until you arrive at a favorite beach, ice cream palour, restaurant, theater, sport game, coffee shop, or ice skating/ roller skating rink, etc.\n\nDon't spend a ton of money. Hope this helps you. Have fun!

"well, without knowing you, i'd say it's because you're a wee bit boring. if that can be considered as having something ""wrong"" with you, then sure. but you're not unusual--lots of people don't know what to do with themselves when they have extra time. \n\nif i were you, i'd decide what you're going to do (that's different) the next time you have free time. and then really do it."

Because they are Liberals first, before they are Jewish!\n\nBy this i mean that their values are not Jewish values.

If you're looking for a system that believes in possibility or the impossible, or belives that what often gets called ""supernatural"" is perfectly natural, then it might be right for you.  \n\nYou can get into it by reading some books, visiting some websites, and most importantly enough, finding Wiccans or Neo-pagans in your area to connect with."

It seems a necessary hypothesis to resolve the paradox of two different concepts.  On the one hand, we believe in a God who is good and plays fair.  On the other hand, we observe that some good people have rotten luck and some bad people have great luck.  Some people can resolve it by postulating a heavan and hell which will, somehow, even the score.  But hell sounds too final and awful for people who are only moderately on the negative side, and heavan too good for those only moderately on the positive side.  Some people solve that one by postulating some sort of custom-tailored heavan/hell idea.  To me, reincarnation is an easier answer.\n\nIf I believe in a God which is smarter and more subtle than all of us, I can believe in a chance for me to come back as a beautiful, intelligent and wealthy young lady.  That's the only way to make up for all the rotten luck I have suffered in the current incarnation!

I don't know exactly how much in money. but of course millions, but it is by time and by people donations, government spendings and organizations fund.   In addition, shiite consider that place is sacred and holy.  it is for them like Mecca for whole Muslims and many sunnis also respect it.  but the hardline sunnis such as Wahabites and Qaeda, those consider shrines as places for worshiping bodies and not God as they claim.  Wahabites (those who dominate Saudi Arabia and Many Al-Qaeda Members)  has long history of attacking and targetting such places.  in last 200 years, they destroyed several shrines in Saudi Arabia.  they also once attacked Iraq cities when the whole region was under Turkish rule (Ottomans).  and They made attrocities, \n\nAlso, this shrine value alot historically, it is ancient, and renewed several times, at least 100 years old for the golden doom, and for the shrine hundreds of years.  the tomb s for men died almost before 900 years. \n\nMany people died because of such attack after that.  however, it is not first attack on a shrine, in the beginning after the war of 2003, Al-Qaeda assasinated one shiite leader by a huge explosion in Shrine in Najaf which damaged the shrine hardly and killed more than 100 prayers.  and several attempts done against another shrines.   in Iran, once also shrine in Mash-had attacked by such extremist, although Iran blamed the communist opposition.\n\nThe goal behind such attacks is to make civil war, and it is launched at least at first place by those foriengers, fanatic Islamists and Arabists who came across border to commit their plans in driving US out, so they can establish an Islamic empire that can conquer the world and spread Islam.
Since you're Pinoy and I'm American, I don't know how much I'm going to be able to help you on this one. America's cheaper than Japan for a lot of things. Japan still has the Gaijin thing going on, but America's got a real xenophobic vibe at present, too. Japan's a great place to experience. If you're sure you have enough to cover food and lodging the whole time you're there, you'd really enjoy it. America's so much bigger. I guess if you were talking about living forever, might think about the US since there's much more room.

"Too many people try to place their own values on others. Unfortunately, some people don't know how to be Christian and tolerant of ideas and values that are different from their own. It's one of the problems that I have with the lack of Christianity in the ""religeous right"" today. \n\nFirst of all, don't place your value of yourself on the opinions of others. You will find a lot of people that are so sure they are right that they are not able to be open minded. They can only see things in their reality, and they will use the Bible or some other doctrine to justify their behavior, when in fact, the Bible has inconsistencies. \n\nYou are who you are, and that's OK. You don't have to justify who you are to anyone else. If you are kind and decent to other people and live a life of love, compassion, respect and tolerance for others, you are living a Christian life. The message of the Bible over and over and over is one of love. Love thy neighbor as thyself. God is love. The theme is repeated. Too many people just don't get it."

It has nothing to do with the bible. It's been proven that there was a man named Jesus, who did live at that time, and who was crucified. There are various historical records regarding this. Noone really disputes that Jesus existed. Jews, who do not recognize Jesus as the son of God, do not dispute that he existed, so it's unrelated to religion.  As a man, he most definitely existed. Christians believe that he is the son of God, and for that, the proof is in their faith, and the Bible, as a record of that faith.

It is not easy to start out with, but the more you stand for Jesus the easier it becomes.  You may want to just not say anything to start with, but with time, you will find that you will not be able to keep from saying something.  And most of all put yourself in Jesus' hands and He will put the words in your mouth.  Always depend on Jesus or you will foul up every time.  First you have to pray for the person, that the Holy Spirit will work to open that persons heart to what you share with them.  That's all that you can do.  From there the Holy Spirit will point that person to Jesus Christ.  We must realize that we ourselves can't save anyone, we just plant the seed.  You may never know if what you shared has any effect on that person, but just knowing that what you did was right thing will make you want to share with someone else.  The greatest feeling you will ever have is seeing someone come to Christ and realizing you planted the seed.  Knowing in your heart that this person will not spend eternity in hell.  If you would happen to see this shared testimony through and see the other person saved, don't get filled with pride.  Remember pride comes before a fall.  And also remember when you do share, don't talk down to them, be humble and just state whatever you feel that Jesus is leading you to say.  Don't get mad and lose you temper if they reject what you say, just knowing that you tried is what matters.

The wahhabis (sect of Islam) wear their trousers above their ankles. I am not sure why but I  think they believe thats how the prophet used to wear it.\n  Most muslims prefer to wear their trousers in a normal way with the end of the trouser NOT touching the earth but just above 1 cm from the floor.\n  Reason1: The floor is full of garbage and dirt and they dont want to dirty their clothes. Some things are considered unpure and thus they dont wan t it to touch their clothes like urine.\n\n  reason 2: Respect. There is more respect to a person dressed appropriately  and not like a hooligan dragging his pants everywhere and sweeping the floor with his trousers. \n \n  Reason 3: Because they were their trouser at the wasit line and not below the buttocks.\n\n  Reason 4: Its believed that Gays during the time of Prophet Lut (Lot) used to wear their clothes dragging it on the floor (like the trousers). So muslims dont want to do it that way.\n\n  Reason 5: Take the reason of gateway above mine. \n         Thank yoou Gateway.

It depends how long both of you been together.;I don't think you should her to move in with you intil you think you are ready to marry her because all it going to do is get you tried of seeing her face everyday. take your time and follow your heart , if you love that much why won't you just marry her then move in with her.It will make happy .listen to your heart.
chocolate. candy. or a kiss on the cheek. ;)
be yourself.\n\ndont be afraid getting embarrassed, it's ok
It's supposed to be bad luck to do so, however, IF there is a really good reason to open one, then I think it should be done. Example: DNA samples for court cases. As technology gets better, people are finding better clues to unsolved mysteries and murders by sampling DNA of the deceased. Also, some people who originally were convicted of murder who were actually innocent are given a chance to prove their cases, and find the real perpetrater.
"I've dealt with that whack job and let me tell you, she's on a frequency all her own. And I don't mean that in a good way, ok? She may be called ILOVEJESUS but Jesus, that's me, hates that loon. Ya know, there's a little known bylaw in Heaven that states a managing partner (that would be me, God, or the Holy Spirit) can veto an entrant into heaven if he can get 2 of 3 votes. And since I didn't tell Mom (that would be the Virgin Mary) about Dad's ""indiscretions"" when he and Jimmy Swaggert were heavy partiers back in the late 80's, the old man owes me a favor."
I would say that learning a new culture, language, way of life, are great things you'd get from participating in a foreign exchange program.  Also, the friends you'd make are wonderful too.
You're absolutely right.  Part of the problem is that many people are afraid of what they don't understand.  A different religion or belief, can't be comprehended.  They don't have any other resort but to make fun of it, belittle it and try to put it down.  Trying to make their own beliefs above the other one keeps them from ever having to expand past their own horizons.\n\nAside from being hurtful, the other downside is that they learn to look beyond themselves and simply never grow as a person or spiritually because they're never really challenged in their faith.  Without a challenege, how do you know how really faithful you are?  And people want the easy way out of everything.  It's human nature.\n\n**As a side note**\nI don't see how she's being hypocritical at all.  She's simply asking why people have to be mean and hurtful, not that people can't share their beliefs, or even have their beliefs about other people.  You didn't answer her question, you proved her point.
Written like this its has no meaning, it's not said like this.\nIt would have to be 'bonne terre' then it means ' good ground (in the meaning of earth, soil).

"First of all, congratulations! And also thank you for the points on the ""should I say yes"" question - I am happy for you!\n\nI thought about your question overnight, and I came up with a simple answer, although I don't know if it is applicable in your case.\n\nThe gift - a camera, film and an album.

any orginized religon is bullcrap
Absolutely positively not.  You're probably better off not messing up your head with what you're told in Church, but rather learn on your own.  You have access to the same exact book that all Christianity is based on and since there are well over 30,000 religions claiming to follow that book, all with different ideas, which one are you going to pick anyway? They do want you throwing money in the bowl though, so they might use the guilt thing to get you to join and stay with a particular church.

"Because we CAN!! hahahaha  Oh yeah, maybe you should put an age range on the ""older women"" you are referring to...you know, just to put a cap on the comments...good luck"
Ignore all those people. Christ's grace cannot be forced on anyone. It doesn't work that way. It is a free gift given of God by grace...freeeeeely given. All you need do as a Christian is plant a seed. If it gets watered, it will grow. \nSince prophets are the primary role in Muslim religion, and since they already believe in Jesus Christ to a point, I think the best approach would be to point out through proof of scripture the incredible amount of prophecies which were fulfilled in the lifetime of Jesus. Over 300!!!!!\nAccording to the law of composite probabilities, by Jesus fulfilling only 48 prophecies; He made a model that breaks down in mathematical terms something like this:\nMake one ball out of every atom in our galaxy. This is roughly 10 to the 66th power(10 with 66 zeroes behind it)!\nNow, reach in and randomly pick out the one atom that represents the probability of this happening in a random fashion!\nYeah! Start there. Then you can simply lead them to the living water by showing them, scripturally, the purpose of His love for us in His Word and how the Bible is, thus far, infallible in its fulfilling of ALL propchecies. In fact, it is the only book in the history of literature that bases its credibility solely on the premise that ALL things are the absolute truth and ALL prophecy will come to pass.
The Chinese have but one religion....MONEY....

"Hope this helps.\n\nProtestants often misunderstand the Catholic teaching on merit, thinking that Catholics believe that one must do good works to come to God and be saved. This is exactly the opposite of what the Church teaches. The Council of Trent stressed: ""[N]one of those things which precede justification, whether faith or works, merit the grace of justification; for if it is by grace, it is not now by works; otherwise, as the Apostle [Paul] says, grace is no more grace"" (Decree on Justification 8, citing Rom. 11:6). \n\nPaul tells us: ""For [God] will reward every man according to his works: to those who by perseverance in working good seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life. There will be . . . glory and honor and peace for every one who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek. For God shows no partiality"" (Rom. 2:6–11; cf. Gal. 6:6–10). \n\nIn the second century, the technical Latin term for ""merit"" was introduced as a synonym for the Greek word for ""reward."" Thus merit and reward are two sides of the same coin. \n\n\nThe Catholic Church teaches only Christ is capable of meriting in the strict sense—mere man cannot (Catechism of the Catholic Church 2007). The most merit humans can have is condign—when, under the impetus of God’s grace, they perform acts which please him and which he has promised to reward (Rom. 2:6–11, Gal. 6:6–10). Thus God’s grace and his promise form the foundation for all human merit (CCC 2008). \n\nVirtually all of this is agreed to by Protestants, who recognize that, under the impetus of God’s grace, Christians do perform acts which are pleasing to God and which God has promised to reward, meaning that they fit the definition of merit. When faced with this, Protestants are forced to admit the truth of the Catholic position—although, contrary to Paul’s command (2 Tim. 2:14), they may still dispute the terminology. \n\nThus the Lutheran Book of Concord admits: ""We are not putting forward an empty quibble about the term ‘reward.’ . . . We grant that eternal life is a reward because it is something that is owed—not because of our merits [in the strict sense] but because of the promise [of God]. We have shown above that justification is strictly a gift of God; it is a thing promised. To this gift the promise of eternal life has been added"" (p. 162). \n\nThe following passages illustrate what the Church Fathers had to say on the relationship between merit and grace. \n\n  \nIgnatius of Antioch\n\n\n\n""Be pleasing to him whose soldiers you are, and whose pay you receive. May none of you be found to be a deserter. Let your baptism be your armament, your faith your helmet, your love your spear, your endurance your full suit of armor. Let your works be as your deposited withholdings, so that you may receive the back-pay which has accrued to you"" (Letter to Polycarp 6:2 [A.D. 110]). \n\n  \nJustin Martyr\n\n\n\n""We have learned from the prophets and we hold it as true that punishments and chastisements and good rewards are distributed according to the merit of each man’s actions. Were this not the case, and were all things to happen according to the decree of fate, there would be nothing at all in our power. If fate decrees that this man is to be good and that one wicked, then neither is the former to be praised nor the latter to be blamed"" (First Apology 43 [A.D. 151]). \n\n  \nTatian the Syrian\n\n\n\n""[T]he wicked man is justly punished, having become depraved of himself; and the just man is worthy of praise for his honest deeds, since it was in his free choice that he did not transgress the will of God"" (Address to the Greeks 7 [A.D. 170]). \n\n  \nAthenagoras\n\n\n\n""And we shall make no mistake in saying, that the [goal] of an intelligent life and rational judgment, is to be occupied uninterruptedly with those objects to which the natural reason is chiefly "
"THE HISTORIES\nCornelius Tacitus, \nRoman Historian, 55-A.D\n\n""Some say that the Israelites  were fugitives from the island of Crete, who settled on the nearest coast of Africa about the time when Saturn was driven from his throne by the power of Jupiter. Others assert that in the reign of Isis the overflowing population of Egypt, led by Hierosolymus and Judas, discharged itself into the neighboring countries. Many, again, say that they were a race of Ethiopian origin, who in the time of king Cepheus were driven by fear and hatred of their neighbors to seek a new dwelling-place."" \n\n   The Muslims said ""they were living in great number to the south of the desert - a people cursed of God and predestines as slaves."" The Muslims also called the western Sudan (West Africa) ""Yahoodee"" which means ""The Tribes of Israel"".  \n      In another article By George E. Lichtblau entitled  \n""Jewish Roots in Africa"", he gives a details about the Hebrews in west Africa. \n\n""Claims of a historic presence of Jewish communities in certain regions of Africa, notably West and Southern Africa, seem esoteric when first mentioned.

Because Christians are the most intolerant religious group there is.  If someone mentions Alah, Arab, or Muslem to you, how do you feel towards them?
believe what you want to beleive, but there is only one truth and that is that no one knows anything. no one. not the scientist who believes in the big bang. not the monk who has studied the bible relentlessly his entire life. and certainly not you. all these beliefs take a certain leap of faith and it is only right for you to respect them all. we'll find out in the end anyway. just hope that your right. good luck!

There are several things you can do. Lobby for more strict domestic violence legislation. Raise money for, and open, a battered women's shelter.

I think if we knew the actual number all responsible parents/guardians would want to put their children under constant surveillance. A personal friend works undercover for a State Law Enforcement team devoted to internet crime and said he is both sickened and appalled at the sheer volume and perversions against minors that have surfaced in our small area alone. \n\nThe internet contributes to an enormous increase because these perverts can cruise for victims from the comfort of their home. I hope all people..children and adults as well.. can be warned that these predators are skilled at picking out just the right comments to gain trust with the sole purpose of finding a gullible victim. \n\nThere is software that can monitor/filter activity on computers. To me it is a responsibility of every parent/guardian to know who your children are talking to and what they are viewing online. These children may not talk to strangers on the street, but who are they talking to online in their bedrooms?
General Murtala Ramat Mohammed (November 8, 1938–February 13, 1976) was a military ruler (Head of the Federal Military Government) of Nigeria (1975–1976).\n\nMohammed opposed the regime of Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi which took power after a coup d'etat on January 15, 1966, and he was a leader of the successful counter-coup of July 29, 1966. Mohammed led the crucial seizure of the airport at Ikeja, which was later renamed the Murtala Mohammed International Airport in his honor. He at first intended to use the coup as a step towards the secession of northern Nigeria, but later dropped this demand.
I would feel happy as I wouldn't have to go out and buy something for sombody that they really didn't want anyway.
the best gifts always come from the heart. you can make things cook a nice candle light dinner for two or if you have kids let them join also. i always try to give my husband something special we are always broke and dont have the money to spend on things i just make him a card cook his favorite dinner and we watch a movie together. as long as it comes from the heart he/she should love it. you dont always have to buy material things make something special just for him/her. love isnt about what you buy for you special someone its about how you feel about that special person.
Jesus suffered and died for us we are to take others burdens and pray with them and i feel it does help keep us humble.  God Bless!!

"When one complies with the counsel of God's Word regarding spiritism, you spurn the bait of the demons. (Compare Psalm 141:9,10; Romans 12:9.) Does this mean that wicked spirits will stop trying to capture you? By no means! After tempting Jesus three times, Satan (the chief of the demons) ""retired from him until another convenient time.""\nLuke 4:13) Similarly, obstinate spirits not only ATTRACT people but also ATTACK them.\n\n\nRecall Satan's attack on God's servant Job.  The Devil caused the loss of his livestock and the death of most of his servants.  Satan even killed Job's children. Next, he struck Job himself with a painful disease.  But Job kept his integrity to God and was greatly blessed.  (Job 1:7-19; chap. 2:7,8 & chap 42:12) Since then, the demons have made some people speechless or blind and have continued to revel in the suffering of humans.  (Matthew 9:32,33; 12:22; Mark 5:2-5) Today, reports show that demons sexually harass some and drive others to insanity.  They incite still others to murder and suicide, which are sins against God. (Deuteronomy 5:17; 1 John 3:15) Nonetheless, thousands of people once ensnared by these wicked spirits have been able to break free.  How has this been possible for them? They have done so by taking these vital steps. Even  if you have not practiced spiritism , get rid of anytghing having spiritistic uses or overtones.  This includes books, magazines, videos, posters, musical recordings and objects used for spiritistic purposes. Also included are idols, amulets and other items worn for protection and gifts received from practicers of spiritism. (Deuteronomy 78:25,26; 1 Corinthians 10:21). We can be successful in our spiritual warfare against the Devil and the demons under his direction.  There is no reason to quake in fear of Satan, for the disciple James wrote: ""SUBJECT YUOURSELVES...TO GOD; BUT OPPOSE THE DEVIL, AND HE WILL FLEE FROM YOU.""  James 4:7. So go on the offensive in opposing Satan by having nothing to do with occult or magical practices and those indulging in them.  \nThe Scriptures clearly show that servants of God must refuse to look for omens or to engage in astrology (horoscrope reading included) divination, etc.  If we are spiritually active and strong in true worship we need not be afraid that someone will cast a spell on us.  Numbers 23:23; Deuteronomy 18:10-12; Isaiah 47:12-15; Acts 19:18-20. \n\nFirst century Christians in Ephesis who had practiced spiritism before becoming believers took positive steps.  We read that ""quite a number of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them up before everybody."" (Acts 19:19)\n\nWe know that the Devil fled when Jesus resisted his attack by using the Scriptures during the temptation in the wilderness. (Matthew 4:4,7,10, 11. Putting on the complete suit of God-given spiritual armor makes a difference."

if it didnt exist I probably wouldnt think much of 'spirituality' at all. my belief in God did not stem from any written word. rather, it is in the existence of mathematics that got me started on my 'quest' for answers. for something as common as 'photosynthesis', a truly remarkable process takes place. a process that has already been calculated. so who put this equation in place for us to find. I believe God did. the construction of the earth, the solar system, the human body, birth are a few of a never ending list of events that are precalculated. God is a mathematician to the 'nth' degree. as for me I currently reside in Brazil, IN., but born and raised in California.

"Many people are Christian in name only. They go to church, do all the ""right"" things (with a few indiscretions), and think that is all there is to it.   At heart, they do not want to change or give up their pleasures or lifestyles, or to find out anything more that might require them to do so. \n\nThere are those who think that moderation is allowable, and that is true...all things are lawfull, but not all things are profitable. For themselves or for others. The thing is, we are called to do everything in love... if drinking causes another to stumble, then one should not drink, at least in front of them. Things have a way of being found out though... the truth always comes back around.\n\nSo is this judging one another? Yes. The question is really; how much do you love God? How much do you love others? Show me by what you do. Let me understand by what you say. You may not be responsible for the decisions that another makes, but you do have an influence. Our decisions often affects others by our examples."

"God. This explanation is what everyone eventually resorts to when the other answers fail. Throughout all of human history, we've been trying to explain existence. But nobody has ever succeeded. And it's likely that nobody ever will. So we create the concept of God, whose only necessary property is being ""that which explains existence."" \n\nThis doesn't tell us much about god, though. It doesn't mean that any particular religion is correct. It merely defines god as something which answers The Question, because we have not been able to. \nbut...\nThe Bible represents a fundamental guidepost for millions of people on the planet, in much the same way the Koran, Torah, and Pali Canon offer guidance to people of other religions. If you and I could dig up documentation that contradicted the holy stories of Islamic belief, Judaic belief, Buddhist belief, pagan belief, should we do that? Should we wave a flag and tell the Buddhists that we have proof the Buddha did not come from a lotus blossom? Or that Jesus was not born of a literal virgin birth? Those who truly understand their faiths understand the stories are metaphorical.""Sophie looked skeptical. ""My friends who are devout Christians definitely believe that Christ literally walked on water, literally turned water into wine, and was born of a literal virgin birth.""""My point exactly,"" Langdon said.

Have you noticed that roughly 2 seconds after a question like this one is posted, the sermons just roll in?  I do so love the smell of brimstone in the morning.\n\nTo answer your question without turing all hellfire and brimstone on you, protection spells vary.  It really depends on what you're seeking protection from. I've had some pretty good luck with a basic protection spell requiring a jar, some nails, broken glass and other assorted sharp pointies.   You place all of the sharp objects into the jar and you bury it in the yard.  While you're burying the jar, you ask the Lord and Lady to offer their protection.  I've also had some luck with binding spells when I'm faced with a person who just won't back off.  Please remember that spells designed to cause damage or harm to another are a bad way to go.  I always keep some salt and some Dragon's blood on hand for protection as well. Both are inexpensive and multi-functional. The link below has some basics.  One last thing, don't ever pay someone online to do a spell for you, it's not worth it when you can handle things like this yourself.
"I grew up in a time when traditional family values were sacred.  Dinner time was the focal point of our day.  What our parents said went - whether we disagreed or not. It was okay to disagree - not okay to disrupt everyone else's life because of it.  Healthy debates were common - meaness was not tolerated.  Mom was home with us, Dad worked and provided for us.\n\nToday, life is so much more complicated.  There are so many more things to consider and evaluate about every single aspect of life.  More people question what's right or what's wrong.  People get offended more easily and think it's okay to sue their neighbor if their dog barks too much.  That was unheard of when I was young. \n\nSomehow along the way, people have become so ME-oriented that they forget they aren't the only ones here.  God put us here and He taught us love.  We're all in this together, and people are forgetting that.  There's very little tolerance for differences of opinions, or other folks point of view.  There's very little willingness to work together with strangers or loved ones to work things out and come to a common agreement.  \n\nInstead of walking over to a neighbor's house to try to work out a disagreement, people sue each other now.  There's so little trust in others these days that no one dares take a chance that someone else is sincere.\n\nThere was once a day - not that long past that I would have (and have) gotten in the car of a total stranger when I needed a ride.  (hitchhiking) ;)  There was a time when I would have (and have) stopped when I saw someone sitting by the side of the road with a car that was broke down.  Nowadays - people put a sun screen in their windows saying ""call police"" when they need help. \n\nIt's not just traditional family values that have been forgotten - it's loving your neighbor, loving and trusting with the innocence of a child that's been lost.  I think the last part is because of loss of family values.  I think the loss of traditional family values is because of the loss of morals an traditions that helped folks to remember it's all about love, and that we're all in this together.  \n\nPeople were not perfect then - none of us can be, but they cared for one another enough to think more about them, than themselves.  It's called love.  We're losing it.\n\nGod Bless,"

I guess you want me to tell why is valentine's day celebrated. You might be aware that it is dedicated to Saint Valentine. But actually, there are more than one or two legends behind the origin of this wonderful day. Here are two of them from the History Channel Official Website. For more details, you can visit the links given as source -\n\nThe History of Valentine's Day\n\nEvery February, across the country, candy, flowers, and gifts are exchanged between loved ones, all in the name of St. Valentine. But who is this mysterious saint and why do we celebrate this holiday? The history of Valentine's Day -- and its patron saint -- is shrouded in mystery. But we do know that February has long been a month of romance. St. Valentine's Day, as we know it today, contains vestiges of both Christian and ancient Roman tradition. So, who was Saint Valentine and how did he become associated with this ancient rite? Today, the Catholic Church recognizes at least three different saints named Valentine or Valentinus, all of whom were martyred.\n\nOne legend contends that Valentine was a priest who served during the third century in Rome. When Emperor Claudius II decided that single men made better soldiers than those with wives and families, he outlawed marriage for young men -- his crop of potential soldiers. Valentine, realizing the injustice of the decree, defied Claudius and continued to perform marriages for young lovers in secret. When Valentine's actions were discovered, Claudius ordered that he be put to death.\n\nOther stories suggest that Valentine may have been killed for attempting to help Christians escape harsh Roman prisons where they were often beaten and tortured.\n\nAccording to one legend, Valentine actually sent the first 'valentine' greeting himself. While in prison, it is believed that Valentine fell in love with a young girl -- who may have been his jailor's daughter -- who visited him during his confinement. Before his death, it is alleged that he wrote her a letter, which he signed 'From your Valentine,' an expression that is still in use today. Although the truth behind the Valentine legends is murky, the stories certainly emphasize his appeal as a sympathetic, heroic, and, most importantly, romantic figure. It's no surprise that by the Middle Ages, Valentine was one of the most popular saints in England and France.
:}\nPeople change over time based on nutrition even environment. The theory of evolution depends on a concept called “survival of the fittest”.

"Mark 9:1, ""And he said to them, ""Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see that the kingdom of God has come with power.""\n\nJesus meant himself... his death and resurrection... the coming of the Holy Spirit.  That is what I gather together.  Jesus repeatedly said, ""The kingdom of God is near"".\n\nIndeed they did not taste death --- the Spirit of Jesus came... with power.\n\nAddition:\nThis does not refer to the actual ""second coming"" but the coming of the Spirit of God."

this is because the government decided not to allow malaysian to go to oversea in continuing they higher education, i mean studying to oversea university for their studies. it happened around the year 1993 to 1999. \n\nbecause of this decision, they are many graduates from the local university but the local demand in certain industry is very low. so who ever get it first, an achiever, good looking and have many professional connections and excellent prospect, get their dream job.\n\nit is the matter of supply and demand. in this case, the supply is over load, but the demand is less. \n\nthat why, in my opinion, the government is now encouraging graduates to be in the farming industry, doing industry training and they encourage student to go oversea in continuing they higher education.

Definitely not everyone on Earth hates Americans, but some that do tend to hate our culture (or lack of it), can often be seen wearing Levi's and eating at McDonald's. It's a love/hate thing for some, hate for others, and love for a lot- I've met people from many different countries, and the general consensus is that George W.

"It is not right to lump all people who say they are Christian into one group. There is no ""American Christian"" church and there are no ""Christian States"". (It is illegal in the United States for the government to prefer any religion or creed.) Christianity is not the only religion whose tenets have been perverted by violent people.  It's not Christianity or Islam or any other religion that is the problem, but rather people who hate other people. Any facet of human life where people have different opinions, appearances, or practices can be and has been used by unscrupulous people as a basis for carrying out their programs of hate. Lumping all the people of one belief or race or culture together and calling them names is just the first step in these programs. Do you really want to go down that path?"

I think that believing that Adam and Eve were white is a misconception.  Why do you say that since it was in the Middle East, they must've been white?  Do white people live there now?  No.\nAnd it is also wrong to say that evolution teaches that a common ancestor is from Africa.   From what I gathered, remember Pangea?  When all the continents were supposedly connected?  The common ancestor lived in Pangea, in the region that is now Africa, not necessarily in Africa as we know it now.\nSo, no, I don't think that racism plays a part, I think it is simply religious fanatacism.  Also, take note that some of the strongest churches in the US, especially in the Southern US, are black churches.  It is a trend that all heavily religious people dismiss evolution, and blacks, I believe, are no exception.
"Jesus' public life begins with his baptism by John in the Jordan. John preaches ""a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins"". A crowd of sinners - tax collectors and soldiers, Pharisees and Sadducees, and prostitutes- come to be baptized by him. ""Then Jesus appears."" The Baptist hesitates, but Jesus insists and receives baptism. Then the Holy Spirit, in the form of a dove, comes upon Jesus and a voice from heaven proclaims, ""This is my beloved Son."" This is the manifestation (""Epiphany"") of Jesus as Messiah of Israel and Son of God. \n\nThe baptism of Jesus is on his part the acceptance and inauguration of his mission as God's suffering Servant. He allows himself to be numbered among sinners; he is already ""the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world"". Already he is anticipating the ""baptism"" of his bloody death. Already he is coming to ""fulfill all righteousness"", that is, he is submitting himself entirely to his Father's will: out of love he consents to this baptism of death for the remission of our sins. The Father's voice responds to the Son's acceptance, proclaiming his entire delight in his Son. The Spirit whom Jesus possessed in fullness from his conception comes to ""rest on him"". Jesus will be the source of the Spirit for all mankind. At his baptism ""the heavens were opened"" - the heavens that Adam's sin had closed - and the waters were sanctified by the descent of Jesus and the Spirit, a prelude to the new creation. \n\nThrough Baptism the Christian is sacramentally assimilated to Jesus, who in his own baptism anticipates his death and resurrection. The Christian must enter into this mystery of humble self-abasement and repentance, go down into the water with Jesus in order to rise with him, be reborn of water and the Spirit so as to become the Father's beloved son in the Son and ""walk in newness of life""."

"Nope.  It will stir up ""controversy"" for awhile and then die down, as others have before it.  ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" had outraged people picketing theatres because it suggested that on the cross, Christ might have considered other paths He could have taken -- marriage, family, quiet life, etc.  ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" stireed up many of the same questions that the ""Da Vinci Code"" does -- people didn't care for the portrayal of Mary Magdalene in that movie either, since they felt it suggested a more intimate relationship than is suggested in the Bible.\n\nPersonally -- I saw ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" and did not find it as controversial as those screaming against it.  I think people tend to read things into movies and books.  In the case of ""da Vinci Code"", people are all excited about whether Jesus might have been married and had children (which, of course, means He would have had sex).  I fail to see why this is so shocking.  Marriage is a sacrament.  Why should Jesus not partake of it?  How can a sacrament make someone less pure, less good than they are?  \n\nThe importance of Jesus is His Message -- it seems to me that many people are missing the important message and focussing on the trivial details that don't matter.  Maybe He was married, maybe He wasn't -- I don't think it matters at all.  He came, He taught us to love one another -- surely that is more important than whether He loved Mary Magdalene enough to marry her and raise a family with her?  (I won't even entertain the thought that One so holy might have had any relationship outside of marriage)"
You know that is a good question but I don't know if I would. Back before I became a born again Christian I would have said in a heart beat no and why would I, sometimes even though I know God I still have that sort of thought that races through my head at times. But you have to forgive yourself and in this case they might be looking for forgiveness for what they have done or may have done to you. Really it is your choice what it is that you want to do. That is really between you and the Lord and your adopted parents and the Lord that will have to answer that question. If it was me now that I am a different person I would go and see them just to let them know that I am going to be alright. And for them let them know that peace comes for us all if you want it bad enough. My advice to you is think about this long and hard, and when you do ask your self this question what if the shoe was on the other foot and my kids knew I was dying would I want them to see me? Think about it and make sure that you yourself be right in mind and spirit when you make your decision. What I am really saying is pray about it before you do!
Absolutely!! We are not commanded to show up on time for church, but we are commanded to love one another. I can worship God any time of day but that person needs me right now.

"I would say women suffer more than men, because they are paid less than men on average, they are burden with carrying children, they are more exploited than men (or by men).  In other parts of the world, like third world and Eastern Bloc counties; Women are forced into prositution, forced abortions, if paid, paid very little, exploited by both the pimps and the ""do-good"" liberals to be ""poster children"", recieving nothing more than ""moral"" support and condemnation of their exploiters but the situation never gets allievated by the liberal tyranny of inaction.  If not exploited by them, they are exploited by some corporation making 10 cents an hour at some factory.  So, Women DO suffer much more than men.  For those woman that can't stand on their own, it's the man's and humanity's responsibility to help them stand-up, giving them a hand-up, not a hand-out.  (Liberals can't seem to grasp that concept.)"

I'm white, and I understand you completely. You just need to think that just because the people you have been experiencing are bad, they don't represent their whole race. The thing is, the white people you experience who are racist are just idiots. I have nothing against any race. I hate black idiots. I hate hispanic idiots. and I hate white idiots. It has nothing to with race. You can dislike the hispanics on your street and dislike the racist whites at your school, but don't dislike the entire race just because of one person (or a SMALL group of people).

WHAT JESUS SAID ABOUT DEATH\n\nJesus Christ spoke about the condition of the dead. He did so with regard to Lazarus, a man whom he knew well and who had died. Jesus told his disciples: “Lazarus our friend has gone to rest.” The disciples thought that Jesus meant that Lazarus was resting in sleep, recovering from an illness. They were wrong. Jesus explained: “Lazarus has died.” (John 11:11-14) Notice that Jesus compared death to rest and sleep. Lazarus was neither in heaven nor in a burning hell. He was not meeting angels or ancestors. Lazarus was not being reborn as another human. He was at rest in death, as though in a deep sleep without dreams. Other scriptures also compare death to sleep. For example, when the disciple Stephen was stoned to death, the Bible says that he “fell asleep.” (Acts 7:60) Similarly, the apostle Paul wrote about some in his day who had “fallen asleep” in death.—1 Corinthians 15:6.\n\nLEARNING FROM THE RESURRECTION ACCOUNTS\n\nThe Bible teaches that the dead “are conscious of nothing at all.” They are not alive and have no conscious existence anywhere. The account of Lazarus confirms this. Upon returning to life, did Lazarus thrill people with descriptions of heaven? Or did he terrify them with horrible tales about a burning hell? No. The Bible contains no such words from Lazarus. During the four days that he was dead, he had been “conscious of nothing at all.” (Ecclesiastes 9:5) Lazarus had simply been sleeping in death.—John 11:11.\nThe account of Lazarus also teaches us that the resurrection is a reality, not a mere myth. Jesus raised Lazarus in front of a crowd of eyewitnesses. Even the religious leaders, who hated Jesus, did not deny this miracle. \n\nThink about this too: If Lazarus had been in heaven for those four days, would he not have said something about it?— And if he had been in heaven, would Jesus have made him come back to earth from that wonderful place?— Of course not!\n\nYet, many people say that we have a soul, and they say that the soul lives on after the body dies. They say that Lazarus’ soul was alive somewhere. But the Bible does not say that. It says that God made the first man Adam “a living soul.” Adam was a soul. The Bible also says that when Adam sinned, he died. He became a “dead soul,” and he returned to the dust from which he had been made. The Bible also says that all Adam’s offspring inherited sin and death too.\n\nThe Scriptural teaching of the resurrection, however, is not compatible with the doctrine of the immortality of the soul. If an immortal soul survived death, no one would need to be resurrected, or brought back to life. Indeed, Martha expressed no thought about an immortal soul that was living on elsewhere after death. She did not believe that Lazarus had already gone to some spirit realm to continue his existence. On the contrary, she showed her faith in God’s purpose to reverse the effects of death. She said: “I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.” (John 11:23, 24) Likewise, Lazarus himself related no experiences of some afterlife. There was nothing to report.\n\nClearly, according to the Bible, the soul dies and the remedy for death is the resurrection.

"In some ways I understand your dilemma, I do.  Here are some thoughts for you to pray about.  We are all human and all fall short, are those miserable brooders in your church just needing someone to take them under their ""wing"" sort of speaking and be a prayer warrior for them?  Could it be that God has called you for this purpose but you are so inwardly focused on receiving recognition/appreciation for it that you don't see the need?  Not trying to be harsh, just thinking through these thoughts as I type, so praying you can understand.  Your husband is the spiritual leader of your home, try to remember this when you communicate with him, show him respect in his making a decision he feels is right for your family.  Bottom line, if God wants to move you, it will happen and you won't even see it coming.  Don't make it happen, in other words, let God be in control, it will happen if that is what is meant to be."
I do agree in one aspect however I do also find many questions to answer that seem to just make my day complete. I have found many new contacts here and really in the long run just enjoying it all.\n\nI do find a couple of your answers good advice. That is just ignore what you don't want to see and look only at what you want, smile, then meet the challange with some of your knowledge and ability passed on to another. In that way you have truly contributed to this whole package and done your part to increase the unanswered questions making it hard for me to choose where to go next. Ha Ha Ha I kinda feel I am needed and my work never ends as I lay down at night with peace and really looking forward for the new day to hurry and get here cause I have plenty of new questions to answer ha ha.\n\nYes my friend I do at times have to shake my head at some questions then BINGO A GREAT ONE APPEARS AND I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE ONES I WANT TO IGNORE. So I then smile and start typing a new answer like I am doing now with the thought the world is only turning because of me ha ha ha\n\nThat is just a joke OK so do take it like that. I sure hope you are smiling.\n\nIf you want some deep spiritual questions just stay tuned ha ha. I will soon start to asking questions that no one can answer ha ha. You just wait and see. Oh yes it will get stupid answers but I tell you I am sure no one will be right ha ha\n\nDo you think you know the Bible? then tell me with an absolute positive answer that no one, no not one can cause you to change your opinion in the future in regards to it. I am serious not joking.\n\nWhat color was Mr Adam's hair in the garden of Eden? Absolutely the bible tells all its precise color and length. Do you know it and this is no joke. If not why don't you know?\n\nHow is that for a religion and spiritual question.\n\nPlease I do not know if I did change your position but I sure hope these questions do continue and I do have a continued good day one after the other. Thanks for letting our paths cross.
"You've got some good suggestions so far (and some pretty crappy answers too).  \n\n1.  Make sure that there is a long round of foreplay.  The more excited and relaxed he is, the easier it will be.  \n\n2.  Use plenty of lube. Infact, I would say, that you cannot use too much lube.\n\n3.  Try (gently) opening up the area with something smaller than what you're currently using:  for example if you're trying to use your penis right now, start with a finger first.  It's smaller and will go in easier.  After awhile of that, he should be reader for bigger objects.\n\n4.  Make sure that you're relaxed also.  If he can sense that you're getting frustrated or impatient, that will carry over to him and make the experience difficult for you both, physically and emotionally.\n\n5.  Check into literature and instructional references about this. The only one I've ever heard of is ""Bend Over Boyfriend,"" but I'm sure there are many others.  Look into this together, it will be a unifying activity and give him confidence and reassurance, which will translate into being more relaxed during sex. \n\n6. Make sure to make these experiences enjoyable, even if you don't reach your ""goal"" right away make sure that the experience is not a waste.\n\nHope this helps.  Have fun!\n\nFR"

It's an overreaction.  Let people choose to do what they want as long as it doesn't affect you personally.\n\nA good example of this can be found in a town where I went to college.  Some in the public and the local government wanted all pornography to be removed and banned.  This pornography sat behind store counters or behind doors clearly marked as adults only.  For some reason, certain people were still offended by it even though they couldn't see it and it wasn't being pushed on them.  They weren't going to be satisfied until all traces of it were obliterated.  You have a choice: if something bothers you, don't involve yourself with it.  Those who wish to walk that road, leave them alone.  Sounds simple, but this debate will continue for ever.  As long as someone is doing something that someone else doesn't like, regardless of whether or not they can see it, people will continue to fight what they can't see until there is nothing left or the offended party ceases to exist.\n\nAND JIMMY R IS CORRECT: PEOPLE ARE FANATICAL ABOUT ANYTHING THAT CONTRASTS THEIR RELIGION...JUST LOOK AT THE FANATICS WITHIN THE MUSLIM RELIGION CONTINUING TO PUSH VIOLENCE IN THE NAME OF ISLAM.

No. I think going into a woman's restroom in itself isn't against the laws of any state. It's what you do in there which could constitute a breach of legality. Otherwise, how would janitors be able to clean it.\n\nSuppose you accidently went into the ladies' room and quickly left when you realized your mistake. No harm, no foul.\n\nNow what if you went into the ladies' room, peeked into a stall ? Then you've broken the law. Or if you just went in, used the toilet, exposing yourself knowing that women were probably watching. Here again, you've broken the law.\n\nNow what if the men's room were broken and you had to use the ladies' room. If it was a restroom with a lock, there's probably no law. You gotta take care of business.

As a music minister and volunteer, the larger the congregation, the higher my stress level. I'm too often playing Martha I'm afraid. I'm sure you know what I mean, Fr. :-)\n\nFull pews for special events also bring me a certain serenity however, and I don't know if there's a correlative physical aspect. But to know that I am lifting my voice with so many singing the litany helps connect me to the Communion of Saints in a way that feels so tangible... like you can reach out and touch apostles and saints of the ages.
Yes, I'm sorry, I do. I buy into the sterotype. Sorry. But you can't blame me, I was a hairdresser for years & I knew NOT ONE straight male hairdresser, so I became jaded over the years. I mean, I KNOW not all male nurses are gay, but if I see one I assume he is.

Pastors get paid...They do a job for the church usually under contract. (That's why most get a house, and other stuff to boot. It's part of the pay.) So when they get old and don't want to Pastor anymore they retire...It doesn't mean they don't preach anymore it just means they don't get paid for it.\n\nThe rest you mentioned usually do those things just because they want to. They don't get paid and are volunteers. They have a calling and decide to serve their chuch by contributing what they can. And no they don't retire but some just quit when they don't want to do it anymore or when they find a replacement or when they die. So they, in a sense, do retire at some point in one way or another.

Well I don't know if it was a ghost or a spirit or maybe just an energy, but I had an interesting experience a couple of years ago.  I was living at my parent's house at the time and they were away for the weekend so I was home alone.  I had a friend come over to my house and we were just hanging out, drinking some wine and chatting.  We finished the bottle of wine and I placed the empty bottle on the kitchen table next to a candle I was planning to put in it.  We decided to go out to meet some people and came back about 2 hours later.  When I opened the front door I saw the candle was placed in the neck of the bottle AND IT WAS LIT with only one drip of wax running down the side.  I had an alarm set with motion detectors when I left the house.  These candles burned very quickly, so it must have been lit just moments before I got home.  I'm so glad I had a friend with me to vouch for it because no one believes it when they ehar it.  Funny thing is, it was almost comforting to me because I think it was my grandmother telling me she was there to watch over me.  I felt very peaceful for a while after that happened.  I've been waiting for something like it to happen ever since, I have a fascination with it.
My parents. They taught me how to live righteously!
Here are some rules:\n\n1. Stop smoking, so you can enjoy life by the century, not the minute.\n2. Make good choices, don't be friends with druggies no matter how good they are to you- and if you care for them enough you should try to stop them from smoking/doing drugs. If you fail to do that, find a new crowd of people to hang out with because with the druggies, your life will go straight down the tube.

"I had an arguement with a Christian friend of mine.  When I asked her, ""Why doesn't God just make everyone happy"" I got a bunch of canned responses (God works in mysterious ways, God wants to give us choice...as if anyone could comprehend what God wants (if there is a God)).  Finally she just said, ""I don't know...I'm not God"".  THAT'S an honest answer!  I agree, I would rather hear an honest, thought-out response than lines that have been fed to you"

People are perfectly capable of making one another miserable without help from a G-d.  What makes you think \nG-d's duty is to solve man made problems?  If G-d (at least in the western Judeo-Christian concept) is capable of asking Abraham to sacrifice his son, what makes you think something wholly other is going to conform to your era-geographic specific values?  Personally I avoid the entire issue by believing in fertilizer.

I think that if you are fine with it, that is all that matters.  If no one else likes it, tough toenails.  They need to get out of your life and get their own.
I think its athletics?
You make it sound like it's a bad thing.\nIs about pride and is not unique to 'boricuas'; look at Texans.\nOne of the things that helps fuel that sentiment is all those athletes, actors, actresses, etc that make our small little island known all over the world.\nWe are proud, and we stick together.

Tradition versus modernity? No it is tradition to modernity.This is a slow change.No one can be totally traditional or totally modern.Traditonally women stayed at home but they were great decision makers on behalf of men.Modern women do not like to be called home makers.They are career women now.Family life is the casualty.Traditonal travel is by bicycles,modern travel is by air or atleast by automobiles.The result? We need static bicycles at home.A balance between tradition and modrnity only works.
":}\nThe Seven Virtues were derived from the Psychomachia , an epic poem written by Aurelius Clemens Prudentius entailing the battle of good virtues and evil vices. \n\n1.  Pride vs. Humility         Seeing ourselves as we are and not comparing ourselves to others is humility. Pride and vanity are competitive. If someone else's pride really bothers you, you have a lot of pride.\n2.  Envy vs. Love           ""Love is patient, love is kind…"" Love actively seeks the good of others for their sake. Envy resents the good others receive or even might receive. Envy is almost indistinguishable from pride at times.\n3.   Wrath/Anger vs. Kindness          Kindness means taking the tender approach, with patience and compassion. Anger is often our first reaction to the problems of others. Impatience with the faults of others is related to this.\n4. Sloth vs. Zeal           Zeal is the energetic response of the heart to God's commands. The other sins work together to deaden the spiritual senses so we first become slow to respond to God and then drift completely into the sleep of complacency.\n5. Avarice/Greed vs. Generosity        This is about more than money. Generosity means letting others get the credit or praise. It is giving without having expectations of the other person. Greed wants to get its ""fair share"" or a bit more.\n6.  Gluttony vs. Faith and Temperance     Temperance accepts the natural limits of pleasures and preserves this natural balance. This does not pertain only to food, but to entertainment and other legitimate goods, and even the company of others.\n7.    Lust vs. Self control          Self  control and self mastery prevent pleasure from killing the soul by suffocation. Legitimate pleasures are controlled in the same way an athlete's muscles are: for maximum efficiency without damage. Lust is the self-destructive drive for pleasure out of proportion to its worth. Sex, power, or image can be used well, but they tend to go out of control."
The story of Adam and Eve is not supposed to be understood as strictly historical or scientific. It is a religious story which has a spiritual meaning. Let's not understand it literally. Besides, spiritual matters are not scientific.

"I don't really know, but I can tell you that I don't even wear ""thongs"".  OMG, those things should be outlawed.  Maybe more men should wear them so they wont think they are sexy?"
i agree with lynda, as far as the clothes dont let the man lust over them, its all good. Loose fitted jeans and shirts do just fine for other men as its very unattractive. You can wear anything for your man when you and him are all alone.
Ich rede den ganzen Tag deutsch ...:-D
"If you go ~lawless~ there is no need for Grace because there will be no sin or imperfection to be forgiven. (God defines sin as transgression against His Law.) It is because mere humans cannot live up to God's standard for admission to heaven that we are at His Mercy to be saved by His Grace. (God's standard for entrance into Paradise is Perfection - the only One to qualify is His Son, Yeshua the Messiah - because He is sinless; He obeyed God's Law/the Torah, perfectly.)\n\nBeing lawless like Hitler or being lawless like Ted Turner* are NOT ways to obtain God's Salvation. Those who are rebellious to God's Laws are NOT ones who are seeking to do God's will ""on earth as it is in heaven."" His faithful believers are using their lives on earth, under His Law, as a preparation for living under His Law in the heavenly Kingdom of God. And based on their imperfection to completely follow the 100% Torah-observant Messiah who said, ""Follow Me,"" they will be imputed with the Righteousness of the Son of God - perfection - on Judgment Day... & will be ready to enter into their eternal reward.\n\nIt is a simple plan which worked for Abraham & still works the same way for you & me today:\n\nTrue Faith + God's Grace = His Salvation\n\n~~~\n\n*Not to be judgmental with Ted... he has publicly stated that he wants to go to hell because heaven sounds ""too boring."""
It's at 37635 Dequindre Road.  The phone number is 248-689-4664.  Services are saturday at 6:00PM, sunday at 9:15AM, and sunday at 11:00AM.  It looks (from the web site) like it tries to be family friendly.  I didn't see any information about the pastor.
yes, a little girl that used to be in the house I grew up in. I saw her twice. Once in tattered rags for clothes and once in like a sunday dress. She actually saved me from falling out of a window when I was young. Her name was Elizebeth and my mom knows that she was murdered close by when the area used to be farmlands in the 1880s I think. It wasn't weird and she was very friendly, although there were some weird things. Like for instance, all the clocks in the house would stop on certain times, and my grandfathers clock (that wasn't wounds and was broken at the time) would randomly work and stop working. She didn't look faded or anything. It was like the little girl was alive.\n\nMy mother and I have also smelt smoke every once in a while. It's always weird because I'll start smelling the smoke and theres a kind of feeling. My mom's never led me on about whether my grandpa's spirit was there or not since she would only talk about it if I brought it up. \n\nI also think I've seen the outline of a suicide victim's ghost in my girlfriend's house. Long story, but it made me jump since it was so human like but black.
#1 - Pray for God's name to be sanctified.\n#2 - Pray for God's kingdom to be realized on earth (as it is in heaven).\n#3 - Pray for others who have been affected adversely in these last days.\n#4 - Pray that your own spirituality remain strong during trials. \n#5 - Pray that others come to know and have faith in the truth about God before the end comes.

This is actually a tough question. Judism was responsible for millions of deaths pre Christianity and in Christianities early days.\n\nPeople keep talking about the Holucost of the Jews, but there was an even bigger and longer Holucost then this one that you don't hear that often. For the first about 800 yrs of Christianity, Christians were hunted. Yes the Christian holucost was far worse then that of the Jews.\n\nThen on the other hand, you have the Christians, which were responsible for the crusades, the Jewish holucost, burnings of witches, not to mention in some countries they persecuted you for not being Christian.\n\nBut, my answer would still be the Jews.\n\nWith that being said, both of these religions bad times were in the past. Niether one is truely bad today. Although there are some wars that state religion as a cause for them today; this is truelly not the case.\n\nFor instance, if you were to go up to the Pope and ask him what he thinks about a war caused by Christianity? He would probably say something like, no Christianity does not believe in any kind of war. Which in todays society is true.

Oh, wow are you lucky.I'm way good at that book. Here's one of the lectures I have. E-mail me at n00b_school_bus@yahoo.com if you need more.\n\n Lecture on November 3, 2005\n\n Odysseus is about 45 – 55 years old. The beggar appears to be 65 – 75 years old. He is ugly, poor, sickly thin and has loose saggy skin. Odysseus is disguised as the beggar so people don’t recognize him. Athena helps with the disguise.\n Odysseus’ dog recognizes him. Beggar looks older than Odysseus; he is extremely ugly. Odysseus’ disguise is to fool the suitors so they don’t recognize him. He doesn’t want Ithaca to recognize him. He wants to know if they are loyal. The dog recognizes him, even with him away because of his scent. Dog= symbol of Ithaca. He was a great dog before Odysseus left, and then he “fell apart” when Odysseus went to war”. Odysseus trained the dog. After Odysseus left, nobody was latched on to the dog, even though he has such a great potential. The dog got old and is dying. It’s literally laying on its own feces whist dying. It symbolizes Ithaca going to crap. Ithaca’s potential has never been realized. They could have been great but nobody seized the opportunity to govern the city. Although the dog dies, there is hope. The city can be restored. Even though the dog dies, Ithaca won’t because Odysseus is there.  Ithaca is ruled by Sparta. People who were loyal to Odysseus remained loyal. The suitors must die.\n Penelope wanted to unstring a bow to see if anyone of the suitors could restring it. She knew that the only person able to do that was Odysseus. 70 year old ugly beggar asked for the bow. Penelope and her maid made the axe shooter (see picture). She (Penelope) is repulsed by the young men suitors so much that she would be just as happy to marry the old beggar. One young suitor is drinking wine and starts laughing and Odysseus (disguised as the beggar) as he inspects the bow. Odysseus effortlessly strings the bow. The young suitors think he’s crazy and are shocked.  Odysseus drops on one knee and shoots…the arrow goes through all 12 axe handle hooks.\n Antinous tries to, and does, beat Telemachus. Odysseus tells Telemachus to keep his head and turns back in to Odysseus in his 45 year old form. The suitors are yelling at Odysseus, saying that he is going to die but they realize they have no weapons. Odysseus: “You dared bid for my wife while I was still alive”.  This is where they start to get afraid. “Their eyes flickered looking for some hutch or hide away from death”. Odysseus tries to and does kill everyone. The Gods are protecting him and Homer shows the Gods don’t want the suitors to live.\n The plot= a guy trying to get back to his wife. Courage, determination, fighting thru the odds= traits of Odysseus. The suitors are very arrogant, which is why they don’t be hospitable to the guest, which is really Odysseus in disguise.\n Calypso isn’t a good example of positive hospitality because she doesn’t willing let him leave when he wants to. He lands with the Phaeacian’s and it is a good example of hospitality because he (the king) gives Odysseus every thing he needs to move on. Cyclops is a negative example of good hospitality. He eats all their food, drinks all their wine, and then progresses to eat them. Polyphemus tried to stop them from leaving. Circes isn’t hospitable. She tricks them and turns them into animals. She tricks them but making them stay there for three years. The Sun God is bad hospitality on Odysseus’ men’s’ part because they were greedy with the cows because they could have eaten anything else. A positive example of hospitality- amaeus (swine herder) Odysseus gets whatever he needs and isn’t asked for his name. The best example of negative hospitality is at Odysseus’ palace because Odysseus’ wife and son can’t kick them out and there’s too many of the suitors for the weak people to force out. It’s the law that they have to put up 
Our celebrity culture as hyped by MTV (MTV cribs) and dozens and dozens of lifestyle magazines are to blame for this. If you see enough times that some celebrity is wearing this brand or that brand eventually you want to wear that brand too no matter what the cost.
I will believe that Islam is not a violent terrorist religion when the following happen:\n\n* Muslims can find their way to believe other religions without being condemned to death.\n* Crowds of gun-toting men do not celebrate terrorist acts against America, Israel, Europe, or India.\n* Muslim nations agree to Israel's right to exist peacefully without the threat of annihilation from its neighbors.\n* Palestinians are respected as people and given state assistance rather than being condemned to refugee camps by the same Arab nations who claim to support them.\n* Westerners are no longer kidnapped and beheaded.\n* Young men and women no longer wrap themselves in explosives in the delusional belief that suicide and murder will be rewarded in the afterlife.\n* Women are allowed divorce rights without losing their children.\n* Women are allowed to drive and to pursue careers.\n* Women are considered people and not chattel to their husbands.\n* Muslims are allowed, and even encouraged, to think for themselves and embrace individualism.\n\nUntil then, it doesn't matter what the Koran may say in theory.  Actions matter.  And actions in the US, the UK, Spain, Indonesia, Turkey, Tanzania, Kenya, Israel, Egypt, France, and India make it clear that Islam is a culture of violence and murder.  If this is not true, it's incumbent on every Muslim in the world to stand up and fight those who besmirch their name.
Christians are persecuted in Afghanistan because this is a nation of Islam. Islam has a very strong conviction against christians because they believe they are going about religion and life in general the wrong way.  In Afghanistan, which is trying to become a democratic nation, there is no freedom of speech or religion.  Feel fortunate to be able to have places on earth that are free of such persecution.
To who? A year ago I quit smoking after 40 years. I hated smoking. I smelled, people looked at me as if I were  nasty. I would buy a box with these white sticks in it. I would take one out of the box, stick the white stick in my mouth and suck in all the crap that was in it. Then smoke came out of my mouth. How stupid I was. I paid so much money for these white sticks(cigarettes) I could have had a great retirement had I saved that money than blow it.\nSmokers are acceptable only if they are considerate. If you want to smoke, go to a place where smoke will not bother non-smokers. After all, it is your choice to smoke not theirs.

Lev 19:4 Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I [am] the LORD your God. Lev 26:1 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up [any] image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I [am] the LORD your God. \nLev 26:30 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you. \nDeu 29:17 And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which [were] among them\n1Ki 15:12 And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. \n1Ki 21:26 And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all [things] as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel. \n2Ki 17:12 For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing.
It is not.  Perhaps you are actually imposing your beliefs on other and are not sensitive to their point of view?\n\nYour comment about Paul G suggests he might be on to something.  Sounded like a sincere and reasonable comment he made to you.  If you took it as an accusation, I think you're just too touchy.
There is no reason to be if it doesn't feel right to you.  Just tell them to back off and not pressure you.  If they are as good of Christians as they think they are, they will.  If not they aren't really the friends they profess to be and distance yourself from them.
What other kinds of folks would you ask all kinds of stupid questions of? If not us, then who? If you can get your answers somewhere else, I'm sure you'd go there. But, you come here instead. There must be a reason you keep coming back. You must be getting your needs met, whatever they may be. Anyway, I don't consider anyone's religious questions stupid. There's always a degree of curiosity, or a deep need whenever someone asks a religious question. And if I can help, in any way, my job is done. <*)))><

Wait a minute dude. Let's be more clear, don't over generalize them all.  On one side they go to churches, mosques, temples, and there are some who killing, cheating etc. Please be sure, are they the same people?\nI'm sure not all of them do both praying and killing. For those who have understanding to the meaning of praying and believe to God, i'm sure they won't do the bad. Please be sure also, that there are many who have no religion, no praying, no worshipping to registered Gods, but they do the peaceworks, decent people, with great love each other, etc.\n\nI just wanna tell you not to judge it over generalized, dont mix them up, or you'll be miss. The rest of your ideas is ok.
"Evidence for evolution:\n1. Vestigial structures.\n2. Microevolution can be observed in both a controlled laboratory setting and in nature.\n3. The fossil record.\n4. Imperfect structures (the blind spot of the mammalian eye, for example).\n5. Developmental biology reflects evolutionary lineage.\n6. Genetic analysis shows similarities among species reflecting evolutionary origins.\n7. Homologous structures.\n8. Many cellular and biochemcial processes are conserved in a variety of species.\n9. Vestigical biochemical pathways (for example, pancreatic cells are light-sensitive even though they are located deep inside the body).\n\nThose are just a few off the top of my head. If you'd like to know more about any of them, just ask.\n\nEvidence for intelligent design:\nUmm... the bible says so?\n\nI think the choice is clear. It's not a question of ""belief,"" but rather of rational thought, reasoning, and examination of evidence.\n\n\n_______________\nResponse to johnblessed01:\n\nFirst, I did not state that each of the points taken own its own is irrefutable proof of evolution.  I said that each of those constitutes evidence that evolution occurs.  While no one point proves evolution, taken in combination the body of scientific evidence that supports evolution is quite strong.\n\nNow to address the individual arguments:\n1. Vestigial structures.\n\nWhere did I saw that the human tail bone is the best example of a vestigial structure?  I'm not an expert on human anatomy, but I will not deny that the tail bone has a structural function in the human body.\n\nOne example of a vestigial structure in humans in the appendix.  It has no function.  Removing it is harmful only in so far as any surgery is associated with certain risks (so I wouldn't have it removed just for fun, but it's because of the surgery not the absence of the appendix).  An appendix is found in several mammals.  In humans it is small and has no known function.  In rabbits and many other herbivours it is large and is used in the digestion of cellulose.\n\nAnother example of a vestigial structure is the hip bones of snakes.  Snakes evolved from quadrupeds, and some species still retain not on pelvises, but tiny protrutions of bone in a location that corresponds to the location of the legs in other quadrupeds.\n\n\n2. Microevolution can be observed in both a controlled laboratory setting and in nature.\n\nI didn't say that microevolution proves macroevolution.  However, it does provide evidence that macroevolution may be possible.  On its own microevolution is not terribly compelling for the reasons johnblessed01 described.  However, taken in context of the other evidence for evolution, microevolution provides a mechanims by which macroevolution could occur.  On its own, it doesn't prove that macroevolution occurs, but it does suggest that it is possible.\n\n\n3. The fossil record.\n\njohnblessed01's response to this point demonstrated a lack of understanding of the processes involved in fossilization and the methods associated with reconstructing evolutionary history.  Obviously the ""geological column"" is a simplification.  Scientists can reconstruct a sequence of events based on the types of surrounding rocks (I'm not an expert in geology but a geologist could explain in great detail how different types of rocks form), carbond dating, and various other methods.\n\nGeologists can distinguish sedemntary layers formed rapidly by a volcano from layers formd by, for example, changing bodies of water and low-acting forces of nature.  But again, this is not the only method of dating fossiles.\n\nThe time scale under which fossilization takes place depends on the geological and environmental conditions.  These can be assessed based on the chemical composition of the fossile and the surrounding material, as well as other factors.  Petrification can occur extremely rapidly in, say, a bog or a tar pit, but not at the bottom of"

The laws pertaining to these relationships differ from state-to-state, and common-law relationships are not recognized in some states.  Your best bet would be to address this question to your local court of law, or possibly search the internet (although you should be wary of information found there)."
Grade schools starts at 8 am and finishes at 1 pm, and it is basically the same, junior high and high school start at 7 am and finish at 1 pm too, the only difference I can see is maybe a little bit in the education, they go deeper in history and what happens around the world. Besides that is basically the same, popular kids, non popular kids, geeks, weirdos, the same.

"David sins in numbering the people. Pleading with God for mercy, he is given the choice between three punishments: seven years of famine, three months of military defeats, or three days of pestilence in the land. David replies: “Let us fall, please, into the hand of Jehovah, for many are his mercies; but into the hand of man do not let me fall.” (24:14) The nationwide pestilence kills 70,000 persons, being stopped only when David, acting on Jehovah’s instructions through Gad, purchases the threshing floor of Araunah, where he offers up burnt sacrifices and communion sacrifices to Jehovah.\n\nDavid had the choice of '1' punishment out of '3', he took ""pestilence"" and this was the cause of 70,000 people to die, David asked God to forgive him and God did forgive him.\n\nThe Bible says that the ""righteous & the unrighteous"" will be resurrected, so we have to leave it up to God.\n\nHilter belonged to the ""Catholic Religion""  The Negative Side of this is:\n\nHitler’s religion was not much of a deterrent to him.

My bf confessed to me that he liked wearing girls clothes. At first I was shocked but then accepted it because I love him. Plus he was hurting no one. At least once a month I dress him in diffrent outfits. He seems sweeter when dressed up like a girl. I especially like him in a mini skirt and see through blouse with high heels, pantyhose and proper undies. I do his makeup too. He is straight and together we have a great time. I plan on taking him shopping while he is dress in a cute pleated skirt and black flats for his birthday. He has great legs and can now pass as a girl. He has a number of wigs too. It is all in fun and we really do have a great time. He can be very macho too. And I would not trade him for anybody. And I respect him for being so honest with me and for being himself!
When people ask for your help to fix and or take a look at there computer then when you try to take a look they say well I usually have this that and this plugged in and I do this and when I do this it does that and you wonder why its not all working .  I can’t stand it!  Why have someone look at it if you’re going to proceed to do the same anyways?\nAnother is when they say there computer keeps saying an error and asks what do you think is causing it?  You say what was the error message they say oh I don't know it was something about something but I can't remember.  That annoys me also.  When they say the virus scanner says there are virus on the computer I left the message there so you can take a look when you take a look it says cookies found.  I hate that it’s enough to make you want to do something and not in a good way.

I AGREE THAT :\n-if there was no god no one would have claimed to be one!\n\n-If I was an important person I would have deserved to be respected. (How do you think god should be treated like?)\n\n-If I were god I wouldn’t have needed women! (god is thought of as male and referred to as male, but god is unique not like creatures in my religion) \n\n-If I warn people they get some punishment if they did something specific then they took it lightly and still defied me they deserve that punishment. (Just like the head of a school and a pain-in-the-butt student, won’t the student be put in detention?at least?) It’s all about consequences. \n\n-If people will be afraid god is with them every where means they are doing wrongful deeds, why don’t they be happy god is with them? I’d love for the ones I like to be with me all the time- almost! Counting out the bathroom time and that :P\n \n-If I had a daughter I would have wanted to protect her from AIDS and other sex transferred diseases and premarital pregnancy of course! Coz I love my kid and I don’t want her to suffer or be just a sex object having one night stands. I will let her know she is precious.\n \n-If I was poor and needed money I would have needed help. If people who have extra money won’t help those who die from hunger how would life be on earth?(I think we know already :(, try spending 1 dollar or even less to a poor person or in some charity organization, mind only your good intentions, in not long a time you will find that you got it back and more! I did that any way and it worked many times. It’s like god tells u if u help others I will make others help you, one more gig or a part time job or something u never expect, and you’ll get what u spent back into your pocket and more!) \n \n-If someone destroys what I gave them I’ll be sad, like giving someone a book or something and they tear it or something, even by accident. If you accept god as the one who gave us the earth and the trees and our souls and bodies, he will not accept us destroying all that. (You really have wrong ideas about religions you need to read more, not only this point but also the women being sinners and that too)\n \n-If some one swears at me I will tell him not to because it’s disrespectful and I’m only a human being and I’m not a president or something. Does that mean I am a sick person?! Shouldn’t we all treat each other nicely?\n \n-If I were god I would tell my creatures to live in peace.\n\n-If human beings are intelligent creatures why don’t they understand SIGNS? we can't see electricity but we see its effect.\n\nOne last thing, what would you people think of me if I tell you I SAW A COMPUTER MAKE ITSELF?!

"It was the Geneva Bible.  Becuase The Geneva Bible is a critical, yet almost completely forgotten part of the Protestant Reformation. Driven out of England by the persecutions of Bloody Mary, several future leaders of the ""\nReformation came to Geneva to create a pure and accurate translation of the Holy Writ. Concerned about the influence that the Catholic Church had on the existing translations of the Bible from the Latin, these men turned to the original Hebrew and Greek texts to produce the Geneva Bible. This made the Geneva Bible the first complete Bible to be translated into English from the original Hebrew and Greek texts.\nThe creation of the Geneva Bible was a substantial undertaking. Its authors spent over two years, working diligently day and night by candlelight, to finish the translation and the commentaries. The entire project was funded by the exiled English congregation in Geneva, making the translation a work supported by the people and not by an authoritarian church or monarch.\nAll the marginal commentaries were finished by 1599, making the 1599 edition of the Geneva Bible the most complete study aide for Biblical scholars and students. This edition does contain the Apocrypha. The Apocrypha’s notes are minimal or absent in other editions. Additional highlights of this edition include Study Bible maps of the Exodus route and Joshua’s distribution of land, a name and Holy bible with Subject index, and Psalms sung by the English congregation in Geneva.\nThe greatest distinction of the Geneva Bible, however, is the extensive collection of marginal notes that it contains. Prominent Reformation leaders such as John Calvin, John Knox, Miles Coverdale, William Whittingham, Theodore Beza, and Anthony Gilby wrote the majority of these notes in order to explain and interpret the scriptures. The notes comprise nearly 300,000 words, or nearly one-third the length of the Bible itself, and they are justifiably considered the most complete source of Protestant religious thought available.\nIt was continually printed from 1560 to 1644 in over 200 different editions. It was the Bible of choice for many of the greatest writers, thinkers, and historical figures of the Reformation era. William Shakespeare’s plays and the writings of John Milton and John Bunyan were clearly influenced by the Geneva Bible. Oliver Cromwell issued a pamphlet containing excerpts from the Geneva Owing to the marginal notes and the superior quality of the translation, the Geneva Bible became the most widely read and influential English Bible of the 16th and 17th centuries. Bible to his troops during the English Civil War. When the Pilgrims set sail on the Mayflower they took with them exclusively the Geneva Bible.\nThe marginal notes of the Geneva Bible enraged the Catholic Church, since the notes deemed the act of confession to men – the Catholic Bishops – as unjustified by Holy Script. Man should confess to God only; man’s private life was man’s private life. The notes also infuriated King James, since they allowed disobedience to tyrannical kings. King James went so far as to make ownership of the Geneva Bible a felony. He then proceeded to make his own version of the Bible, but without the marginal notes that had so disturbed him. Consequently, during King James’s reign, and into the reign of Charles I, the Geneva Bible was gradually replaced by the King James Bible."
"Hebrews 1:10-12:\n10He also says, \n   ""In the beginning, O Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, \n      and the heavens are the work of your hands. \n    11They will perish, but you remain; \n      they will all wear out like a garment. \n    12You will roll them up like a robe; \n      like a garment they will be changed. \n   But you remain the same, \n      and your years will never end.""\n\nI've no doubt that with the cosmic changes that happened abruptly, there may have been a big bang!

"Actually, very few autographs (original copies) of ANY work older than about 300 years have survived.  We have no originals of the works of Aristotle, Homer, Plato, Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, or even Shakespeare.  Shakespeare died less than 400 years ago.  Yet scholars believe that the copies we have of all these works are accurate to the original.  There is NO ancient writting, however, that we are more sure of than the Bible.\n\nThe Old Testament was written between 1500 and 400 BC.  The earliest copies we have of the Old Testament date between 200 BC and 200 AD.  That means that some of our earliest copies might have been written 1700 years after the fact.  This sounds like there is a lot of time to make a lot of errors in copying.  If this was any other book, that would probably be true.  However, we know a great deal about HOW the Bible was copied.  First, we know that copies were not made very often.  We have records that tell us that books were only copied once every 300-400 years or so.  These copies were done by only the best scribes, and under very strict guidelines.  We have obtained checklists that a copy must go through before it can be used.  The checklists were along this order...""The 359th word is THE, the 78th letter on the 22nd page is L, the book contains 1294 words, etc.""  If the copy did not pass all of the checklist items, it was redone.  This means that our copies of the Old Testament have probably not been copied more than 8 times, and in some cases, probably only once or twice, under the strictest guidelines imaginable.  This is a far cry off from the ""telephone game"" scenario that critics would like you to believe.\n\nThe New Testament is a bit different.  It was not copied under such strict guidelines, and it was copied over and over and over again.  We are not so assured of its accuracy based on the methods of copying.  However, we are assured of its accuracy because of the great number of manuscripts we have, the relatively short amount of time between these copies and the originals.  We have hundreds of manuscripts from the 1st and 2nd centuries, and thousands of manuscripts from the 3rd and 4th centuries.  We are able to compare all of these manuscripts to one another and determine where and when certain discrepencies arose.  There is only .5% of the New Testament that is of any real dispute, and none of those verses contain matters of doctrine that are not addressed in other areas of the New Testament."
Jewish people aren't, categorically, different from anyone else - when offended, we act just like anyone does, getting mad for a while and (hopefully) coming to forgive that person in the end.\n\nOur religion teaches us to forgive - on Yom Kippur, which is the Day of Atonement, we explicitly seek for forgive everyone who has wronged us, and pray that they will forgive us. The rabbis teach that praying to God for forgiveness on Yom Kippur seeks forgiveness for sins against God - failure to keep the sabbath, taking His name in vain - but forgiveness for sins against another person only comes when that other person has forgiven. So, we seek to forgive those that have hurt us, so that they may be completely forgiven for their wrongs.\n\nThere's a parallel to most other religions I can think of - while the greatest teachers of peace have learned to forgive their enemies even in the moment that they are being harmed, those of us who can't are still taught to forgive as much as possible, and called on to remember where we nurse grudges and let them heal.\n\nHope this helps.

I'm assuming you mean literature. Most Authors are liberals and they find ways to make their ideas look good. An example of this is the book from the 60's, Peyton Place. In the book, a man is committing incest with his daughter and the author manipulates us into cheering the doctor who performs an illegal abortion on her when she gets pregnant. What isn't brought up is the fact that her father could have been stopped if it was known that she was pregnant. Since it wasn't reported, he got away with it. Also, the humanity and innocence of the baby is totally ignored.      \nP.S. I LOVE spell check!
Both. Since they are in the funeral industry, they are happy to have the business. However, seeing the grief that people endure every day takes its toll. Very few morticians would say that they are happy to see people die, and caring for the dead can be somewhat draining due to the intensity of emotion shown by the survivors. But, to be realistic, every time someone dies, it puts food on the funeral director's table. That's the reality of the business. Death, for them, equals a paycheck.

'Those who believe and those who are Jews, and Sabaeans and Christians - whosoever believes in God and the Last Day and does good work - there shall no fear come upon them, neither shall they grieve.'\n\nSābi'ūn appears to be a coordinate with the accusative nouns before it, and should accordingly have been accusative, but it is nominative. Here again there is another (if less common) reading wa'l-sābi'īn making it accusative with no shift. Muslim scholars have expressed various views to explain the nominative sābi'ūn. \n\nSome see the nominative as justifiable because when inna is followed by an invariable noun (here al-ladhina), a following noun in conjunction could either be accusative governed by inna, or nominative, cancelling the government of inna. Rāzī prefers this view. Others see the nominative as marking a fresh sentence, with an unexpressed predicate, i.e. wa'l-sābi'ūn kadhālik, in the sense that those who believe, the Jews, the Christians, those who believe in God and the Last Day and do good work shall not fear nor shall they grieve, and this also applies to the sābi'ūn. As Khalīl and Sibawaih put it.\n\nThe sābi'ūn have not been co-ordinated with the foregoing groups to bring out that, of all the groups mentioned, they are the most forward. The intended effect of the verse is something like: 'God will accept repentance from these groups, should they believe and do good works and He will wash away their sins, so that even the sābi'ūn will be treated in this manner if they too believe'.
This is the difference between God and man. Man can only procreate, but God creates. This is one of the things that you have free will to have faith in and believe. No, God did not procreate with Mary in the same way that man procreates, He did create His Son in Mary through the immaculate conception of His Holy Spirit. Thus, Jesus was born in the Spirit, making him man and God.

"There is no indication that he committed the unpardonable sin, blasphemy of the Holy Spirit (Matthew 12:32).  \n\nHe did, no doubt, viloate the third commandment, as do all leaders who are implementors of commercial Christianity.  His choice of the 25th of December was probably more deliberate because he was a son worshiper.  That is the date Nynus (Tammuz) the sun god, the alleged son of Nimrod, was born. His motives were probably political even though he had the ""vision"" of the shields with crosses on them and the message was ""in this sign conquer""."

11 is a special number in numerology. It means that you ought to pay attention to what you really want to do.

My family sounds just like your family. It's frustraoccasionallybe very upsetting.

"The Bible does not forbid image making absolutely. This becomes clear when Exodus 20:4-5 and your quoted verses from Leviticus are interpreted in the context of other biblical passages. For example, the same Holy Spirit who inspired Moses to write these also inspired Moses to write Exodus 25:18-19 where God commands Moses to make statues of the cherubim (angels).\n\nIn Numbers 21:8 God also commanded Moses to make a bronze serpent (seraph), which the Israelites had to gaze upon in order to be healed. God used this image as his instrument. In John 3:14 we learn that image was a type of Christ.\n\nIn 2 Kings 18:4 (under Exechias) God commanded the destruction of the bronze serpent, but only after it had come to be worshipped. Up to that point it had been preserved for about 800 years.\n\nThe Bible provided other examples of the use of images. Garlands of fruit, flowers and trees were carved (Numbers 8:4; 1 Kings 6:18; 7:36). The kings throne rested on carved lions (2 Kings 10:19-20). Images of lions and bulls supported the basins in the temple (1 Kings 7:25,29). \n\nIn 1 Kings 6:23,27,29,30-31 we discover that within the sanctuary of the temple “he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high ... And he set the cherubims within the inner house. And he carved all the walls of the house round a out with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without... And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree. The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims made palm trees and open flowers.” God did not condemn this practice, rather he was pleased (1 Kings 9:3).\n\nThe Bible does forbid making or using images for the purpose of worshipping them: “you shall not bow down to them or serve them” (Exodus 20:5). This commandment is absolute. God forbids the worship of any idol, including statues, power, sex, money, and oneself. However, when Catholics kneel before a crucifix or a statue, the posture is a sign of reverence to God not the image.\n\nThe Catholic Church forbids the worship of idols or anything created. This is called the sin of idolatry. Only God is to be worshipped.\n\nAs to the crucifix -\n\n""And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life."" (John 3:14-15). This is the reason we have a crucifix which displays a crucified Christ still on the cross. 1 Corinthians 1:23 tells us that we preach Christ crucified (not Christ resurrected, or Christ in the manger). Jesus could not separate His resurrection from His death [Father, if it is your will take this cup from me (Luke 22:42)] and neither can we. It was through Christ's willing sacrifice upon the cross that heaven was opened for us and it became possible for us to share in His eternal resurrected life."

You should simply not associate with people who make fun of you and try to dominate you.  There's no magic retort which will suddenly turn them into caring considerate people.\n\nIf you find that most people make fun of you and try to dominate you, you might want to look into yourself for the answer.  It could be that you might be misinterpreting their actions.
That is really up the individual. Some people consider 4 weeks a long relationship and other consider 20+ years.  It really depends on who you are talking to.
This is connected primarily to faith in Allaah. All religions are agreed that it is not permissible for a woman to have intercourse with anyone except her husband. Among these religions are those which are undoubtedly of heavenly origin, such as Islam and the original versions of Judaism and Christianity. Belief in Allaah dictates submission to His rulings and laws, for Allaah is All-Wise and All-Knowing, He knows what is in the best interests of mankind. So we may understand the wisdom behind the ruling of sharee’ah, or we may not be able to grasp it.  \n\nWith regard to the permissibility of multiple spouses for men and its prohibition for women, there are several issues which are obvious to every intelligent person. Allaah has made woman like a vessel, but man is not like that. If a woman becomes pregnant (when she has had intercourse with a number of men at one time), the father can never be known. People’s lines of descent and lineage will be mixed up, families will be destroyed and children will be lost. Women will be burdened with so many children that they will be unable to bring them up and spend on their maintenance. Maybe women would find themselves forced to sterilize themselves, which would lead to the extinction of the human race. Moreover it is medically proven now that one of the major causes of the serious diseases which have become widespread, such as AIDS etc., is women having intercourse with more than one man, and the mixing of seminal fluids in the woman’s womb causes these lethal diseases. Hence Allaah has prescribed a waiting period (‘iddah) for a woman who has been divorced or whose husband has died, until enough time has passed for her womb and passages to be cleansed of any traces of her former husband, and the monthly period also has a role to play in this matter. Perhaps these brief pointers will dispense with the need for a lengthy discussion. If the purpose of the question is research for a university or other assignment, he may refer to the books which have been written on the topic of plural marriage (polygyny) and the wisdom behind it. And Allaah is the Source of strength.
"As a former assistant pastor, I have seen this type of dillemma, before. The problem is that most medium to large churches have become a source of entertainment, rather than inspiration. \n\nIt sounds like this church has a youth group of several dozen kids. They probably have a youth pastor for Wednesday night youth group, and a volunteer young adult to teach SS. This volunteer sounds like being seen as cool is more important to him than inspiring the kids to be moral.\n\nWhenever you frequent a place with large numbers of people you will find small groups of people that become the true source of inspiration, whether for good or evil. People cannot grow spiritually when they are simply members of an audience. We need companionship and friendship, a hand to hold, a shoulder to cry on. We will be naturally drawn to those we feel are most likely to accept us.\n\nThe problem is not one person, it is the entire empire of Christianity we have built in America. Jesus chose twelve disciples. These twelve were the ones he poured himself into. The common bond of this group was love. Yet, even among these twelve, one became a traitor. Can you imagine how many Judas could have influenced if he had his own SS class?\n\nThe problem is extremely complex, but the answer is simple. Find a few families that have children close to the ages of yours. Meet with them at your house, their house, the coffee house. Study with them, pray with them, talk with them. Don't try to start a class, just be friends. Have a BBQ together, go to the lake together, watch the game together. In other words; make friends, and let them be your support group. \n\nIf you want to attend a church on Sunday morning, fine. But, don't let that be the sole source of inspiration for your family. Jesus called his disciples ""friends""; not students, congregants, or members. You need a small group of like-minded families sharing the love of God, and the  journey of life, together."

Gremlins!\n\nHere is how to get rid of them...\nTechnological advances have gotten ahead of magic in many ways; there are few specific spells to protect modern machines. This is bad because gremlins just love machines. They get inside and cause all manner of mayhem. Gremlins are especially fond of appliances like washers and dryers, where they chew holes in your clothes, add inexplicable spots, and pilfer socks, leaving you with unmatched pairs. \nTo banish gremlins from your washer and dryer, first tie a long sock into three knots. Then add nine pinches of salt to the wash water. Wash and dry the load as usual. \n\nWhen you take the clothes out of the dryer, check the sock. If all the knots are untied, then all the gremlins are gone; and if any of the knots remain, there are still some gremlins left. Repeat the charm as needed to banish any remaining gremlins.

I do believe that she is in serious need of some love.  The person or thing she thinks loves her is only using her for their own selfish needs and she's either too stubborn or too niave to realize this.  I shall pray for her.  Hopefully God can open her eyes.  It's like that saying I heard once, love comes softly.  Well God will knock softly on the door to her heart, until she lets him in.
I had a digital camera and myself and two good friends drove to Greenwood Cememtary in Leavenworth, Ks at about midnight and as we drove we had a bad fealing so i just stuck the camera out the window as we sat there and snapped a picture.

"I'm an ex-catholic. Now before you label me heretical and pray for me, let me share some of my insights. Catholics are Christians. They believe that the catholic church and its traditions to be the only true church; the only one established by Christ and governed by His representative, the pope, since the time Peter was made head of the church. All other factions are heretical and not founded on the true faith. \n\nSome of their traditions and beliefs are not accepted by other denominations. Some even think of the church and/or the pope as the ""anti-Christ"". They do not agree with the praying to Mary and other saints. The doctrines and beliefs include degrees of sin, confessions to priests, rote prayers and ceremony. The church and it's traditions reign supreme, above independent interpretation of the bible. Penance is required for the forgiveness of sin. The fear of God seems to be more prevalent than the love of God. There are many websites that go into these and more in greater detail.\n\nPeople outside the faith look upon the past activities of the church (the Inquisition, crusades, etc.) as evidence of the power, greed and corruption of Christianity in general. The recent molestation inquiries and reports puts even more enmity against the church. \n\nThis is NOT how all Christians, or Catholics, feel or believe. Protestant churchgoers also have put their faith in their denominational dogmas. Some believe simply attending church is all that is required of them. Christ is the way, truth and life. May we all transcend the animosity and become one with and through Him."
I believe that people do drugs because they can't face reality.  alot of young people do it because it was introduced to them by a friend. However, a strong teen, can refuse it I believe that alot of it is what the parents instill in them. however, when it comes to an adult, the only reason I can possibly think of is stupidity. I'm sure that alot of them have personal problems,  it is a way to destroy your body, family, children, and everything areound you. so when someone does drugs they affect everyone, not just their selves.

"I am not sure what question you are really asking...\nThe American English morphed from British English, just ask in any language there a handful of dialects many times seperated by geographic regions and social class. (Chicago has 6 accents). So that is how Europeans can tell the difference, because your accent is not British. \n\nYou DO have an accent- even as one poster said, it could be the ""non-regional""/media accent. People with a good ear for languages and dialects (usually people who are multilingual) can detect accents easier than others who are monolingual. \n\nIt also could be that you developed more of your accent of your native region since you left. For some reason, I have noticed this phenomenon with a lot of Americans after living abroad for some years. For example, I grew up in the midwest, but nobody ever believed me because they said I didn't sound like it- but the longer I have lived away from the midwest I have noticed that I sound REALLY midwestern without hearing it at all!\n\nAlso, Europeans can spot Americans a mile away... it's the way we carry ourselves-- we smile a lot more and speak louder in public and often all they have to do is look at your clothes or your feet to know."

It is the social perception - based on thousands of years of observation - that women are able to act in entirely non-sexual behaviors while men do not. A man wearing women's clothing is perceived as being frustrated sexually, so frustrated that he is attempting to be attractive to other men in the hope/expectation of sex. However, women are not perceived as sex pursuers, and so are free to wear men's clothing - or any clothing they want. It is a double standard, but like most double standards with women and men, we can be thankful for it.
"Duchess of Windsor: twice divorced American named Wallis Simpson who married England's King Edward VIII (1937). He had to abdicate his throne because monarchs were not allowed to marry divorced people. They married, were banished from the royal family, moved to the Caribbean and spent most of the rest of their lives there. The only time Wallis ever saw the royal family after the marriage was at her husband, the former King Edward VIII's funeral. They were not treated well by the Family, including the Queen. They saw Edward as disloyal to his country and not taking his responsibility as King seriously because he married Wallis.\n\nDuchess of York: Sarah Ferguson married Queen Elizabeth's 3rd child/2nd son Prince Andrew and became Duchess of York upon marriage (1986). She was hounded from the beginning because of her boisterous nature, overspending, HORRIBLE wardrobe, and for cheating on her husband. Was eventually banished from the royal family and all royal functions. The only royal function she was allowed to attend since their divorce was Princess Diana's funeral.\n\nDuchess of York: Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother was the last person before ""Fergie"" to have held the title of Duchess of York. She and her husband, Prince Albert (who upon his brother's abdication in the 1930's became King George VI) were the Duke and Duchess of York. She became Queen when Edward abdicated and her husband was crowned and her two children were suddenly 1st and 2nd in line for the throne. \n\nDuchess of Cornwall: Camilla Parker-Bowles. I think we all know HER story. Because she married Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, she is technically the Princess of Wales (Diana's title) but the Queen bestowed a new title upon her to avoid any uproar among Diana loyalists."

If there is a judgement as we think, I believe our entire lives will be considered - not just the state we are in before we die. Alot of people who regularly did awful things to others, never did a thing to correct the problems they caused, but thought asking God for forgiveness one time was sufficient - probably went to hell. I.e., you can fool people, but try fooling God.
Unfortunately for a segment of people, religion is a means to control and questions are seen as a threat to their control. There are those who require your unyielding conformity and any sign of individual thinking is frowned upon. Beware of those type of people. God gave you a mind and it would be a sin not to use it. Moses asked questions and got answers. Only the insecure and those with something to hide fear an inquiring mind.
"I read the entire article.  I had no idea that scientology was so....unhealthy.  As to why intelligent people embrace it, I believe it's because they have a need to feel important, and this cult feeds you this.  Like a starving person, everything is eaten.  These e-meters are just their way of making sure no one gets out, and if they want out, they can track the person through their sessions.  I feel so sorry for anyone taken in by this, because now this cult has the resources and celebrity power to keep you in.

She believed I was not good enough for her son, but she never took the time to find out about me and he was weak when it came to defend me so we divorced and he paid for it!

Baptism symbolizes the washing away of your sins and your spiritual birth as a christian. From this point on, you are striving to live a clean, spotless life for Christ. Baptism recognizes the fact that he is your savior and your source of guidance. Although you will commit sin again, you now know that you can ask forgiveness and expect his help in overcoming sin in the future.

"I like the New Revised Standard Version quite well.  When I learned some Hebrew, I soon was able to see that the NRSV was the truest to the original language and meaning.  It is not perfect, but I found it to be the most honest in conveying the original text.\n\nI have further been convinced of this because when I began to major in religious studies in college, all of my professors always recommend the NRSV because of its accuracy.  Therefore, it wasn't just me!  It apparently really is good.\n\nI also like the New Jewish Publication Society's version. \n\nThe KJV has a magnificent poetic quality that really cannot be easily replaced.  It just sounds pleasing to the ear!  And it is often the text we have memorized as children, and so nothing else sounds right sometimes.  Psalm 23 for example, just has to be KJV if you want that poetic, beautiful style.\n\nHowever, if you want a better view into what the original may have sounded like, you may be better off with NRSV.  There is no ""Thou"" in Hebrew.  There is just ""ata.""  It didn't sound flowery to the people who used it.  It sounded more like ""you"" sounds to us.  It is not so formal.\nThis is not to say that the original Biblical languages have no poetic value.  On the contrary, they DO, and as always it is difficult to translate poetic quality into another language.  The Hebrew loves plays on words.  You usually have to read the footnotes to catch these when you are reading a translation."

UN pays their volunteers reasonably well.  And you also get diplomatic status everywhere you go.  The perks are not all monetary in the beginning but eventually if you pursue a career in development it may also pay you much.  If you're into cultural diversity, travelling to remote places, charity, challenging yourself to contribute something to society or if you want to be a politician then that is a good start.  It's not all humanitarian work, you also learn how governments prioritize the use of their money and how they tie aid with certain interests.

They are long oval pans which can sit across two burners - big enough to take 'the one that got away'!  \n\nThey have lids, and my stepmother's is a pretty fish kettle as it is shiny stainless steel.\n\nPerhaps the phrase comes about because one thing you would never do is cook two different types of fish in the same kettle as their flavours would taint each other.

I used to be a spoilt little rich girl who got everything i asked for. i just went to my Dad and asked nicely and i would have a new car or those new shoes. Then my parents divorced, my mum had her leg amputated. my dad made a huge amount of debts and i was left to fend for myself. As hard as it was at the time, it was probably the best thing that ever happened to me. It was a huge slap in the face and one i badly needed. Now my mum is financially ok. my dad is doing better than ever. I have my own money that i earned myself. I really have the greatest appreciation for what i have. I wouldn't change the past one bit.(except i would rather my mum had not lost her leg)  I shudder to think how i would be now if things had stayed the same.

"Actually the concept of the Trinity is completely unrelated to the statement made in the scripture quoted.\n\nThe Trinity doctrine does not establish that there IS a Father, Son and Holy Spirit, but that they are three entities in a singular existance.  There is NO scripture in the Bible that supports this view.\n\nTriads of Gods have existed in pagan religions dating back to ancient Bablyon (and possibly further).  The Trinity was incorporated into Christianity by Constantine, who was not even a Christian.  Constantine worshiped Ra, the sun god, and eventually converted to Christianity on his deathbed.\n\nThe Trinity has been maintained by the Catholic Church ever since, and was passed on to the Protestant Churches when they split away.  Nevertheless, there is absolutely NO scriptural support for the Trinity, and there are pleanty of scriputes that would seem to contradict it.\n\nFor example, when asked when he would return, Jesus told his Apostles that ""no man knows the day and hour, but only the Father"".  How could Jesus have not known himself if he was actually God?\n\nAlso Jesus said on a few occasions that ""the Father"" is greater than he is, and he himself prayed to God on many occasions.  The night before he was put to death, he asked that ""this cup"" be taken away from him, but only if it was Gods will to do so.  Clearly it was his, but not Gods.\n\nI think if you examine Jesus's relationship to God you will find the truth in this matter, which is that the Trinity is utter rubbish."

Christians believe that a man named Jesus died on the cross, and there is more proof about that event than Julius Caeser, but I can see your point about how some Christians make Christianity seem like you say. But not all Christians are like that. I am a Christian, you might be too, but there is no danger whatsoever of people reducing it to subjective truth because Christian's faith is too strong for it fall to that.

Think of it like this. I wouldn't call it so much culturally insensitive as it is stupid, because if they were culturally insensitive, they would make fun of you because your race. Saying things slow, they are more DUMB because they see the race that you are and they automatically think they need to speak slow. That has nothing to do with cultural insensitivity, that has to do with the amount of intelligence a person has. I used to live in Texas. Trust me, some people, depending on where your living, are quite slow and dumb, so I wouldn't think much about that particular thing.

The developement of the Catholic Church makes for interesting historical reading.  Various doctrines to which it holds can be pinpointed to certain dates and people.  For example, the concept of sprinkling instead of immersing for baptism goes to the late 3rd century.  A man named Novatian was on what he thought was his deathbed, and wanted to be baptized, so they sprinkled him. This is the first record of sprinkling in history.  When he recovered, he wanted to be made a bishop.  The entire church was outraged, because they all asserted that he wasn't baptized correctly.  So he was immersed, and became a bishop.  \n\nAnother interesting sidebar in the developement of Catholic doctrine was the Quartodeciman controversy, in the middle of the second century.  Because of the Bar Kochba revolt in Palestine, the Roman government forbade all Jews from being anywhere near Jerusalem.  The Sanhedrin was no longer able to produce its religious calendar.  Not only did this impact the Jews, but it impacted Christianity as well, because up to that point the Christians depended upon the Jewish calendar to determine when to observe Passover, to honor the death, burial, and resurrection of Messiah.  So the bishop of Rome (I believe it was Anastasius at the time, I could be wrong, and I am too lazy to look it up), decided that because Messiah was raised on the first day of the week, the Passover would be observed on a Sunday every year.  This eventually developed into Easter.  Anyhow, Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna, and the eastern churches initially rejected this move.  Polycarp, who was taught by the Apostle John, said that John told him that Passover must be observed on 14 Nissan every year, regardless of upon what day of the week it fell.  Polycarp did not deny that Christ arose on a Sunday, and Anastasius did not deny that Christ was crucified on Passover, the controversy was about when the Lord's Supper should be observed.\n\nThe development of the doctrine that infants are born sinful can be traced back to Augustine, bishop of Hippo, in the mid 4th century.\n\nThe introduction of musical instruments can be dated in the 600's A.D.\n\nThe developement of the current ecclesiastical arrangement of the Catholic Church is quite fascinating.  Initially, each congregation was autonomous, and governed by a board of men known simply as presbyters (elders).  This office was also known as the episcopoi (overseers/bishops), or poimoine (pastors).  This office was quite distinct from that of the evangelists (preachers) and deacons (ministers/servants).  Anyhow, Ignatius, the bishop of Antioch in the mid to late second century, was the first to suggest that only one of the men be called the episcopos, and the rest called presbyters.  Up to that point, no one presbyter/episcopos had any more authority than any other.  The word episcopos, eventually was shortened to piscops, then to bischop, to our current form of bishop.  The term presbyters was eventually shortened to prester, then prest, and in its current form of priest.  What started to happen was that if a city had several congregations, the bishop of most affluentual of them began to gain authority over the others.  Soon, all the smaller congregations dropped the bishops, but retained their presbyters, and acknowledged the authority of the bishop of the leading congregation in the town.  Soon, there were five prominent congregations throughout Christendom: Jerusalem, Antioch, Constantinople, Alexandria, and Rome, and each of these vied for the prominence, but none was willing to give any foot to the other.  With the advent of the splitting of the Roman Empire into east and west, the barbarian incursions, and the advent of Islam, only two congregations of these powerhouses remained to have any influence: Rome and Constantinople.  The story of their bickering back and forth with each other, and how I believe in 1054, thereabouts (can't remember the exact date), the Bishop of Rome and the
"I don't go to church, even though I believ in God, and Jesus Christ, because I was tired of going to church and listening to people talk about how they are a better christian than someone else.  God is the only one who can judge us. All these people talking about how good they are... I don't need that.  Also, I feel that we need to read between the lines of many things in the bible.  Ways change.  Just because it was like 2000+ years ago, doesn't mean that it has to be that way now.  Many things in the bible are the way they are for societal reasons. Not because God ""said so."" The bible was written by men, and is then questionable. The easiest way to get people to do or not do something, is to make it ""Holy Law."" If I'm passing on, orally, the bible and I feel like saying you can't eat pigs, because I think they are dirty.  Whose to stop me from saying, ""God, said this!""  If God is everywhere why do I have to go to church to worship Him?  Can't I go up to the mountains where I can see His work, and worship on my own there?  I have a beautiful wife and a baby boy.  I can see God's work right there.  I don't need to go to church have someone tell me, about His work.  Why am I going to give money to the church ""for God?"" God doesn't need money. Does anyone else think it odd that televangelists and some real preachers are driving around in Cadillacs and Mercedes', and BMWs?  While their ""flock"" drives clunkers. I know not all are like that, but you get my idea.   I believe in God.  I've lost faith in the church."

I lived in San Diego for 21 years.  I only went looking for Black's Beach once, but never did find it.  It was very notorious.  The media was always trying to stir up controversy because they knew it was good for ratings.

In the beginning, God did not make people to be deffective.  They were formed in His image, and therefore, perfect.  Over time, we have sinned and our birth deffects are a result of this sin along with poor diets and a bunch of other stuff we have brought on ourselves.  Haven't you noticed that new diseases are being discovered all the time.  Then once they are discovered, it is just a matter of time before we find them everywhere.  Some are from enviromental factors such as pollution.  Others are from the junk we put in our food, like preservatives.  And don't even get me started on prescription drugs.  We have doctors telling us to put poisons in our bodies, in the name of medicine, all the time!
"Wow, I must comment on Petermaxey's assertion that ""Charity"" is a unique characteristic of Christianity.  That is so far from the truth, and I can't for the life of me figure out what made Petermaxey think this was the case.  I believe that that ideal, of selfless service and willingness to suffer for others without regard to what their particular religion is, is one of the greatest teachings of any religion, and thankfully, it is a universal ideal.  It is taught most wonderfully in Mahayana Buddhism, with the example of the Bodhisattva who endures rebirth and suffering until all come to enlightenment.  This is a huge part of my own religion, Hinduism, and I know it to be a teaching of Judaism as well, because I once believed in Judaism.  You will find this most wonderful teaching even among those who have NO religion.  Yes, Christianity has it, but thank God, they are not the only ones.\n\nI noticed that on one of the questions here at YA, Christians were most often saying that they would not suffer hell if by doing so, they could save other folks.  Now, I cannot condemn someone for saying this, because that would indeed be a horrendous sacrifice, but then on the other hand, isn't that level of selfless suffering for others precisely what would mark a person as having reached the highest level of true love and selflessness?  I answered that question that I HOPE that I would be willing to suffer hell, if by doing so, I could save others from that torment.  I don't know if I am so brave, but I hope I would be.  \n\nOk, as you can see from my response to Petermaxey, I DO believe that religions do have a common thread.  And this goal to become selfless, altruistic, compassionate beings is one of those threads.  Some religions may exemplify this more than others, but in the end, we are all humans, and as human beings, we all have this same essence of our being, and it is that that we wish to realize.  \n\nOk, to answer a question that you asked me on one of my questions, I have been a Hindu for about 3 and a half to 4 years.  I converted because I studied religion, and my soul was drawn to Hinduism because of its excellent path of devotion.  I have always wanted to just be a loyal and devoted servant and friend of God.  And I had explored other religions but I kept coming back to Hinduism because through it, I was able to express my feeling of devotion to God, and to further it, in a way that was very natural to me.  I love the worship practices, of offering flowers, fruit, and incense, etc.  Those are the most natural outer expressions of the feeling of devotion and love of God that I have on the inside.\n\nI love the Scriptures of Hinduism.  The Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Ramayana, the Puranas.  In all these, I have found some of the purest teachings of religion.  They just strike me as true and magnificent.\n\nHindus differ on many things, and one of those things is whether someone can convert to Hinduism.  Obviously, I believe you can convert!  And most Hindus I have met also believe that one can convert, and welcome me as a full Hindu.  There will be those I am sure who will not agree, but to me, that is not that important.  I practice Hinduism, go to a Hindu Temple, read the Hindu Scriptures, and I feel like a Hindu.  But it doesn't matter what you call me so much, or whether all Hindus accept me as a Hindu.  What matters is that through my religious devotional practices, I become the best human I can be and strengthen my relationship to God. \n\nDoes God consider me a ""Hindu""?  I don't know!  Maybe to God, there is no ""Jew or Gentile, no Greek, or Hindu""!  Maybe we are all just people.  And the soul, and God do not care what my ""religion"" is.  They care whether I am fulfilling my soul's purpose."
"Energy cannot be created (by humans or in the ""natural universe) or destroyed.. This leads me to believe that the energy of the human soul is conserved and reincarnated into another human being..\n\n*****Conservation of energy is possibly the most important, and certainly the most practically useful of several conservation laws in physics. It states that the total inflow of energy into a system must equal the total outflow of energy from the system, plus the change in the energy contained within the system. In other words, energy can be converted from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. This excludes the possibility of perpetuum mobile of the first kind.\n\nLaw of conservation of energy is a mathematical consequence of continious translational symmetry of time (no moment of time is different than any other).****************\n------------------------------\nThe Structure of the Soul \n\nA human being on earth unites two parts -- a body and a soul. Each part is extremely complex in structure and consists of multiple components. While the body's structure is reasonably well understood, the structure of the soul is a mystery many tried to analyze. One Talmudic opinion divides it into three major segments: \n--------\nNefesh: the lower, animal part, related to the instincts and to the reactions of the body.\n\nRuach: the spirit, or the middle soul, linked to the understanding of morality and the ability to differentiate between good and evil.\n\nNeshama: the higher soul, linked to the intellect, and separating humanity from all other life forms. It allows the person to be aware of God, and to participate in the afterlife. \n--------\nAccording to the Zohar, which leans toward a mystical view of the universe, two additional soul parts may be developed by very few, select individuals who have the capacity of sublime levels of intuitive cognition: \n\nChayyah -- the part of the soul that is aware of the divine life force.\n\nYehidah -- the highest part of the soul, capable of achieving full union with God. \n\nWhen the body dies, the soul components come apart, and each segment follows a separate road. The lower parts must undergo purification; the higher parts aim to join with God. Nefesh remains with the body for about twelve months, guarding the grave and occasionally roaming the earth for the purpose of learning. Ruach goes to Gehinnom (Purgatory), to purge itself from the sins the person committed in life, and prepare for the future life of the soul. Neshama goes to the lower Gan Eden (Paradise), Chayyah and Yehida return to Upper Gan Eden. \n\nThe Stages of the Journey \n\nIn rabbinic teachings, Olam Haba took many shapes and forms. To some, it is simply our own fully physical world, made better after the coming of the Messiah. To others it means Paradise, a spiritual place. Often, a journey is described, where the soul will encounter certain stages: \n\nHibbut ha-kever (the suffering of the grave) \n\nA Jew who truly believes in God has little fear of dying. He sees death as a simple transition from one life to another. God will be the same there as He is here, and that is all that matters because in either life the one goal is to serve Him. The separation of body and soul is as simple, according to Talmudic transition, as removing a hair out of a glass of milk. \n\nTo the less than perfectly pure, the separation can be more difficult. The soul of the worldly Jew strongly identifies with the body -- an erroneous but powerful notion that makes watching the body undergo decay and be eaten by worms extremely unpleasant. However, this mental agony serves a purpose; it awakens the soul from its wrong assumptions and allows the separation from the body to occur. \n\nDumah (the angel of silence) \n\nIf Hibbut ha-kever is still insufficient to separate body and soul, a great danger looms -- the decay and disintegration of the consciousness of the soul. At some point after death, the angels summon the Je"
"That's a really awesome question! Thanks for asking it!\n\nMahatma Mohandas Karmachand Gandhi.\n\nWhy?\n\nEver since I was little and first heard about Gandhi I have admired him, what he did, his courage, and his outlook on life. \n\nAs one friend said after I converted to Hinduism ""somehow this doesn't surprise me since you've always admired Gandhi and he was a Hindu."" Although, Gandhi didn't really claim to be just a Hindu, he said he was also a Christian, Jew, Muslim, etc...and I feel the same way. I've studied those religions, have friends of those religions (and others: Pagan, Buddhist, Baha'i, etc)."

It is a hard choice that would be difficult to commit to until you are in that pisition. Teh reality is that adopting an american baby is far harder than going overseas. I am sure many couples go overseas because of the time and hassle it takes here.
Yeah, it's a placeholder text. It's derived from a text written in Latin, but it doesn't really mean anything, those are just some random words. Anyways, if you're interested, check out the article on Wikipedia.
Gen. 2:16\nFor the human family to be genuinely happy, they must have a good relationship with God—one that is voluntary, not forced. (Deuteronomy 30:15-20; Joshua 24:15) Jehovah wants obedience and worship that come from the heart, out of love. (Deuteronomy 6:5) So in the garden of Eden, God. made a restriction that afforded the first man an opportunity to prove his heartfelt loyalty. “From every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction,” God told Adam, “but as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will positively die.” (Genesis 2:16, 17) It was a simple test. Jehovah forbade Adam to eat the fruit of just one tree out of all the trees in the garden. That tree symbolized the all-wise Creator’s right to decide what is good and what is bad. The first man conveyed this God-given command to his wife.\n\nGen. 2:17\nThere is only one true Source for standards of morality—the Creator of mankind, Jehovah God. Soon after creating the first man, Adam, Jehovah God laid this command upon the man: “From every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction. But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will positively die.” (Genesis 2:16, 17) Jehovah God gave the tree that unique name to denote his exclusive right to decide what is good and what is bad for his creatures. God’s standards of good and bad thus became the basis for judgment, or evaluation, of a person’s deeds, outlook, and personality traits. Without such standards we could not correctly distinguish right from wrong.\n\nThe command concerning the tree of the knowledge of good and bad set before Adam and Eve a choice—to obey or not to obey. For them, virtue meant obedience to that command. In time, Jehovah further revealed what pleases him and what displeases him, and he had this recorded for us in the Bible. Cultivating virtue, then, entails our conforming to Jehovah’s righteous standards set out in the Scriptures.
I don't know cause there is a blur, Japan is very Westernized and so is South Korea and Taiwan. China is moving that way. If you are taking historically then Asians are more Team Oriented while Western is more for the individual.
blacks? you mean african american? what race when you say white.... italian, russian, irish? I think if researchers stopped the classification of race by colour would be a good start.
If god loved us so much, why would he set us up for failure from the get-go? Why would he even go through that whole thing with Adam and Eve? And why would he then wait several thousand years to send some sort of symbol of his love? And why would bad things happen? And why would he constantly tell his people to commit genocide? Why would he lie and show wrath? Why would he create evil in the first place? To test us? That's absurd. That reminds me of an ex-girlfriend who always use to test me with petulant questions about whether I loved her or not. Is that who god is supposed to remind us of?\n\nIn short, does god hate us? No. He doesn't exist.
Evil is the antithesis of Good. \n\nGod is Good. \n\nIn short, evil is the absence of God...

Your soul will await judgement along with all the others that have died. Be good so when all your sins are seen up there for all to see you dont get embarrased. God forgives it all. Ask for his love and forgiveness and live a Godly life and it will all be ok for you.
Have your daughter watch the Cosby Show and Family Matters too, that should balance things a bit for her. As for all of the racist responses... that's really sad. I am glad I live in the Bronx where we all love one another.
It would suck if you like to get wasted and not remember what you did the night before, boink everyone you want to and end up with who knows how many STD's, smoke till your lungs rot, or only care about yourself. So pretty much the same that it would be if Jesus ran the country.

"Dear Friend its nice question.\nI have ready few responses and lol, becoz some of them are saying dat Religions can't b proved wrong.\nOne Must keeps scientific thinking and try to become Rationalist. No Religion in the world is totally right. Religions make our thinking non-scientific. They even give us wrong, unsuitable morals and teachings. No matter which ever religion it may be, Even Christianity, Hinduism, Islamic, Sikhism, etc.\nPeople are believing God because there religious books says God exists, and they follow there religion blindly. Theists never Put questions on there religious teachings, why ?? Great Scientist Bruno was killed by Christians becoz he told the fact (which was against Bible) dat earth is revolving around the sun, but today we know the fact.\nAccording Hindu Religious book Ramayana the earth is standing on the head of Elephant. Who is fool here, try to prove it true ??\n\nAt the end there are few links to ""Tear Religions"" and See wat's inside it, Must visit them.\n\nscience is the only source of knowledge, and that religion is simply a distraction from the correct pursuit of information. \nAt Last i just wanna make a request to everyone just read matter, articles, books etc. based on Rationalism and decide urself dat wat's the value of Science/ Scientific thinking and where religious thinking or Religions stands.... \n\nHere is link for Bible is a dangerous moral guide:- http://www.edwardtbabinski.us/feedback/j...\n\nHere's another link where u can read abt.

"Life is continuous (there is only death of the body) so it's not possible to RE-incarnate. BUT, as spirits I believe we do have human embodiment as many times as it takes to learn the lessons needed to advance spiritually. We all have the same lessons to learn and we will all learn them, at our own pace. We agree before we are born that we will take on a certain lifetime in order to learn a particular ""lesson"". Yes, I believe I've been born many times. We are all spirits having human experiences in order to advance."
"Some thoughts:\n\n""PORNOGRAPHY IS A SIN"" \n\nPorn is not mentioned in the Bible. Remember, photography did not exist when the book was written. Most Fundamentalists, however, base their objection to pornography on two biblical references. \n\nIn Genesis 3:7, Adam and Eve committed the first sin, and, says the Bible, they suddenly realized they were naked and tried to cover themselves. Fundamentalists point to this as proof that nudity is bad. This, of course, makes no sense since Adam and Eve were naked before they ever sinned by eating of the ""fruit of the tree."" God created humans naked, and they lived naked until they sinned. Some want to claim, however, that nudity became a sin after ""the fall."" And, in fact, in Leviticus 18 we find a whole chapter dedicated to why the people of Israel should not see their family members nude (though the actual words used indicate this means having sex with them, not just seeing them naked). However, in chapter 19, verse 27, we also are told not to cut the hair over our ears, or even to trim our beards, and earlier in the same book we're told not to eat pork or birds (uh oh, no more fried chicken!). \n\nWhy do Fundamentalists pick out those parts of Leviticus that they want to be sins and ignore the rest? Good question. Leviticus was not meant for you and me. It was meant for ancient Israel. Its rules were designed to rid a nomadic population of their diseases, not as a rulebook for all humans. But, interestingly enough, even if we decided to apply all the rules of Leviticus to our lives, if we never cut the hair over our ears and never ate pork or turkey again, and never saw any of our family members naked, the book never says it's a sin to see a non-family member naked. In fact, nowhere in the Bible do we read that nudity, by its very nature, is wrong. \n\nNudity, according to the Fundamentalist however, causes people to lust, which according to Matthew 5:28 is a sin. And pornography, that is, images or stories of people engaged in sexual activity, is specifically designed to make people lust, so its existence must, by default, be a sin according to these people. The Bible, itself, however, would have to be considered pornography by this definition. In Song of Solomon 7:7-8, Solomon describes how satisfying the breasts of his lover are, and then tells how he longs to take hold of them and how he wants to climb onto the woman. And in Ezekiel 23:1-20 we read of two women with insatiable sexual appetites, and we are told of how men with penises the size of donkeys' would pour out horse-like quantities of, well, their ""issue"" upon these women's breasts. If viewing pornography is a sin, then reading the Bible would also a sin considering how much pornography is in it. Point out these verses to your Fundamentalist friends and see how much they sweat. \n\nYou can read more about the pornography in the Bible at: http://elroy.net/ehr/vchip.html"
"None of these answers are remotely close and they seem well..stupid. I am a Muslim woman and I don't feel oppressed at any time. I wear what I wear do to my love and fear of Allaah the Orginator of the Heaven and earth and all that is between them) my Lord. I could care less as to what anyone thinks and I certainly am not doing this with reguards to a man but for my Lord so some of you who answered this question have no idea of what your talking about and are speaking without Knowledge as usual. Don't hate on us because we have respect for ourselves as instilled in us by Allaah to have shame and be pious. Quetioner be carefull of what kinds of Questions with reguards to Islam you post here. News Flash for those of you who don't know why we cover ourself here is an article on that very thing....\n\nVirtues of Hijab (The modest dress of the Muslim woman)\n____________________________________\n\n1. An act of obedience.\nThe hijab is an act of obedience to Allah and to his prophet (pbuh), Allah\nsays in the Qur'an: `It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and\nHis messenger have decreed a matter that they should have an option in\ntheir decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, has indeed strayed in a plain error.' {Surah 33:36}. Allah also said: 'And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things) and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc) and not to show off their adornment except what must (ordinarily) appear thereof, that they should draw their veils over their Juyubihinna (ie their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms). {Surah 24:31} Juyubihinna: The respected scholars from As-Salaf As-Saleh (righteous predecessors) differed whether the veil cover of the body must include the hands and face or not. Today, respected scholars say that the hands and face must be covered. Other respected scholars say it is preferable for women to cover their whole bodies.\n\n2. The Hijab is IFFAH (Modesty).\nAllah (subhana wa'atala) made the adherence to the hijab a manifestation for chastity and modesty. Allah says: 'O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) over their bodies (when outdoors). That is most convenient that they should be known and not molested.' {S33:59} In the above Ayaah there is an evidence that the recognition of the apparent beauty of the woman is harmful to her. When the cause of attraction ends, the restriction is removed. This is illustrated in the case of elderly women who may have lost every aspect of attraction. Allah (swt) made it permissible for them to lay aside their outer garments and expose their faces and hands reminding, however, that is still better for them to keep their modesty.\n\n3. The hijab is Tahara (Purity)\nAllah (swt) had shown us the hikma (wisdom) behind the legislation of the hijab: `And when you ask them (the Prophet's wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and their hearts.' {Surah 33:53}The hijab makes for greater purity for the hearts of believing men and women because it screens against the desire of the heart. Without the hijab, the heart may or may not desire. That is why the heart is more pure when the sight is blocked (by hijab) and thus the prevention of fitna (evil actions is very much manifested. The hijab cuts off the ill thoughts and the greed of the sick hearts:`Be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy or evil desire for adultery, etc) should be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner.' {Surah 33:32}\n\n4. The hijab is a Shield\nThe prophet (pbuh) said: ""Allah, Most High, is Heaven, is Ha'yeii (Bashful),Sit'teer (Shielder). He loves Haya' (Bashfulness) and Sitr (Shielding; Covering)."" The Prophet (pbuh) also said: ""Any woman who takes off her clothes in other than her husband'"

Nope my angry friend.  Jesus told parables, a story with a real point to it.  You can't get around that, and you have to figure out the parable. \nMatthew 13:3  He spoke about a sower then in Matthew 13:10 he explains why  and in 13:18 he explains it to the disciples.  \nWhy are your writings so angry looking, I have no animosity towards you.

"It is NOT a stupid question.\n\nThe ONLY celebration which Jesus commanded his followers to keep is the yearly memorial of his death, which happens after sundown on the date corresponding to the 14th day of Nisan on the Jewish calendar.

Peace in this world is not a matter of everyone believing the same things.  It's a matter of accepting the fact that everyone thinks differently, and not trying to prove who is right and who is wrong.  The reason why there is not peace in the world today, is because there are too many people who can't accept the differences of others.

It's a very good movie, but that's nature and it's how things are.  I think we will say that for everyone or animal that we feel sorry for.  What about the kids in those third world countries, that fight for food in garbage cans or the dumps and eat things that we would not even look at.  Yet you see people throw food away like it was sh*t without a second though.  It's the way things are.

It didn't religions are forming today.  They constantly form and dissolve.  Some religions provide a comprehensive view of the world to all personality types, are self-reflective, and adaptive; most do not.  If you look at the major religions, then you will see the properties.  Localized failures, such as the Reformation, are the result of rigidity in one of the above characteristics.  Heresies, in a given religion, are the result of not the religion being wrong but the failure to stretch and adapt to current needs in favor of strict orthodoxy.  Most heresies have a short life of a few hundred years.

No, if you allow them to have their own email accounts, then you show them that you trust them. If you go checking that email, you break that trust. If your kids find out, they will not understand. If you suspect that they are doing something that they shouldn't, ask. Keep tabs on where they go and who they're with. Call to make sure that they're where they say they are. It is possible to do this without snooping.

"planet dan - the Bible very specifically says that the slave is ""PROPERTY.""  It says that if a slave owner beats his slave so badly that the slave goes unconcious for days, but then wakes up, the owner receives NO punishment for, ""he is his property.""\n\nFor those of you believe that the New Testament nullifies all this, I do not understand how you make sense of the fact that God ever gave this law in the first place!  Was God cruel in ""Old Testament"" times?  Did he suddenly have a change of heart 2000 years ago?\n\nAnd saying the Buddhist faith is lazy is about the most inaccurate thing I have ever heard.  Buddhists meditate and this is NO easy task.  In fact, it is probably the most difficult thing, to gain control of one's mind and to work on their own inner traits and become more compassionate and good people without the negative traits of anger, etc.\n\nBuddhism is hard work, but it is worth every bit of it."

That depends. Most of the above answers referring to the roots of German and French are quite right--German is closer to English. On the other hand, having learned both languages (French is my second, German my third), I would like to remind you of one thing: the German grammatical system is quite complicated. German nouns can be one of three genders (masc., fem., and neuter), and there are also several cases (ie: genitive, ablative, nominative, accusative). In order to speak any semblance of good German, you have to know the genders of the nouns you are using, and also how these gender decline (ie, how they change when they change case, eg: der changes to den, etc.).\n\nHowever, if you have studied Latin (which also has declensions, etc) then German grammar will be a breeze. Otherwise, if I were you, I'd take French. \n\nGood luck!

Well, number one, succefully is actually spelled wrong. Look it up in the dictionary. So your influence with the HIPHOP culture must be taking root well. Besides violence and rape, women are being called prostitutes - basically by you and your buds. So this question is something an idiot would ask.\nWhy don't you TRY to get an education and do something good for the world instead of demeaning women. HIPHOP is KILLING America. You're a prime example.

Scientific evidence has demonstrated that the universe IS constntly expanding. There is also evidence to suggest that at one point the universe was nothing but a single atom-speck,, and that something (The Big Bang) made it expand outward, creating the outer rim of the universe.\n\nSo we can reasonably assume that at one point the universe was essentially non-existent, and that something made it into what it is now.\n\nAs for the creation of God, the Bible doesn't cover it. Since that's the only source of Christian information we can accept as true, we *don't know* how God was created. But to answer your question: I believe it's easier for one being to have existed forever instead of our universe having existed forever. Scientific evidence supports the former and rejects the latter.

i guess females enjoy a joy ride once in a while and as long as they love the guy it doesnt bother them whether he is a gangster or bad.In their eyes they might see him differently but maybe to others he is bad.A lot of gangsters and bad boys have a soft side to them but society expects the worst from them and females probably think being bad or having a bad side is cool or risky.everyone has different tastes.

Hurricane Katrina is just one of the natural disasters that Jesus said will be increasingly more numerous as the world comes closer to the end and His return.\nMark 13:\n5 And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you: \n6 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. \n7 And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet. \n8 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be EARTHQUAKES in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows. \n9 But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them. \n10 And the gospel must first be published among all nations. \n\nIf it landed there because of a particular judgment of God on that city, we will never know unless He tells us.  He judged the world with a flood, Soddom and Gomorrah with fire and brimstone, Jericho by the children of Israel, Miriam with leprocy and a host of others.  \nHe told us why he judged those things.  He hasn't said why there was a hurricane in Katrina.  If it was because of wickednes, then everyone better prepare because there isn't a nation left that isn't wicked.
NO WAY!!!! if two people love each they should have sex to express that love. And if they want to be kinky or whatever that is their right.\n\nOur government and all religious organizations have NO right to tell anyone what they can and can not do in the bedroom.
At least for me, I know that I have at least tried things sexually that I might not have been interested in if I did not view pornography.
"Laura's suggestion is interesting.  I'm sure it works for some but personally I hate when people ask me lots of questions in order to make conversation.  Therefore I also avoid asking others too many questions because you never know when you're hitting a sore spot.  Like ""what do you do""?  They could have just been laid off, or my favorite: people ask me if I have kids, and since we've been trying for awhile and not yet succeeded, it is a painful question to be asked.  Anyway, so I try to avoid asking questions and instead I make conversation based on sharing the present moment with the person.  The most classic is commenting on the weather, or if we're at a party, ""hey, i like this music"", or ""the food's really good"".  I find this usually creates a natural comfort level when i share about the present experience with the person because that is what is usually on peoples' mind that very moment. I used to have a lot of problems with this, and read something about grounding oneself, using our five senses to experience our surroundings.  Usually when we allow ourselves to just ""BE"" instead of feeling anxiety about what we will say, it comes more naturally to talk, because thoughts just pop in our head.  Like if i'm just ""BEING"" i may notice something around me and naturally say it to the person next to me, like, ""that baby is so cute"", or ""look at that gorgeous sunset""... I find people usually respond to this natural way of expressing oneself.\n\nHope this helps. it's helped me, but takes practice. I'm sure you also know there are many books out there about socializing so you may want to check out your local library too.\n \nGood Luck."

"For ancient Egyptians, the ankh meant life.\n\nFor alchemists, its another way of writing the planetary symbol for Venus.\n\nFor Hermetics, it represents the union of the male and female principles.\n\nCoptic Christians adopted it as their preferred cross, to remind the world that Akhenaten - who also extensively used this symbol - was obstensibly the creator of monotheism.\n\nEarly Greek Christians sometimes used it to represent the miracle of the fishes, or as the ""rho"" part of the Labarum."
I've had a few personal ones, but never anything on a larger scale than that.  \n\nThe most interesting one for me was dreaming that one of my friends who I was very close to had a very profane MSN name, and then said something that I found very disturbing, since it was a total perversion of their normal charecter.  The next day, it happened.  It meant a lot to me that I had had the dream, because it felt like a warning - it gave me a chance to think about what I would do if something like that were to happen, and when it did, I felt like I was more emotionally able to cope with it because of the short warning I had been given.

Though muslims & christians have many principles in common, i guess they have many many diffrences, like what u said; muslims don't believe in Jesus Christ, they beleive no way God can become a human being, while chrisitians for example don't believe in Prophet Mohamed, and both beliefs are the core of religions, which means if u don't believe in Jesus Christ u can't be a chirsitan and if u don't believe in Prophet Mohamed u can't be a muslim, even the view of god in both religions are different, so i guess the answer would be no.

Benedict the XVI means he is the 16th Pope to take the name Benedict since the beginning of the church...it has nothing to do with the number of cardinals.\n\nThe College of Cardinals is like the Supreme Court, appointed by the Pope but serve for life.  Cardinals serve for life, but can only vote for a new Pope if they are younger than 80 years old.\n\nSo to answer your questions in order...\n\n1. Nothing\n2.  No...they serve for life\n3.  No...there are almost 200 of them.\n4.  No, all cardinals under the age of 80 will be responsible for voting in the next pope.  There are 193 Cardinals and 120 of them are under 80 right now.\n\nThe next Pope won't necessarily be the 17th. The last one was the second (John Paul II).  If that Pope chooses the name of Benedict, (yes, they choose their own names) then he would be the 17th.  Otherwise, he will either be John Paul III or John the 27th or Peter II, depending what he chooses.

as a Christian, i personally cant stand when people wrap it all up into this neat little package called ooop, -love the sinner hate the sin.\nGuess what, youre a sinner, in Gods eyes a sin is a sin, to natural eyes, youre probably better at sinning than youre average gay. These are human beings people! with human emotions and feelings! Not social outcasts, not degenerats of society, we live in a society much more full of sin than homosexuality. If youre getting a visual of what someone is doing in their bedroom, and it just sickens you, well i say youve got issues. your kinda perverted for even going there yourself.\nLove your nieghbors as you would yourself. period.\nIf you dont understand their walk, where they have been, the soil they grew in, their journey, what they feel deep in their hearts, then pray that you do. try to understand, try to tolerate, and try to help from a POSITIVE place not a negative one.\nHate is negative, even hating sin, it gets us nowhere as brothers and sisters in Christ or humanity.
You can be spiritual without being religious, and you can be religious without being spiritual.\n\nIn any opinion, the need to belong to a religion stems from the inherent need of people to experience wholeness.\n\nReligion may or may not give that to you.  Spirituality, in my mind, is the personal expression of that need, that cannot be shared, only experienced.
Would my creator be my father, my mother, or both of them?\n\nI don't believe that mankind has invented all deities. I am polytheistic and believe that pretty much any deity could exist, but that none of them have claim to the One True Way (some of them might want to convince their followers of that to get some exclusive worship, though). No one can prove that any deities were or were not invented, however, no matter how much they may believe one way or the other. I personally see evidence of higher powers, but multiple deities makes more sense to me than one due to the diversity found in all other aspects of the universe and the fact that (if deities exist at all) there is no logical evidence to show why one is real and another is not. Plus, believing in One True God makes so many people so damn arrogant, and I'm not interested in that.

"ANSA) - Rome, April 3 - A fourth-century papyrus manuscript containing the long-lost 'Gospel of Judas' will be presented in Washington on Thursday .\n\nThe Gospel of Judas is one of several ancient accounts of Christ's life which were rejected as suspect by the fathers of the early Church and so they did not become part of the Bible .\n\nVatican officials have denied that the publication this week is part of a rehabilitation of Judas by the Catholic Church .\n\nThe document reportedly argues that Judas Iscariot, known to Christians as the man who betrayed Jesus Christ, was an essential part of God's design and, as such, almost a hero .\n\nWithout his betrayal, Jesus would not have been crucified and so, the argument goes, God's plan to save mankind from its sins would not have been fulfilled .\n\nThe papyrus containing the text of the 'gospel' appeared about 30 years ago on the Egyptian antiquities market. It had last been heard of in AD180, when Saint Irenaeus, a bishop, condemned it as heretical .\n\nIt was recently acquired by the Swiss-based Maecenas Foundation for Ancient Art and the U.S.-based National Geographic magazine, who are behind this week's publication .\n\nThe text, which has been translated into English, French and German, is written in Coptic, the language used in Egypt when the country converted to Christianity halfway through the third century AD .\n\nThe text was the work of an ancient Gnostic sect called the Cainites, which made a habit of giving a positive value to all the negative figures in Christian scriptures .\n\nIt is believed to have been originally written in the first or second centuries. The text was later copied onto the papyrus which is to be presented in Washington .\n\nThe forthcoming publication has sparked fears among some in the Catholic Church that it could give people wrong ideas about the man who is famous for betraying Jesus Christ .\n\n""Some people will try to hide the truth and give undue importance to a document written in the 2nd century by people in open opposition to the early Christian Church,"" said a Rome-based theologian who is an expert on ancient texts .\n\nExperts say the manuscript is interesting and important for scholars of Church history but changes nothing in the accepted view of Judas .\n\nItaly's top Catholic writer, Vittorio Messori, noted however that the text does raise interesting questions about the role of Judas in the Christ story .\n\nInterviewed by the Turin daily La Stampa, he noted that a key difference between the Gospel of Judas and the Bible accounts concerns the question of forgiveness .\n\nMessori recalled that in the apocryphal account Judas is forgiven: ""He weeps, Jesus forgives him and in order to purify him he sends Judas into the desert to do spiritual exercises."" In the New Testament, in the Gospel of Mark, Jesus is quoted as saying: ""Woe to that one by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that one not to have been born."" After the betrayal, they never meet again and, overcome with remorse, Judas commits suicide. Christ atones for the sins of humanity but never specifically forgives Judas .\n\nMessori said the lack of forgiveness in the Bible account appeared strange in a man who preached forgiveness .\n\nHe also noted that Jesus's choice of Judas as a disciple in the first place seemed to show a slip of judgment .\n\nBut, as someone who wanted to believe the Gospels were true, he said he was glad of Judas's presence. ""If the gospels had been invented, the figure of Judas just wouldn't be there because he's so embarrassing,"" he said ."
They have two different meanings.  One means that they don't care whereas the other means that they care too much.  People do tend to use them as equals eventhough they aren't.  It could just be that people have begun to alter the language.  It happens a lot to many sayings.  I definitely have thought about it!!:)
Take a good look at the people around you and then ask this question.
"I don't know how ""Christian"" these are but they are two of my favorite religious jokes.\n\n#1 - On the outskirts of town, there was huge nut tree by the cemetery fence. One day two boys filled up a bucketful of nuts and sat down by the tree, out of sight, and began dividing the nuts.\n""One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me,"" said one boy. The bucket was so full, several rolled out toward the fence.\nCycling down the road by the cemetery was a third boy. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to investigate. Sure enough, he heard, ""One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me.""\nHe knew what it was. ""Oh my,"" he shuddered, ""It's Satan and St. Peter dividing the souls at the cemetery.""\nHe cycled down the road fast as he could and found an old man with a cane, hobbling along. ""Come here quick,"" said the boy, ""You won't believe what I heard. Satan and St. Peter are down at the cemetery dividing the souls.""\nThe man said, ""Shooo, you brat, can't you see I'm finding it hard to walk as it is."" But after several pleas, the man hobbled to the cemetery. Standing by the fence they heard, ""One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me . . .""\nThe old man whispered, ""Boy, you've been telling the truth. Let's see if we can see the devil himself."" Shivering with fear, they peered through the fence, yet they were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of Satan.\nAt last they heard, ""One for you, one for me. And one last one for you. That's all. Now let's go get those nuts by the fence, and we'll be done.""\nThey say the old guy made it back to town five minutes before the boy.\n\n#2 A small rural community, so small, in fact, the only church in town is a small Baptist church whose pastor must also double up as the local barber to make ends meet. There happened to be a man in this small community who had invested wisely and was enjoying his newfound comfort. This man got out of bed one day to go through his daily routine. He looked into the mirror as he was about to shave and decided, ""I make enough money now, I don't have to shave myself. I'll go down to the barber and let him shave me from now on."" So he did. \n  He walked into the barber shop and found the preacher/barber was out calling on the shut-ins. His wife, Grace, said ""I usually do the shaves anyway ... sit down and I'll shave you."" So he did. She shaved him and he asked, ""How much do I owe you?"" ""$25,"" Grace replied. The man thought that was somewhat expensive and that he may have to get a shave every other day. Nonetheless, he paid Grace and went on his way.\nThe next day, he woke up and found his face to be just as smooth as the day before. No need for a shave today, he thought, well, it was a $25 shave. \nThe next day he awoke to find his face as smooth as a baby's bottom. Wow! he thought. That's amazing, as he normally would need to shave daily to keep his clean-shaven business look. \nDay 3, he woke up and his face was still as smooth as the minute after Grace had finished. Now, somewhat perplexed, the man went down to the barber shop to ask some questions. \nThis particular day the pastor was in and the man asked him why his face was as smooth as it was the first day it was shaven. The kind old pastor gently retorted, ""Friend, you were shaved by Grace ... and once shaved, always shaved."""

College? oh lord could you blackmail me with some of those!! But the groovy cool part is that weird outlandish things still happen to me all of the time. I had this friend that I used to talk to every day. I swear I think he wanted to just hear me ramble about all of the strange happenings in my life just that he could feel a bit more normal. So hopefully more and more strange and unusual and exciting and exasperating stories will continue to occur. But for now.......look ""hither and yon."""

"True Christians, would always be persecuted, misunderstood, and ""gossiped"",   Jesus said, These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world. John 16:33, so don't worry continue your way share the Gospel, live the Gospel, and suffer the tribulation for the Gospel, Jesus will reward all of those willing to be ridiculed , by men who think Christianism is fake, and at the end of times Who do you think is going to be the ""fake""?????"
That's the Blessed Virgin Mary. Look at how she looks like in her apparitions in Fatima and other places. She gave birth to the Messiah who brings salvation and is also satan's enemy. This could also refer to the catholic church who had been persecuted in any way throughout centuries of history for teaching about the truth of Jesus Christ. The catholic church produces martyrs and saints, and the church's teachings through the pope were also contradicted by its enemies even this present time.

"Jesus intended that his disciples and those that followed (even Christians of today) would, through the gifts of His Holy Spirit spread the Gospel with signs and wonders following.\n\nActs 1:5-7\nFor John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit."" So when they met together, they asked him, ""Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?"" He said to them: ""It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority.\n\nAct 14:3\nSo Paul and Barnabas spent considerable time there, speaking boldly for the Lord, who confirmed the message of his grace by enabling them to do miraculous signs and wonders.\n\nJohn 14:12-14\nI tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father. You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it."

"The short answer is, Christians who possess a true understanding of Christ's teachings do not have evil intentions against anyone. Those who do not have a true understanding can fall into a number of categories: mislead, mistaken, ignorant, or as a previous person suggested, just Human (i.e., fallible and imperfect). \n\nThere are, however, those who do have legitimately evil intentions that they seek to carry out in the name of ""Christianity"". These individuals/groups have no caring for anyone but themselves and their close circle of like-minded ""friends"". More often than not, your examples (and other things like them) are due to reasons listed in the previous paragraph, but the truly evil intentions do exist. Jesus taught that we will know them ""by their fruits""...that is, know them by their actions, NOT their words. If their actions suggest something other than what they claim to be, then they either have an incomplete or incorrect understanding of the true teachings of Christ, or they have other more insidious motives. You will have to decide for yourself who falls into which category."
"I guess I don't buy Frosts idea of a neatly forked road.  I think life is a lot more like a series of squiggly lines then two neat paths.

Sometimes I've just said ""screw this"", grabbed a machette and cut my own way through the woods.\n\nWhat matters to me is not that I have traveled the ""popular"" or ""unpopular"" path, but that I have traveled my path.  It has had pitfalls and moments of perfection, but more then that, it is MINE and no one can ever take it from me."

I see it, but I do not think it is very subtle. There has been an all out FRONTAL assault on Christianity in the media for the last 20 - 30 years. What you are seeing is the culmination of the attack. It is anything but subtle. It is overt and blatant. Look at Law and Order, Boston Legal, any talk show, yes Oprah too, and any thing on the Discovery or History channels. What is right, according to the scripture, is now WRONG and what is wrong, adultery and homosexuality et al, is now right. Read the Bible it foretells that this will happen. If this ain't he fulfilling of prophesy then I'm a kangaroo.
I think you are right, no matter how interesting their conversation may have been, your friend should have had the courtesy to stop for a moment to introduce you as you were together since the beginning, however as a demonstration of education it would be acceptable that you waited for the perfect moment during their conversation to introduce yourself with a positive comment emphasizing the good aspect of making new friends or simply encouraging their conversation.  \n\nHaving manners often implies having empathy with others.
Count me is as believer.
All who live on the planet Earth! They would be the best!
Better Place?  Oh Yeah!  Safer?  Maybe as far a Modern Nations are concerned.  We in the USA can see via spy satellites everything every military does.  I.E. Pearl Harbor can never happen again, we would see the Japanese fleet leaving port.
Why can't you make those vows yourself why do you think you need to be a Catholic Religious Brother?
Without any historical or biblical proof, Medieval and Renaissance painters have given us our picture of Christ carrying the entire cross. But the upright post, or stipes, was generally fixed permanently in the ground at the site of execution and the condemned man was forced to carry the patibulum, weighing about 110 pounds, from the prison to the place of execution.
OOPS.....
Don't they?\nIf you're talking about countries that use the Euro, it's beacause in such a tightly packed continent with consumers readily traversing country borders, the plan was to adopt a universal currency and do away with conversion rates.\nIf you're talking about countries that use American dollars, well that's because America is the largest economic power in the world and US currency is taken most everywhere.
what is the definition of terrorism? \n\nto be even more fair, both hamas and Israel need to be condemned. how come when Innocent people die from the palastians side then Israel is no blame, but when Innocent people die in Israel then all jump on the poor palastians? \nmurder is murder even if that person is blowing himself up, or carry a advance technological weapons shooting people. \n\nMuhammad has clearly forbid killing your own self and he said whoever killed himself is in Hell forever. also in the Quran it mentioned whoever kill an inocent soul with no right it's like killing the whole people. also Muhammad forbid killing women and children even if they were from among the enemies.\n\nthe word Jihad mean struggle with own self to do good. Jihad dosen't always mean war and fight. Jihad-fight is only allow to defend your country against any unfair attack which is common sense, but muslims are not allowed to fight those who did not fight them, neither allowed to kill people who come for peace or inocent people. \n\nIslam is not about peace of jihad, islam is about fair and truth. Islam peaceful with those who are peaceful with it, and harsh on those who attacking them unfairly.\n\nand every muslim will be questioned infront of God of the behavior he has done. there is different between people behavior/culture and what-Islam-says.  you need to also count the psychological pressure on those people, social pressure, humiliation, no feeling of hope, people went thru bad exprience, people loose their love ones and want revenge...etc all that create hate and hate create terrorism.
I think that sounds extremely enjoyable! I'd pay up to about $200. Can't afford more, and that's a lot more than I'd pay for most things.

The answer here is simple. Celtic pagans have a different tradition and believe in different Gods and Goddesses and a different afterlife. Egyptian Gods include Set, God of death, Anubis God of life, and Isis. I am not sure of any specific Celtic Gods except that in the neo tradition there are a male and female deity who are married. Entry into paradise is different between the two Egyptians weigh the heart to judge your character and entry in Celtic paganism is based on pleasing the Gods, I am not 100 percent sure of the latter however.
As far as the pharmacies go.......a lot of States have laws that pharmacies are required to offer birth control.  A pharmacy in I think Mass. was recently sued for not providing ru-486 as an option.  COntrolling the cable system?  There could be a monopoly issue there....and I assure you the price of putting that cable down is going to prohibit a small community from using their own system.
Look around -- everything is in Spanish, so they don't have to!  My grandparents spoke German, and when they arrived, no one catered to them, so they were forced to speak the dominant language.  If I were Mexican, I wouldn't learn to speak English, either.  \n\nWhose fault is this?  Americans.  This isn't the United States.  It's Little Mexico.  And it's an insult to anyone from Mexico because we're telling them that we don't think they're smart enough to learn English.
How do you know that what Jesus even looked like?  No one really knows, that's just what they assume he looked like.

"Brother Mustafaa, where have you been all my life?!  Just kidding!  It is so nice to see that there are still some Black men who are attracted to Black women and don't see anything wrong with dating Black women.  You are not strange or racist for wanting to date Black women!  A lot of people on this website throw the word ""racist"" around too much and they aren't using it correctly.  Racism is an institutionalized system by which certain groups of people are oppressed; their civil rights are consistently denied.  How does choosing to date and marry someone from your particular ethnic group qualify as a racist act?!  Whose civil rights are you violating?!  I personally think your attitude is a lot healthier than some of these people (usually people of color) who REFUSE to date someone of their own ethnic group. I think deep down people view Black as wrong and ugly;that's why you're viewed as strange for liking Black women.  They don't understand why on earth  you would want to date a Black woman when you can get a ""prettier"" white, Hispanic or Asian woman.  I say if it's okay for Caucasian people to fall in love with each other, it should be okay for Blacks to do the same."
Let me sing you a little song about what I would do with a million dollars:\n\nIf I had a million dollars\n(If I had a million dollars)\nI'd buy you a house\n(I would buy you a house)\nIf I had a million dollars\n(If I had a million dollars)\nI'd buy you furniture for your house\n(Maybe a nice chesterfield or an ottoman)\nAnd if I had a million dollars\n(If I had a million dollars)\nWell, I'd buy you a K-Car\n(A nice Reliant automobile)\nIf I had a million dollars I'd buy your love\n\nIf I had a million dollars\nI'd build a tree fort in our yard\nIf I had million dollars\nYou could help, it wouldn't be that hard\nIf I had million dollars\nMaybe we could put like a little tiny fridge in there somewhere\nYou know, we could just go up there and hang out\nLike open the fridge and stuff\nThere would already be laid out foods for us\nLike little pre-wrapped sausages and things\n\nThey have pre-wrapped sausages but they don't have pre-wrapped bacon\nWell, can you blame 'em\nUh, yeah\n\nIf I had a million dollars\n(If I had a million dollars)\nWell, I'd buy you a fur coat\n(But not a real fur coat that's cruel)\nAnd if I had a million dollars\n(If I had a million dollars)\nWell, I'd buy you an exotic pet\n(Yep, like a llama or an emu)\nAnd if I had a million dollars\n(If I had a a million dollars)\nWell, I'd buy you John Merrick's remains\n(Ooh, all them crazy elephant bones)\nAnd If I had a million dollars I'd buy your love\n\nIf I had a million dollars\nWe wouldn't have to walk to the store\nIf I had a million dollars\nNow, we'd take a limousine 'cause it costs more\nIf I had a million dollars\nWe wouldn't have to eat Kraft Dinner\nBut we would eat Kraft Dinner\nOf course we would, we’d just eat more\nAnd buy really expensive ketchups with it\nThat’s right, all the fanciest ke... dijon ketchups!\nMmmmmm, Mmmm-Hmmm\n\nIf I had a million dollars\n(If I had a million dollars)\nWell, I'd buy you a green dress\n(But not a real green dress, that's cruel)\nAnd if I had a million dollars\n(If I had a million dollars)\nWell, I'd buy you some art\n(A Picasso or a Garfunkel)\nIf I had a million dollars\n(If I had a million dollars)\nWell, I'd buy you a monkey\n(Haven't you always wanted a monkey)\n\nIf I had a million dollars\nI’d buy your love\n\nIf I had a million dollars, If I had a million dollars\nIf I had a million dollars, If I had a million dollars\nIf I had a million dollars\nI'd be rich
We shouldn't say that saying at all because we are using God's name in vain and that is a sin.  I get what you mean, I wont say Oh my Gosh any more.\n\nThank you!\n\nGod Bless!

"Most likely because they confuse faith with science and have trouble reconciling the two.  Science, by definition, makes statements that can be tested.  Faith doesn't require proof.  As a scientist, I can look at the evidence that supports evolution and recognize that it makes sense and has yet to be disproved.  I can look at the idea of intelligent design and say ""That's not science, because it can't be tested.  Belief in that idea is based on faith, not scientific proof.""  This does not, however, interfere with my belief in a higher power.  Science tells us how we got here, Faith tells us what we're supposed to do now that we're here."
"OK, firstly, a slight correction - Trampus, there's a slight error in the quote. ""Do what you will is the whole of the law"" is the creed of the Church of Satan, and puts no restraint on its members beyond their own self-interest. ""An it harm none, do what you will"" is the traditional Wiccan creed, which is a fairly different thing - Do what you will as long as you harm no-one. Taken together with the law of threefold return, that says whatever you put out into the world - harm or benefit - will come back to you three times stronger - it's an effecttive, pretty disciplined line to walk.\n\nNow, to the question: yes, you can follow your Wiccan path and believe in a single god, including the one you grew up with. There are Wiccans who dedicate themselves to single gods in various systems, from Norse and Celtic to Egyptian and Christian. The one defining characteristic of Wicca is its open-mindedness - if any path helps you to be a positive, respectful influence on the planet it's pretty much fine with most Wiccans. Blessed be, and enjoy the journey you are on."
I would say that this is against both evolution and creationism.  \n\nIf humans were not from earth then why would we have so many similar internal organs to other animals?  I mean I doubt any extraterrestrial creature could have a pig's heart transplanted into their body like humans can.\n\nIt could be that humans were in some way altered by aliens or our culture is influenced by aliens.  But this lacks any real evidence at present and is thus a very unlikly (but not impossible) case.\n\nPersonally I think there are aliens of some sort but they are not amongst us in any conventional sense at the moment.
Always, in every area, not just the arts. If a neurosurgeon can describe exactly how to operate on your brain, and yet has never done this, how does he compare with the surgeon who stutters and stammers around trying to describe the procedure, but has successfully performed it hundreds of times?\nI'm sure you can carry this example out in an million occupations if you think about it...in knowing how to do something, language is just not that central to the issue.
i would say oprah beacuse she has the power and money to help people all around the world she is also a good role model for woman and young girls of all races especially minorities to believe in yourself i would be alot like her and help people after all isint giving so much better than recieving? i sure think so
Some people do, some people don't.  I can say that I know and work with more black people who don't throw the r-card out all the time if ever.
Do not let people interpret you. Show people what should be interpreted. Christians who do not understand Islam is expectedly normal and it is not their duty to. \n\nIf people will see the opposite of what you expect, don't blame them, blame those who destroy your name. People should not be blame for interpreting because interpretation can be broad that can create diverse opinions. \n\nBlame those who are within your ranks that portray the worst image that can tarnish your religion. It is them who are painting the picture. We are just observers who may or may not appreciate what we see. \n\nDon't blame the media either because it will only deviate your attention into achieving the right path towards building a good image.
Turning 18 and being able to move away from the family
Wow,what an inspiring message for a beautiful morning at OKL.Now I understand what that means,God is there forever and will never leave us no matter what the circumstances are.Like that storm awhile ago in 6 states,After the tragedy,God will place a rainbow to remind us that He still loves us.
I usually do unless it is a page long.  I like scrambled eggs.
I think it's possible... or at least that civilization as we know it will have completely disappeared.  Global warming is permanently changing our planet, war and terrorism are leading uncontrollable third world contries to develop nuclear weapons, and all of our basic infrastructure...health care, telecommunications, transportation, levies... is breaking down in the US.  Maybe the human race will survive, but I doubt very much if the United States will be considered a superpower any more even just one hundred years from now.  Our children will all be trying to immigrate to India to find low-paying manual labor.
i think they probably could...not sure about madly in love tho since they usually has a sexual conotation to it...not sure if old people are into that but who knows... A movie about that would be great and actually I bet there are movies out there where old people fall in love, I have seen stuff like that on TV anyhow...I think it would be sweet if two old people found each other and had someone to spend the rest of their years together...life is much more fulfilling to most people when you have a companion ...and at 80 years old most people do not have many family members left...sigh...

"The Seven Cherokee Clans\nAh-ni-ga-to-ge-wi or Wild Potato Clan - Were known to be farmers and gatherers of the wild potato plants in swamps (hence the name gatogewi = ""swamp""), along streams, and swamps to make flour or bread for food, and were so named after them. They are keepers and protectors of the earth. The Wild Potato Clan have also been known as the Bear Clan, Raccoon Clan and even ""Blind Savannah"" in different regions. The Clan color for the AniGatogewi is Green and their wood is Birch.\n\nAh-ni-gi-lo(la)-hi or Long Hair Clan - This Clan, also known as Twister Clan, Hanging Down Clan or Wind Clan. Gilahi is short for an ancient Gitlvgvnahita, the warrior women's society, meaning something that grows from the back of the neck"". Those belonging to this Clan wore their hair in elaborate hairdos, walked in a proud and vain manner twisting their shoulders. They are teachers and keepers of tradition. Peace chiefs usually came from this clan at one time in Cherokee history and wore a white feather robe. The Clan color for the AniGilohi is Yellow and their wood is Beech.\n\nAh-ni-(k)a-wi or Deer Clan - Those belonging to this Clan were the keepers of the deer, deer hunters and trackers, tanners and seamers, as well as keepers of the deer medicines. They were known to be fast runners and foot messengers. The Clan Color for the Ani Kawi is Brown and their wood is Oak.\n\nAh-ni-tsi-sk-wa or Red Tailed Hawk Clan - Those belonging to this Clan (also called the bird clan) were the keepers of the birds, sacred feathers and bird medicines. They were messengers and were very skilled in using blowguns and snares for bird hunting. Their color is Purple, and their wood is Maple.\n\nAh-ni-sa-ho-ni or Blue Holly Clan - Those belonging to this clan were keepers of all children's medicines and caretakers of medicinal herb gardens. They became known for a medicine from a bluish colored plant called a blue holly, and were so named after it. This Clan has also been known as the Panther or Wild Cat Clan, in some regions. Their color is Blue and their wood is Ash.\n\nAh-ni-wo-di or Paint Clan - Those belonging to this Clan made red paint. The tribe's medicine men, Dida:hnvwi:sgi (healers) and Adawehi (wise men), traditionally came from this clan at one time in Cherokee history. The Clan Color for the AniWodi is White and their wood is Locust.\n\nAh-ni-wa-ya or Wolf Clan - The Wolf Clan is the largest clan today and the most prominent clan, providing most of the war chiefs, and warriors. True ah-ni-wa-ya are protectors of the people. The wolf clan are keepers and trackers of the wolf and the only clan who could kill a wolf through special ceremonies and wolf medicines. The Clan color of the AniWaya is Red and their wood is Hickory."

It is your choice.\n\nAnd it depends what type of event. Our wine tastingclub presents a limited number of wines and it is expected that people will drink. There is a container for you to pour away unwanted wines, but people do not spit.\n\nHowever at professional tastings there are maybe hundreds of wines available and spittoons are provided and spitting is expected. And someone that went around just drinking might be suspected as being a freeloader and not serious.\n\nAt professional tastings I spit, drink a small glass with lunch, spit all afternoon until I've tasted enough and then I may drink one or two that I really liked.   \n\nSo, see what others do for the etiquette.\n\nOh, and practice spitting by taking a mouthfull of mouthwash and take it in the shower with you :)

I think that matters of the faith are not able to be proven scientifically - thus, your faith is continually tested and thereby grows stronger.  People who are scientifically oriented have a difficult time accepting this, making the challenge more difficult for them.
"Absolutely not.  What the Qu'ran teaches is that a martyr will be rewarded in the afterlife.  Unfortunately, many radical fundamentalists have distorted the idea of what a ""martyr"" truly is.  It is a term used for someone who is persecuted and murdered for refusing to renounce their faith, not someone who decides to take themselves out along with a crowded street full of infidels.  Sadly, you'll find these people in any religion, including Christianity (Rev. Phelps, I am looking in your general direction), and yes, they are just as dangerous and morally misguided.  Hope that helps."
hi there, funny i was just about to ask this question ' if anyone has seen a ghost'  you guys beat me to it.  My answer is yes i have and it was very vivid when i saw it, and i wasnt dreaming.  i dont think its easy to dream about sth like this.\ni was about 13 yrs old then, night and everyone in my family asleep.  I had my face turned to the wall, then turned to my left and thats when i saw the ghost standing right over my bed to my left side, he was a man all white and glowing, and behind him pitch black.  i let out a loud scream and that was it.  I beleive in them.\n\nAnother little truth.  i lost my father a few months ago and it is said that their souls wonder the earth the first 40 days after they die.  the first three days they wonder around their house.  well, this was during the three days and i was sitting at my computer and holding the mouse on the desk, my hand had a scratch on it then and all of the sudden i felt a caress on the scratch.  i know it was my daddy touching me for the last time.  i believe that.  we should believe more.
No, unfortunately most people take this way too seriously.  Too bad for them.

"See.... You could have gone to yahoo.com and typed Michael Collins in the search window, but here... Let me do YOUR homework for you, cause you are lazy:\n\n On 16 October 1890 Michael Collins was born near Sam's Cross, a tiny hamlet in West Cork, named after Sam Wallace, a local highwayman. Sam's Cross lies between Rosscarbery and Clonakilty. Here, in a picturesque valley between river and sea, the young Michael grew up. As a lad, he spear-fished for salmon in the river and played among the cliffs above Black beach and at Cliodhna's Rock. But, as was typical of the times, Michael never learned to swim.\n\nMichael's father, Michael John Collins was sixty years old when he married a local girl, Marianne O'Brien. Marianne was only twenty-three, but they were apparently happy and went on to have eight children. Michael, the youngest, was born when his father was seventy-five.\n\nMichael's father was a farmer by trade, not rich, but living comfortably for the times on a holding of ninety acres. The farm was called Woodfield after a hill in the area. When Michael was six, his father died.\n\nMichael attended national school at Lisavaird, and the schoolmaster there was to have a large influence on Michael's life. For this schoolmaster, Denis Lyons, was an active member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, a secret organisation dedicated to ousting the British from Ireland, by force if necessary. Lyons and the local blacksmith, James Santry, another Fenian, were Michael's first tutors in giving him a sense of pride of the Irish as a race. Throughout Michael Collins' brief life, Irishness was the thing that held the greatest meaning for him.\n\nBig for his age, Michael had a keen mind as well as a fit, athletic body. He loved to read. His sister, Mary Ann, heightened his interest in the struggle for nationalism, and because of her, he devoured the writings of men such as poet and Nationalist, Thomas Davis. Worried that he might fall in with a bad sort, his mother sent him to Clonakilty to study for the Post Office examinations and to live with his sister Margaret. Here he worked briefly for his brother-in-law who owned the West Cork People, a newspaper of the area. Michael learned typesetting and wrote articles of local sporting events. After a year and a half, he went to London where he lived with his sister Hannie, in West Kensington and worked for the Postal Savings Bank in West Kensington. He was fifteen. Michael would spend the next nine years in London.\n\nMICHAEL'S YEARS IN LONDON\nHe was active in the Gaelic Athletic League and in the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB). Later, Michael Collins was to become first the secretary and then the president of the IRB.\n\nTHE RISING\nIn 1916, Michael returned to Dublin to take part in the planned insurrection. He received a Volunteer's uniform and as Captain Michael Collins he was second in command to Joseph Mary Plunkett in the General Post Office during Easter Week. Collins made no secret that he admired the realism of men like Sean Mac Diarmada more than the aesthetic Padraig Pearse. And though he played a minor part in the Rising, his sense of duty and clear-headedness were remembered.\n\nFollowing the Rising, Michael, as a prisoner of war, was sent to Richmond Barracks and later to Frongoch internment camp in Wales. He returned home to Ireland in December 1916. But it was at Frongoch where Michael Collins' ability as an organizer became recognized. And immediately following his release, he rebuilt the IRB.\n\nORGANISATION\nIn 1917, he was elected to the Sinn Fein executive.During 1917 and 1918, his activities included: creating an intelligence network, organising a national loan to fund a rebellion, creating an assassination squad (""The Twelve Apostles"") and an arms-smuggling operation. By 1920, Michael Collins was wanted by the British and had a price of #10,000 stg. on his head.\n\nIn 1919, Michael Collins personally, wit"
Even if I thought I did believe that, the belief would still be a part of the movement of thought.  It would still be just words, concepts, ideas.  Saying that I believe in sunsets is entirely different than watching one and being witness to all of it's colors and shades of light.  Belief is built of thought.  Whatever is beyond belief is something that words do not approach.  You cannot know the unknowable through the known, through word or belief or mental concept.  Believing is still a part of the game, it's not enough.

Yes, in America they have strayed so far from Biblical truth that, overall, they can be classed as apostate.
If God has lay ed it on your heart, to fast then do so , don't ask any one, and tell as few as possible. This is Personal between you and God.
"This is just a guess on my part, like many phrases in English, we often don't know their origins.\nBut here is a stab at it. It could be short for ""Let's hope it won't be so long, until we meet again.""\nOr something of that ilk.\nIt's obviously a farewell term. so that may fit."
Just start looking for another place to live, and when you find another arrangement, let her know.  You don't have to explain it or tell her why.  I am sure that if she asks, you could tell her that the new place is better or cheaper or whatever that doesn't have to do with her.  That way she won't feel offended and you can live somewhere else.
http://www.world66.com/asia/southasia/pakistan/nowshera\nNowshera[edit this] \n\n Nowshera is located to the north of Khushab district, probabally the most populated area in the bigining of northern hill areas. It has many small towns situated all around. Overall it is called as Soon Valley, a beautiful hill station, people like to come from all over pakistan to visit the Sodhi Garden, Narvari Garden, Phulvari Garden. Soon Valley has blessed by two lakes, the Ochali lake and Khabaki lake. In the winter season thousands of birds migrtae from Ciberia which enhances the natural beauty of Soon. During last years the problem of drinking water has grown, also the water of lakes falling down from its original level. The land of Soon is really fertile, it has the ability to cultivate almost all types of Ajnaas. The most popular of all is the Gobhee(Coulieflower) of Soon (mainly from the small town known as Khohrah) which is famous all over in Pakistan. \nIn conclusion this is the most beautiful place of Pakistan where Government sector never invested even a penny. Although Nowshera has a sub Tehsil status but people are demanding to give it the status of Tehsil so that all local governmental administrative structure can be based there. This can become a good vistors place and touristic attraction.
Who cares if he was white or black. The important thing is you believe in his teaching.
New Age along with Buddhism is the only forms of spirituality that will survive the new world. \n\nThe way I understand it, New Age is a study of all forms of religion and spirituality. It doesn’t have a bunch of laws and regulations (even in modern Christianity the old laws of Leviticus are seen as a taboo). \n\nWell, this new form of faith has no laws and believe it or not it has no faith either, it only looks for the universal power of love and healing of the soul. \n\nSounds good to me. I think even an atheist that base their life and beliefs on facts would admit that a religion based on the unseen powers of the universe can be good. It is a scientific fact that meditation is good for your physical and mental wellbeing, so what if we add to those facts with more unseen truths that can be proven with the study of the human body? No doctrines or dogma just the true facts of life.
If you mean clutter that creates support and structure, but also emotional baggage, while also reflecting cultural heritage, I agree.\n\nMaybe God = being stoned? Makes your brain go fuzzy round the ages, offers a temporary sense of community-in-sleepwalking\n\nOr God = badger? Black and white together, excellent comedy credentials, crops up with bizarre frequency in my dreams

Hi Buddy, we all feel that way from time to time. Don't worry too much. U said u r a good student, wonderful! You know, in life sometimes we have to do things we don't enjoy. It's just how it is. But since you anyway have to do it, why not do it willingly. If you keep feeling sad about it, you know it might make the situation worse. So make a decision whether u wanna do it with interest, or do it dejectedly and with sorrow. If you see *meaning* in what you do, then maybe it won't feel so much of a chore. And sometimes, we have to make that meaning ourselves. We have to make our own stories to motivate us in whatever way possible. \n\nAsk yourself, what would make you feel happy. \nIs it something in particular u r stressed about? Can you do something to change the situation? Sometimes, we wanna do something real bad, but we avoid it becoz we feel it will take too much effort. Try not doing that and take baby steps. Believe me, even 5 minutes of doing something towards that important goal, will make you feel so good.\n\nOne thing that is helping me these days is going *slow*. U know when we hurry through things, it stresses us out, and we can't be *in the moment*. So whatever u do, do it with interest, and do it slow.  \n\nWe all feel burned out from time to time. Maybe u need a lil break? Why not go for a roadtrip on a weekend with ur friends? See a new place. Connect with nature. U might feel refreshed. \n\nMaybe have something new planned for every weekend. This way u can look forward to it. And keep working towards ur goals too. \n\nWell....I wish you all the best!\nDon't worry, you are not alone, and you can do a Lot to make urself feel better. I hope u have a good nights rest.  (Try a nice bath, and some warm-hot milk...if u haven't. it helps)\n\nSorry for ending up with a long answer but I had so much to share.

Chinese is more difficult, but it's more helpful.  Many Asian languages including Japanese and Korean are derived from Chinese.  So if you can write Chinese, even educated Japanese and Koreans can understand you.  Don't learn simplified Chinese for 2 reasons.  1) only people in China can read it and 2) it's incredibly ugly, and disrupts the traditional calligraphy of the characters.

"My concept of God is so massive that it is something we cannot fully comprehend. The only way we can comprehend this supreme being is to be apart of this world then move to the next level by dieing. We were meant not to know if there truly is a God. It is part of the test. Some people believe, without a doubt there is a God. They MAY believe we all go to heaven and meet the people who have died before them. I don't think it is as simple as that. What if you were married three times and all your wives died does that mean you hang out in heaven with all three of them? What do we do in ""heaven"" wander around and chit chat with all the people who died before we got there? There is defiantly more to it than that. But then what if there is no God? What if when we die that's it.  The universe is so huge and we are a tiny spec. Why do people think they are so special that there has to be an after life? Is it because we are aware of our existence? I am iffy on who or what my God is but i do feel it is something. I do believe it is something ten times better than what we think it is. It is so much better that if we knew the truth we wouldn't be able to handle it.  It would be like the government telling us it is a fact that aliens exist. We would go nuts."
I believe in strange thing happening with no explanation. and no explanation sometimes is better than knowing.\nI can be la yin in bed and here someone walk down the hall\ntoward the bedroom some times i think it is my wife. but when i open my eyes she is already lying there sound asleep.
yes, retirement is great if you know how to enjoy it . having a positive attitude toward things , and just relax . i have a friend that retired from his job , but he couldn't stand being at home just being there . so he got a part-time job . he relaxes by working , he says .others , they travel and visit places with family or love ones .
Because, for the most part, they are.
I would never donate my body to Science. That is kind of creepy!!!
words are vehicles that take you to good things or bad things. Jesus is THE WORD.   do you know people who are so negative that always say negative things and then wonder why they receive negative things in their life. people who say what is going to be good in their life receive good. i used to always say, i'm so poor, because i was, but once i quit saying it and started saying that i have the blessings of God, things changed. it ususally comes gradually until one day you say, i'm not  where i want to be yet, but i can see where i came from.
I have, and it was not like pictures I've seen in art work. It was sort of like a dark cloud. It clung to a little girl that was terribly ill & having difficulty breathing. It was rebuked in Jesus' Name & it left her. Her breathing became normal & she slept peacefully.

I do not believe in a god or any higher power. I believe that we are alone here and there is nothing out there that can guide or help us.\n\nThat may sound depressing or lonely, but for me it is a very freeing feeling. I know that everything I do, I do for myself and others. I do not answer to some power in the sky. \n\nI also believe that we are nothing more than the most advanced lifeform on earth (in most ways). We can think, love and have feelings. Because of our advanced minds, we created gods to answer things we did not yet understand.\n\nBecause we are nothing more than an advanced makeup of cells put together to make a human, when we die, everything we are dies. There is no soul. We do not go anywhere after death. The only way to have a so-called afterlife is to do good on earth and have people care for and love you and remember you when you die. \n\nAs long as we do everything during our lives to make it better for ourselves and everyone else, we will die happily.

No.  Logic or science can not prove the existence of a god.\n\nThey can, however, prove that a god does not exist.  For example:  Zeus and the other Greek gods were said to live on Mount Olympus.  As soon as Mt. Olympus was thoroughly explored, then those gods were disproven.\n\nThe Judean-Christian god (if the bible is taken literally) can be disproven by logic.  However, a deist's god that created everything and walked away would be impossible to disprove.
Honestly I don't believe it is rude. You are taking time out of your own schedule to watch them when you could clearly be doing something else. Since you cut the hours back at your job you are not making the money there. You relative should be able to understand this, especially if you have bills to pay.
Every generation needs to rebel.  Rebel against conformity, or rebel against non-conformity.  This new generation is no different from any other generation I've seen.

That depends on where you're living. Places such as Florida and California have a tendency for natural disaster. Rent. Any large Metropolitan area the advantage is in owning; but, beware, if you miss apayment you will lose everything. The banks do not forgive. \nYes, you are under a lease agreement with rent but nothing outside of paing it is your responsibilty. That means taxes, insurance, maintainence, saefty of others, compliance with city codes, et cetera.\nYou can rent now and look for a place.\nAlso, if it is a flat: If the property is removed, you may not recieve all opf your money back. With a house, you have a better chance, and, with renting you need to get a new pad.\nyes, the deposit is expensive and yes it can be stressful but no you won't lose everything.
I think there may be something to it.

It makes me sick that these things are allowed to be posted here to begin with, but for yahoo to leave them here two days without even acknowledging complaints?! I am not the only person who reported this guy either, and there was actually another lady who was trying to figure out how to find out who this guy actually was in order to report him to the police.

Yes, Yes, Depends.\n\nI can see auras, and when I see them and interpret the meanings of the colors, I am yet to be wrong about them. ^_^\n\nThey do exist to many people.

"Somewhat, but again I think it's a question of skin color/appearance because Latinos are a very diverse group with many different backgrounds. You have blonde fair Latinos, Afro-Latinos, and those with indigenous roots. That's not to say the blond does not get discriminated against, it's just not as likely because he can ""blend in."" You also have to factor in that there are many Latinos that are immigrants and that's a whole different issue. The basis for the discrimination may not be the same, but it surely exists for both groups.\n\nAnd for the answer above... ""Latinos are not discriminated against"" maybe not in your world.\n\nand another one, this is proof of discrimination ""There seems to be a lot of them on welfare."" Throwing Latinos in a group like that, that's discriminating."

If the medication was for birth control(forgive me for thinking this, it is a suspecious world), your son should be responsible. If not, it is up to her parents to take care of her medical expenses, Sounds like she is attempting to suck you blind. Don't let her. Sounds like the mother has issues. Why is she on welfare insurance, does she work? Doesn't she sound like an honorable, full fledged co-dependent? Don't get me started on this type of personality. \nPlease help the girl as much as you can and give her as much love and support that you can give her. She has gone through situations like this all of her life; she must be humilated. Your poor son is included in the problem. Those poor children need you to be the adult and do what you Know is right. Why not sit down with the kids and ask them how they feel. After listening to the two of them, the answer will come. You do not have to ask them what to do because the answerw will come to you. Even if the answer seems unjusst to you, maybe you will have to ear crow. You are such an honest person, you will know the WILL OF GOD.\nNow, back to the sibling thing. I had four sisterss and one brother who I grew up with. About three years ago, I quit trying to please them. I call them on birthdays and they call about family dinners. That is about it. THANK GOD. \nI no longer have the burden of attempting to please my siblings. Three years ago, I told my oldest sister the truth about everything in our lives. She, threw a fit as usual and attempted to start a fued again with the siblings. That time, I did wipe my feet of her and her bulling. She would not let me visit her on her death bed a year later. As cold as it sounds, I did not morn her death. To me, she died at the time of our last conversation-fight. \nTo be honest, we probably all felt bullied by her, she was an athusist, alcoholic(recovering),and disloved everyone. The list of her problem go on and on. The fact that God allowed me to finally stand up to her and he did not take her without me setting things straight with her. I never stood up for myself and I am so thankful that I was given permission to do so. Thanks for listening. It is over and done, but the bruses will always be there. Darn!!!!!\nTalk later\nMary
"Intelligent Design is the theory that life did not evolve in the manner stated in Darwin's Theory of Evolution (which is an undirected process), but rather that a ""Supreme Being"" (who is never identified by a specific name but often believed to be the God of the Christian faith) deliberately guided their creation.  The theory rests on the premise that there are some life forms (such as humans) that are too complex to have been formed through the directionless process of evolution."
Bible gateway is the best! it has 50 versions of the bible in 35 languages. I use it all the time.

No rapture will come (at least not the kind you speak of). Every generation wants to feel special and what better way than to believe that you somehow have a part, albeit a somewhat passive one, in the end of mankind.
I've always thought that Evolution was so dumb!! In the bible it says that God created us after his own image.... so what, God's image was a monkey when he first created men???
I'm not ratting on pagan religion, I'm speaking from a psychological perspective here.  All three are sleep paralysis.  It is a problem with the physiology of the brain during sleep.  It's caused by an inactive pons, an area in the brain stem, during periods of post-sleep where it should be inactive.  The pons is responsible for paralyzing your muscles when you sleep as to prevent you from acting out your dreams.  When it is inactive as you awake, you can't move.  It can be quite frightening because your breathing rate is suppressed and it sometimes feels like there is someone pressing down on your body.  That's where the myth of the incubus/succubus comes from.\n\nScott, you're full of it.  no offense.  That's such a primitive way to characterize a sleep/brain disorder.
Well, since that's a name, I don't think it would be any different in Spanish.
It's the best choice you will make in your life. Islam is the first religion to have given women and men the same right. Today western tv are portraying bloody islam amd trying to make people beleive thats what islam is all about. but you know islam means peace and submission to the will of God. Peace and Submission that's islam. But God has never forbidden muslim to defend themselves when they are being attack, and those who defends themselves are being called terrorist by the west>
"I would bend the rule. My job as a Christian is to serve people and care for their needs. I need to respect them as people, setting an example in how I treat them rather than by controlling them.\n\nWhy should I pull away support from this person in their time of need? What sort of love is that? It certainly doesn't bring them closer to God, it just torments them in their time of need and brings enmity.\n\nI would guess the fundamentalist would enforce the rule because they believe homosexuality is wrong, so this guy's not really a ""family member"" and thus the rule is more important than this guy not being alone. \n\nAt the very least, the head nurse could visit the patient, in order to provide support, regardless of sexual orientation."
First of all, you do not have and immortal soul, if you did, then why had no one gone to Heaven before Jesus came to the Earth, 4000 years had came & gone since Adam & Eve, millions of people had died, what did Jesus say to a man of the Pharisees, Nic·o·de'mus was his name, a ruler of the Jews.\n\nJohn 3:13\nMoreover, no man has ascended into heaven but he that descended from heaven, the Son of man.\n\nWhat is a Soul?\nRight in the very first book of the Bible, Genesis, we are told that the soul is not something you have, it is something you are. We read of the creation of Adam, the first human being: “The man came to be a living soul.” (Genesis 2:7) The Hebrew word used here for soul, ne'phesh, occurs well over 700 times in the Hebrew Scriptures, never once conveying the idea of a separate, ethereal, spiritual part of man. On the contrary, the soul is tangible, concrete, physical.\n\nLook up the following cited texts in your own copy of the Bible, for the Hebrew word ne'phesh is found in each of them. They clearly show that the soul can face risk, danger, and even be kidnapped (Deuteronomy 24:7; Judges 9:17; 1 Samuel 19:11); touch things (Job 6:7); be locked up in irons (Psalm 105:18); crave to eat, be afflicted by fasting, and faint from hunger and thirst; and suffer from a wasting disease or even insomnia as a result of grief. (Deuteronomy 12:20; Psalm 35:13; 69:10;) In other words, because your soul is you, your very self, your soul can experience anything you can experience.\n\nDoes that mean, then, that the soul can actually die? Yes. Far from being immortal, human souls are spoken of in the Hebrew Scriptures as being “cut off,” or executed, for wrongdoing, being struck fatally, murdered, destroyed, and torn to pieces. (Exodus 31:14; Deuteronomy 19:6; 22:26; Psalm 7:2) “The soul that is sinning—it itself will die,” says Ezekiel 18:4. Clearly, death is the common end of human souls, since all of us sin. (Psalm 51:5) The first man, Adam, was told that the penalty for sin was death—not transfer to the spirit realm and immortality. (Genesis 2:17) And when he sinned, the sentence was pronounced: “For dust you are and to dust you will return.” (Genesis 3:19) When Adam and Eve died, they simply became what the Bible often refers to as ‘dead souls’ or ‘deceased souls.’\n\nSome people think that “spirit” is just another word for “soul.” However, that is not the case. The Bible makes clear that “spirit” and “soul” refer to two different things. How do they differ?\n\nBible writers used the Hebrew word ru´ach or the Greek word pneu´ma when writing about the “spirit.” The Scriptures themselves indicate the meaning of those words. For instance, Psalm 104:29 states: “If you [God] take away their spirit [ru´ach], they expire, and back to their dust they go.” And James 2:26 notes that “the body without spirit [pneu´ma] is dead.” In these verses, then, “spirit” refers to that which gives life to a body. Without spirit, the body is dead. Therefore, in the Bible the word ru´ach is translated not only as “spirit” but also as “force,” or life-force. For example, concerning the Flood in Noah’s day, God said: “I am bringing the deluge of waters upon the earth to bring to ruin all flesh in which the force [ru´ach] of life is active from under the heavens.” (Genesis 6:17; 7:15, 22) “Spirit” thus refers to an invisible force (the spark of life) that animates all living creatures.
I had a friend in high school that was like this.  She said it was because she thought it implied that they can't do stuff for themselves.  I tried to explain to her that it is just an expression of respect, but she didn't buy it.  She would get really pissed off whenever I opened the door for her.

"Ages ago (you know, about 11 years) when I was 15 I got suspended from high school. This is a ""How nerds get suspended"" story.\n\nI had a disagreement with two of my ""friends"" on the yearbook staff, wherein I refused to sign a ""contract"" they made up for yearbook photographers without reading it carefully and showing it to my dad. They were unhappy. After school I took the contract home, read it through carefully, and wrote a list of things that needed clarified before I was going to sign it. At that basketball game that night (we were all in the pep band too) I gave both of them the list of clarifications I wanted. One of them read through it, gave me reasonable and thought out answers, and went to take her saxophone onto the stage in the gym. The other girl got angry with me for questioning her and chewed me out. At that point, my best friend told her that I was just trying to work things out and she didn't have to be such a snot. The other girl then called my friend a b**** and slapped her across the face. My friend barely had time to slap her back before I had shoved her into a corner made by the wall and the side of the piano (we were in the bandroom). I kept punching her in the arm, telling her she wasn't going to get away with slapping my friend. She punched me in the eye. And my friend Reid kept trying to break us apart without having to touch any boobies (should have been our first clue he was gay!). At any rate, the fight broke up eventually, and the superintendant who was also the principal at the time talked to my friend and the other girl about the fight. But, as my friend and I have the same first name (different spellings), he didn't realize I was involved, even though I went up to him and asked if he needed to talk to me (I warned you this was a nerd story). After the weekend, on Monday, all of us were called in to the principal/superintendent's office, and I was suspended for fighting because the girl said that she was ""scared to be in the same room"" as me. Which was b.s. And further b.s., because I only punched her repeatedly in the upper arm, while she punched me with her ring in the eye. So, I went around for quite a while with my sense of justice unhappy, but when I think of it now, it was pretty funny."
Almost all of the Psalms are songs. Psalms 150 speaks of using several instruments to worship - the lyre, the tambourine, trumpet, harp, strings, flute, and cymbals. The Jews used a lot of reptition in their music. God was praised by musical instruments, singing, and dancing. If these instuments were around when Psalms was written, they were surely around when Jesus came.

"Jesuit scholar says Gospel of Judas does not merit name 'Gospel'\n\nBy Cindy Wooden\nCatholic News Service\n\nROME (CNS) -- The Gospel of Judas was unimportant to most Christians when it was written hundreds of years ago and it is unimportant today, said a Jesuit professor who has convoked a series of ecumenical studies of the historical Jesus. \n\nJesuit Father Gerald O'Collins, a longtime professor of Christology at Rome's Pontifical Gregorian University, said the text, like the gospels of Mary Magdalene and Philip, ""does not merit the name 'Gospel.'"" \n\nThe National Geographic Society unveiled the document April 6, posting a copy of it on the society's Web site, www.nationalgeographic.com, and releasing English translations of portions of the text.\n\n""A 'Gospel' is a literary genre -- established by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John -- focusing on the life, death and resurrection of Jesus,"" Father O'Collins said. \n\nWhile including events supposedly related to the life of Jesus, the Gospel of Judas and the others really are texts ""attempting to bolster the importance"" of the personalities they are named after, not of Jesus, the priest said. \n\n""They are not summaries of the good news,"" he said.\n\nThe texts come from the gnostic tradition, a religious-philosophical current popular in the second, third and fourth centuries. The gnostics claimed to have secret knowledge unavailable to the vast majority of people and focused so strongly on the spiritual and intellectual that they despised material creation, including the human body. \n\nIn the year 180, St. Irenaeus condemned the gnostics, mentioning particularly a Gospel of Judas.\n\nFather O'Collins said the most important thing about the text released in early April is that ""it shows just how right Irenaeus was in saying the gnostics were against mainstream Christianity and Judaism, they were against our God."" \n\n""To give Judas greater credit,"" the Jesuit said, the gnostics ""portray Jesus giving him secret knowledge. It was a nice try,"" but there is no evidence to support the claim.\n\n""It was junk then and it is junk now,"" he said .\n\nFather O'Collins, who between 1996 and 2003 convoked a series of ecumenical, interdisciplinary summits for scholars on the historical Jesus, said it was ""ridiculous"" for anyone to claim publication of the Gospel of Judas will challenge mainstream Christianity. \n\nEND"

(Deuteronomy 12:20; Psalm 35:13; 69:10;) In other words, because your soul is you, your very self, your soul can experience anything you can experience.\n\nDoes that mean, then, that the soul can actually die? Yes. Far from being immortal, human souls are spoken of in the Hebrew Scriptures as being “cut off,” or executed, for wrongdoing, being struck fatally, murdered, destroyed, and torn to pieces. (Exodus 31:14; Deuteronomy 19:6; 22:26; Psalm 7:2) “The soul that is sinning—it itself will die,” says Ezekiel 18:4. Clearly, death is the common end of human souls, since all of us sin. (Psalm 51:5) The first man, Adam, was told that the penalty for sin was death—not transfer to the spirit realm and immortality. (Genesis 2:17) And when he sinned, the sentence was pronounced: “For dust you are and to dust you will return.” (Genesis 3:19) When Adam and Eve died, they simply became what the Bible often refers to as ‘dead souls’ or ‘deceased souls.’\n\nSome people think that “spirit” is just another word for “soul.” However, that is not the case. The Bible makes clear that “spirit” and “soul” refer to two different things. How do they differ?\n\nBible writers used the Hebrew word ru´ach or the Greek word pneu´ma when writing about the “spirit.” The Scriptures themselves indicate the meaning of those words. For instance, Psalm 104:29 states: “If you [God] take away their spirit [ru´ach], they expire, and back to their dust they go.” And James 2:26 notes that “the body without spirit [pneu´ma] is dead.” In these verses, then, “spirit” refers to that which gives life to a body. Without spirit, the body is dead. Therefore, in the Bible the word ru´ach is translated not only as “spirit” but also as “force,” or life-force. For example, concerning the Flood in Noah’s day, God said: “I am bringing the deluge of waters upon the earth to bring to ruin all flesh in which the force [ru´ach] of life is active from under the heavens.” (Genesis 6:17; 7:15, 22) “Spirit” thus refers to an invisible force (the spark of life) that animates all living creatures.
One of my mentors is a woman pastor, and I have the utmost respect for her and her call.  I have no doubt that God has called her into the ministry and has gifted her with the skills and talents she needs to do that job.\n\n1st Peter 4:10 says:\nEach one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms.\n\nShe is using the gifts God gave her to serve others.
I do. It is a comfort to pray and it is also a comfort to know that someone else is praying for you. Praying is like talking to your best friend, it gives you a peace like no other.\n God Bless...
"Awww, look... No offense, but you kind of got yourself into this situation when you agreed to start seeing him, didn't you?  Or was it a case of you were not told about the boyfriend before hand?  In that case- I think you should drop him like a hot potato.  He's being an ass and you definitely deserve better than that.  You should never, ever have to put yourself in the position of being the ""bit on the side.""  Find someone who will treat you right!  As for why all men are bast*rds... I don't think they all are, but a lot of them just don't think before they go ahead and do things."
You asked a loaded question and will get hostile responses on it.  Braver than me, anyway.  Women are not 'stupider' than men.  Many women are much better in school and practical things than men.  To generalize like that is not a good idea for anything.  You need to take people on a one to one basis and not categorize.  That is how bigotry starts as well as a reputation as a male chauvinist pig.
Ask him why he thinks he is ruining your life. If you believe he is not, then tell him so. Tell him to lighten up and that you love him also, and you want him to be happy with you and not worry about ruining your life.\n\nThe two of you should be more open with each other. Talk openly about your relationship, your feelings, your struggles.. it will help.\n\nAnd keep on praying :)\n\nGod Bless,\nDevan
it has changed it meaning from time to time,\nnow its a fantasy i feel.
"There is no problem with Catholics dating non-Catholics (and for that matter non-Christians).  The problem that comes in when marriage occurs is that now your lives are completely joined.  And yet, there is a separation between you . . . a big one in some cases (more so for non-Christians, but even between Catholics and non-Catholics).  Some potential issues include separate worship on Sundays, disagreements over what faith to teach your children, disagreements over contraception and timing of children, etc.  Certainly, many people have worked through these issues.  There is hope for you, because you are thinking about this now, before you jump into marriage.  I would encourage you to check out the forums at www.catholic.com.  There are frequent discussions about problems in ""mixed"" marriages as well as dating issues (and there are many, many non-Catholics who post there, do not be afraid!).  As far as requirements for you upon marriage; to be married in the Catholic Church, you must take a marriage prep course with your future wife and during your marriage ceremony you will be asked if you will be open to children in your marriage, if God intends them for you.  (The Church desires, of course, that you raise these children Catholic.)  You do not have to be initiated into the Catholic Church in any way.  However, for your marriage to be considered valid by the Catholic Church, it does have to be performed by a Catholic priest (my DH and I were married in my parents Methodist Church and are preparing to have our marriage validated).  This will probably be important for your girlfriend.  (BTW, Catholics believe in one baptism.  If you have been baptized they will not baptize you again . . . though there is such a thing as a conditional baptism, in certain circumstances. . . but I digress.)  Hope this helps."
From what I've read, it was your basic stag type thing.  A bunch of guys drinking and talking about women, having sex with said women.  Funnily enough, there were aristocrats and dignitaries, not common men. \n\nI know it wasn't called a Hellfire Club by it's founder, Dashwood, he called it the Monks of Medmenham.  Rumor has it that they were Satanists, but this seems to be highly exaggerated.
Unfortunately, both.   Some pick and choose what they will focus on.  This is the birth of denominational Christianity.  Fewer choose to acknowledge the bible in its fullness.  Its much harder to do this way and the first step is the one that prevents the first group from following this path; you have to admit you don't know all the answers, and probably never will.\n\ni refer to myself as a Christ follower.  I'd rather be thought of as a person who is genuinely trying to follow the life and teachings of Christ as they are revealed to me than thought a memebr of a particular group, denomination, etc.
I think that compared to when my grandparents were young kids now a days are more lazy and more rude. We do not make our children (well some of us do not) get up at 4am to milk cows & get eggs from chickens,come home from school and do school work. We do whip our children (not that everyone did that either then) for mis speaking. But honestly we do not have to whip our children for them to behave. Our children our the way they are partly on how we allowed them to be raise, by our own examples in everyday life from how we speak to the sales person at marshals or walmart, how we talk to the cashire, how we treat a waitor or waitress who screws up an order or takes to long getting to you. Kids mimic everything from how we act when we cook, to how we are in thecar when traffic is jammed, lost, or an idiot driving. they mimic our phone conversations and us getting mad at applkiences and electronics. they even try and mimic our dress and music at times. As well as what they hear or see on tv, radio, games and computure,and yes even in public. so compared to the 80s are kids more rude I am not 100% sure but it seems they get a way with a lot more crude sayings and behaviour partly because we allow it and also they more swearing is allowed on tv and radio as well as humor that was not okay back then but is ok now.

I think it is a bigger leap of faith to say there is a god. You have to believe something exists that there is no absolute proof of.
"As a female living in Utah (worse yet, UT County) I would agree that the religion is as weird as other extremists or fundamentalists.  Also, I'm sick of being an outsider because I REFUSE to join their sick little world.  I've done my research, so I'm not just pulling that out of my behind.  How anybody can believe the crap that that church spews is beyond me.  The only thing I can come up with is that they want to believe it and the church discourages their members from learning about other faiths.  Ask a mormon how much they know about other religions and they will all come back with the same memorized crap they learned from the MTC.  Any of you who haven't read the book ""Under the Banner of Heaven"", you should read it.  Very interesting.  They should make the church members read it.  Anyway, enough ranting-have a good day!"
I have. Been vacationing there since 2000 but visited it first around 1994. I simply love this country and everything about it. Feels like my second home. It's a wonderful mixture between oriental and occidental culture, lively, vivid and colorful, of course with the spicy mediterranean twist. The scenery is amazing, people are very friendly and talkative, always eager to help, food is excellent and there's plenty of places to visit (whether you're interested in the scenery, having fun, relaxing, culture and history, shopping...so on and so forth). Not to mention the mild mediterranean climate which i adore!\nSo yeah, i guess i could say it's nice and interesting...and beyond :)
Religion is a tightly held set of beliefs that touches every part of a person's world view. When that world view could be attacked, it is natural to either start attacking first or to flee. I believe attacking someone's religion to their face brings about a fight of flight response just as if they were in danger of physical harm. \n\nTo be open minded about religion and religious at the same time requires a great deal of respect for others and their rights to their own beliefs.
Seafood is evil - hate the shrimp I say.\n\nI really think it's time we let the Old Testament go - it's so full of hatred etc I really don't think it has a place in the world.  I mean, I'd rather we turned the other cheek than took an eye for an eye - might get some peace and less war.
Spongebob has much more backbone than a lot of people I know!
That's so stupid. Jehovah's Wittnesses, to me, seem even more devout. They find a whole host of additional things to adhere to in the Bible that no one else sees. I just don't get why all the factions of Christianity fight. You all DO believe in the same Jesus...
Exactly what it says - a good shepherd looks after his/her sheep, finds them good pastures to eat, keeps them safe and fends off wolves and if we get lost - leaves the other sheep behind and goes off to find us.\n\nWe can trust Jesus to look after us, want the best for us and keep us safe.\n\nHe's done a good job in my life - changing me from a self-centred twit who put his wife down - to a loving husband. He didn't give up on me when I;ve messed so many things up - but came and fouind me.\n\nBut don't take my word for it - ask my wife!!
I don't think you can find that type of information online, and certainly not for free. The closest you can get is that in most states you can find out online if someone is a registered sex offender or not.
This is on the spiritual side, not religious, and it's one of my favorite books.  It's called 'The Four Agreements' by Don Miguel Ruiz.  So you can get an idea of what the book's about, the four agreements are:\n\nBe Impeccable With Your Word\nSpeak with integrity.  Say only what you mean.  Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others.  Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.\n\nDon’t Take Anything Personally\nNothing others do is because of you.  What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream.  When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won’t be the victim of needless suffering.\n\nDon’t Make Assumptions\nFind the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want.  Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama.  With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.\n\nAlways Do Your Best\nYour best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick.  Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse, and regret.
"The simple fact you choose to call it ""putang"" means you are not mature enough for love making, or just sex.  Grow up, use proper terminology, and maybe you will get some for real, and not just with yourself."
I can't think of any reason. It's a just different spin. I think fundie Christians are just afraid to think outside the box that they have boxed themselves into.
"Well, a couple situations that happened to me recently leads me to believe that it depends on what the person did. In one instance, my ""friend"" got drunk, started verbally abusing his woman, I told him to stop, went back to reading my book, then he came up from behind me and broke my jaw in two places. Now I can forgive that with time. I'll probably whoop his a** at some point though.\n\nNow the other situation isn't forgivable. Another one of my ""friends"" tried to steal my best friend's woman and have a three way relationship (him, his girl, and my friend's woman). That sh*t just doesn't heal over time.\n\nSo hopefully you can get a guage on what kind of betrayal your friend has done."
How good was it?  Was there a happy ending?  15-20% is standard.
Definetly someone who is themself. Pretending only leads to trouble.
"Cause they're playing ""dress up.""  Get it? ""Dress."" ""Up.""  ROFLMAO!  Seriously, it's due to the drag queen or transvestite tendency."
VERY good question....\n\nwould really try to get my life right. i could only imagine how many people would be scrambling around trying to do good deeds....churches would also be PACKED!
"Noah's wife is not named in Genesis. Some traditions identify her as Aretitia, from the Hebrew ereẓ (earth), on account of her being the mother of every living thing; after her death she was called ""Vesta"" (ie, ""Eshta"", from esh, ""fire""), on account of her ascension to heaven. A separate tradition in Jubilees gives her name as Emzara, while later Midrashic writings and the Book of Jasher give it as Naamah."
Nope.  Just not my thing.  Martinis are more my thing.  :)

A windmill is an engine powered by the wind to produce energy, often contained in a large building as in traditional post mills, smock mills and tower mills. The energy windmills produce can be used in many ways, traditionally for grinding grain, pumping water, sawing wood or hammering seeds. Modern wind power machines are used for generating electricity and are more properly called wind turbines.

I would change the events of 1692 in Salem, Massachusetts.  The people hung were innocent of what they were accused of.  There was no reason for any of them to have died.
"Well you know what they say - ""Ignorance is Bliss""\nIf you don't know any better or believe everything the government is telling you then life seems a lot easier to handle.  It is when you start to question why things are the way they are, life gets much more complicated.\n\nThis is why religion is so popular, because you do not have to think for yourself, everything is absolute and anyone who says different is just wrong.  Americans especially fall into this kind of conformity so they do not have to think to much.  Let the church or the government do the thinking for you.\n\nI know there is a lot more to this then that, but it is a good place to start.  Please do not think that all Americans are ignorant even if the majority seem to be."
Love, tolerance and understanding.  While they might be free they are also the most valuable things in the world.

It's not really fair to say that Christians hate science.  In fact, many scientists are Christians.\n\nThe Bible is helping scientists understand history, and scientists are simultaneously helping Christians to enforce many of their beliefs.\n\nSee how easy it is for everyone to play nice together?

The more you know someone, or the closer you are, the more they tend to get on your nerves, because you notice the small things they do on a daily basis.\n\nThis is why you have to be careful who you are roomates with.  Sometimes this kills really good friendships.
No i can not beleive it! Not in this day and age where gay folk are getting married and having families. That is so backward if u ask me. I am hetrosexual but i am not homo phobic either. I think we should let people live the way they want to live and stop judging people because they are different then us.
CRIP... was first formed in 1969, and was an acronym for Community Resource for Independent People... and Community Police force to fight police injustice in black community... but it strayed from it's original course because of police brutality and arrest for bogus charges which led many innocent blacks to jail and prison.  Bloods broke off from crips.\n\nBelieve it or not, a White Prison gang (not supremecist group) were the first one formed... it was called Blue Bird... because of the threat from the Blue Bird, the Latinos formed the EME, the Mexican Mafia, to control the drug activities in prison... they were unmolested until the Nuestra Familia was formed because of conflict within the EME... after these conflicts, the Aryan Brotherhood and Black Guerilla Family was formed.  So... the Whites - Mid 1960's Surenos - 1968 Nortenos - early 1970's White Supremecist - early 1970's the Blacks.  (now I'm talking about prison gangs, I'm not talking about Black Panthers and what not, they weren't considering themself a gang)
God did. Jesus was sent down to earth to spread a message and save us.
i'm willing to confess. why would i want to hide it? everyone is responsible for their acts. i expect truthfulness from anyone else so why would i chickened out?\nand yeah i think sharing past mistakes is good so you can help others from making the same mistake you did. though this is a bit inconvenient if you made mistake of more embarrassing nature...
"It is not evil - it's merely a board with some black letters and a planchette\n\nIf you go looking for evil or demons you might possibly get something unwanted such as that - I've heard of stories of people trying to invoke demons and the like - they suddenly find members of their family having tragic accidents and suddenly developing terminal diseases with no ill effect to themselves - don't do it - it's not worth trying - otherwise be prepared to deal with what you bring on!\n\nSpirits that talk through the board are just like you and me - they deserve respect and should be treated well\n\nNothing will come from a board if you leave it lying around - you do not need to burn it or throw it away if you have a bad experience - it cannot work without people making it work\n\nALWAYS include prayers amongst the circle of people involved in the seance to both OPEN and close the circle. It is a good idea to make sure you protect yourself before the seance is begun with a few prayers..\n\nNever let anyone be involved in a seance who is under the influence of drugs or alcohol\n\nTiredness will stop the board from working properly - make sure all members of the seance are fully awake and not overly tired.\n\nNon believers and overly skeptical people will also ruin a seance, it's a good idea to approach a board with an open mind and a willingness to accept whatever comes forth.\n\nDon't all start arguing about who's moving the planchette - this is a common thing - it upsets the mood and some people get very angry and ruin the entire thing. If you feel that someone is pushing the planchette ask them to remove their hands for a short time.\n\nDON'T ASK THE SPIRITS TO PROVE THEY ARE THERE - Just think about it for a while - if you ask them to prove that they are there OF COURSE something is going to happen - whether it be rattling cupboards or windows - temperature dropping - things being thrown across the room - movement of other objects - you asked them to prove they are there and they are just showing you that they are.....they can't simply send you a letter in the mail saying ""hey - by the way - I was there the other night and this is just to prove it"".\nALSO it is strongly believed that if you do ask a spirit to prove that it is there that you are opening up a doorway to the other side, one that is very hard to close, you are inviting unwanted guests into this world that you may not be able to send home. Once they are here they are almost impossible to get rid of and you might find you have something attched to you and following you around causing trouble for life.\n\nYOU ARE NOT BRINING SPIRITS INTO THIS WORLD BY MERELY TALKING TO THEM THROUGH A BOARD - As stated above, you may bring them back into this world by inviting them in (this is not my personal belief) so be careful - don't invite anything in. But just by using a board and talking to spirits you aren't going to pull them into this world and trap them here or anything. The Ouija board is merely a tool to talk to spirits who are all ready here and this does not create some kind of votex to trap and pull spirits back into our own world.\n\n\nHow Does it Work?\nThere are many many theories as to why and how a board works. Psychologists explain it as a simple muscle reflex that makes your hand automatically move and your subconscious mind control the words that are spelled out. Who knows maybe this is so. I know that I've seen unexplainable things which cannot simply be muscles and subconscious minds controlling the planchette. On many occasions I have seen a planchette move around the board on it's own, with no fingers touching it. I have seen dead relatives that people didn't even know they had step forward time and time again, the relative operating the board would look into their family history to find that this person really did exist. So what is it that makes it go, the truth is nobody really knows the answer"

In Hindi, wallah means man - as in dhobi-wallah : laundryman.
I guess this is a trick question.  I think this question really depends on the person whos asking it.  Religions are pretty much anti logical by nature.  Its really impossible to pick a most logical religion without looking like a fool.\n\nThere are just to many factors when making the choice of what religion is the most logical to you it all depends on where you come from.  If you're truely looking for logic in religion I suggest you study math but even math isnt perfectly logical.

"First of all ""projectisation"" is not really a word (at least not officially, since it does not appear in reference dictionaries), but it if it did, it would probably mean the act of turning something into a project, or structuring something like a project.\n\nIt is always hard to guess the true meaning of a word outside of context, but my best guess is this word was made up by someone to talk about the introduction of formal procedures (such as scheduling, planning, resource management, etc.) into an activity which was very informal before, or making it more business-like in general."

"I wish to state categorically that this Church has nothing whatever to do with those practicing polygamy. They are not members of this Church. Most of them have never been members. They are in violation of the civil law. They know they are in violation of the law. They are subject to its penalties. The Church, of course, has no jurisdiction whatever in this matter.\n\nIf any of our members are found to be practicing plural marriage, they are excommunicated, the most serious penalty the Church can impose. Not only are those so involved in direct violation of the civil law, they are in violation of the law of this Church. An article of our faith is binding upon us. It states, ""We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law."" One cannot obey the law and disobey the law at the same time.\n\nThere is no such thing as a ""Mormon Fundamentalist."" It is a contradiction to use the two words together.\n\nMore than a century ago God clearly revealed unto His prophet Wilford Woodruff that the practice of plural marriage should be discontinued, which means that it is now against the law of God. Even in countries where civil or religious law allows polygamy, the Church teaches that marriage must be monogamous and does not accept into its membership those practicing plural marriage.  \n\nPresident Gordon B. Hinckley\n4 October 1998"
President Schwarzenegger triggered World War 3.

Governor Schwarzenegger never made a speech there last year. OH MY GOD! I'm the only one that remembers the other time line. They will be coming for me soon.\n\nSee you on The Island.

"Hm - good question.\n\nI think the myth of an optimum political-economic system would probably be a stronger contender (at least in the developed world).\nThe myth of progress (ie. that ""progress"" is always a good thing) is another likely one.\n\nOn a mythos (rather than philosophical) level, the Star Wars films are probably the great global myth of our time (kids in all kinds of countries/languages know all the details - far more intensely than they know about any version of God).\n\nGod was probably the most important myth of previous times, but hasn't been for a while. Another good question might be ""When did God cease being the most important myth?""\nSome time between the Enlightenment and the French Revolution?"
"Selkies (also known as silkies or selchies) are mythological creatures in Irish and Scottish mythology that can transform themselves from seals to humans, where ""selkie"" is simply the Orcadian word for ""seal"". The legend apparently originated on the Orkney Islands.\n\nSelkies are able to transform to human form by shedding their seal skins and can revert to seal form by putting their selkie skin back on. Stories concerning selkies are generally romantic tragedies. Sometimes the human will not know that their lover is a selkie, and wakes to find them gone. Other times the human will hide the selkie's skin, thus preventing them from returning to seal form. A selkie can only make contact with one particular human for a short amount of time before they must return to the sea. They are not able to make contact with that human again for seven years, unless the human is to steal their selkie's skin and hide it or burn it.[citation needed] The Grey Selkie of Suleskerry is a ballad typical of the former, while The Secret of Roan Inish is a movie telling the latter tale. ""Seal Child"" is a children's novel by Sylvia Peck which details a modern telling of this myth.\n\nMale selkies are very handsome in their human form, and have great seduction powers over human women. They typically seek those who are dissatisfied with their romantic life. This includes married women waiting for their fishermen husbands. If a woman wishes to make contact with a selkie male, she has to go to a beach and shed seven tears into the sea.\n\nIf a man steals a female selkie's skin, she is in his power, to an extent, and she is forced to become his wife. Female selkies are said to make excellent wives, but because their true home is the sea, they will often be seen gazing longingly to the ocean. If her skin is found she will immediately return to her home - sometimes, her selkie husband - in the sea."

I've known Muslims living in the US, they were not really any different than typical Americans.  I am not sure if all Muslims are as devoted to their religion as the people I know are, but they did not push the religion in my face.

So far it does seems for the most part peaceful.  \n\nI do not like the fact that most of the ones I have spoken with online have a lot of discrimination against those who leave their religion it makes it look a bit like an cult, but other than that they seem well mannered, educated, and willing to share their knowledge.
"It depends on the books they read.T.V. influences our decisions by creating alternate realities;sometimes allowing us to set unrealistic expectations for ourselves and others.Of course ther's the sex and violence issue.If all we watched was educational programming then that by itself would seperate us from the""norm"".You would be smarter in someways but ignorant of others.Ultimately we need to achieve balance in all areas."

"Honestly, I'm not surprised. I would like to say that our colleges are not racist...  but unfortunately, I think it is too likely that they are.  I regret to say that on my massively large campus, I have never heard any student speak up when teachers asked if there were any people of Islamic faith present, and there are very few people who appear to be of Arab descent.\n\nI absolutely believe that racism in America is not a ""black and white"" issue anymore.  African Americans have --luckily-- been able to campaign for improved access and acceptance, as have Asian-Americans. To some degree there also appears to be better access for people of Hispanic decent and (perhaps to a lesser degree) Native Americans.   However, I think that just as in WWII there was an upswell in prejudice against people of all Asian extraction, I think now there is an upswell in prejudice against people of all Arab descent.\n\nI also know that federal financial aid throws up major road blocks for all people of Arab descent whose names reflect their heritage.  I had a close friend who worked for Sallie Mae and reported that loans were consistently frozen ""for review"" for all people whose names were ""substantially similar"" to anything on the ""terrorist watch list"" -- including numerous common Arab first and last names, either of which could get someone frozen.\n\nI am sorry and ashamed of this...   *sigh*\n\nI'm not sure what good it will do to challenge these decisions, or if you feel prepared to do that, but know that there are people out here who were born into ""White America"" and still would support your right to equality in all ways.  \n\nI wish you the best of luck."
"""""Isn't it a bit naive (though very convenient) to believe that someone else can ""pay"" for your sins?""""\n\nNot only is it naive, it is also against what the Bible says!\n\nThe Christian understanding is that the Messiah, Jesus, died for the sins of the people. The messiah is supposed to be a human sacrifice that is the blood sacrifice necessary for the forgiveness of sin.\n\nBut we are taught in our Torah that no one can die for the sins of another. In Deuteronomy 24:16 it specifically says this:\n\nDeuteronomy 24:16 The fathers shall not \nbe put to death for the children, neither \nshall the children be put to death for\nthe fathers: \nevery man shall be put to death for his \nown sin (eesh b’chet-o yumatu).\n\nIn Exodus 32:30-35, Moses tries to offer himself to atone for the sins of the people. To be written out of Gd's book, means to be written out of the Book of Life, which means Moses was asking to die for the sins of the People. Gd's response is No, it does not work that way, each man dies for his own sin:\n\nExodus 32:30-35 And it came to pass on the \nmorrow, that Moses said unto the people, \nYe have sinned a great sin: and now I will \ngo up unto the Etrnl; perhaps I shall make \nan atonement for your sin. And Moses \nreturned unto the Etrnl, and said, Oh, \nthis people have sinned a great sin, and \nhave made them gods of gold. Yet now, if \nthou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, \nblot me, I pray thee, out of thy book \nwhich thou hast written. And the Etrnl \nsaid unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned \nagainst me, him will I blot out of my \nbook. \n\nThe whole of chapter 18 of the book of Ezekiel is about this idea, that no one can die for someone else's sin. Further, this chapter of Ezekiel teaches us that all we have to do for Gd's forgiveness is to stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good, and Gd will forgive us:::\n\nEzekiel 18:1-4; 20-24; 26-27 .....Behold, all \nsouls are mine; as the soul of the father, so \nalso the soul of the son is mine: the soul \nthat sinneth, it shall die. Eze 18:20 The soul \nthat sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not \nbear the iniquity of the father, neither shall \nthe father bear the iniquity of the son: the \nrighteousness of the righteous shall be upon \nhim, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be \nupon him. But if the wicked will turn from all \nhis sins that he hath committed, and keep all \nmy statutes, and do that which is lawful and \nright, he shall surely live, he shall not die. \nAll his transgressions that he hath committed, \nthey shall not be mentioned unto him: in his \nrighteousness that he hath done he shall live. \nHave I any pleasure at all that the wicked \nshould die? saith the Etrnl Gd: and not that \nhe should return from his ways, and live?.... \nEze 18:26 When a righteous man turneth away \nfrom his righteousness, and committeth \niniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity \nthat he hath done shall he die. Again, when \nthe wicked man turneth away from his \nwickedness that he hath committed, and doeth \nthat which is lawful and right, he shall save \nhis soul alive. \n\nSo, the Bible is clear, no one can die for the sins of another, and this means that Jesus cannot die for anyone else's sins."
hmmm.interesting question.I thought of this too but didn't found an answer.\ni think that misogynists made up these words..we all know that women struggled to have the same rights as men\nthe human society seems to look more carrefully at women and to be badder with them.\nstill, I don't got a good explanation.\nI think is beacuse of the same reason earthquakes have women's names
I am a luminous being, beautiful in my own fragility. I am a sculpture, a singer, a painter, an artist. I am the girl who wakes up in the morning and looks in the mirror and says: Good morning. You don't look so good right now, but God sees beyond this half-asleep glob and sees a beautiful soul. I am who I am. That is all I need, and that is all I know.
"Yes, I had heard of the word pedarasty.  The source you list is consistant with other information about sexual practices in Ancient Greece.\n\nSimilar things were practiced in other cultures too - Japan, for example.\n\nThese days, even if consenting, such relationships are illegal in most jurisdictions.\n\nThe term pederasty embraces a wide range of erotic relations between adult males and adolescent boys. Pederastic relations can have widely dissimilar manifestations – they can be lawful or transgressive, chaste or sexual, loving or commercial – and have been documented from prehistory to modern times.\n""Pederasty"" derives from the combination of pais (παις) (Greek for 'boy') with erastis (Greek for 'lover'; cf. eros). Late Latin pæderasta was borrowed in the sixteenth century directly from Plato’s classical Greek in The Symposium. The word first appears in the English language in the Renaissance, as pæderastie (e.g.: in Samuel Purchas' Pilgrimage.), in the sense of sexual relations between men and boys.\n\nIn modern academic parlance, ""pederasty"" is used as a generic term to describe the cultural phenomenon of love relationships between men and adolescent boys, wherever encountered.\n\nThe main difference between pedarasty and pedophilia (from the perspective of academia) is that pedophilia is a fetish - pedophiles only are aroused by children (of either sex, not just boys), where as pedarasts might not only be attracted to young boys, and the attraction is not necessarily sexual.  The word pedarast specifically refers to boys."

"Both Jewish and Christian traditions state that he was killed by being sawed in half. Some interpreters believe that this is what is referred to by Hebrews 11:37 (in the New Testament), which states that some prophets were ""sawn in two"". It is also mentioned in the book of The Martyrdom of Isaiah that he lived into the days of Manasseh, and was also sawn in half with a wooden saw."

why do you feel like you belong there? Is it because you really feel that the teachings are the truth? Or is it that Friends and family or congregation members make you feel welcome and at home? God expects us all to seek him, if you feel that this is the right place for you maybe it is for now? However, if you do not agree with the teachings, feel that they dont come from God, or you are not getting the answers you seek, you would be wise to look at why you want to stay. If you value your relationship with God, pray to him and ask him to guide you, and teach you the truth. If you are just shy, it would not take long to settle in somewhere else if you feel that you need to move on. Trust God. You might also get alot of negativity from people on here because many feel that morman is a cult, i am going to be baptised as one of Jehovahs witnesses soon, and i get ridiculed sometimes, i dont mind though, because i trust in God to take care of me, and i am loved by him, and my brothers and sisters. They are close to me as if they are related. I can count on anyone in my congregation to help me if i need it, that is how it should be. Jesus said:\n“I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.”—John 13:34, 35.\nHope you find your way
Here's a site for some games http://www.funattic.com/game_icebreaker.htm\none of my favorite games I learned in junior high youth group is called shuffle your buns.  Everyone sits in chairs in a circle with one person standing in the middle.  There is one more chair than the number of people that are sitting down. The person in the middle tries to sit in that seat and the people in the circle switch chairs to keep that person from getting an open chair. When that person gets an open chair the person to the right has to go in the middle.  The applications are that we need to keep the devil out of our lives and to turn the other cheek.

Of course we'd known that the levies would break; in fact, the President had the information about a more powerful hurricane destroying the levees, yet he chose not to develop any emergency planning. The levees themselves were only built to withstand a Category 2 or possibly Category 3 hurricane. We can definitely predict that these disasters will happen, with advanced computer models and other new technologies.

There is no rational reason to believe in 'life after death' - the very idea is an oxymoron.  When you die, you're dead, you cease to exist, and that's that.  Anything else is just wishful thinking.
Abso-Fn-lutely NOT.\n\n1st, the military is the arm of the government which should not affiliate with any religion\n\n2nd, I'm not comfortable with anything that's mission is death and destruction (whether justified, necessary, or not) being associated with religions that are supposed to promote peace, love, and understanding.  Would Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha fire a gun?  If not, then don't pick one up in their name.
In Quran, There is no where mentioned that Sun was created before earth.\n\nWhen I have talked with Christians before, they seem to be saying don't look at scientific accuracy of bible, look in the message only. For example there is a verse in bible that states that sun was stopped in the sky to prolong the day.\nSee Joshua 10 : 12,13.\nhttp://cgi.godsview.com/cgi-bin/rcdenig/kjvread.pl?book=6&chapter=10\n\nIf bible is scientifically correct, isn't it the rotation of earth that has to be stopped to prolong the day ?
It is fascinating and, as I read evidence for its authenticity, I get excited; then, when I read contrary evidence, it depresses me. So, I go back to the Word of God, the one thing that I can be certain about. It testified that Jesus is our Savior, It supplied the faith for every martyr, and edifies and instructs the church today. God's Word never changes, it is a sure foundation, and it is preserved forever in heaven.\n\nSomeone once let me hold a supposed splinter of Noah's Ark. I can't say that it helped my relationship with God; but I can say that about the Bible.
You can't be punished for not knowing something. I think we will be given a chance to accept God's truth and that is what we will be judged on, and whether or not we acted on the truth we already had.
I believe heaven and hell are right here on earth. No its not because I'm not imaginative or anything. Its just because its been that way for me.\n\nHeaven was when I spent the entire day with buntz (my nephew) and we did all kinda things like goin to the zoo and all that. For an entire day I was completely withdrawn from all the troubles I had ( and I had a lot). \n\nI think heaven is kinda like that. A purgatory but an extremely pleasent one. One where its your world ..your peace. \n\n(sigh)
Unfortunately, this statement about animals getting on together is false, generally most species are aggressive! Birds will have fights over territory, cats scrap all the time, even peace loving creatures like dolphins will fight to prove who is alpha-male in courtship! \n\nMankind is just a more elaborate form of animal, and thus we have those same instincts, to reign supreme over other men, to get the best mate, to own the most etc. The only reason it is not excusable in humans is that we have the ability to rationalise.\n\nWe can realise that something we are doing is fundenmentally wrong, and yet we still do it. And that sucks. Because if everyone used their minds a bit more, they would realise we don't have to behave like greedy animals to get along in this world.
I'll add a little bit here, just in case you want to know some of the characteristics of Gnostic Christians in the early church.  Of course one could write several books on this subject but I will keep it short.\n\nLet's start with creation.  Gnostic Christians did not believe that the God who created this world, the God of the Old Testament, was the supreme being worthy of worship.  Rather, he was a lesser diety, but he did not know this.  Therefore many Christian Gnostics would throw out the Old Testament.\n\nGnostics also believe the material world is evil, and our goal is to escape this world and return to the heavenly realm we came from.  Combine this with their belief about the creator God above, and you get a very interesting twist on the creation story.  Some Gnostic Christians viewed the serpent in the Adam and Eve story as Jesus.  Why?  Because the lesser creator God wanted to trap Adam and Eve in the evil material world.  The serpent wanted Adam and Eve to eat the fruit of the tree of Knowledge, and that Knowledge would free them from being foreve trapped in this world.\n\nChristian gnostics also had their own creation story that is very different from Genesis and is too detailed to go into here.\n\nThese beliefs also changed their views on Jesus.  They had a docetic Christology, which means they believed that Jesus only appeared to be human, because the supreme God would never contaminate himself by putting himself into an evil material body.  Jesus came to give us the gnosis, or knowledge, of how to get to heaven, and there were at least a few who did not believe that Jesus died on the Cross.  After all, if he only appeared to be human, how could he die.\n\nHope you find this helpful.

Because they have forgotten the fact that according to their religion, God is the only one who needs to worry about other people believing.\n\nI am also an atheist. I have no problem with people practicing religion, or even talking about religion- but when people tell me that I'm wrong, I get pretty angry. Even if I am wrong, and God does exist, I'm going to hell and you're not going to have to deal with me when you're all the way up in heaven.\n\nSome atheists are guilty of that too, though, and it pisses me off just as badly. Live and let live.
If i could imagine, i would say like the drums in Africa as they beat the drums that could be heard from village to village each village taking it farther and farther to its destination..sometimes the enemy would hear it,(hackers). progress called computers have the same problems (hackers) life repeats itself, is we only really looked in a place called the third eye, or vision, for there is nothing new  under the sun....most times we dont catch on till we are nearing what we call the end of life....which could start in our 50's unless remain a fool all of our life
It's a disease that nobody cares about environment, love, respect, honesty... I think the real reason people act this way is because they don't really care about the consequences of their actions. Money is the language of this era and then everybody tries to get some (or too much) no matter how. And I think the seven sins are killing our planet and killing human kind... specially greed.
I know a difference. His Holiness the Dalai Lama is the leader of only one sect of Buddhism, while the Pope is the leader of the whole Catholic Church. The Dalai Lama is the most famous Lama because He was made the leader of Tibet after they were forced to flee to India during the Chinese Invasion. They both work for peace and tolerance and encourage peaceful demonstration over armed conflict whenever possible.

I'm not a psychologist but I beleive that in dreams you often see things which are causing you anxiety.  It may be that you did not realize it was causing you a problem, so dreams can often be a good way of bringing to your attention something you should deal with.\n\nIn short - you are worried about your brothers (obvious really).
You don't need to. If you believe in Jesus Christ and God's salvation, you're gonna go to heaven. God will look after them much much better than you can. So enjoy your stay with God!

"Sorry to cut and paste, but I've answered this question quite a lot lately...\n\n\nThe gospel of Judas is not credible. Scientists believe it to be the work of gnostics, a mystical early Christian denomination. People in those times did not have the access to the scriptures as we do today. They rarely had more than one or two books of the Bible at one time, so they often did not know what the other parts said. Gnostics often wrote stories of the way they thought things might be. The gospel of Judas is a philosophical conjecture, not scripture. It was also written at least 100 years after the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John - the 4 gospels present in the Bible that tell of Judas's betrayal.\nAlso, because ""gospel"" means ""good news"", and the good news is that Jesus died for our sins, the text would have to include the crucifixion and resurrection to be classified as a gospel. The gospel of Judas tells of neither. \n\nThe gospel of Judas has indeed been authenticated - that means that it is indeed as old as it seems. It does not mean that it is a work of scripture. If you want to back up what I have said, then watch the National Geographic special. April 13 and 22 at 9pm ET/PT. \nAs for the other gospels, the earliest known manuscripts date from 65 to 95 AD. That is 35 to 65 years after Christ died. It is quite possible then, that even if these were the earliest manuscripts (and not just the earliest known ones) that they are first-hand accounts, or recorded from first hand accounts."

"Sorry I don't know of the essay you mention, but I would like to say that whether or not a person could accept that theory would depend entirely on their perception of what ""God"" is.  Personally, I enjoy holding an idea that ""God"" is the spirit of life, love, intelligence, creativity, etc. that permeates all of life, including not only people, but plants, animals, etc. and since I still see that all of these are here, it is impossible for me to accept any theory that ""God"" is not here now.  Of course, if someone holds ""God"" to be some kind of ""man"" (father) in the sky, or somewhere else up there or out there, then accepting another theory than mine might be easier for them.  I know in my heart that ""God"" is always present and active in my life, and in all life......and my genuine respect for life is a sure form of ""worship."""

I normally ignore questions that come from shallow individuals that don't have a clue, but I can't pass this one up.  As a former teacher of physically challenged children, I can tell you that not all people are large by choice- some have physical limitations that do not allow them to move as well or as much as you- try sitting in a wheelchair for awhile and see what happens to your body.  As a current nursing student, I can tell you that some people are not blessed with the genetics that makes one tend to be thin and they are more prone to being large.  As a human being, I can tell you that I value individuals for who they are- not what they look like, their social status, or age.  One of the dearest men I've ever known was badly scared due to being burned in a fire. His mobility was extremly limited and he gained some weight- he was still one of the kindest, wisest men I've had the pleasure to call my friend.  I feel sorry for all those who would turn away because they didn't like the way he looked.  They missed a wonderful opportunity to know a great man.  How many great people have you missed the chance to get to know because of your judgemental attitude?  Not everyone is a size 2.  There's nothing wrong with someone because they are a size 14, 20, or 32.  You should realize that these indiviuals are already hurting and they don't need others to make their pain worse.  As for me, I also do occassional plus size modeling-plus size is anything over a size 12 and guess what?  That's most of America's women.  If a small body made you beautiful and happy, then Hollywood would never have any divorces.  I am both beautiful and happy because of who I am as a person.  Everyone will grow old and time will take it's toll on all of us, I hope you mature in your thinking and acceptance of others before then or you will be very unhappy.

Doctrine. All Christians hold the basic concepts of Christianity and accept Christ as the Son of God and their Savior. Doctrine is the part of the Church where men try to interpret the meaning of God's word. In other words, translate the divine into mortal terms. Groups that agree or accept one interpretation belong to one denomination.\n   As a responsible christian, you should investigate and educate yourself on the doctrine of a church and then decide if you agree with it or not. If not, there are many others from which to choose. You can still be a christian and not belong to a particular denomination. The decision is yours to make.

Spirituality has a couple of different meanings. One involves non-material beings, in which I don't believe. The other simply expresses an amazement with the universe around us and ways to learn how to love and help others. This I strongly believe in. Since many religions ask and try to answer the second type of question, I have found it useful to look at the answers they have come up with to see if I can use them in my life. Not all of the answers require belief in a deity. Also, given the number of religios people around, it is important (to me) to understand the various religions so I can relate better to those I share this planet with. When I disgree, I *try* to do so politely unless impoliteness started somewhere else.

A Vegan yes. See Numbers 11 when the children of Isreal were in the wilderness and God gave them the meat of their desire. You will see that none of those who partook of the flesh entered the promised land. If you look at the news and various studies you will see that all animals are diseased. The original diet for man was a vegan diet (see Genesis 1:29). In the end in the book of Revelation you will see there will be no more death in the new earth which also means no more killing of animals for food. God made a provision for man to eat flesh after the flood but it was not to remain so. The way meat is killed today is by no means the way God said to kill it. All the McDonald's burgers, etc. have the blood and urine in it to make it tasty. If you were to kill the meat the way God said to and drain the blood, it will taste like a leather boot no matter how much you season it. Why not refrain for all flesh now and be much healthier?

"I believe that each one of us contains the Divine seed within. I just know that God incarnates on Earth many times whether as well-known incarnations such as: Jesus, Buddha, Satya Sai Baba, Krishna, etc. or as someone unknown working quietly. I view them as fully grown Divine trees that continue to give fruit and help nurture our ""seeds"" within so that we may grow to be the beautiful trees that they all are.\n\nI believe that it takes several lifetimes to continue to grow. We pick up where we left off spiritually in the previous life. I am sure I've had several lives in different religions because I feel a sense of familiarity with many religions and don't see one as better than another, just a different perspective of the path towards God.\n\nSince I view religion like a map that we hold in our hands, but the map itself does not take you to where you want to go. You have to do the actual action to get yourself to the destination. And those actions are the divine qualities that you need to develop in order to get to the destination of God: love, wisdom, acceptance, tolerance, nonjudgment, peace, joy, humility and so on.\n\nAlso I believe that if one had spent their previous life studying spirituality seriously, then the next life, one would probably not need the map/religion in order to get to Self-Realization. It just becomes much more natural and spontaneous for them because they are just ""remembering"" what they had learnt previously.\n\nI believe in what Jesus teaches. I love his parables. I also believe in what Buddha teaches. I also believe in what all of the Hindu Gods and Goddess teach. These all are Divine teachers. They all have a lot of similiarities. They all teach me who to become within in order to be closer to God, that seed within. They all teach me what it really means to be loving, compassionate, wise, accepting and nonjudgmental.\n\nI just believe that everybody can teach me something about myself whether big or small. Even people who do the opposite can still teach me how to NOT be that way."

Our problem is the number of people who have no basic concept of what evolution actually is.  The poster above, who answers a question on evolution with something about astrophysics instead of biology, is an excellent example of this ignorance.    A questioner yesterday asked nine questions about evolution, and only the last one actually had anything to do with evolution theory.  It's troubling to see this, especially when you see the same person make the same claims after having been corrected.

There is that fine line to walk on your post.

"If you HAVE to get one it's ALWAYS better to get one from your local bank or credit union.  Why?  Because they are out to win your business thereby building theirs.  Choosing a random credit card company is usually a bad idea.  And if you take only one piece of advice from me let it be this....STAY AWAY from those credit card companies who send representative to your school.  They are predators and you will regret ever dealing with them.  These reps don't care about whether you get a card or not or if the company will treat you fairly.  They get paid a fee for every ""complete"" application filled out and faxed in.  Good Luck!!!"
:}\nThat was his purpose in being incarnated.\nThe Old Testament is replete with Scripture predicting his Crucifixion\nEarlier parts of his ministry he taught over and over that he would be crucified for our sins\n\nHis purpose was to provide the payment of death to satisfy the forensic debt created by our sin.\nThe love of G-d and his unwillingness that we should perish necessitated his sacrifice.

No, Man is like God.  For God created man in His image and likeness (Gen 1:26-27).  But unlike God, man is not complete; we do not have eternal life... yet.  God is still in the process of creating us in his image and likeness, and offers us eternal life so that we can be like him and with him, enjoying life forever.\n\nYour analogy of a movie is an interesting one.  Though God can be thought of as a Producer, writer and director -- in that he makes all things possible, has a plan and oversees its fulfillment; and people are like actors, having free will -- the analogy breaks down from there.  Life, and God's plan, is not like a script for actors to follow.  It's more like a production schedule, where there are certain things that must happen at certain times, and God makes sure they happen regardless of the will of the people involved.\n\nAs for the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil that God planted in the midst of the Garden of Eden -- This reveals an aspect of God that few people realize -- God does NOT know all things.  He does not know what beings with free will will do in each situation.  But he wants and needs to know that; so, he tests us to find out.  The tree was a test.  Adam, and all his family by his action, failed the test!\n\nGod tested Abraham in the sacrifice of his son Isaac; he tested the Israelites in the wilderness, to find out if they would obey him or not.  God even allowed Satan to tempt Christ, to test him.  And God tests Christians today; all for the same reason -- to find out if we will obey him forever.\n\nBut notice, God had planted TWO trees in the midst of the Garden, and it was only the one he commanded the man not to eat.  The other, he actually WANTS us to eat of the fruit.

There would be no Christianity.\n\nJudaism would outnumber the religious population in the world. There may have been a WWII, but perhaps instead of Jews being a main target, it would have been a race/another religion. Israel would be its true state because, like I said, the Jews would outnumber the Pakistanis and, if there was a religious war over the land, the Jews would win an easy battle. \n\nHmm... that's all I can think of at the moment, but it was a good idea. Made me ponder :)

I think its circumstance and choice.  God gave us free will, God allows things to happen in our lives.\n\nI do think that He is still involved in our lives and directs our lives to whatever degree we cooperate.  I don't believe that our lives are written in stone and I don't believe we are completely without God's influence.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. What I find most attractive is not the same thing as other people.  And the other way around too, you will know.  But in the mean time, it could be that you should be a little bolder too possibly.  Are you showing interest in others too?  Or just waiting for someone else to make the move on you?

I do not think God is blessing America.  America is set up as a secular society, and the people are just living for material happiness.  God's blessing is not reflected in the accumulation of material goods if those goods just distance people from God, which they do, and God does not bless a country that does not actually recognize Him as God.  Just the fact that we are a secular nation means that God would not bless us, because we are not recognizing Him as the one who would bless us.  If anything our current success could be a curse, because our success seems to take us further from worshipping and interacting with God.

Most Asians think that the ancestors who made it possible for us to be here are deserving of respect and regular acknowledgment; that's why they practice what westerners call ancestor-worship.  Since they have that, they don't need god.\n\nSo there you go.

You can wear short skirts or dresses, not like a miniskirt though.  Don't wear something too tight.  I believe that it suggests color is fine, unlike typical coctail attire where one is pressured to wear muted tones or black.  Still don't wear pants (you might be able to get away with dress pants if you really hate dresses).  Hair is done nicely but fun, doesn't have to be up.
"I don't think all English speaking people can be considered intelligent, and neither the other way around. It just means that maybe you were born in a geographical area. Nothing more. There are some studies that show that different languages require different sides of the brain to be spoken. If that is the case, the difficulties on learning a English can be only a temporary ""out of practice"" use of that side of the brain. It just takes some more time. The same with all the other languages."

All he and the other little boys and girls do in the orphanage is ""exist"". They used to have a television, but it broke and they now have nothing to occupy themselves with. They are really bored.  No one is stimulating their minds, and he begged the interviewer if she could provide them with a television or a radio."

I think all humans are by nature 'racist'.\nWe all have a need to organise, catergorize something, especially another race. There are so many different types of individuals, so many different personalities and people, most of us need something like a word, a description to describe the 'typical' characteristics (that might perhaps stem out of cultural biasness or differences in culture and hence the stereotyping), or we wouldn't be able to actually 'understand' the people.\nAdding to that, mass media tends to pull jokes that many times border on racial stereotypes, the smiling chinaman, the flirtatious Indian, the poor mexican, the nodding Japanese - it's become so widespread and mainstream that it's become an unconscious gesture of just describing or poking fun at a race.\nIt doesn't bother me so long as the jokes or the meaning isn't meant to have a vicious undertone, used to discriminate, insult or degrade the race.\nSometimes, we have to learn and accept that we all make snap and permanent judgements on people, including races. What matters is the line we draw at these judgements, jokes and so on.\n\nJenova\n(d.yuffie@gmail.com)

If the Bible was  never translated, you would only be able to read it if you spoke Hebrew, aramaic, or Greek. The Bible needed to be translated so all could read it. Plus it has been translated into modern english so it is easier to understand. This happens with all literiture, dictionaries etc. The Bible can be graphic in some parts, but is up to the parent to teach the child according to age and ability, and to discern what is needed at the right time. I actually think that the fact it has been translated and is read by so many people in the world, survived even when Church leaders didnt want the commoners to read it, and is still relevant to life today is testament to the fact that it is the word of God!

"Jesus says turn the other cheek, which means to let yourself be made vulnerable to further harm for their well being.  It isn't about right and wrong.  Justice is important but the prayer of the publican is ""Lord have mercy."" Jesus says the Father will have mercy to the extent you do.\n\nThis does not mean you need to go back into the relationship as boyfriend/girlfriend but you are called to forgive in your heart and to tell them they are forgiven.  If you are carrying this around the anger will turn into hate.  Anger is rejection of what was done, hate is rejecting the person as a person."
"One could say the same for advertising. Or sports. Or just about anything. \n\nPicking up religion, and examining every misuse of it is not the right way to look at religion. If a butterfly falls in your cup of coffee and make it undrinkable, would we conclude that butterflies were created to spoil coffee? \n\nButterflies do much more than die in cups of coffee, and coffee is rendered undrinkable for a hundred other reasons.\n\nThe point is, nitpicking on religion is not logical. I am not poor. Religion gives me hope too. That should kill this line of argument. \n\nReligion isn't something that people invented in the past 1500 years to kill each other. Religion is a way to understand life - the totality of life. There are many ""problems"" with applied religion, the biggest one is that people are selective in following religion, and then blame it all on faith.\n\nA writer once said that cultures are not based on customs. Cultures are different based on how people answer the question about life AND after life. In other words, how people answer the questions: WHO AM I? WHERE DID I COME FROM? WHAT AM I DOING HERE? WHERE WILL I GO WHEN I DIE? WHAT WILL HAPPEN THERE?\n\nTo me, that is also the definition of religion: a set of answers to the above questions. To apply such a big thing on individual examples is misunderstanding religion. Secondly, if people behave in this world as if there's no tomorrow, and someone else suffers from their acts - why blame it on any faith?\n\nReligion, esp Abrahamic faiths, are much much more than getting fascinated with nature. In Abrahamic tradition, that is just the beginning. Prophet Abraham started with observing nature, and was disappointed that the stars, moon, and the Sun all ""vanished."" So he said, ""If this thing sets, it cannot be my God!"" \n\nGod and religion are larger than people trying to use them as some kinds of solutions to everyday problems. Without changing the fundamental mindset - without answering these five questions above - one cannot understand and practice religion. And cannot blame the human faults on God."

It seems to go around the net because groups like Chick Publications put in out there that this happened.  I believe the origin of this particular urban myth comes from the retranslation of the KJV in the 1890's.  Whole denominations' reasons for existence winked out of existence with that event.  Also, people have edited the bible throughout history but generally not in a malicious way.  A clarification here or there, and edit etc by people who did not always have the best text to work from.  In that limited sense people did add or subtract, but it doesn't affect us today.  It is also probably exaggerated by the prior existence of more slanted texts done so as to support a particular theological cause.  This is mostly rare now and isn't done to support theology so much as internal church politics and audience needs.  Using multidenominational translation teams put and end to the likelihood of that occuring.\n\nThe other thing is a misunderstanding of the deuterocanonical books.  They were not added, Luther removed them.  They had always been there.  The only major early authority who suggest their removal is Jerome and I believe Anthanasius, but Anthanasius has I believe seven additional texts in his New Testament.\n\nAlso most people are unaware of the process by which the books were assembled into a canon for all of Christianity.  They are not aware that it was the Pope who promulgated the list and it is on Papal authority that the list rests.  A local synod at Carthage, following the work of one at Hippo Regius and a local synod at Rome sent their lists to the Pope.  He promulgated the list using his authority, also with a list of excluded books and so closed the issue until Luther.  Luther did remove James, Jude, Revelations and the Deuterocanonicals as they didn't agree with him.  The charge ever since is that Catholics added books to the bible.
for Pete's sake .... how can anyone read this question and some of the subsequent replies and still think the Bible has relevance?  How many kids are bullied at school because of their size, and here you lot are using the Bible to keep that going.\n  Being overweight can be due to any number of things, many cancer medications, many Anti depressant medications can cause the person taking them to put weight on,  A lot of pregnant women won't be able to move some of the excess weight they put on before the birth.  Thyroid troubles cause huge problems for some people.\nAnd the reason there are larger people now than in the 60's is  because diet has changed, people don't home cook the way our grandmothers did, food is more highly processed, everyone has cars, no-one takes exercise even walking to work.\n   I hope all you perfect skinnies who condemned the larger people for no good reason wake up one day and find you all gained 200 pounds.

"Because in these days, society has decided that nobody is responsible for their own actions.  Drank yourself into a stupor, then had a car accident?  Blame the bar where you chose to keep drinking even though you knew you had to drive.  Got caught stealing?

Check with your local department of Family and Youth Services. Depending on your state the guideline will vary but usually you will have to sign up for a 3 month class that meets once a week. You will discuss the family role, the potential issues and problems your foster children may have after being taken from their homes. \n\nYou will then be evaluated and ask to write testimonials as to why you want to be a foster parent. The state will ask for testimonials from a few of your friends and family - which you will designate who you want to write.\n\nThey will do a background check on your - arrest records etc to make sure there are no drugs, felonies etc.\n\nIt is a process that takes several months to go through but if your heart is into it - it is worth it. Good for you.\n\nI dont believe money is a factor in considering whether or not you can be a foster parent. I think single people can foster children and I'm not sure about sexual orientation and fostering. But these are all things that would come up in your classes.\n\nThey will also set up your own personal case worker to help you and be available for you for education, help, support etc. \n\nGood for you - there are children out there who need you!
"I do not know, but that is a very sick reason for an abortion.  Though, I guess it might depend on the country you are talking about because in many Asian countries, females are looked down upon by society, and though they deny the practice, are still often ""accidentally"" killed in backwater regions of the country.  If it was simply because she wanted a boy, then this woman has some very serious issues and is quite selfish to take the life of an unborn child just because it is female."
Try using some concecrated mother of pearl.Annoint it with some sea water, or money attracting oil like cedar or patchouli,then take a silver coin (silver coins minted before 1965 are totally silver),and wrap it with the m.o.p. in a dollar bill or green paper, and tie with with green string and place it between 2 green candles and visualize money coming into your life for about 15 minutes.Then snuff the candles and carry the charm with you.Just, be careful what you wish for.You know how these things work.
"I think you're right. Most Christian boycotters are very selective in who they boycott. Homosexuality is one ""hot spot.""\n\nTo be honest, if they boycott every company that had a disagreement with their theology, they couldn't buy anything at all. They should be living somewhere in hovels, without power, clothes, and food.\n\nIn any case, our job is to be salt in the world, not constantly protest what the world is doing.\n\nIf they are so worried about homosexuality, they would do much better being friends with homosexuals, finding out their needs, and serving them as real people whom they cared about, instead of impersonally fighting to simply take things away from them that they really do need."

"My parents came to America from Cuba, and I myself lived overseas (Japan) for six years.   \n\nFor my parents, they wanted to be American.

Of Course
You might say American Christians could have a different kind of suffering because of our freedom.  The freedom to choose addictions and a huge list of other hollow things that our material- and sex-focused society holds up as luxuries means a lot of americans suffer within a superficial christianity and don't know what is causing it.  In that way Americans could suffer internal battles from several of society's messages versus externally from the govt.  People in other cultures who suffer for their faith hold their beliefs even more dear and maybe get stronger.  Americans don't have to struggle for ours and don't get the same blessings in our lack of suffering, but it doesn't make us less Christian. Christian = forgiven sinner.  Our culture persecutes us by forcing cheap replacements on us and working us to death so that our relationships and things that matter in this life suffer.   That is a menial persecution compared to torture and other grievances - i think I see where you're coming from.\n\nMaybe the verse touches on how people don't like to be convicted of truth.  People can respond fiercely when they are not ready to hear something.  People pushed Jesus to the edge of society and killed him violently.  He was a peaceful guy but he exposed the religious leaders' motives and it was met with force.  Ideas are powerful.  I think it is a warning that you won't be welcomed with open arms all the time when speaking about the bible and the story.

The Buddha's discovery of the solution to the problem of suffering began with the recognition that life is suffering. This is the first of the Four Noble Truths. If people examine their own experiences or look at the world around them, they will see that life is full of suffering. Suffering may be Physical or Mental.\nPhysical Suffering\nPhysical suffering takes many forms. People must have observed at one time or another, how their aged relatives suffer. Most of the aged suffer aches and pains in their joints and many find it hard to move about by themselves. With advancing age, the lderlyfind life difficult because they cannot see, hear or eat properly. The pain of disease, which strikes young and old alike, is unbearable, and the pain of death brings much grief and suffering. Even the moment of birth gives pain both to the mother and to the child that is born.\nThe truth is that suffering of birth, old age, sickness and death is unavoidable. Some fortunate people may now be enjoying relatively happy and carefree lives, but it is only a matter of time before they, too, will experience suffering. What is worse, this suffering must be born alone.\nMental Suffering\nBeside physical suffering, there are also various forms of mental suffering. People feel sad, lonely or depressed when they lose someone they love through separation or death. They feel irritated or uncomfortable when they are forced to be company of those whom they dislike or those who are unpleasant. People also suffer when they unable to satisfy their limitless needs and wants.\nHappiness in Life \nWhen the Buddha said that there is suffering in life, he did not deny that there is happiness also. On the contrary, he spoke of many kinds of happiness such as the happiness of friendship, the happiness of family life, and so on. But all these kinds of happiness are impermanent and when one loses them, one suffers. For example, one may like a pleasant and charming person and enjoy his or her company. But when one is separated from that person, the happiness turns into suffering. One suffers because of one's attachment to pleasures that do not last.\nPeople often remain unaware of the inevitable sufferings of life because they are distracted by temporary pleasures.
The same way everyone else celebrates a birthday. A nice party with some of the kid's friends, cake, candles, pizza or whatever else you want to serve. It's up to you and the birthday kid to know what you want. Have fun, celebrate and have a great birthday.....
Not really..although I think in the Spanish dictionary it does have the same meaning. Puta means whore..Puto means male homosexual
It was a religious revival attempting to revive the integrity of the monastic orders. It was also a way to get young people into monistaries.
I think everyone is mixed with something even though I just look caucasian  ( I'm of Norwegian,Holland,Irish & Scottish background - I'm a redhead w/ freckles ) and my Fiance is Black,French-creole, American Indian and White and  our babygirl is all that and right now she looks Hispanic or Indian but her black hair is slowly turning more red and she has a very light complexion from my side and she may get my freckles - when she was born she looked Asian or Eskimo
pretty amazing, eh? i tend to believe.

No, it'll probably annoy her and make her more angry.
well this is terrible, but i was on my period last year and it had leaked through my jeans during first block, and w/o me knowing it, i was walkin down the hall to the gym, so second block in PE, we all went to the locker room to get changed, and there's this huge mirror, well when i seen it, i freaked and wrapped my hoodie around my waist all day, but also during PE, when we were changin, i went into a stall that was out of order, but the door was pushed in so far that i didn't see the sign and went anyways...well the toilet wouldn't flush and i freaked and just walked out...i hope nobody ever found out it was me..but it was the worst situation a gurl could ever have..in my opinion...only cuz it happened to me, but i guess the worst is over for me. lol.
most people on here already do how come you havent noticed before now??!!!!!!
its not the organized religion. It is the separate churches that do the corruption. Sadly in my line of work i find alot of corruption in churches. \nThe corruption can be financial, spiritual or social.  If you find corruption in a church you should expose it. I have a bad habit of do this.\n I can't tell ya how many churches have banned me from preaching and teaching just for exposing thier leadership!
It is interesting to note that this particular description of satan only came about in the new testament.\n\nWith the expansion of christianity, in an attempt to covert other faiths, they try to turn the Gods of old into the devils of the new. A prime example is the way the catholics in their expansionists stage perverted the 'Great God Pan'.\n\nI find this to be one of the lowest points of the church, and a cheap way of trying to discredit other valid religions.\n\nYour Friendly Priest of Pan

Over a period of time you will come across people who will give you lots of varieties of advice.\n1. first remember that meditation is solely for control over the senses.To the person who practices, his main aim should be to control the wavering of the  mind. Dawn and dusk are excellent periods for such practices.\n2. Meditation doen't mean merely concentrating for a few hours. You HAVE TO practice the following:\n                 SEE NO EVIL\n                 HEAR NO EVIL\n                 SPEAK NO EVIL\n                 THINK NO EVIL\nThe first and last are of paramount importance.Lapses in the above result in the kundalini slipping back to it's original place. But if you suceed, over a period of time, the kundalini shakti comes up to it's zenith and your mental and intellectual power are extremely enhanced. \n         So good luck. You are on the right path and remember it needs lots of practice and patience.
"I am fascinated by spirits. I have had personal experiences with them. One of my favorite things to do is go cemetery hopping at night! I take pics trying to find orbs or mists. I also enjoy staying in ""haunted hotels"". I stayed in a bed and breakfast in st. Louis mo called Lemp Masion. It had been listed as the second most haunted place in the country. It was awesome!! Put it this way, I asked my husband before we got there, if he believed in ghosts. He said ""I believe in exterrestials before ghosts!"" He didn't say that the next morning! He said ""There were too many things happening you can't explain."" I don't know how close you are to st. louis, but it's worth the trip. Go to www.lempmansion.com"
Wow, what a loaded question.  \n\nThere is a lot of history involved in most of these conflicts.  In other words, it's not just that two groups of people are from different religions.  Just being in those religions does not make a fight (look at America, every faith lives here without fighting).  \n\nInstead the conflicts tend to have socioeconomic (meaning having to do with group interactions and money), and deeply held personal feelings at stake.\n\nLet's look at a hypothetical (b/c I don't want to offend anybody).\n\nA group of people has an uprising because they (correctly) believe that they are being oppressed for monetary gain by another group of people.  We'll call these people the Alphas.  The Alphas belong to religion A.  It takes almost 10 years for the Alphas to overcome their oppressors.  The world looks on and agrees that the fight is good b/c the oppressors are bad.\n\nIn the course of this uprising there are individuals involved who are not good people.  They are not interested in just being free, they want money.  And maybe they want to hurt someone b/c they were always jealous of the stuff that  person had.  Bottom line is that they are not nice (you've met people like this I'm sure).  During the revolution this mean person goes into a section of town occupied by another group of people. We'll call them the Betas.  The Betas belong mostly to religion B.  So the mean person goes into town, and in the name of the revolution takes a bunch of stuff from the Betas.  The Betas don't like this and they fight back, but the mean guy has a whole army so he kills a bunch of Betas (who he doesn't like anyway) and moves on.\n\nSo this mean person goes to the part of town where the Betas live, and steals a bunch of their stuff while the revolution is going on.  Well, unfortunately, sometimes the Betas will see the actions of this one person as indicative of the people who belong to religion A.  Maybe one of the preachers of religion B will have a sermon talking about how mean Alphas can be, which will get the Betas even more upset.\n(I think one of the greatest sins against God and man is to preach a sermon of hate.)\n\nSo now you see the seeds being sown.\n\nWell put another factor on top of this.  If I want people to come together and act like a team, a great way to do this is to give them an enemy.  If people have somewhere to focus their frustration (like if they are hungry, or poor) they can come together, and forget their differences while they attack this perceived enemy. So if I want to bring a group together, and I want to be their leader I'll pick someone they don't like anyway, and I'll tell them everything is their fault.  Let's say that I'm a Beta, and I'm running for Governor.  I don't want anybody to talk about the fact that I'm corrupt and take money from gangsters, so I spend every conversation talking about how the Alphas are really bad people.  That way everyone will agree with me.\n\nSux, huh?\n\nThe only way to get over this stuff is to let the past be.  We must look on for our children.  We must forge peace ourselves.

"Yahoo Answers may replace or*al sex with ***'s in this answer, but I hope it will help you.\n\n________________\n\n\nIs Oral Sex A Sin - What Does the Bible Say?\nCouples often ask, ""Is oral sex a sin?"" The best place to look for answers is in the Bible. Hebrews 13:4 says, ""Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral."" The first point the Bible makes very clear is that sex - all types - is designed specifically for married couples. Non-married couples are not to practice premarital sex. \n\nThe Bible never indicates exactly what a husband and wife are allowed to do in their sexual relationship. However, there are some sexual principles that we can consider. \n\n\n\nMutual Consent - 1 Corinthians 7:5 says, ""Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control."" This verse indicates that each sexual activity should be mutually agreed upon. \n\n\nAdultery is Sin - The Bible is very clear that any form of adultery is sin, even if both people in a marriage relationship agree to it. 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5 says, ""It is God's will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; that each of you should learn to control his own body in a way that is holy and honorable, not in passionate lust like the heathen, who do not know God."" Adultery also includes ""swapping"" or adding sexual partners. \n\nViewing Pornography is a Sin - Matthew 5:28 is very clear. ""But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart."" Pornography viewed alone or together as a couple is sin. 1 John 2:16 says, ""For everything in the world - the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does - comes not from the Father but from the world.""\n\nIs Oral Sex A Sin - Practical Application\nWhen answering the question ""Is oral sex a sin,"" it is important to remember that God created sex to be a beautiful expression of love for married couples. When the husband or the wife does not feel that sex is a ""beautiful expression of love,"" then changes need to be made in that couple's sex life. Evidentially, the actions are not mutually beneficial to each person. Nothing in the Bible says that oral sex is a sin, however it may not be appropriate for every couple. \n\nIs Oral Sex A Sin - Questions to Consider\nConsider these questions when answering the question ""Is oral sex a sin?""\n\nIs oral sex voluntary and have both the husband and wife agreed to it?\n\n\nWhy do you want oral sex? Is it for pure sexual pleasure or is it to fulfill a sexual fantasy derived from porn?\n\n\nHave you or your spouse been convicted by the Holy Spirit that oral sex is wrong?\n\n\nDoes oral sex edify and fulfill both you and your spouse?\nWhile answering these questions, pray for guidance from God. He will reveal the answer to you - for your relationship."

Ok, so you have posted 5 anti-Christian messages so far. Dont you have anything better to do with your time than try and bash on other people's religions which is what you are accusing Christians of doing?

"It comes from a couple of verses in the Bible: ""How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north."" (Isaiah 14:12-13).\n\nLater tradition make Lucifer the nom de guerre of the Archangel Sammael. He was followed by a whole army of angels, in his pride feeling he was too beautiful, well-liked and smart to be second to God. Gabriel defeated him in the crucial battle, and exiled to Hell he changed his name one last time to Satan.\n\nBut it all comes from those verses in the OT that were actually condemning the arrogance of the Chaldean King in Babylon.\n\nPS: Lucifer, the ""light bearer,"" is the Hebrew version of what for the Greeks was Prometheus. Humans were like animals, with no intelligence to create moral values. According to most religions, what makes humans radically different from other creatures is their ability to say what is right and what is wrong.\n\nWithout intelligence, right and wrong cannot exist. So Lucifer, or Prometheus, are a symbol for intelligence. Lucifer rebels before God because he feels he is smarter and more beautiful than God, he puts himself above God, and seduces millions. In other words, it is human intelligence what allows us to disobey God, since we can convince ourselves that ""right ir wrong and wrong is right.""\n\nOf course Lucifer is right. A previous poster is correct: he is the one that, in the mythos, tells humanity to think by ourselves and stop following prescribed rules just because they are said to come from some higher power. \n\nAs George Bernard Shaw put it in his novel ""Back to Methusdelah,"" when the Devil, in the shape of a serpent, approaches Eve, he tells her:\n\n--You see things; and you say, ""Why?""\nBut I dream things that never were; and I say, ""Why not?\n\nLucifer, hence, stands for our own capacity to think. The reason why we have been conceptually expelled from Nature: we cannot be like the other animals, we never could."

"From a Hindu perspective : yes\n\nBrahman (God) manifested the entire universe from Itself and yet also Brahman pervades the universe. Thus the rock is Brahman and so all living beings in the universe. Thus, knowing that there are rocks so large the people cannot lift, Brahman has thus created Itself in the form of rocks that are so large that Itself in the form of people cannot lift.\n\nIf that makes sense.\n\nThe word Brahman is derived from two Sanskrit words Brih and Manah. Brih means ""great"" or ""expanding"" and Manah means ""consciousness"". Thus Brahman is ""Great Consciousness"" or ""Expanding Consciousness""...although is usually translated into English as ""Cosmic Consciousness"", ""Ultimate Reality"", ""Universal Soul""."

A few days back i was ask'd to help a cousins boy friend. The kid needed help putting a sound system in his car, so I said ok. To the conterary he had no clue what so ever about what I was trying to teach him, then later that night I was told this kid never had a father.............and my heart sank......so the following day I contacted him and had him get every thing we would need to get the ball rolling on this sound system, and to my amazment he got every thing I said we'd need. Later that night I spent some 5 hours showing him not only how this task was done and doing it too, but I even had the chance to teach him a few basic mechanics on his car, even greater, this was all taking place in my father in-laws garage then he came out when we ran into a slight problem during the wiring proccess and saved the day, This floored me so emotionaly, by the time I got home and had a chance to reflect I balled like a little baby for hours! It was that great to of tought some one some thing for free and to have my father in-law come out in the middle of it and just jump right in and lend a hand was such a break through for all of us........Tramendus is the only word I can use to discribe this whole ordeal...........And mam this only happend with in the last 24 hours. and ironically the last answer I gave before resopnding to your  was regarding some else needing help with there car audio system.
"It has always been customary to personify certain inanimate objects and attribute to them characteristics peculiar to living creatures. Thus, things without life are often spoken of as having a sex. Some objects are regarded as masculine -- the sun, winter, and death are often personified in this way. Others are regarded as feminine, especially those things that are dear to us. The earth, as ""Mother Earth,"" is regarded as the common maternal parent of all life. In languages that use gender for common nouns, boats, ships, and other vehicles almost invariably use a feminine form. Likewise, early seafarers spoke of their ships in the feminine gender for the close dependence they had on their ships for life and sustenance.\n\nAnother point of view: Early seafarers spoke of their ships in the feminine gender and in those ages, all seafarers were male. (In fact, having a female in the ship were considered as bad luck.) Since those men think that they own the ship, they may call their ships as they call all other females. In my opinion, this tradition of calling vehicles has passed from ships to cars."

It depends on which definition you employ: 1. worth or value is determined solely by utility; or, 2. that action is best which brings the greatest happiness to the greatest number.  #2 on the surface appears to be more humane than #1 although both are accepted definitions. Look beyond the surface and you have to question the value of happiness and utility.  People would be happier if gas prices were low, but the planet would suffer making the happiness of future generations more elusive.
The pain of the loss allows emotion to pivot like a balancing, we remember the departed for the good times shared and in this remembrance the joy of those moments are brought out. The lost for some however can be so overwhelming that they can't stop mourning at this point in their grief, which is quite understandable if you've ever experienced the loss of one held so dear. The fun in funeral is a coincidence(although in my culture they have what is called a wake where little sandwiches are served with tasty beverages), and mourning has nothing to do with morning; but the coincidence allows for the thought that for the bereaved a new day will come, with the dawn bringing light back into the darkness that fills their hearts, or at least that is my hope. Great question, thank you for asking it.

"It all dependes on the context. Let me explain. We have in English the verb 'to freeze' which in Spanish would be 'congelar'. You can in English use ""freezing"" es in the expresion, ""it's freezing"", meaning 'it's very cold'. In Spanish, you would say 'Nos estamos congelando' o 'Hace mucho frio'.  You can also say, ""Joe's freezing the porkchops to take to the picnick."" That in Spanish would be, 'Joe esta congelando las chuletas para llevar al picknick'. So one has to be very careful using words from a language to another without knowing the context of the situation. That's why is so dangerous to try to translate a document using just a dictionary: The most funny things can happen and they usually do."

Courage is the ability to confront fear, pain, danger, uncertainty or intimidation. As a virtue, courage is covered extensively in Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, its vice of deficiency being cowardice, and its vice of excess being recklessness.\n\nThe precise view of what constitutes courage not only varies among cultures, but among individuals. For instance, some define courage as lacking fear in a situation that would normally generate it. Others, in contrast, hold that courage requires one to have fear and then overcome it.\n\nThere are also more subtle distinctions in the definition of courage. For example, some distinguish between courage and foolhardiness in that a courageous person overcomes a justifiable fear for an even more noble purpose. If the fear is not justifiable or the purpose not noble, then the courage is either false, or foolhardy.
"Oricalc, or ""Orichalcum,"" is a legendary metal mentioned in several ancient writings, most notably the story of Atlantis as recounted in the Critias dialogue, recorded by Plato. According to Critias, orichalcum was considered second only to gold in value, and was found and mined in many parts of Atlantis in ancient times. By the time of Critias, however, it was known only by name.\n\nIt is not known for certain what orichalcum was. Orichalcum (or aurichalcum) is generally thought to literally mean ""gold copper"", but the term derives from the Greek word oreichalkos (from oros, mountain and chalkos, copper or bronze), so more accurately meaning ""mountain copper"" or ""mountain metal"". It is alternatively held to be a gold/copper alloy, a copper-tin or copper-zinc brass, or a metal no longer known to man.\n\nIn later years, ""orichalcum"" was used to describe chalcopyrite or brass. However, these are difficult to reconcile with the text of Critias, because he states that the metal was ""only a name"" by his time, while brass and chalkopyrite continued to be very important through the time of Plato until today. For that reason, other authors on the subject conclude that orichalcum is either the gold-copper alloy tumbaga, or a metal that is, in the words of Critias, ""known only by name today, but was once more than a name.""\n\nAn alternative way of understanding the word, ""oreichalkos"" (or orichalcum), would be to assume that it came from Greek word ""orao"" (meaning to see or look... to let oneself be seen, appear), ""chalkos"" (meaning copper... bronzé). Put together they could mean: ""seeing-copper"", ""looking-copper"", or ""transparent copper"". Transparent means ""through-appearing"" but it is not the transparent thing that ""appears"": the transparent thing allows another object to be seen through it. Oreichalkos—""seeing copper"" or ""looking copper""—could be used to fuse to other substances that allowed people to look into objects or through them. It is possible that if energy is passed through it; it could give the desired effect of flashing red.\n\nAccording to Critias, recorded by Plato, the three outer walls of the Temple to Poseidon and Cleito on Atlantis were clad respectively with brass, tin, and the third, which encompassed the whole citadel, ""flashed with the red light of orichalcum."" The interior walls, pillars and floors of the temple were completely covered in orichalcum, and the roof was variegated with gold, silver, and orichalcum. In the center of the temple stood a pillar of orichalcum, on which the laws of Poseidon and records of the first princes after Poseidon were inscribed. \n\nOrichalcum is also mentioned in the Antiquities of the Jews - Book XI by Josephus, who stated that the vessels in the Temple of Solomon were made of Orichalcum.\n\nThe Golden Plates of Mormonism, although not called orichalcum, were reported by Joseph Smith's brother William to be a mixture of copper and gold, and have ""the appearance of gold."" The Andean alloy tumbaga fits the same description, being a gold/copper alloy.\n\nIn numismatics, orichalcum is the golden-colored bronze alloy used for the sestertius and dupondius coins. It was considered more valuable than copper, of which the as coin was made.\n\nMany references originate in Japan but have been translated to English incorrectly. If a translator does not recognize that the reference is to a word in another language and directly romanizes the Japanese instead, errors are likely because of the difficulty of representing the word in Japanese in the first place and the multiple ways it could be romanized."

Cologne is a fine-smelling liquid that one applies to his body to make him smell better.  It is common in many European countries.  It originated during the black plague in Europe.  They would put cologne and perfume on a kerchief and when they passed a deceased person, they would smell the cologne to cover the other smells nearby.  Now, though, culture has transformed it into a symbol of status.  You smell like you are wearing expensive cologne and people treat you better.  It's all about status.

At the age of seventeen I was praying on my bed to God because my heart ached at all the pain and suffering in the world.  I had searched all sorts of places for God, and not found him (I was fairly ignorant of how far that trip can lead a person).  I went through a number of mental adaptations as I realized that I didn't need to pray out loud, then realized I didn't need to ask him, then realized I didn't need to address him mentally, etc.\n\nShort version of the rest: Five hours later, I became aware of having a body, an identity, and had the memory of having experienced everything, everywhere, simultaneously throughout time and beyond.\n\nI walked out and my mother asked where I had been.  I told her I was in my room.  For one of the only rare times in her life, she got angry, and she was angry because she said she had checked my room, and I wasn't there.  She told me to get ready for dinner, I was later (that's how I knew five hours had passed).\n\nI spent the next year in absolute bliss, free of anger, fear, frustration, worry.  My mental abilities were greatly increased, and much of what people call psychic abilities were common place for me.  I was utterly happy and loved everyone and everything (still do).  In time, I lost some of it, kept  a lot, and share it with those who really want to be happy.\n\nNo message, no mission, no crowning saying I'm special.  Just the opposite.  I can never kid myself into thinking I'm better than anyone, or they better than me.\n\nSometimes I wish there had been a message.  It would have made it all easier, or perhaps harder.  I don't know.\n\nFew believed me.  My parents did.  My psychologist did (I went to one to insure that I hadn't had a psychotic break.  He suggested that since the only apparent effects were positive ones, I really didn't need to come see him).  I also had a cat-scan (best to be cautious when you've experienced God first-hand!)\n\nMost people don't believe me.  Doesn't matter.  My wife and daughter benefit, as do I, as do others who simply have a saner, happier, more productive person in their lives.\n\nGood luck in your search.  There is so much wisdom out there, and so many of us want to encourage you, no  matter what spiritual path you take.

"Just because the Hindu religion has many dieties does not mean that a Hindu worships all of them. Some of them just focus only on one.\n\nWhen one focuses on too many dieties in their worship to aide their spiritual growth, that is spreading energies too thin and not creating much of a progress.\n\nAmma told a story of this devotee that when he went to go see a guru. This guru worshiped so many different dieties. This devotee started digging a hole when the guru worshiped a diety. Then when the guru would go to the next diety and pray to that one, and the devotee would stop digging the hole and move to dig another new hole. The devotee kept digging so many small holes for all of the different dieties. I don't have the exact wording of this story but the concept is that this devotee wasn't able to successfuly dig one deep hole.\n\nBy focusing on one diety, one can really seriously feel their energies more. Also just because one focuses on one diety does not mean they wouldn't partake in many of the cultural festivals that celebrate other dieties. That would be more of a holiday, cultural aspect rather than actually worshiping it on a daily basis.\n\nWhat Hindu is in ""general"" as a religion does not always mean that it is the same for a specific person."
"God is a socially accepted delusion. It's legalized insanity. People who believe in 'god' have nothing more than an imaginary friend. \n\nThere is no material evidence for a god, you are absolutely correct.\n\nIt's funny to watch the sheep try to defend their delusion, quite comical. I'm sure they're lining up to answer this one, lol.\n\nSome morons will say stuff like, ""The odds that life happened by chance are 1 in xx."" How funny... what are the odds that your god just existed by chance? Certainly your god is more amazing than all of life on Earth combined?\n\nThey have no answers, just their pathetic delusions."
No, our lives are eternal if we accept Salvation through Christ.
Knowledge and understanding.  How can you say something is false or claim not not believe if you don't know the contents of said things?  A broad knowledge base, even if some of the topics you don't believe in, is never bad.  If you don't read about it you might not understand something going on.  Let's take Scientology and Tom Cruise for example; if you just listen to what Mr. Cruise spouts it sounds great and viable but it isn't until you actually READ about it that you understand the fallibility of the statements he spouts.  Without that knowledge it is easy to get sucked into things that are wrong and harmful.  The more we learn about what others believe the better our society will be.
I think this varies greatly depending on where one lives. In some places a three bedroom house can be purchased for USD165,000 and in other parts of the country the same house may cost USD400,000. In some areas it may be necessary to own a car and in others public transit may be cheap and plentiful. And there are lots of other factors.

it looks like a down slope\nThere have been times when powers have fallen and the people in society suffered for as long as 100 years or more, we are facing a heavy time but I hope this time we can get through it with our heads on our shoulders. instead of trying to find someone to stick the blame on for problems (although it seems bush had a lot to do with the problems today) we should try fixing them first.\n\nwe need to concentrate on rebuilding and working together, if we try to do things by ourselves, we will end up with a society without order or right and wrong, we will basically fall extinct.\n\nI'm not sure if this is philosophical of not but it's a good idea.

"Yes, blind people do dream. What they see in their dreams depends on how much they could ever see. If someone has been totally blind since birth, they only have auditory dreams. If someone  has had a measure of sight, then that person dreams with that measure of sight. Those individuials who have had some sight before they went blind can dream as though they can see, colors included. \n\nIN all fairness, one should first look at what a dream is.. really.. this must be understood before the question could be fully answered. The word ""dream"" has four interrelated meanings that follow one from another. When we put them altogether, we know what a dream is. \n\nFirst, a ""dream"" is a form of thinking that occurs when (a) there is a certain, as yet undetermined, minimal level of brain activation, and (b) external stimuli are blocked from entry into the mind, and (c) the system we call the ""self system"" (the ""I,"" the ""me"") is shut down.\n\nSecond, a ""dream"" is something we ""experience"" because the thinking is very real and makes use of our senses -- especially seeing and hearing; because usually we are the main actor; and because a dream is sometimes very emotional (but not always). \n\nThird, a ""dream"" is what we remember in the morning, so it is ""a memory"" of the dreaming experience. \n\nFourth, a ""dream"" can also mean the spoken or written ""report"" we give to others about that experience, which is the only way anyone else can ever know about another person's dreams (because they can't be seen by others or told about by us while they are happening). \n\nSO....in summation (keeping in mind what dreams are),\n\nThere are no visual images in the dreams of those born without any ability to experience visual imagery in waking life. \n\nIndividuals who become blind before the age of five seldom experience visual imagery in their dreams, there has been  reports some visual imagery in six schoolchildren who lost their sight before age five. \n\nThose who become sightless between the ages of five and seven may or may not retain some visual imagery. \n\nMost people who lost their vision after age seven continue to experience at least some visual imagery, although its frequency and clarity often fade with time."

Kamehameha, also known as Kamehameha I and Kamehameha the Great (circa 1758-1819), unified the Hawaiian Islands in battle and formally established the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi in 1810. A skilled diplomat, Kamehameha developed friendships with the major colonial powers in the Pacific resulting in the preservation of independence, as well as a guarantee of peace and prosperity of the kingdom, for future generations of native Hawaiians. Kamehameha is most noted for his vehement defense of traditional Hawaiian values and the kapu system of law and religion. He is also remembered for mamalahoe or the Law of the Splintered Paddle, used today throughout the world protecting the human rights of non-combatants in times of battle.
"We can only be rid of religions when:\n- Critical thinking skills are taught in schools and applied to religious arguments.\n- Parents are convinced that loading unsubstantiated nonsense into a child's mind is mental abuse.\n- Religions are taxed like nay other for-profit biz. This will chnage the mindset that they are ""something special"".\n\nEven then, it could be around for a long time."
I think no one should be able to live in this country (or any country) illegaly.  Why should we pay taxes and then they don't have to.  \n\nThe government needs to step up there game, either that or let them stay here and give them a few years sentence to work for free.
Selfishness. Everyone seems to want things fixed or changed but expects others to do it for them, or wonders why there is even a problem to begin with, not thinking or realizing they are part of the problem. It takes effort, caring, time, and selfless acts to change things. Just think what it took to change the British taxes ( the Boston Tea Party) Now that took a lot of self-deprivation and effort by a lot of people. I don't see that same thing in people today.\nIt would take another revolution to change things.

Many in the medical profession say so, and that's why they say some people experience psychosomatic illness.....you think you're ill so you become that way.

"In the first half of the last century, America was on the rise in the world, and there seemed to be an exuberance in the language, which is sort of silly in retrospect. From earlier slang like ""absquatulate"", they moved on to stuff like ""twenty-three skidoo"" and finally to the song ""Mairzy Doats"". So, after finding the following on the web, I vote for ""it just sounded nutty in an American way"" so people liked it:\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary records the expression  bee's knee as meaning the type of something small or insignificant from 1797. The plural form is US slang dating from the 1920s, when there was an explosion of terms meaning 'the acme of excellence': compare the cat's whiskers/pyjamas. The first example is dated 1923. Some of these have lasted, and some have not (the flea's eyebrows, the canary's tusks).\n\nOR \n\nA bee's ""corbiculae"", or pollen-baskets, are located on its\ntibiae (midsegments of its legs).  The phrase ""the bee's knees"", meaning ""the height of excellence"", became popular in the U.S. in the 1920s, along with ""the cat's whiskers"" (possibly from the use of these in radio crystal sets), ""the cat's pajamas"" (pyjamas were still new enough to be daring), and similar phrases which made less sense and didn't endure:  ""the eel's ankle"", ""the elephant's instep"", ""the snake's hip"".  Stories in circulation about the phrase's origin include:  ""b's and e's"", short for ""be-alls and end-alls""; and a corruption of ""business""."
"HE actually spoke to me twice.  \n\nThe first time:\n\nMy friend Jen and I are talking about God and I'm like, ""Yeah, I pray, but I never get the impression that God is listening or anything.  It just doesn't seem real to me.""  So Jen tells me I just need to ask Him to reveal Himself to me and He surely will.  I'm like, yeah, right, whatever.  That night I remembered to pray that, you know, that He would reveal Himself to me.  That night as I'm sleeping, I have a dream of the most powerful, the most graceful yet commanding voice, saying, ""I AM LISTENING!""\n\nThe second time:\n\nI'm driving with my friend Doug cross-country--we're going to rescue his ex-girlfriend from Champagne, IL. I puked Big Macs all over the back of the van.  We had a nasty time cleaning it all up and afterward I am completely exhausted riding in the passenger seat, just completely limp like a fish.  We are then driving down the road when lights flash behind us, sure enough, the state patrol.  My friend gets completely paranoid for some reason, and that's when I hear a whispering voice telling me, ""It's just going to be a warning.""  I say to my friend out loud (not bothering to explain what's happening) ""It's just going to be a warning"".  They end up making fun of me and he gets off with a warning.\n\nI am not sure of the trip your pastor is laying on you.  It doesn't matter if you're a ""good"" person... that's what grace is all about.  It's just that Jesus said specifically, do not be called 'father', for you have One Father, and He is in heaven.  Why don't you ask Him yourself?"
"Let me tell you of a personal experience.  I am not stereotyping any state neither am I meaning to disrespect anybody.  Just wanted to get that out of the way before I begin.\nI and my husband have traveled the US quite a bit.  When we were in the city of San Angelo, Texas in July 2005 we went camping to a popular camping site.  One day, while strolling past all the recreational vehicles, with noisy people partying everywhere one looks, we saw a unique motorcycle and could not help but inspect closer to admire it.  A couple of minutes later, we hear a young man's voice behind us saying something, we could hear he had a strong local dialect. \n-""The ole' man o'er there, dat's his.  He's ole', but he can shoot real well.""\nOne can derive one thing from that statement, he thought we may have wanted to steal or vandalize the motorcycle in some way.  We said we were only admiring it.  Then a conversation began about who's from where and what we are doing here.  Well, my turn came to explain my origins.  Since I am a Ukrainian who has married an American, I told him I was from Ukraine.  He was quiet for a few seconds then replied with a drawl, ""So, is that outside of Texas?""  \nI looked at him, then at my husband, and that was when we both decide to say ""goodbye"" to our ""unique"" Texan friend.  Never have we had such an experience...only in Texas."
"Clearly it's a compliment. If a man says someone is ""built"" it means she's really hot. Obviously, being the Goddess that you are, what he meant to say was that even your fingers are beautiful. Yeah, that must be it..."
"The Gospel of Judas is all over the news. It has been hugely promoted by \nthe National Geographic Society, which funded its reconstruction and \ntranslation, and has been trumpeted by practically every major news \npublication in the world. USA Today's front-page headline is typical: \n""Long-lost gospel of Judas casts 'traitor' in new light.""\n\nUntil recently this gnostic gospel was thought to have been lost and was \nknown only through Irenaeus' late second century condemnation thereof in \nhis Refutation of All Heresies, but a copy from the third or fourth \ncentury that was found in Egypt a few decades ago was purchased and \nrestored. The translation of the fragmentary writing was published on \nApril 6.\n\nThe Gospel of Judas presents Judas in a positive light as the only \ndisciple who truly understood Jesus and who betrayed Him only because he \nwas asked to do so.\n\nAccording to Irenaeus, it was produced by the Egyptian Cainite Gnostics \nwho claimed that Cain, Esau, the Sodomites, Korah, Judas, and other \nvillains of biblical history were actually enlightened heroes who \nvaliantly kept the gnosis or knowledge of the truth alive. According to \nthis cult, a god named Hystera created the world and another deity \ncalled ""Sophia"" allegedly assisted the aforementioned people (Refutation \nof All Heresies, book I, chapter 31, \nhttp://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix...\n\nThe Gospel of Judas begins with the words, ""The secret account of the \nrevelation that Jesus spoke in conversation with Judas Iscariot."" Jesus \nallegedly tells Judas that the world was created in a manner different \nthan the account in Genesis and that ""an evil god named Nebro rules the \nlower world of humans."" Judas is the ""thirteenth spirit"" who was \nappointed to release Jesus from the physical body in which he was \ntrapped. The Jesus of the Gospel of Judas laughs a lot, even laughing at \nthe way the disciples pray and praise God. In this strange writing it is \nJudas rather than Jesus who is glorified by entering a ""luminous cloud.""\n\nThe Gnostic Jesus described in the Gospel of Judas is not Almighty God \nor the Creator of the world, does not die for man's sin, and does not \nrise bodily from the dead. It is no gospel at all.\n\nEgypt was a hotbed of heresy and fanaticism in the early centuries after \nChrist. Many other strange ""gospels"" originated there, including the \nGospel of Thomas that purports to give details of Christ's childhood \n(such as giving life to a dried fish and causing the death of one of his \nplaymates).\n\nEgypt also gave us the Sinaiticus and Vaticanus codexes and the handful \nof similar New Testament manuscripts that contain an Alexandrian type of \ntext preferred by modern textual critics and the translators of the \nmodern Bible versions.\n\n""For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old \nordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God \ninto lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus \nChrist"" (Jude 4).\n\n""But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there \nshall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable \nheresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon \nthemselves swift destruction. And many shall follow their pernicious \nways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of"" (2 \nPet. 2:1-2). \n\nTo know more, click here...\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/bibletruths_forbelievers/"

The second chakra is the sacral chakra. When in proper condition it should be seen as red. As an energy center within the body it will be effected by things that effect the body. Whatever is good for that portion of the body will be of help. Being an energy center on more than one level, which means mental and spiritual as well, anything that will promote well being in these areas will also help. More specifically, things you might try ... A warm bath with rose petals, meditation with visualization of the chakra changing naturally to red (start with what ever colour comes to mind when you do this and visualize it becoming red), and couple deep breathing with this last one.
Let's see...  I honestly have never heard that.  But I doubt that it is true, because I only use my tarot deck when the need arises, which can be as long as 6-7 months in between.  And all three of my dogs and my cat are in good health.  So honestly, I think it was just coincidence.  I'm sorry your pets died.  If you feel your tarot deck is causing these problems, I suggest either cleansing it, or getting a new one, an animal based tarot might be just the thing you need and might break your bad luck streak.

"I once worked at a Catholic seminary and the students would spend 4 years there before they were assigned. One day one of the graduates returned for a visit and told me this story.\n\nHe had been assigned to a small, somewhat remote church and served under an elderly Priest named Father John. Father John always performed the Sunday servcies, except during his rare absence, where on such occations the seminarian would be required to perform the services. It wasn't long before one such day came where the Church requested Father John's presence at a gathering. The seminarian became nervous, having never been in front of the congregation by himself. Father John assured him that all would be fine and to simply rely upon his teachings. Even so the seminarian remained uneasy as the date was soon approaching. \n\nThe seminarian had chosen a teaching and had prepared for his big moment. Wanting to review this with Father John, again the Priest simply reassured him that all would be fine, except to be warey of ""Mother Green"". Father John explained how Mother Green was an outspoken and confrontational nun who had apparently given Father John some difficulties over the past. The seminarian became more nervous than ever. ""Who was this Mother Green and what problems could she possibly present?"" \n\nIn the end, Father John came down with a cold and decided not to travel to the meeting. However, feeling ill, he kept the seminarian on the task. The seminarian could not shake his anxious worry, desparately hoping to do a good job and for all to go smoothly, while this warning of Mother Green loomed in the back of his mind. \n\nSunday finally arrived. As the seminarian stood above, the congregation entered the church and found their seats. Father John sat quietly behind the seminarian in the shadows reading and studing an old book. The seminarian watched each person as they entered the church, wondering if suddenly he might recognize someone who matched his mental image of the mean Mother Green. \n\nJust before 10:00 AM, at the last moment a tall, young, veluptous black woman entered the church. She wore a scandalous low cut top that exposed more than ample cleavage and a short, short mini skirt. She walked down the center isle and sat in the front row, directly in front of the seminarian and spread her legs. The seminarian was freaking out. This woman was wearing no panties. Suddenly it hit him! Could it be??? The seminarian leaned back, turned his head toward Father John and whispered; ""Is that Mother Green? \n\nThe Priest replied; ""No, I think it's just the way the light's hitting it.""\n\nTrue story...swear to God!"
Post office?
Since I've been one for 20 years, I'm not surprised the perceptions are full of distortions, fear, and misunderstanding.\n\nThe way I explain it is that it's a denomination/faith community based on radical individualism.  In the Unitarian Universalist tradition, finding faith, truth, and meaning is the responsibility of each individual, and requires individual soul-searching and not just accepting whatever pre-packaged doctrine is appealing or convenient.  A corollary to this approach to religion is humility and tolerance, accepting that God works in different ways in different people, and that some people don't feel God at all but still seek meaning in their lives.\n\nRadical individualism in the arts, economics, and politics is second nature to Americans, but applied to religion it makes a lot of people feel uncomfortable and threatened.  It's such a different approach from getting religion handed down from a priest that some people will never understand it.\n\nAs the world coalesces into nuclear-armed camps of radical fundamentalist Muslims and Christians who despise and ridicule each other, the tiny voice of reason and tolerance from Unitarian Universalism is one slender hope of saving us from the Apocalypse millions of Christians are eager to see.

according to the Jews the Prophet Elijah never died and instead went up to heaven alive. Also they state that The last Prophet was Malachi and the next Prophet will be the Messiah. That is why you will find Jews rejecting this whole concept.
Church or AKA religion was developed to deal with death and depression and birth and marriage etc. Humans will always demand a cultural response to these things. Doctors and professors can't replace churches but can work along side of them in all cultures.
I'd say most of the people there--75%. I think a majority of people go to church because they think they should. But how many people go to church to get something out of it? I think the people who go just to go because that is what they are told to are the same as the people who only go during holidays. You go to church to grow and learn. Not just to say you do--God doesn't keep a tall of how many days you go. I think what you get out of church is more important than the amount of times you go.
I have heard of Christian Meditation. Basically you just find a nice peaceful spot and pray.  You let the world disappear around you and you focus on God.\nIt would help to have nice soothing christian music playing in the background.
More truth than Christianity is willing to admit to.

So, he wept.  Was it the humanity in him that longed to know his friend was still there on earth with him?  Was it his unknowable love for all mankind and his abhorrence for sin and it's consequences that made him morn over the death.  Indeed he knew what he would do.  Or perhaps he hadn't received instruction from God to go raise him yet, so he stayed put until that time.  Did he have things that had to be done where he was at, knowing that a resurrection could take place at anytime if he so desired, and thus it could wait, yet still had to express the very real emotion of pain, sorrow, and sadness that sin has wrought upon all the world and the very essence of life itself?\n\nthings to consider, and answers in themselves.\n\nLike all the mysterious things Jesus did (and does) it is for the glory of God. Why was the blind man blind? Because his parents sined? No, but instead so the power of God can come through and be glorified.  Likewise, his waiting period before rushing to Lazarus' grave was for the glory of god, and that all there might know that he is the Son of God.  This seems to me the most logical and likely.  Remembering Gods ways are not our own.

I think there is duality in everthing.  The perfect balance of duality is the perfect balance of light and dark among other things.  That's why Heaven can be considered perfect.  It's in perfect balance.....it's not lacking evil...it was always there, just in balance.

Because people are close-minded and can't believe that some people are born loving people of the same sex, just like themselves are born loving people of the opposite sex.  It is shown throughout the animal kingdom that homosexuality is not just a human thing, but something that many animals partake in.\nI don't see why it matters to so many people anyway.  I mean, why do they care if loving someone of the same sex makes someone else happy.  Worry about your own happiness.\nTo each his/her own.\n:)

I will pray for your dad. Is your dad a Christian? I hope he is aware of the wonderful gift that Jesus Christ gave us all when he died on the cross for us. If he is aware, then he knows that in heaven, they'll be no more pain. I'm sure that gives you some comfort also. \nDear Lord, Please be with your child Don as he goes through this terrible ordeal. Be with his family, and keep them strong and give them the loving comfort that only you can give. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.      Best Wishes

It's not that Americans are arrogant, it's the other cultures that prop up the American culture and make them seem to be better.  Americans are just Americans just like Germans are Germans.  One can't help but be a product of their culture.  There are many Americans that look to other cultures and admire them for what they are and where they have been.
I don't know but the question sounds really gay.
Its okay. They Yahoo Answers originate in America.\n\nThe censor board (oops) came into existance in America.  \nThe code developers made customizations that are more tailored to America. \n\nSo it is quite natural that the questions originate and are specific to America.\n\nWhen Y!A team developes Answers customised to your country, Than you could also fire questions that pertain to local information. Time shall tell that.\n\nDont make it tough for Americans to put every question into global prespective.\n\nSo is the case with windows / office and other softwares\n\nThey make more sense when used in America as they are developed by for american clients clients who give SRS for such things.\n\nThe MSN virtual earth is another example (where Earth = USA, cause you cannot find directions with that for any other country) Yet it is called VE , and is accessible all over world\n\nI dont mean to take side of you or America, Just stating facts.

"Another Jewish source, the Talmud, makes several historical references to Jesus. According to the American Heritage Dictionary, the Talmud is ""the collection of ancient Rabbinic writings consisting of the Mishnah and the Gemara, constituting the basis of religious authority for traditional Judaism."" Although not explicitly referred to by name, later rabbis identify the person as Jesus. These references to Jesus are neither sympathetic to Him or His Church. Also these writings were preserved through the centuries by Jews, so Christians cannot be accused of tampering with the text.\n\nThe Talmud makes note of Jesus' miracles. No attempt is made to deny them, but it ascribes them to magical arts from Egypt. Also His crucifixion is dated as ""on the eve of the Feast of the Passover"" in agreement with the Gospel (Luke 22:1ff; John 19:31ff). Similar again to the Gospel (Matt. 27:51), the Talmud records the earthquake and the tearing in two of the Temple curtain during the time of Jesus' death. Josephus in his book, The Jewish War, also confirmed these events.\n\nBy the beginning of the 2nd century, Romans were writing about Christians and Jesus. Pliny the Younger, proconsul in Asia Minor, in 111 A.D. wrote to Emperor Trajan in a letter:\n\n...it was their habit on a fixed day to assemble before daylight and recite by turns a form of words to Christ as a god; and that they bound themselves with an oath, not for any crime, but not to commit theft or robbery, or adultery, not to break their word, and not to deny a deposit when demanded. After this was done, their custom was to depart, and meet again to take food... [Pliny, Epistle 97]\n\nSpecial attention should be made to the phrase, ""to Christ as a god,"" an early secular witness to the belief in Christ's divinity (John 20:28; Phil. 2:6). Also it is interesting to compare this passage with Acts 20:7-11, a biblical account of an early Christian Sunday celebration.\n\nNext the Roman historian, Tacitus, who is respected by modern scholars for historical accuracy, wrote in 115 A.D. about Christ and His Church:\n\nThe author of the denomination was Christ[us] who had been executed in Tiberius time by the Procurator Pontius Pilate. The pestilent superstition, checked for a while, burst out again, not only throughout Judea...but throughout the city of Rome also... [Tacitus, Annals, XV 44]\n\nEven with disdain for the Christian faith, Tacitus still treated the execution of Christ as historical fact, drawing connections to Roman events and leaders. (cf. Luke 3:1ff)\n\nOther secular witnesses to the historical Jesus include Suetonius in his biography of Claudius, Phlegan recording the eclipse of the sun during Jesus' death and even Celsus, a pagan philosopher. It must be kept in mind that most of these sources were not only secular but anti-Christian. These secular authors, including the Jewish writers, had no desire or intention to promote Christianity. They had no motivation to distort their reports in favor of Christianity. Pliny actually punished Christians for their faith. If Jesus were a myth or His execution a hoax, Tacitus would have reported it as such. He certainly would not have connected Jesus' execution to Roman leaders. These writers presented Jesus as a real historical person. Denying the reliability of these sources in connection to Jesus would cast serious suspicion on the rest of ancient history.\n\nNow these ancient secular writings do not prove that Jesus is the Son of God or even the Christ, but that is not the goal of this tract. These reports show that a virtuous person named Jesus did live in the early first century A.D. and authored a religious movement (which still exists today). This Person was at least called Christ - the Messiah. Christians in the first century also appeared to consider Him God. Finally these writings support other facts found in the Bible surrounding His life. The claim that Jesus never existed and H"

"When was 911 ""invented?"" The simple answer is: over 35 years ago. However, the development of the three-digit number in the United States is slightly more complex than a single date. Here is a summary of how it was implemented for the first time in the United States, and events leading up to that historic event.\n\nBy the way, this collection of material was prompted by Reba Fitzgerald, who contacted me after the death of her husband in June 2001: it was Robert Fitzgerald and his colleagues who implemented the first 911 system in Haleyville (Ala.) in 1968. Ms. Fitzgerald spent the last year of her life working to set the record straight, and then no doubt satisfied she had accomplished some measure of success, died in August 2002.\n\nThere is no debate on where the first 911 call was placed. However, there is considerable unverifiable information about who was involved and how 911 was developed. We have investigated the genesis of the first 911 system, and present here the first accurate, documented history of 911, including key dates, whether we've confirmed the event with documentation from the time (not from later recollections), and the details of the event. E-mail us if you have confirming documentation for events without a check mark, or if you have corrections/updates--check below for the missing information we need verified. We hope this account will finally give credit to those whose imagination and spirit helped create the invaluable resource of 911.\n\n\n \nFriday,\nMarch 10, 1876\n\nOK, this may be pushing history a bit too far, but.....Alexander Graham Bell made the first telephone call for help during testing of his gear. Bell reportedly dropped some battery acid on his clothes and said those famous words, ""Mr. Watson, come here. I want you!"" His assistant, Thomas A. Watson, heard the words over the set-up they were testing and came to his aid. \n\nThursday,\nJuly 8, 1937\n \n Britain implements its 999 emergency telephone system serving police, fire and EMS after phone calls were delayed reporting 5-fatality fire on Wimpole Street. The first 999 call was placed at 4:20 a.m. when the wife of John Stanley Beard (33 Elsworthy Rd., Hampstead, London) dialed 999 to report a burglar outside her home. The burglary, 24 yeard-old Thomas Duffys, was apprehended. \n\n1957\n\n   The National Association of Fire Chiefs reportedly suggests a single number for reporting fires.\n \nSept. 1958\n\n   New Zealand debuts their 111 emergency number. \nJune 21, 1959   According to the Winnipeg (Man.) Police Department Web site, North America's first 999 system was introduced in that city, and the operation's first supervisor was Helen Aizita Woollard. There were initially eight Emergency Telephone Operators, of which Lucienne Galinas was one of the original hires. Canada converted its three-digit emergency number to 911 in 1972. Check this CBC video about the center. \n\n1961   \n\nAustralia introduces its 000 emergency number in metropolitan areas of the country. \n\nFebruary., 1967\n \n President Lyndon Johnson's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice issues its report, recommending that police departments have a single number to call, and that eventually that single number should be used nationwide. (see Alan Burton's account.). The report stated, ""The Commission recommends: Wherever practical, a single police telephone number should be established, at least within a metropolitan area and eventually over the entire United States, comparable to the telephone company's long-distance information number."" The recommendation was based on input from the Commission's Task Force on Science and Technology [see June 3, 1967 entry] \n\nMay 23, 1967   \n\nIndiana Rep.

About 10% of people all over the world are left-handed (Mcmanus, 2002). However, if you are wondering risks/odds, one area may be in familial sinistrality (how many family members you ahve that are left-handed).\n\nHandedness runs in families, and  even having a grandparent (who it can be argued will have be of little imitative effect) who is left-handed increases a person’s chance of being left-handed. The effects of parental sinistrality are seen below \n\n Effects of parental sinistrality (McManus, 2002)\n\nParents’ handedness (respectively)/ Percentage of left-handed children\n\nRight & Right   9.5%\nRight & Left    19.5%\nLeft & Left     26.1%\n\n\nIt is evident that children born to at least one left-handed parent are more likely than the rest of the population to be left handed.\n\nI hope that helps! all the best!

Why Do Hindus Worship Many Gods?\n\nHuman beings through history have formulated many different names and forms for the Divine or Eternal. Just as we have many names and forms for other things, whether it is foods, or types of art, so too, in religion a similar great diversity has been created.\n\nThe Western world has prided itself in monotheism, the idea that there is only One God as the highest truth. Western religions have said that only the names and forms which refer to this One God are valid but those which appear to worship another God, or a multiplicity of divinities, must be false. They have restricted the names and forms they use in religious worship, and insist that only one set is true and correct and others are wrong or unholy. \n\nAs a universal formulation Hinduism accepts all formulations of Truth. According to the universal view there is only One Reality, but it cannot be limited to a particular name or form. Though Truth is One it is also Universal, not an exclusive formulation. It is an inclusive, not an exclusive Oneness - a spiritual reality of Being - Consciousness - Bliss, which could be called God but which transcends all names. The different Gods and Goddesses of Hinduism represent various functions of this One Supreme Divinity, and are not separate Gods. \n(Having many names for something is not necessarily a sign of ignorance of its real nature. On the contrary, it may indicate an intimate knowledge of it. For example, Eskimos have forty-eight different names for snow in their language because they know snow intimately in its different variations, not because they are ignorant of the fact that all snow is only one. The many different deities of Hinduism reflect such an intimate realization of the Divine on various levels.)

good question.\nOne our opinions don't mean jack as far as determining God's opinion.\n\nHomosexuality is breaking the laws of God, the punishment is hell.\nThis is your decision though. God doesn't want anyone to go to hell just like no decent judge wants anyone in prison, but He can't just go bending the rules or there would be chaos.\nI havesometimes lusted but that is a sin too so what can I do?\nwell God provided a way out. He gave His Son Jesus to take the punishment for our sins so that we could not go to hell and so that we can begin to achieve perfection.\n\nAccept that you have broken God's law who made you, repent and he will forgive you and change your heart to be like Jesus. God loves you but if you refuse His payment for your sin then you will have to pay for it.

The Catholic bible has a book in it called the book of Tobit.  It is about a man who goes blind and has his son work for him.  During his travels, the son meets a woman and marries her.  Throughout the story the angel Raphael helps the man and his son.  Once all is fixed the angel says his goodbyes and goes back to heaven.  The painting shows Raphael saying goodbye and going back to heaven.  There is a pretty good description of everything at the link below.
It depends on the child, and your exact situation; but a safe bet would be a young teenager, 13-16. An extremely responsible child in a neighborhood with very little crime, I might say as young as 10. Then again, I know some kids who aren't responsible enough to be alone before they turn 14; and some neighborhoods I've lived in where I wouldn't let the best kid stay even then. My best advice is if you trust them to fix a healthy meal for themselves (especially since they'll be alone until between 6 & 9 PM) then you can probably trust them to be alone.
I think this came up between Pepsi and Coke a while back -- where someone in one of the uniforms was drinking the soda of the other producer.  I can't remember now the outcome of it.\n\nHonestly, I think it's ridiculous.  I personally am not going to think poorly of a company whose employee I see being a consumer of a competing product.  When I worked as a professional cake decorator, I HATED smelling all the cookies and such that I worked around all day.  But I didn't have a problem grabbing a bag of oreos on my way out the store.  I can't imagine the things that a person sees in their own restaurant . . . even smelling it all day would be enough to cause me to want a change.  Even the Pepsi/Coke thing . . . that's almost a religious experience in the US.  No one could convert me to Pepsi.  Does that mean I'm going to stop drinking Coke when Pepsi offered me a killer employment deal?  Not on your life.\n\nOn the flip side, while it's a little far-fetched to think that one employee is going to change a consumer's mind, I think it's fair to ask employees to have a little respect for their employer by not participating in a competitor's business while in uniform.  It comes down to the appearance thing.\n\nThough I have to admit that when it comes to cars, that's a little different.  I have often asked my car salesman what he drives and if he doesn't drive something he's selling, I ask why.  Sales as a whole though, is a little different than your run-of-the-mill employees.  If you don't believe in the product and use it - why should I?

"Hi.\n\nI don't really have a problem with agnostics, but, then again, it all comes down to your definition of the word. If ""agnostic"" means someone who is skeptical about god, but not quite able to say ""There is no god!"" I'm fine with that. I'm very much up in the air about a lot of issues and even have opposing viewpoints about some things. It's fine to not be able to come to a hard opinion about certain things.\n\nThe issue that I do have is when agnosticism means: ""The existence of god is unknowable."" I just can't buy that explanation. From where I sit, everything is knowable. We may not have the tools to find the answer, or even the mental software to grasp the answer, but this doesn't mean that it is ""unknowable.""\n\nNow, I don't think I have a better term than ""agnostic,"" but I do know that there has been some backlash lately (not here) from certain people who feel that people like me (hard-atheist/skeptics) have co-opted the term ""skeptic"" and taken away its ""actual"" meaning (which closely means ""examiner,"" as opposed to ""loud-mouthed nay-sayer."") These people are trying to reestablish a more traditional school of skepticism under the name zetecism (closely meaning ""seekers.)\n\nSo, I don't know. Do some research and you might find that you're actually a Zetetic. I realize that it can be a difficult thing for a young woman to learn that she is actually a member of an ancient Greek school of thinking that the majority of people on Earth have never heard of, but it is a rite of passage that we must all go through. :)"
Here are all the verses of the Qur'an that talk about Jesus (sorry i don't have the verse numbers, but if you really want them, contact me). For more info, arguments, and description of Islam's teachings about Jesus, you can go to my msn space at:\nhttp://spaces.msn.com/jesuspbuh/\n\n“The disbelievers say, ‘The Lord of Mercy has offspring.’ How terrible is this thing you assert: it almost causes the heavens to be torn apart, the earth to split asunder, the mountains to crumble to pieces, that they attribute offspring to the Lord of Mercy.” “It does not befit the Lord of Mercy [to have offspring].” “May He be exalted! No! Everything in the heavens and earth belongs to Him, everything devoutly obeys His will. He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth, and when He decrees something, He says only, ‘Be’, and it is.” “There is no one in the heavens or earth who will not come to the Lord of Mercy as a servant – He has counted them all: He has numbered them exactly – and they will each return to Him on the Day of Resurrection all alone.” \n\n“The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was nothing more than a messenger of God, His word, conveyed to Mary, a spirit from Him. So believe in God and His messengers and do not speak of a Trinity – stop [this], that is better for you – God is only one God, He is far above having a son, everything in the heavens and earth belongs to Him and He is sufficient protector. The Messiah would never disdain to be a servant of God, nor would the angels who are close to Him. He will gather before Him all those who disdain His worship and are arrogant: to those who believe and do good works He will give due rewards and more of His bounty; to those who are disdainful and arrogant He will give an agonizing torment, and they will find no one besides God to protect or help them.”\n\n“Those who say, ‘God is the Messiah, the son of Mary,’ are defying the truth. Say, ‘If it had been God’s will, could anyone have prevented Him from destroying the Messiah, son of Mary, together with his mother and everyone else on earth? Control of the heavens and earth and all that is between them belongs to God: He creates whatever He will and has power over everything.’ Those who say, ‘God is the Messiah, son of Mary,’ although the Messiah himself said, ‘Children of Israel, worship God, my Lord and your Lord,’ have defied [what he said]: if anyone associates others with God, God will forbid him from the Garden, and Hell will be his home. No one will help such evildoers.”\n\n“The Jews said, ‘Ezra is the son of God,’  and the Christians said, ‘The Messiah is the son of God’: they said this with their own mouths, repeating what earlier disbelievers had said. May God confound them! How far astray they have been led! They take their rabbis, their monks, and Christ, the son of Mary, as lords beside God. But they were commanded to serve only one God: there is no god but Him; He is far above whatever they set up as His partners!” “In God’s eyes, Jesus is just like Adam: He created him from dust, said to him, ‘Be’, and he was. This is the truth from your Lord: do not be one of those who doubt.”\n\n“They disbelieved and uttered a terrible slander against Mary, and said, ‘We have killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of God.’ They did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, though it was made to appear like that to them. Those that disagreed about him are full of doubt, with no knowledge to follow, only supposition: they certainly did not kill him, God raised him up to Himself. God said, ‘Jesus, I will take you back and raise you up to Me: I will purify you of the disbelievers. To the Day of Resurrection I will make those who follow you superior to the disbelievers. Then you will all return to Me and I will judge between you regarding your differences. I will make the disbelievers suffer severely in this world and the next; no 
"1-Denial-""this can't be happening to me"", looking for the former spouse in familia places, or if it is death, setting the table for the person or acting as if they are still in living there. No crying. Not accepting or even acknowledging the loss.\n\n2-Anger-""why me?"", feelings of wanting to fight back or get even with spouse of divorce, for death, anger at the deceased, blaming them for leaving.\n\n3-Bargaining-bargaining often takes place before the loss. Attempting to make deals with the spouse who is leaving, or attempting to make deals with God to stop or change the loss. Begging, wishing, praying for them to come back.\n\n4-Depression-overwhelming feelings of hopelessness, frustration, bitterness, self pity, mourning loss of person as well as the hopes, dreams and plans for the future. Feeling lack of control, feeling numb. Perhaps feeling suicidal.\n\n5-Acceptance-there is a difference between resignation and acceptance. You have to accept the loss, not just try to bear it quietly. Realization that it takes two to make or break a marriage. Realization that the person is gone (in death) that it is not their fault, they didn't leave you on purpose. (even in cases of suicide, often the deceased person, was not in their right frame of mind) Finding the good that can come out of the pain of loss, finding comfort and healing. Our goals turn toward personal growth. Stay with fond memories of person."
Haven't given money to any religion.\n\nIn fact I steal from collection plates so in reality they give me money.\n\nIt helps them as they believe tis better to give than to receive.
SURE!  Jesus will catch me!..WHEEEE!!!(leap)...uh Jesus?...Hey Jesus?....OH JESUS!!!!..(splat)
I say go for it. If you don't rescue those things, they'll just be sitting in a dump somewhere taking up space and not decomposing. \n\nYou might as well take them, restore them (ie - give them one heck of a cleaning), and find them a good home. If you make a little money off of the deal, then more power to you.\n\nIf this is a hobby you'd like to start up, I recommend getting a truck and cruising the nicer apartment complexes in your area. People move in and out all the time and are constantly throwing out perfectly good things that they just don't want to move.
You need to have a quiet place, light a candle, and meditate for 15 minutes or so.  \n\nAnother way can do it is by devination.  I have used tarot cards, scrying and pendelums to do this.  It works great to get in touch with your spiritual energy.
As a christian myself who has friends who are Muslim I can say that they only have one mother the same as you or I and take time to add why are you so anti Muslim? to tar all Muslims with the same brush is very xenophobic of you live and let live bro.

Do not try to ask her or it won't be a surprise.\n\nNot all girls are the same when it comes to gifts.\n\nFirst, you must know her attitude and likes {music, computer, dress, fashion, painting etc.}\n\nSecond, she is your girlfriend. Give something sweet but memorable. Something sweet but unique\n\nThird, when it comes to price. Do not buy too expensive gifts or too cheap gifts.\n\nFourth, buy a thing which is appropriate with her attitude, lifestyle and likes.\n\nyour question is WHAT right? Not HOW...\n\n but since I don't know your girlfriend. Try following the steps I gave you. (^_^)

I'm not sure that it's more widely accepted, but the supply has increased exponentially. This is a case where the supply actually creates the demand.\n\nThe increased demand, in turn, finances the development of more pornographic material. It's a vicious cycle, but I think the way out of it is to create more opportunities for men and women to mingle in real life. It's just more fun.
There are more women than men! I have sisters only (two).\n\nStrange...maybe thats why there are more nuns than monks!!

"You'll probably remember your life on earth but very little. You will be so caught up in being in the very presents of Almighty God that earth will seem like a bad dream. You probably won't even want to think of earth anymore.\n\nHere's one thing I always think of when I'm going through hard times. I picture myself in heaven with Jesus at my side and think to myself, ""Why oh why did I ever doubt Him on earth, why oh why was I so faithless?"" I believe that while looking back on earth in heaven we'll wonder why we even feared anything on earth."
Forever! People thrive on this stuff.
no you will not.but you  will be stucked in intra-dimensional space,which is void and it is a long wait until the next available vortex. At the next available vortex you will come back and repeat exactly what you were going through.coz suicide is considered the breech of contract of your chart.and in spiritual realm no chart can be breech until you fulfill the purpose

"Remember, it is God who ordered them to bow. It was not a bow of worship, but a bow of honouring, respect, and to obey God's command, just as humans used to do to pay homage to someone. Here's the reason why God told them to bow.\n\n“[…] When your Lord told the angels, ‘I am putting a successor on earth,’ they said, ‘How can You put someone there who will cause damage and bloodshed when we celebrate Your praise and proclaim Your holiness?’ ” They asked this not out of objection, but simply to know why and to know whether they have fallen short of their duty in praising and worshipping God. “But He said, ‘I know things you do not.’ ” Then the angels thought to themselves, “Let our Lord create what He will. He will not create a being that is more honoured, or more knowledgeable than us.” They kept this thought of theirs a secret, but nothing can be hidden from God.\n\nThen, later, when God ""taught Adam the names of all things, then He showed them to the angels and said, ‘Tell me the names of these if you truly think you can.’ They said, ‘May You be glorified! We have knowledge only of what You have taught us. You are the All Knowing and All Wise.’ Then He said, ‘Adam, tell them the names of these.’ When he told them their names, God said, ‘Did I not tell you that I know what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and that I know what you reveal and what you conceal?’ ” God exposed the statement the angels kept to themselves  and showed them how Adam was in fact both more honoured (when they bowed to him) and more knowledgeable.\n\nHope this helps, Peace be with you. If you have any other questions, i would love to answer them for you."

I guess it's because the fact that we're a species of animal, related to all other living organisms by common descent, shows what a nonsense the idea of a creator god is.  Hence those who have an emotional investment in being some kind of special creation may prefer to deny evolution rather than accept the truth.

"""Emo"" is a social group. It is also another term for screamo which is a type of music. The people in this social group tend to listen to or play screamo, they dress kinda punk and goth mix. Most of the guys actually where girls pants. It is a hard core group of kids. forgive me for profile, but that is what that word refers to"
I think men tend to take a mechanical view of of sex.  Compound that with an egocentric point of view (in other words, what is it doing for me?), and you get boring writing.  I think women are more able to step out of the situation they're describing and write about the pleasure from the viewpoint of both/all participants and write about how it feels physically and emotionally.
Hello paul g.. :)\n\nI opened up my heart, in a sincere wanting to change my life..I prayed and Jesus sent His Holy Spirit which came to dwell within me..I was set me free from a life filled with sin..the veil was lifted from my eyes..for whom the Son hath set free is free indeed.. :)\n\nI did not have to research the Love, Joy, Peace that dwelt within my heart, for it was like I was born for the first time..with a longing to help others..my heart was finally clean as white as snow..I knew that I was forgiven.. :)\n\nIn Jesus Most Precious Name..\nWith Love..In Christ..
i believe angels exist.  i also believe they have free will.  In Isaiah the prophet says that the greatest of the angels was Lucifer and he aspired to God's throne.  He said he would make himself like the Almighty.  OK, this is open rebellion.  and a third of the angels in heaven followed him!  you've got to wonder what the problem was with a third of the angels that they would rather follow Lucifer than the Lord.  And it says that war was in Heaven and Lucifer and the angels that followed him were cast out of Heaven.\n\nSounds like a lot of free will to me.
No.  The mythbusters busted this myth on one of their shows.
Catholism has a lot of mixture, therefore many of the traditions, rites and sacraments, are not to be found in the Bible, or in the ancient Christian doctrine even Paul mention it on 1st Timothy 4:1-3 1  Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;  2  Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;  3  Forbidding to marry, [and commanding] to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.  Hislop says that when the cult to Cibeles an acient babylon godess was established in Pagan Rome, it was established in its primitive form, with a celibate priesthood!!! *The two Babylons Alexander Hislop).\n\nSo my friend Celibacy is not a CHRISTIAN doctrine it has it's origin in pagan cults, and was introduced to the catholic church, and also fathom this How did the Apostle Peter alledglly the first Pope, had a mother in law??????  Even their first pope wasn't celibate right!!
Reminiscing about my first Earth Day.\n\nI'd be out on a hike, but it's raining cats & dogs/hammers & pitchforks/ today.  So, I'm watching the birds and squirrels enjoy sunflower seeds.

"Probably because of the Hippocratic oath to do no harm.  The medical person who puts in the needle isn't the person who ""throws the switch"" to turn on the chemicals they are injecting.  This gives them a measure of mental ""distance"", i.e. ""I didn't kill that guy, the executioner did.""\n\nBut I'm just guessing."
Islam sees the world as divided between two spheres: those that are under Islamic rule and those that are not yet under Islamic rule. After a place comes under Islamic rule it is not supposed to go back to rule by non-Muslims. So, Jewish Israel creates a problem... \n\nThe goal of the Arabs is to destroy Israel. They don't like the idea of a non-Arab, non-Muslim country in the region, and apparently have UN support...  http://www.eyeontheun.org/view.asp?l=21&p=142

"A friend of mine from Conn. and NY was here (KY) for her brother-in-law's funeral. She rented a car to drive from the airport. She said that she pulled to the side of the road 3 times for her son to ""use the bushes"" and every time she stopped, someone would stop before he had time to get out of the car to see whether she needed help. She was amazed at every car pulling over to the side of the road when the funeral procession from the funeral home to the cemetery went by. She had never experienced this ""up north"".\nI think that we all tend to act a lot like the people we're are around."
You're an idiot.  And the Apocrypha is idiotic.  Lots of false history, mixed in with true history.  There's a reason it's not in the Bible.\n\nGood luck with your new religion.
start by writing down what you believe. Then start going to churches in your area and/or talking to various missionaries for the churches and see what matches your beliefs or what you feel is right.  Pray, meditate and read. Remember that reading information from the churches themselves will be more reliable then from others who don't believe in a specific religion.  Also find one that has good activities and associations for your son.  Good Luck
Hi - I believe in ghosts, I have one or two in my house, laugh if you like I don't care!  I live in a little cottage in County Antrim, and strange things are always happening, in my hall I have a lamp that switches itself off only when my husband passes by it, we have had friends and family walk past it to test it but it only happens to him - in that hallway a saw a little boy with dark hair and wearing a striped t-shirt and shorts skipping past our living room door, we do not have children there is only the 2 of us. Also my husband was working in the garage and he dropped his hammer but continued working on, when he bent down to pick it up about 10 mins later it was sitting on the stepladders beside him - it totally freaked him out.  We hear voices and once even singing.  My house does'nt feel evil or creepy, but a happy place.  My father-in-law was mucking out our stables and heard some-one speaking - he answered then looked out of the stable and there was no-one there.  I have felt something tug at the back of my clothes the way a child would when they want your attention.  \nI'm not scared by my ghosts but conforted by the fact that they are there - I never feel alone. You could possibly write these things off as our imagination but there has been too many things happen!
I am good and bad like everyone else. There is no black and white among us humans.

Some people smile when they are nervous or when they don't want people to know how they're really feeling inside. Maybe you smile rather than show that someone has really pissed you off. Smiling might make them think that what they say or do really has no effect on you.

God will not keep them alive in hell. A person who goes to hell will suffer the second death. The second death is an eternal separation from God and  you will be no more.

I have visited Xinjiang, fascinating place!  I loved it, especially Kashgar.  Are you insinuating that it should become a country?\n\nThe most interesting thing about Kashgar was that the town was split at Renmin Road, to the left was the chinese side, and to the right is where the true locals lived.  They never seemed to mix, and I applaud them for it.  Regardless of my opinion, or anyone else's opinion, China will never let go of their prized western regions (XJ and TB)!  In Xinjiang, too much oil, coal, and international trade with Central Asia.  Tibet, too much tourism money.

"Does it have to be one or the other?  He was gerat in that he had the courage to explore unknown places (educated people of the time did *not* believe they would fall off the edge of the world), and some of his crew were probably people who would otherwise been killed by superstitious oafs, so he was likely responsible for saving lives.  On the other hand, he started the takeover of the ""New World"" and spread diseases that killed large numbers of the native population."
"As you have probably noticed, Muslim males have quite a few more privileges than females. The Muslim religion does not easily tolerate non-Muslims, and to see their Muslim women convert them to other religions would be a huge tragedy for them. So if the men are in control, then Islam stays intact.\n\nNow Muslim men aren't supposed to marry just anyone. Preferably they are to marry Muslim women, but they are also allowed to marry ""People of the Book"", which refers to Jews or Christians."

Catholics believe that people only go to hell if they freely choose to completely turn away from God (live and die in mortal sin). Believe it or not, all Catholics sin. But they ask God for forgiveness and try not to sin again. \n\nI don't think this venial sin is quite as bad as murder or terrorism.\n\nWith love in Christ.
JUST TRY TO FORGIVE THEM AND PRAY THAT GOD WILL MOVE ON THEIR HEARTS TO STOP . SOME PEOPLE ARE THAT WAY BECAUSE THEY THINK IT MAKES THEM TUFF AND ACCEPTED INTO A CLICK OR GROUP .

Wow! This is what I can say first. I guess you're a Romanian, right? I am a Romanian, so now I have to answer to what I think about the people I meet daily. :) \n I think that Romanians are very smart, first. Then they are less civilizated ( well, this is bad but it goes hand-on-hand with the first point mentioned). \n You also asked if they are nice and friendly. I'm not really sure what to say about this.... Romanian teenagers sometimes suck :P They're full of teribilism, I say, but with strangers they are very nice, usually. :) What more can I say?!?!

"The money ""given"" to the various tribes are from treaties signed when the US took lands from the American Indians.\nNot all tribes receive equal amounts of monies from the government.\nSome of the money is compensation for taking lands that were signed over to the American Indians, reservations, then taken away again as valuable natural resources, gold, etc, were found on those lands.\n\nThis guy needs to read more than one Reader's Digest condensed ""history of the American Indian"" to be able to argue about the American Indians with anybody.\n\np.s.

Change of attitude!  \n\nI believe that we live intentionally and our decisions  are a reflection of the beliefs we have of ourselves. \n\n I have known women who seem to attract men who are not good husband or father material--yet they choose to be with them and have babies with them.  All species are attracted to the best of their kind--the strongest, fastest etc.  It is natural to want the best traits to be passed down in your offspring.  \n\nSome women do not pick the best because they do not think they deserve the best.  \n\n  Also, I have know both men and women, who are always in dire circumstances because of their attitudes. People who have a a better opinion of themselves would be sad and frustrated in situations of bad circumstances, but would use the occasion to grow--not self-destruct.   \n\nMoney problems are not fixed with money.\n\nDr Phil and Suze Orman believe that money problems are first resolved by 'fixing' your beliefs and habbits.\n \n  Dr Phil once said that if I took all the money away from people who have it and give it to people who do not have it, within a year the people that had money taken away would have some. The people who had money given to them would lose it again.  I have witnessed this time and time again. \n\nMy advice--a mentor/education program with a strong support system. \n\nEducation is power and giving people the tools to develop their skills and make them economically viable to take better care of themselves is a tremendous gift.  Also made them aware of opportunities, so they can make a choice to take advantage of them.  \n\nThe mentor program can exposed people to possibilities beyond their wildest dreams; where there is a change of enviornment so they can pick up the influences of people who are proactive about succeeding and living a better life, not just struggling day to day.  \n\nRemember--if you give me a fish, I will eat for a day. If you teach me to fish, I will eat forever.
"I have a huge problem with that. I also have a problem with people expecting you to change your plans to accommodate them. I just refuse to do it anymore. If I were you I would tell the person/people when they come over ""I'm sorry, we were just on our way out. I'll call you later OK?"" That way you're rid of them, and maybe they'll get the hint without you having to come out and call them on coming over unannounced and uninvited. Hope this helps..."
For a variety of reasons. Some feel inferior around them and feel the need to compete. Some feel judged by them. Some people who work hard think that they are superior and become very arrogant. There are a variety of reasons, that can have to do with anything from the attitude of the hard working person to the attitude of the people who react to them.

Blue is used on black in cartoons for the hair. It helps to add texture to the hair and show which way it flows. You know how in cartoons they're outlined in black?

So... they use blue instead.\n\nYoure shoes are the huge ones clowns wear that are red, or they're your pink, fuzzy, bunny slippers.
Apathy is more satisfying (not caring)  than hate.  Love and hate take a lot of effort.
I don't completely believe in any one religion.  So I tend to consider myself spiritual but not religious.  I don't go to church but I do have very strong beliefs and I do worship.  My beliefs just take a little of every religion.
I like to be a unique individual,like everyone is, I think I like to meet people with different perspectives,lifestyles and experiences,and I learn alot from them ,I think that hating and rejecting others without hesitation because they do not share your dogma or beliefs is dooming yourself to ignorance by not even considering how someone would feel or act a certain way or what would you be like if you were raised like them and had their experiences you close yourself off to gainig understanding and frustration from believing assumptions and then getting confused because you cannot develop or identify an issue accurately if you start with assumptions,then you are hopeless to resolve your problem because your plan is based on fantasy not reality , I do not understand what is so difficult for some people to agree to disagree or live and let live
God is not capable of hate.  By definition, God is Love.  To recognize that there is a God at all (as you did in your question) means that you must also recognize that other forces are at work in the Universe.  Rest assured, God is not responsible for hate.  Leave that one to the forces of darkness.
Its hard to tell. Its a belief of mine that many people only believe because they're afraid that once their gone, their gone. Religion is a way to become immortal. Kind of sad, really. I believe because I want to believe, and I don't believe in any after life. Technology, science, religion-they're all ways to become immortal! Humans, as a species, are afraid of death and being forgotten. Myself included.

Riverotter7 has the right of it.Early Catholic priests were allowed to marry, up until The 11th century,where it was then decided that to convert people easier, they needed to elevate a priests stature in society,so the Church institued the celibacy thing.

Is this what you are refering to ?\n\nMatthew 12 43-45\n\n43When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none. \n\n 44Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. \n\n 45Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.

When I go to Heaven, I hope I get to be in ""charge"" of loving and petting all of the animals!!!"
Yes. The news tends to make people insensitive by the way it presents the most sensational view of what is happening with the world. For instance say there is some disaster it is presented and then we hear no more about it unless it is deemed newsworthy - the people living with that disaster can't just switch off, they're stuck with it. Because we can switch off at any time we cease to be shocked by the shocking. It gives us the pretence of being in control when we are really not.
I'd bring him some beef jerky.
Jesus himself was asked by a disciple how many times should i forgive.....and he said seventy times seven...i believe if you are really going to count that many, then you have no love or forgiveness in yourself....i dont think he counts our sins when we confess them to Him out of a sincere and pure and repentant heart...but we should not be running and stumbling into sin...thats what the Holy Spirit is for, He convicts us and guides us away from sin, so we wont stumble over and over...if you dont have convictions or the inner witness of the Holy Spirit, then you need to examine whether or not you know Jesus...because those that know Him hear His voice...The Lord disciplines the ones He loves....so when you arent being disciplined...be afraid...and seek Him out of a pure heart.....ok..let me stop talking now...email me if you want me to continue...i hope you are blessed.....
yeah I would have to agree with that
I go on and actually have a nice day!:)

Enjoy, your sex life is nobody elses business, if they don't like what you're doing then they don't have to have sex with you.  Just use condoms and don't get too drunk or too stoned lol!  Enjoy all the judgmental answers that will probably follow mine, people are so self righteous on here!
If you don't want to, you don't have to.  Besides, you'll get further in life than most of your peers with this sort of attitude!  Also, statistically, you'll live longer than them also.  Not wanting to spend a bunch of money on beer and cigarettes and die of lung cancer or cirrhosis doesn't make you a goody goody bastard.
"I give my toilet a nice ""spa"" treatment. I give it a good scrub and rinse. I wipe all of the little ""mystery"" hair off of it (as nasty as it is). And make it shiny and new looking...and then the hubby comes home to destroy all of my hard work....oh well."
Do any of you even know what remote viewing is? It's the process of seeing at a distance. It is a psychic ability that has a decent ammount of credability to it and has been employed by police to solve crimes. It is no substitute for a good criminal profile and physical evidence as it is unreliable, but it can help.\n\nI am not a remote viewer, I'll go with thousand oaks.
To whom are you referring? Do you have any citations? Jesus' followers during his lifetime and shortly after are considered Christians, and Christianity started out as a Jewish sect. I don't think this is in dispute by reputable religious scholars, so some citations from you would be helpful to get to the bottom of this. \n\nA timeline for Christianity can be found below.\n\nETA: Anyone who thinks Christianity started in the Garden of Eden is completely wacko. Do a little reading, please.

"I will treat this as the question you asked. There are several ways that children can be introduced to witchcraft. When I encounter interested young people, I tend to direct them to the Tarot unless I think they are capable of learning more rapidly. \n\nI know what you are thinking: ""What does a byzantine card game played between devout christians and muslims in the time of the crusades have to do with witchcraft?"" well it was turned into a simple and easy to use divinatory system by A E Waite. \n\nPoetry is another good way to introduce young people into the occult. The poet William Butler Yeats was a member of the hermetic order of the golden dawn and has written extensively on the occult. \n\nAnother good way for children to get into witchcraft is for them to study the bible. Infact, more pagans come from homes that hold to a strict and rigid interpretation of the bible than come from any other source. Even for non christian households, playing with the bible can be a fun diversion. \n\nIf they aren't interested in studying scripture, perhaps they should learn by example. (I don't advise this, the early christian demon summonings could be a little much for some children.) The early christians practiced several forms of magic including the following: \n\nhttp://www.lib.umich.edu/pap/magic/agg.display.html \n\nIncluded in there are love spells that torture the subject until they give in to the intent of the spell. Many of the details are missing, but a careful study of history can fill in those details. \n\nAlchemy was a more accepted form of witchcraft that holds true to more traditional christian values. Famous Alchemists such as Sir Newton, and N Flamel helped us to bring alchemy into a form of science, but it has still shaped modern western magic more than any other single magical endeavor. \n\nFinally, in the 1950s wicca came about. It has been popular with young and old people alike who are interested in learning about the supernatural. It has some of the same values that christians do, but it tends to be more free about them. \n\nWicca developed out of cerimonial witchcrft such as that practiced by the Golden dawn. It did not come before Christianity as was once claimed, but it does draw from spiritual paths arround the world that are far older than Christianity."
It depends on the guy and gal-- women fake it sometimes to make their man feel better about the act, when sometimes in the womens eyes its about as exciting as watching the evening news. A man needs to know that a women takes longer to reach orgasm then a man does and women need to have some kind of foreplay to signal to her body that it's time. Women can't go from 0 to 60 in sixty seconds like a man. We need a little more time. An experianced man will know this therefore eliminating the womens need to fake it.  All in all alot of women fake it because they don't want to disappoint their man into thinking he ain't no good, it's our little way to boost ya'lls ego. My experiance though has taught me to be honest and tell my man that I need a little down south time to get my motors running- then it's full throttle from there.....
"Christians for the most part will tell you yes. I'm not sure what the other main religions would tell you on this one. I don't believe any ""conversion"" that's based on the fear of death is genuine to begin with. The law of cause and effect are not negated just because someone thinks that confession corrected everything they did."
I think that to some extent the emancipation of women brought many positive things for us, females. However, some of us, got carried away and now prioritize their careers in front of family and personal life in general. At the end of the day, everyone has the right to choose his avenues of life, so I consider the feminist movements as something that has  elevated the equality of women and men. \n\nOf course it's proper that every woman gets educated, gets a Career and is able to be financially independent, but some women really overdo it and anything that is done  without moderation loses its positive aspects.

"The French dont keep statistics on how many ""blacks"" or ""whites"" are in their country. The view is that, if the government doesnt recognize the distinction, maybe over time, other people wont recognize it either. People will just be people.\n\nI was watching Morgan Freeman on 60 minutes. He was lamenting that we even had to notice such distinctions. He was more or less saying ""Im not a 'great black actor', im just a great actor"". \n\nI am not nieve, I know many people will continue to see difference racial groups in their narrow way, but that doesnt mean you or I need to. Thats their problem. \n\nIf you refuse to notice the difference, as I have done over the last 10 years, I promise added peace to your life. Its so odd, when you make that decision, you eventually feel lighter, like a weight has been lifted.\n\nDont be anything BUT YOU. Your race doesnt define you...not the least bit.

Moses Maimonides, the medieval Jewish philosopher, writing in the twelfth century, laid down for the first time in the history of Jewish doctrine, thirteen fundamentals of Jewish belief. While they have been criticised by later academics, they are generally taken as as the official creed of Judaism.\n\n\n1. God is the creator of all that is;\n2. God is one;\n3. God is incorporeal (without material form);\n4. God is eternal;\n5. God alone is to be worshipped;\n6. God communicates to man through the medium of prophecy;\n7. Moses was the greatest of the prophets;\n8. The whole of the Torah was revealed to Moses by God;\n9. The Torah will not be changed or supplanted by another revelation from God;\n10. God is knowledgeable about the deeds of mankind;\n11. God rewards and punishes people for their good and evil ways;\n12. The belief in the arrival of the Messiah and the messianic age;\n13. The belief in the resurrection of the dead.\n\nThe last doctrine has generally been replaced by non-Orthodox Jews with a doctrine that the soul continues to exist after death.

Good question. I think drivers do it for extra space to put their left arm. Passengers probably do it to test the aerodynamics of their hand, for example if you put your hand at a certain angle while going fast, the wind will push it up or down, kinda fun but don,t do it while youre driving.
"Honyock was originally an ethnic slur that referred to immigrants to the United States and Canada who came from Central and Eastern Europe. It was later expanded to mean a rube or simpleton, its most common usage. Honyock first appeared in print in the late 19th century. It fell into disuse during the 1960s and 1970s. This term was often applied to people who were unwelcome among their family, friends and/or community.\n\nThe most common theory of the origin of this word is the merger of the first syllable of the word ""Hungarian"" and the last syllable of the ethnic slur ""Polack."" However, a more likely origin is the Hungarian adjective hanyag, which has a variety of negative meanings including careless, derelict, indifferent, irresponsible, lax, negligent, oblivious, slipshod, sloppy, slothful, and slow.\n\nIn parts of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Alberta and Saskatchewan, a honyock is a hardscrabble farm. The farmer who works such a farm is a honyocker.\nRetrieved from ""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/transwiki:Honyock"""
No such naps don't have a point. Instead one could relax outside in the fresh air and the companies must provide healthy working conditions. Spending money doesn't mean good working conditions. The atmosphere should be more lively. Efforts should be made to kill depression and stress.

I believe we will be known as we are known here on earth.  I am not sure what we will look like, but I don't think it will really matter.  We won't be there for ourselves, but for our God.  We won't be in our earthly bodies, but I think we will resemble ourselves enough to know the difference between each other.  I don't believe everyone here will be in heaven though.  Only those who believe and have a personal relationship with the Son of God.  I hope to see you there!

"Within Christianity, the doctrine of the Trinity states that God is a single Being who exists, simultaneously and eternally, as a communion of three persons (personae, prosopa): Father (the Source, the Eternal Majesty); the Son (the eternal Logos or Word, incarnate as Jesus of Nazareth); and the Holy Spirit. Since the 4th Century AD, in both Eastern and Western Christianity, this doctrine has been stated as ""One God in Three Persons,"" all three of whom, as distinct and co-eternal ""persons"" or ""hypostases,"" share a single Divine essence, being, or nature.\n\n\nThe word ""Trinity"" comes from ""Trinitas"", a Latin abstract noun that most literally means ""three-ness"" (or ""the property of occurring three at once""). Or, simply put, ""three are one"". The first recorded use of this Latin word was by Tertullian in about 200, to refer to Father, Son and Holy Spirit, or, in general, to any set of three things.\n\nThe Greek term used for the Christian Trinity, ""Τριάς"" (a set of three or the number three),[1] has given the English word triad. The Sanskrit word, ""Trimurti,"" has a similar meaning, as has ""Dreifaltigkeit"" in German, and many other words in other languages.\n\nThe New Testament does not use the word ""Τριάς"" (Trinity), but only speaks of God (often called ""the Father""), of Jesus Christ (often called ""the Son""), and of the Holy Spirit, and of the relationships between them. The word ""Trinity"" began to be applied to them only in the course of later theological reflection.\n\nThe earliest Christians were noted for their insistence on the existence of one true God, in contrast to the polytheism of the prevailing culture. While maintaining strict monotheism, they believed also that the man Jesus Christ was at the same time something more than a man (a belief reflected, for instance, in the opening verses of the Letter to the Hebrews, which describe him as the reflection of God's glory and bearing the impress of God's own being, and, yet more explicitly, in the prologue of the Gospel according to John) and also with the implications of the presence and power of God that they believed was among them and that they referred to as the Holy Spirit. St Paul even goes so far as to state that ""in [Jesus] lives all the fulness of Deity bodily"" (Colossians 2:9).\n\nThe importance for the first Christians of their faith in God, whom they called Father, in Jesus Christ, whom they saw as Son of God, and in the Holy Spirit is expressed in formulas that link all three together, such as those in the Gospel according to Matthew, the Great Commission: ""Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit"" (Matthew 28:19); and in the Second Letter of St Paul to the Corinthians: ""The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all"" (2 Corinthians 13:14).\n\nConclusions about how best to explain the association of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit with the one God developed gradually and not without controversy. Christians had to reconcile their belief in the divinity of Jesus Christ with their belief in the one-ness of God. In doing so, some stressed the one-ness to the point of considering Father, Jesus and Holy Spirit as merely three modes or roles in which God shows himself to mankind; others stressed the three-ness to the point of positing three divine beings, with only one of them supreme and God in the full sense. Only in the fourth century were the distinctness of the three and their unity brought together and expressed in mainline Christianity in a single doctrine of one essence and three persons. Some Christians still debate the differences found in the New Testament, where Christ declared ""I and my Father are one,"" "

Having a large gun (automatic pistol, probably a 45 or a 9mm) shoved in my chest by a guy wanting money, of which I only had $3.23 on me and/or my leather jacket, then a guy at the end of the car started talking crazy, distracted the guy with the gun long enough for a REALLY big dude to grab my coller, pull me out of my shock and my seat and yank me to the next car, then at the next stop he shoved me out of the car and told me to run. I wanted out of there so bad, I never turned to thank him for saving my life.

Oh my... well there is hope for you to not be shy. People laugh at me when I tell them I used to be shy. I would literally start puking in school if I thought I would have to do or talk in front of someone. One day I was on a school bus and some kids were picking on a boy that was a bit slow... (older and popular boys) and I decided I had to stand up for this boy. I did and I let them have it and to my knowledge they never picked on that boy again but what happened is after I did that I was like WOW that wasn't so hard or bad and I slowly started gaining confidence. I have actually done public speaking now. Chaired committees and even served as a Jury foreman. I just decided life was to short to be afraid any longer and I made a decision to just go for all I could. I want you to know in certain circumstances I still sometimes feel the tendency to be shy but I just keep going and then I have a great time. I have great faith that you can do this also. Just take one day at a time.\nSo sorry that your 3rd grade teacher was so arghhhhhh!!! Don't give up on others or yourself because of her. Dust yourself off and go for all you want!!!

Interesting point….  Although I am not a vegetarian, I would have to agree with you that I cannot think of a single case where meat is necessary, or even better than a properly balanced vegetarian or vegan diet.  \n\nHowever, the key to that is it being a PROPERLY BALANCED diet.  Much of our society (and the world for that matter) has gotten accustomed to getting certain portions of their nutritional needs from meats – essential amino acids, vitamins, etc.  Someone who is familiar with vegetarian or vegan diets can easily replace these needs with an arguably healthier, meatless menu.  \n\nThe problem comes when someone who has unique or specific nutritional needs looses access to part of their diet that they do not know how to replace completely.  For instance if someone who regularly eats meat to meet a significant part of their nutritional needs simply cuts that meat out for lent and does not know that they need to replace it with other foods, they could encounter malnutrition issues.\n\nPerhaps an alternative would be to educate people on what foods should be used to substitute for various meats to maintain a healthy diet.\n\nGreat question!  Thanks!

"I think they are telling the truth, ""truth"" being defined as that which the speaker honestly believes. Whether or not they are relating FACTS is another matter entirely. I think much of what they relate is influenced by media and prompting. \n\nMany people misunderstand hypnosis, falsely believeing that it is impossible to lie while in a hypnotic trance. Not true! It is not only possible, but quite common. Hypnosis puts a person into a state of mind which makes them highly suseptible to suggestion. The hypnotist has to be extremely careful not to plant a suggestion into the subject's mind, but this still happens anyway.\n\nSo, combining media influences with  hypnotic suggestions, a subject will often fabricate what he believes the hypnotist is asking for. Technically the subject is not ""lying"", however. He honestly believes he is telling the truth. But in many cases it is only a creation of his mind, intending to satisfy the questioner. \n\nWith all that said, do I believe that some people have actually been abducted?

I've recovered from backsliding multiple times.\nIt's through God's grace and mercy that we are able to manage our sins and down falls.  We don't ever truly defeat them, but we are able to recover if we will humble ourselves and alloy God to change us.  \n\nOnce we get married... There's more at stake.  There's more people involved then just you.  Your sins and downfalls will greatly effect your spouse as well.  If (or when) you do sin, you have to humble yourself and prove to your spouse and God that you are changing.  Faith is action.  If you want someone to have faith in you again, you have to prove yourself to them once again.  Then, it's through God's grace, Mercy and forgiveness that you are both able to overcome the pain the sin and backsliding has caused.  Once you realize that you have sinned and asked forgiveness for that, you need to keep yourself accountable to God, yourself, and your spouse.  It's not easy for you nor your spouse to recover from backsliding but yes it IS possible.  My wife and I are living proof.
"By understanding that we are One People in the Universe.. The Earth is the ship that carries us trough the Ocean of Spirituality and we are sharing the same course. There is not My Religion or Your Religion but only ONE GOD that has many ways of showing HIS Face... trough billion of people sharing the same spark of His Spirit... trough the animals, the plants, the sun, the stars and the Whole Universe.. We belong to each other.. we are part of the Great Family of the Universe.\n\nI had  a dream one day: There was a bun fire with twelve Wise Men sitting around it; to each the same question was asked: ""Describe the fire you are looking at..."" There were twelve different answers.. though the Fire was only one..\n\nSo are our Religions... and the Fire is God"
Jesus said that if a man doesn't hate his own life, then he is unworthy of Him.
to tell people this: I know that you can go to heaven if you get saved and the way that you get saved is if you believe that Jesus died on the cross from your sins, rose on the third day, and then you have to confess to God in prayer that you are a sinner and that you believe He died on the cross for your sins and ask for His forgiveness on your sins and it is THAT simple, salvation is a free gift, we can't earn it. I am a baptist who believes (let me rephrase that, I KNOW) that this stuff I said is true.

There might be something to that. We have no idea what that gene would be like. Interesting thought to ponder.
Ha! I agree with Mr. Question!\n\nI have it because I like to be able to SEE. Cars feel too low for me. I like being up high, I like the feel of driving an SUV, it has awesome storage/carrying space, comfortable for long drives, etc.
1. Fundamentalists and other religious wackos who want to tell me how to live my life because they couldn't figure out how to live theirs without an almighty crutch.\n\n2. Homophobes, because even though I'm bi, mostly straight, it's just too annoying that people can't live and let live without wanting to oppress and degrade others. Let's all just leave each other be, 'kay?\n\n3. People who play their car stereos too loud in residential areas. Come on! Save your hearing; save my nerves. Play it at a reasonable volume.\n\n4. People who flirt and/or go out on dates with no intention of being any thing more significant than friends. Is it really so hard to be emotionally honest? No! I just don't get why there are so many *ockteases and *untteases in the world.\n\n5. Anti-choice activism. Don't like abortion? Then don't have one! No one has a right to interfere with women's private medical decisions. That goes double for men since they don't even have a uterus or any chance of getting pregnant.

Not often enough...habit enables me to remember tasks by rote. (get up, let dogs out, hit light switch, turn coffee\npot on(which was set up night before), turn on radio, give dogs a treat when they come back in, get out medicine, wash up, fix breakfast, set out lunch for work, on and on and on\nand that's just a partial list for morning...)\nBeing a creature of habit also tends to turn me into a boring, rut-induced person....I need to find a happy medium.
Humans have been the same over all time.  What changes is technology, information, and society.  Society is the big one.  All things are relative.  So people, essentially, are biologically very similar throughout history...and morals are social constructs that change with the times.\n\nThe Victorians were, in my opinion, basically just more reserved than us.  At least publicly.  Think about Catholic school kids for a minute, or drinking ages here versus in Europe...sometimes being denied access to things makes the masses crazier.  By that reasoning, the Victorians were crazy.
'On your Todd' was originally cockney rhyming slang - Todd Sloane (a jockey) - alone\n\nI thought it was a Scots saying, apparently not I guess.
I have felt that (more when I was a kid - sometimes still...  this is a VERY good question and I hope you ask more at this level!)  \n\nHehehe, if that were true, than this question was there to shake me from these feelings, and make me feel like someone esle feels the same.  I don't know what to believe.  Either you are real, and we are all real, or only you and I are real, or I'm real and you asked the question as some part of a divine plan to throw me off course...  (begins to doubt every thought he has ever had... mind slipping away).  YOU KNOW TOO MUCH!!!!!!!!!\n\n: )
"Yes, here is the reasoning:  The center of authority for the Catholic [apostolic] Church is Rome.  Administration is centered at the Vatican, Vatican City.  There are some 200 Christian denominations;  Lutheran, Methodist, Greek Orthodox and the list goes on. There are also many Christian religious orders.  Fundamentalist Christian Churches in a local community are a good example.  Some of the local Fundamentalist Churches are not recognized by the Catholic authority in Rome, therefore they are considered Christian but not Catholic.\n  To be Christian you are a believer of the teachings of Jesus Christ...to be Catholic you are both a believer of the Teachings of Jesus Christ but also a practicing member of the Roman Catholic Church.  The word 'Catholic"" means ''universal''."
Depends on the individual actions of the soldier.\n\nFor example, if the soldier deliberately commits a war crime such as by torturing or executing an unarmed prisoner of war for no reason.\n\nBut defending ones-self when threatened is not a sin.
Both.  Without the points I suppose I would answer questions less frequently.  On the other hand, I wouldn't come here at all if it weren't for the chance to make my voice heard or help somebody or maybe just try and be a know-it-all.  Motivations are difficult critters to figure out sometimes, even ones own.
Man used fire, long before he was capable of creating it himself. Fire is a natural phenomenon, and usually created by lightning. For a very long time, Man only had to maintain the fire, by stoking it and keeping it lit.\nIt was probably an accidental discovery, when someone, hit two stones together and saw a spark. One stone was flint, which is still being used today, to create fire. Mostly in cigarette lighters.\nIf they did spot the spark and perhaps with it being against some dry grass, it caught fire, it wouldn't be long, before they put two and two together.\nRemember early cro-magnon man, had the same brain power as we do today.
Vote in the mid-term elections and remove some of the Republican influence that resides in the Congress.\n\nIt's well known that the Republicans have been censoring information regarding Global Warming.

The culture of the people living on the island of Ireland is far from monolithic. Many notable cultural divides exist between the rural people and city dwellers, between the Catholic and Protestant people of Ulster, between the Irish-speaking people within and without the Gaeltacht regions and the English-speaking majority population, between the settled people and the Travellers, and, increasingly, between new immigrants and the native population.
I think it is pathetic, there is no need to abuse anyone or anything, yes we all get angry and maybe say things we regret but if we realize our faults thats a start to maybe containing a little if not all the selfcontrol we have. Its all about teaching not only math, english, science etc. but teaching at a young age what selfcontrol is and how inportant it is. We are not perfect in my household but we do stress selfcontrol.

"When English speakers hear ""achoo,"" they usually respond with either ""Gesundheit"" or ""God bless you."" Gesundheit was borrowed from German, where it means ""health"". \n\nWishing a person good health when they sneezed was believed to forestall the illness that a sneeze might indicate. ""God bless you"" had a similar purpose. \n\nIt was once believed the soul could exit the body during a sneeze, causing ill health. Folks said ""God bless you"" to ward off this danger."
It really depends on the slave owner during that era. Some slaves were treated badly there is no doubt about that but you must also remember that there is always two sides to a coin.  Not all slave owners were horrible to the slaves. In fact at one point when the slaves were freed some actually stayed with there owners and became crop sharers. Continuing to do what they were doing prior to being freed. \n\nI live in the south and am very proud to be southern. I never owned a slave nor did any member of my ancestors in fact my grandmother worked along side the coloreds in the cotton fields less than 50 years ago.

"Organized Religion is an ingenious way to control  masses of people, collect money from them, make them feel guilt,\nand tell them how to think. Because some people are easily led they do what they are told, no questions asked.They are afraid or don't know how to think for themselves,so they let someone else tell them what and how to think about any particular thing.It's easy to hide behind Religion, easy to hide on a key board and easy let let someone do your thinking for you,because then you cannot be 100% responsible for what you say or believe. So  they take the easy way.The last time I checked THE BIBLE, I read \n""Love Thy Neighbour.""\n maybe that is the one sentence they did not read.For some of us who think for ourselves, (yes some of us believe in God ) we do not judge, hate, or say what we are told to. We do worry that gay rights should be in line with the rights other people have and we may not understand all about gay culture but little by little we educate  ourselves by making friends with gay people, reading about gays and asking our gay friends things we don't understand about the gay culture. And because we do these things, our lives are enriched beyond compare to people who don't."

"I actually gave a speech on this not too long ago.  I have these notes that may help:\n\nIt is critical to understand what happened in the Garden of Eden.  If you get off track in Genesis (the beginning), imagine how far off you’d be by Revelation!\n\nLet’s begin by reading Genesis chapter 2 & 3\n\nTree of Life= Christ\nTree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil= Satan\n\nGenesis 3:3 “But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.”\nLook up the word “touch” in the Strong’s Concordance, #5060.  It can mean “to lie with a woman.”  Keep that in mind.\nChrist needed a pure blood line to come through so he could be the ultimate, perfect sacrifice.  Satan was always trying to prevent that.  What better way than to corrupt Eve’s seed?\n\nYou can’t isolate verses and expect to truly understand it.  You have to view the Bible as a whole.  Look at the big picture!  So here are some passages you might want to consider:\n\n2 Corinthians 11:3 “But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.”\nIf you look up that word “beguiled” in the Strong’s, #1818, it says, “to seduce wholly”\nWhat does it mean to “seduce wholly”?!  That’s right, have sex.  Now, am I taking this out of context?  Well, what is the subject of chapter 11?  Virginity!  Follow the subject, it fits.  What else could “seduce wholly,” in a chapter about virginity, possibly mean?\n\nJust in case you’re not sure about who the serpent is in Genesis and in the latter verse, read Revelation 12:9 and 20:2.\n\nCommon argument: “Satan is a fallen angel.  Angels can’t have sex.”\nReally?  Explain Genesis 6 to me, particularly verses 2-4 \n“That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.  And the LORD said, ""My spirit shall not always strive with man, for he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.  There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of GOD came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.”   \nWhat are the sons of GOD?  Angels!\n\nWhat about the book of Jude (verse 6 in particular)??\nThese angels “fell,” their progeny were giants.  The Hebrew word is Nephilim, meaning fallen ones.\n\nSo am I saying Satan succeeded?  He successfully corrupted Eve’s seed line?  No.  He almost did, but not quite. *Mary came through Seth’s seed line (Luke 3)*  \n\nLet’s go a little bit deeper… first off, Cain and Able were twins.  How do I know?\nGenesis 4:1-2 “And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD. 2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.” \n\n“Again” in the Strong’s, #3254, means to continue; Eve continued in labor… that means twins!!\nI know this is a lot of information to process, but hang in there… we’re going even deeper.\n\nYes, Cain and Able were twins, but they had two different fathers!!  WHAT?!  Impossible right?  Wrong.  It can be proven, and it happens; it’s called “heteropaternal superfecundation” (Google it yourself!).\n\nSo which was which?  Able is Adam’s son.  Cain is Satan’s.  I have further proof, keep studying!\n\nWhere is Cain in Adam’s genealogy?!  Check out Genesis 5.  Someone is missing!  \n\nCommon argument: Well, Able is not listed either.  Explain that.\nThat’s true, he isn’t.  That’s because he died before he had children.  Notice Seth is listed, but Cain isn’t… Cain definitely had children.\n\nWant more proof?  Okay, here we go…\nIn John chapter 8, Christ is speaking to the Kenites (literally means “sons of Cain,” als"

"The US calls itself a ""melting pot"", where everyone is expected to give up their uniqueness and blend in with the whole.  Strange, then how Americans are petrified at communist collectivism.  Canada calls itself a ""mosaic"" where people are welcome to come and stay as they are.\n\nBecause of it's physical isolation, the US has always had an isolationist - and xenophobic - mentality.  Canada always had the Commonwealth connection to the British, so we never felt disconnected from other countries despite the same distances.  And we don't have Mexico and Central America to visit.\n\nTo go back to mentioning communism, the US politically is an oddball in the world by never having had a strong socialist movement.  Your ""democratic"" party would be a rightwing party in most every other country in the world; many countries consider your ""republicans"" to be fascist, and that was *before* the Chimp was appointed in 2000.  American political views are so narrow and to the right of all other nations, it's like someone looking through the wrong end of a telescope and thinking everything seen is everything that is.  \n\nSocially, your country behaves much the same way.  Try buying a plane ticket to southeast Asia or take a bus ride through Central America, meet people and listen to what they think without telling them your opinion.  You might begin to understand the problem."

unfortunately you cant tell, i am a veteran of Iraq, and as an infantry soldier in Baghdad i know for a fact that the bottom line is that you cant tell. the evil people will disguise themselves to appear as normal as anyone else. you will not be able to tell. that is the strength of their vicious acts. you have to make a personal decision whether or not you want to trust them when you see them. but if you think about it a little you may realize that if they are dressed as Muslims and are not trying to disguise themselves then they probably don't have anything to hide. but on the other hand they may just be confident in what they are doing knowing that America is afraid to discriminate and they will be able to walk right in.

it depends. there are some families where the do one for every child, depending on the culture and traditions. do not feel obligated to buy an extravagant gift if you want to participate. some mothers have a large gap between children, such as me and my brother are 12 years apart, so my mother didn't have anything. others may choose to if they are with a different father, and it is the first grandbaby for that family also. \ntraditionally a baby shower was for the first child of a couple, but now days--- who sticks with all the tradition anyways?!?
Whether it's expanding or not, man will never find the edge of the universe.\n This shows the limitless Love that God has for His children.

"It started out with an effort to give respect to others. Too many loud mouth experts demanding to be heard on the subject of hurt feelings. Then unfortunately politicians got involved! You know that as a specie, they nothing about earning respect as to getting a free gift. If anyone is going to poop in the drinking water its these people. Did not seem to be worth the fight so most people went along, till now. Now we realize we have been quiet too long, nothing has changed, only that things have gotten worse.

General at service of the emir Abd ar-Rahman II of Córdoba, that was uncle of the emir Al-Hakam I.\n\nIn 826 revolted Aissó (or Aysun) and requested help to Abd al-Rahman II. This sent to the general Ubayd Allah known also as Abu Marwan, that it arrived to Zaragoza in May 827. From there it happened to territory of the county of Barcelona, reaching Barcelona in summer, that it was besieged without success, ransacking its surroundings. Then moved to Girona that either they could occupy (October 10, 827). Louis the Pious, while, knowing the Musulman raid, ordered to his son Pippin of Aquitania, and to the counts Hugo of Tours and Matfred of Orleans, the recruitment of an army, but the recruitment was slow and when it was formed already Abu Merwan and its army was returning to its dominances. The rebels abandoned the country with them (827).

"I guess the easiest illustration and application about slavery would be the fact that, because of the sin of Adam, and we being his offspring, we are born into the ""slavery"" of sin.

I do not know where hatfield herts is, but most domestic abuse facilities have a list of the available anger management programs.

Contact a domestic abuse facility near hatfield herts they'll direct you where you need to go.

You will be met with a series of disappointments for the next week or so. Your plans will be filled with complications. \n\nTo see several tornadoes in your dream, represent people around you who are prone to violent outbursts and shifting mood swings. It may also symbolize a volatile situation or relationship.
"Many people believe that Christ spoke primarily Hebrew or Aramaic (While there were differences, these languages were basically the same).  While there is no question that He did speak Aramaic, he probably primarily spoke Greek (probably all Jews at that time primarily spoke Greek).\n\nThere are numerous reasons that I believe this is so:\n\n1)  Greek was the common language of the world at this time.  This is why the New Testament was written in Greek.  When Alexander the Great conquered this part of the world, he truly assimilated much of their culture.  So much so that it can still be seen today.  Try going to a Greek restaurant sometime, and then go to a Middle Eastern restaurant.  You will be amazed at how similar the menus are.\n\n2)  Most of the ""Bibles"" we find from that time, or quotes from the Bible at that time come from the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures.\n\n3)  When Jesus cried out in Aramaic on the cross, many of the people misunderstood him!  That seems to indicate that many of the people in the crowd (and they would almost certainly have been 99% Jew - especially at the time of the Passover) did not understand Aramaic!\n\n4)  When Jesus quoted the Old Testament, he quoted the Septuagint.\n\n5)  We find no almost no early manuscripts of the New Testament in Aramaic and Hebrew (I don't think there are ANY, actually, although I am not sure) in the area of Jerusalem, but we have found 1,000s in Greek.\n\n6)  Common Greek of the time is often said to be one of the most exact languages ever spoken.  It left very little room for misunderstandings of meanings.  Many Bible scholars believe God chose that time to send Jesus because His words would be recorded in that language.  It seems logical that if the is the case, Jesus also would have chosen to speak in that language.\n\n7)  Matthew was a Jew, and his gospel was written to Jews.  Yet he felt he needed to explain what Jesus said in Aramaic on the cross.  If all the Jews knew Aramaic, there would be no need to translate it for them!"
"Belief is a little more than speculating...at first,yes, there is speculation, a sense of wondering...but if/when one follows that speculation, which is a form of urging oneself into studying the ""unknown""...one will find evidence to support the belief, until it grows deeper and deeper, beyond the knee-jerking of ego.  \n\nThere can be, and ultimately is, a point at which belief moves quite effortlessly into knowing...and the knowing is calm without opposite, joy without opposite, peace without opposite...thus cannot be shaken."
I've had that happen also, but it might be very difficult to work out a system like that. I think its a good idea, though, to deter people from giving nonsense answers.
They should come to see you too.  I always have to drive to V.A from N.Y about 8 hour drive with two young kids and they haven't came here to see me.  I feel the same way.

I'm sorry, I hope they will visit you from now on.  I refuse to go back home anymore, it's too much of a hassle, my mom and I always fight too.

As a guy who uses a wheelchair, I bring my own seat.  BUT, if you are sitting in the front rows of the bus, and the bus company receives federal $$ (which most do) then it is requested (note: not required) that you get up and allow a person with a disability to sit there.\n\nAnd, most people with disabilities live in an inaccessible world.  They are unable to access many portions of the community.  Allowing someone to have a seat when they need one is a great step in the right direction.

yes.\n\n people have been traveling for centuries.some stories are common or at least give similar resonance in totally different religions.\n\nBuddhism was already quite wide spread when Christianity evolved. Buddhist described extraordinary dreams Mahamaya had before Buddha was born. Christians got theory of virgin mother. Buddha had a disciple Amrapali who used to be a prostitute then became a nun when came in contact with Buddha. What is that accepted story about Magdalen?\n\nchristians adopted same type of managing style of church as buddhist Vihar. the idea of celibate priests, nuns etc. earlier buddhist did not allowed females in monastries. Some early buddhist schollars  were against it others thought women should be allowed.Afterwards they were allowed to join as nuns but really not given important posts among high officials.\n\nBesides that Christians had already inherited stories from their native sourses. From Pagans to jew.\n\nthe idea of only true god and true belief has a Jewish source as far as i know.\n\nThe missioneries in India have regularly made up stories or changed them a bit or simply borrowed local tales. Im Baar geets Asam they replaced name of jesus with Rama and Krishna. In Nahaland they replaced Jesus with Local hero and called him a victor. Last year they made up stalls on Krishna Janmashtami(birth day) and depicted infact jesus in place of krishna.\n\n It is said that Lord Shiva drank all the poison Himself which came out of cosmic churn so that living world is saved.\n\nWhen they are borrowing this much today to get mixed up and using deceit to get converts how can be anyone sure that they did not do it from the start.\n\nI can perceive it from a limited knowledge. I am sure peole who have compared the other religious thoughts know it as a fact. they accept it openly or not. Accept the concept of Jesus for everybody what else is really original?

"There is no ""sin.""  There is good and evil, right and wrong, and morality and immorality.  One thing I have learned by becoming close with a few is that revs/ministers/pastors are the biggest hypocrites around! I will not have anyone dictate what is right and wrong based on some self-proclaimed ""christian"" pastor/rev/minister's belief and politics (whether it be conservative or liberal).  Some pastors get their politics mixed with their religion; their churches should lose tax-exempt status (liberal or conservative)."

"Here's your answer:\n\n""Here comes Peter Cottontail\nhoppin' down the bunny trail \nHippity hoppity \nEasters on its way!""\n\nThe Easter bunny has its origin in pre-Christian fertility lore. The Hare and the Rabbit were the most fertile animals known and they served as symbols of the new life during the Spring season. \nThe bunny as an Easter symbol seems to have it's origins in Germany, where it was first mentioned in German writings in the 1500s. The first edible Easter bunnies were made in Germany during the early 1800s. And were made of pastry and sugar. \n\nThe Easter bunny was introduced to American folklore by the German settlers who arrived in the Pennsylvania Dutch country during the 1700s. The arrival of the ""Oschter Haws"" was considered ""childhood's greatest pleasure"" next to a visit from Christ-Kindel on Christmas Eve. The children believed that if they were good the ""Oschter Haws"" would lay a nest of colored eggs. \n\nThe children would build their nest in a secluded place in the home, the barn or the garden. Boys would use their caps and girls their bonnets to make the nests . The use of elaborate Easter baskets would come later as the tradition of the Easter bunny spread through out the country.\n\n\n""Oh! here comes Peter Cottontail, \nHoppin' down the bunny trail, \nHippity hoppity\nHappy Easter day"" \n\nTiff"

He predicted the coming of the Apocalypse to take place 13 years before or after the year 2000. Since it didn't happen in 1987, if Nostradamus is right, it will occur in 2013. It is said that this is NOT the end of the world, but the war that MIGHT end the world. The Apocalypse is said to bring (among other things) the resurrection of Kain, the second coming of Jesus Christ, and the return of Merlin.

"Oh, I totally know the answer to this one!  In 1 Peter 3:19, it says that he went to visit and teach the spirits that were in spirit ""prison.""  There are people that die here on Earth without the knowledge of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ or who were not baptized, etc.  They too are children on God and since God is not a partial God and ""does not esteem one flesh above another,"" He has prepared the way that all may be ""partakers of Salvation.""  In short, Christ went to the spirit world to visit the spirits who were in prison (1 Peter 4:6).\n\nIn trying to write my response, I realized that it could get kind of lengthy.

OK: multiple part answer for a multiple part question:\n1) where were they buried: this information is virtually impossible to come by in the UK apt from specialist Genealogical services (there is no central registry of burials)\n\n2)Death records are available from the Pyblic Records Office (google it) - but i think you have to wait 100 years before the information is released.\n\n3) Pauper's burials haven't existed in the UK since 1947 (the founding of the 'Welfare State')\n\n4) If you die in london and nobody claims your remains, you will probably be buried/cremated in London according to your will.

Honey, I'm sorry to write this but you aren't going to be able to change Mom at this point. Your mom has been favoring your sister over you probably since forever and it hasn't anything to do with birthdays or whatever you might attribute it to. It has to do with your mom. She's set in her ways. You don't say if your sister contributes to this fiasco or if she sympathizes with you. Either way, you're going to have to move on with your life...you can't find a new mom or a new sister...you have to discover what is best about YOU! You're at an age now where you deserve to think about yourself and stop comparing yourself, or allowing yourself to be compared to an older sister. \n\nFirstborns can sometimes be the favorites for obvious reasons: They were there first. Perhaps your mom resented giving birth a second time so quickly after the first. Who knows? You don't need to know what makes your mom do this. You can ask her if you want but she probably will deny it is happening, or she'll put you down describing why your sister is better than you. ENOUGH! Haven't you punished yourself enough? \n\nBe polite, but firm when dealing with your mom from now on. You maybe will have to distance yourself from her for awhile. That doesn't mean you can't send Mother's Day gifts and birthday cards...but until you get yourself together and stop being her doormat, you need to find somewhere else to celebrate holidays. I would also consider counseling for this, as a counselor might have more and better ideas on how to deal with your mom's and your relationship. And how to improve your much-battered self-esteem.\n\nI really feel bad for you. It's really a shame that after all these years she can't understand how much she hurts you.\n\nTake care of yourself.

Well, a whore is a woman who prostitutes herself for gain, like money or power. Babylon has always been the center of pagan beliefs like false gods. Babylon was also a city that was the head of a major, powerful kingdom.\n\nTaking these examples, the great whore of Babylon could be a religious system that has great power over many people. By centering that power, it holds sway over many, even political power. And it plays the whore by accepting different beliefs and customs in order to gain more power.\n\nI believe it will end up being a type of religious government that will dictate terms and conditions on how its people shall live.

"Tradition is a lame excuse to me as well. It is one of the reasons that I refuse to celebrate most holidays anymore. \n\nTake Christmas and Easter - both supposedly religeous holidays, but both have lost their meaning in American society - it is all about getting gifts...buying stuff and stimulating the economy. Hallmark has made a mockery of most holidays by inventing other holidays, just to sell more cards. \n\nTo me, tradition is only valuable if the meaning of what youre performing maintains its tradition. Doing something for the sake of tradition is lame, unless youre celebrating the original purpose... Even with Christmas, people might go to church that day when they dont go the rest of the year, but they are still missing out on the big picture.... \n\nThe term ""rule of thumb"" comes from the tradition of not being allowed to use a stick bigger than the thickness of your thumb to beat your wife with.

Yet, he goes on to say that what we have there is an \naccount of a ""repentant ex-prostitute"" who became a faithful follower of Jesus. If anyone's theology is dubious here it is Norman's. It is a fact that the Bible does not say that Mary Magdalene was ever a prostitute. I pointed this out in my essay. Yet, Norman can blatantly say that the Gospels portray her as a repentant ex-prostitute. Even as he is saying that ""there is no other source"" of knowledge about Mary Magdalene other than the Bible, he strongly asserts that she was an ex-prostitute even though that notion comes to us from extrabiblical noncanonical sources.\n\nRigorous scholarship reveals that there is no reference to Mary Magdalene as a prostitute at all in the Bible. If anything, ""dubious traditionalist theology"" has thought it important enough to label Mary Magdalene as a \nprostitute even though the Gospels do not say that. It is the traditionalist view that engages in much speculation about Mary Magdalene. It is kind of \namazing when you think of all the stories, homilies, and sermons that go on and on about Magdalene the ""penitent whore."" Most people think that this \ncomes from the Bible simply because it has been repeated so often.\n\nTraditionalist church historians have no problem believing sources outside of the Scriptures IF those sources do not challenge their own notions. For \nexample, most of them teach that Paul was beheaded by the Romans between 66-69 AD. They teach that Peter was crucified upside down. They teach that \nJohn lived to be 90 or 100 years old in exile. ALL of this information comes to us from noncanonical writings. And they are all probably true. However, noncanonical writings that challenge their own ideas are quickly and \nsummarily discredited and not even seriously discussed.\n\nMy point is that traditionalist scholars like Norman seem to believe that they are unbiased and objective while the scholars that they don't agree with are biased, slanted, and pushing an agenda with ulterior motives. In fact, we can see from Norman's statements that he seems to be pushing an agenda himself. He seems intent on perpetuating this image of Mary Magdalene \nas an ex-prostitute even though he knows that the Scripture says no such thing. And yet he says that this account comes from the Gospels!! He KNOWS \nthat the Bible says no such thing. Well, I'm assuming that he knows. If he doesn't, then he can't be much of a church historian.\n\nIt is ""dubious traditionalist theology"" that maintains that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute even though the Bible does not say that. It is the same ""dubious traditionalist theology"" that maintains that the Beloved Disciple is St. John even though the Bible does not say that either.\n\nThe traditionalist view(s) are NOT free of all bias. Therefore, it is fair to scrutinize widely held beliefs even if they have been believed for a long \ntime.\n\n\n\n\n1830 ~ 1912 \n\nby Patricia Chadwick\nwww.historyswomen.com \n\nThe name “Mary Magdalene” can evoke different images to various people. Many see her as a deranged woman suffering from being possessed by demons, while others view her as a fallen woman, even a prostitute. Although the Biblical record is not silent on the matter, we are only given a few details about the life of Mary Magdalene in the Bible - and you may be surprised what the Scripture do"

Man doesnt have the right. Anyone who has read the Bible knows that. Men like to change what it says to fit their personal beliefs or needs. Sure we dont have the actually scrolls that the authors in the Bible wrote on.

You can read it, then others and the scriptures dont even have the same meaning anymore. If You're searching for answers from God, and reading his word. Even if it is written in old english.

this is hard to answer and to be short about it. but God is a  holy God that can not the presence of sin. man is born with sin and needs to be cleaned of it to have a relationship with God. the only way to be cleansed of sin is blood. (the Passover story) since man could not pay his own sin debt He sent His Son to die a brutal and terrible death on the Cross. (psalm 22) from there faith takes over where a person needs to believe in Jesus for the payment of his debt. if a person does they are put in a right relationship with God. (john 3:16).as you can see (by the other answers) faith is a hard thing to have. hope this helps.

The book claims that Leonardo Da Vinci is one of the Grand Masters of the organization called Priory of Sion that protects the bloodline of Jesus and Mary Magdalene.

And it has no evidences to support its claims. \n\nTo understand more about Leonardo Da Vinci and how he was associated in the book, allow me to refer you to this site: http://www.jesusdecoded.com/leonardo1.php?page=100

With the rising cost of living, I would think that it would require more than that to at least provide the basic necessities of life for the average family (2 parents, and 2 children). I would think that it would have to be at least $60K, but I guess that also depends of geographical location, among other things...
it has for  me. E-Bay is a wonderful place to shop,I do my banking online. stores that have online websites,their goods are cheaper online than in the stores maybe because of shipping charges. I even buy movie tickets online.easier and I don;t have to stand in line at checkout registers and don't have to leave my house too

Because some people think the rights of the one are important.  It's called politically correct.  You can't even say Achilles Heel anymore without the Friends of Achilles group wanting to sue you.
Wow, I'd want to change almost everything... I'd want to change governments from screwing over their people, science to stop trying to prove peoples beliefs are wrong, schools to enforce discipline, society to stop being so damn ignorant and rude... I think I'd be happier on Mars to be honest!!!

"I realize that no one reads this when I just link to it, so here is my answer to a previous version of this question:\n\nI believe that I have been nothing but courteous to the people of faith here. I openly deny their belief-system. They openly deny mine. That's fine. We have, however, engaged in some very respectful debate, much to the benefit (I hope) of both sides. I know that my beliefs have not changed, but my preconceptions about young-Earth Christians have been shattered by some of the people I have found here. I think that they are wrong, but I am thrilled to have the opportunity to debate with them without resorting to name-calling or rudeness.\n\nGranted, this requires an openness on both our parts. I think that their faith is ""wrong."" They think that my lack of faith is ""wrong."" This is where most people get hung up and debate can go no further. If someone disagreeing with you is ""offensive,"" you're stuck. Once you accept this disagreement, you are quite free to exchange ideas. This is what I have found here (for the most part.)\n\nAs for why I spend so much time in the religion and spirituality forum, I see faith as playing a huge role in the lives of everyone in the world, be they moderate Muslims, fundamentalist Christians, Pagans, or Atheists like myself.\n\nIn my supposedly free country I see gays discriminated against due to faith. People who would never think of using the N-word openly hate and criticize homosexuals for what they are, not who they are. \n\nI see medical advances that could help millions of people stymied by arguments that have their basis in faith. Stem cell research could potentially ease the suffering of billions around the globe, but people of faith stand in the way.\n\nWe are currently involved in what may or may not be a holy war. This is an issue of faith.\n\nOur current government supports ""faith-based initiatives"" in what may be a breach of The Constitution itself.\n\nI know that faith helps people sleep at night. This doesn't undo the tremendous amount of suffering it has inflicted at every turn of history. \n\nI see faith as a problem, and would like to encourage people to put aside their myths and embrace reason. However, I realize that this is futile. As Jonathan Swift said, ""It is useless to attempt to reason a man out of a thing he was never reasoned into.""\n\nThat said, I think that Yahoo Answers provides a wonderful opportunity to try to see where other people are coming from. I disagree with the Christians (and Muslims and Pagans...), but I think it is very important for me to try to understand them. I would hope that they will try to understand me. Once we find some common ground and some mutual respect, we can truly start to talk about things.\n\nI hate the name-calling. The largest problem I have with religion is that it is divisive. I feel that this is the most important aspect of faith that needs to be removed from the equation. Name-calling is also divisive and does not fit into my attempts to act reasonably.\n\nI feel that I deny, but do not scoff. I embrace and enjoy open debate. I think that the things discussed here are important. I'd like to think that some of the things I have to say are pertinent. \n\nIf you want a place for only Christians (for example) to exchange ideas, there are plenty of places on the web for that. However, I think that this exclusion of other mindsets and worldviews does a disservice to those who would seek such a closed system.\n\nThat's why, as an atheist, I show up on the religion thread."

I'm great with kids, i used to work at a daycare centre and i had a great time and the kid felt at ease with me.\n\nMy thing was to have fun with and act silly with them which meant they didn't see me as an authority figure, I'd only discipline them if they did something really bad. Because they didn't fear me they knew they could approach me for anything whether they had injured themselves or had a cute story to tell.

I looked around on the web and found only nothing but the same ol' answers, stay away! As the old adage says ""If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is""! These guys must think people are idiots! Now days you can't be too carefull and this is just another reason why...I am not sure who to report it to but I am gonna find out...I hope they get busted and do alot of jail time..."
You have made several huge generalizations that make it seem like millions of people think exactly alike, which is far from the case.\n\nMost homosexuals want to be accepted just as much as any other group of people you can label.  But what most fight for is having the same rights under the law as others.  There is a huge distinction between the two.
happy birthday...they will eventually get over it.
"Wow...you folks sure can talk a lot for not knowing much about the LDS church. \n\nHere is the answer from a Mormon. It's not an official view from the LDS Church, but it's a lot closer than the bunk other people have been spouting off. \n\nDo Mormons think Catholics are the Antichrist? \nAbsolutely not! There is absolutely no LDS doctrine that labels ANY specific religion as ""the antichrist"". LDS doctrine teaches of acceptance and love towards members of other faith. \n\nHowever it is true that the LDS church makes the claim of being Christ's official church. That doesn't leave room for the other Christian denominations being ""official"" too. That doesn't mean that Mormons believe others to be ""evil"" or ""antichrists"" simply based on being a Catholic for instance."

No but there is a correlation between geographic location and religious preference.  You are more likely to keep the religion you were brainwashed into during childhood.
Of course - they make life most interesting as do most superstitions.  Life would be dull without the fantastic and supernatural.  Think about life if it were only the average person's reality.

in about 326a.C. Santa Helen started a visit to Holy Lands so as to find the Cross. \n\nShe knew that after His death, Romans took the cross and threw it to the garbage.  She went there and tried to find the place that they threw it. \nThen she saw a plant which she recognized as a Holy plant and a statue of Aphrodite(usually when they wanted to hide something from Christians they were building a statue of a God). She told the workers to search there. And she found it. They understood that it was the Holy Cross because they touched a woman that just died that time and she aroused.\nI think that the biggest part of the cross is in mount Athos in Greece.\nWe celebrate in Orthodox Christianity this event on May 21st.
It's not that most people don't care about anything.  It's that they only care about themselves.  Being solely focused on oneself makes it impossible to see that ones actions have any effect on other people.  Basically, unless they need something from someone they don't exist.  Not a very nice way to live!
"This is based on the assumption that only whites can be racists. But you don't have to be white to be racist. If someone thinks you're racist just because you're proud to be white, then they are the ones who are ignorant. It's ok for any person to be proud of their race and culture, as long as you don't fall into the trap of thinking your race is better than any other. \n\nThe majority of Americans are white. The majority of people you see on television and in the movies here are white. That's the reason why there are institutions in place for minorities (such as BET, NAACP). These organizations exist to bring a sense of equality to the racial structure of America. It's sort of the minorities way of saying ""hey we're here too."" But please try not to take it as reverse racism because it isn't."

I just asked this question a little while ago.  I read them if they are interesting or about a subject that I'm interested in, but if it has long biblical quotes, I usually skip them.  I skip a lot of them that compare the Bible to the Qu'ran, too.  Not for any religions reason, I just feel like they are trying to start a fight.

"no,at all!\nfor your answer,Jesus in Islam actually is just like our messenger - Muhammad - Jesus in Koran actually are Isa called al-masih.\n \n[45] Behold! the angels said: ""O Maryam!

As a follower of Jesus Christ, God has equipped you with everything you need to tell others, even those who don't believe, about Him. Just make sure you saturate your friends in prayer and ask God for the words to say. Give God more credit! He is living in you and He will provide the words for your friends to hear. You have every right to be scared of saying the wrong thing because your words wont work. In fact, the words that get through to them won't be YOUR words, they will be His through your mouth! How exciting! Be encouraged, I will be praying for you and your friends!
"i teach english as a second language.  I have done so for years and in several countries.  I dont think that we should pick these words apart to decide what it means.  Look at the situations that native speakers use phrase.  what are they're feelings when they say it.  In my experience people say this to people they care about.  They want this person to be happy and enjoy their life.  maybe they feel they work too much.\nor, it is often the case that they want that person to go out that day.  when the reply is, "" i cant, im busy"" one often hears, ""you work too hard"".\nbut really, it is mostly said as a parting line....another way to say goodbye.  like take it easy"
"Great question.  My short answer is ""no, not entirely.""\n\nLove is never purely emotion.  Love is a verb.  It's what we do.  Love is also never completely without emotion.  If you look at the context of the verse, this is from the sermon on the mount and follows the beattitudes.  \n\nJust before verse 44, Jesus tells them to turn the other cheek.  I think this is one of those verses that people agonize over because they worry that they can't/don't feel like they should about enemies or bullies in their lives.\n\nThink about how Jesus practially lived that out.  He was respectful of the Jewish leadership even though He is the Son of God.  They should have worshipped Him.  They should have followed Him.  But insofar as it was God's will, He submitted to their authority.  He tried to teach them and reason with them, even though they used those occaisions to try and entrap Him.  He was loving to His enemies.\n\nHe was rough with them at times.  Matthew 23:27-37\n“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men’s bones and all uncleanness. Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.\n“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous, and say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.’\n“Therefore you are witnesses against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers’ guilt. Serpents, brood of vipers! How can you escape the condemnation of hell? Therefore, indeed, I send you prophets, wise men, and scribes: some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city, that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. Assuredly, I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.\n“O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!\n\nNot pretty.  But they were blasphemous and deserved death, yet He taught them instead.  Sought to reach them.  It wasn't warm and fuzzy, but it was loving.  He longed to gather them like a hen gathers her chicks.  But they were not willing.\n\nIn the end, for love to be fulfilled, it must be returned.  Mutual.\n\nOur job is to behave in a loving way toward them, whether they deserve it or not.  I don't think that means trying to win their love or affection.  It's not trying to please or appease them.  But it is feeding them when they are hungry, clothing them when they are without.  Comforting them when they are in anguish.\n\nI think it's wrong to be kind to an enemy as a punishment.  Some people get a litte too happy about ""heaping coals of fire upon their heads.""  I think what that refers to is if you are kind in response to unkindness, it should hurt the other person's conscience.  It should make them rethink their behavior.  It's not that you are kind to others to ensure their punishment. \n\nIn the end, God wants salvation for everyone.  If my kindness in the face of enmity can cause someone to draw closer to God, it's worth it to be kind.  My kindness is born out of the realization that their soul is valuable and endangered. Not with me, but with God.\n\nYou love what you care for.  I believe we can love our enemies by helpful actions.  Our minds control those actions.  It's a decision more than a feeling.  I believe that we can grow to have loving feel"
Show responsible, adult behavior. Do your homework and attend classes regularly. Get good grades in school. Help out around the house without being asked or told to do it. When they want you to be home by a certain time, be home a few minutes before rather than a few minutes after that time. When you go out tell them where you are going, who you are with, what you will be doing and how long you expect to be. If plans change, contact them and update them on the situation.
You can wear what ever you want but some nice casual clothing would be best  Many people will be wearing jeans evern though it is at night but I would wear something a bit more dressy than jeans to a Friday evening performance.  I have seen the show and it is pretty good yu should have a good time.  One bit of advice  Don't go walking in Central Park after dark.  We always read about some poor tourist who did that and we always shake our heads.  The only people in Central Park after dark are criminals and victims and a few scattered homless people now  the weather is getting nice.  Have a good time
If you want to become a Catholic, you must receive the Sacraments of Initiation. Baptism is the first. Once you are Baptized, Original Sin and all sins you've committed up until the Baptism are washed away. For all practical purposes, you will be a Catholic. However, your initiation is not yet complete. You must then receive the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharest; the Body and Blood of Christ in the appearance of bread and wine. From here, your next, and final step will be to receive the Sacrament of Confirmation. You will also want to consider receiving the Sacrament of Penance on, at least, an annual basis; certainly just prior to receiving one of the previously mentioned Sacraments.\n\nYou will want to check with your local Catholic parish, or maybe your Diocese. They will be able to give you the details for Catholic initiation.\n\nI find it strange that both your parents are/were Catholic but did not see to it that you already receive the sacraments of initiation. Depending on how much, or how little, formal religious education you may or may not have already received, you may need to study up on the faith so you are aware of the basics in time for receiving Sacraments.

they got invented as the first names became more used and used.

There was also variants used such as in wales 'Evans' 'Ivan' means john and in other parts of europe 'john' is 'hans' and 'heinz'.

The language Mizo is in the Tibeto-Burman branch of the Sino-Tibetan family.  It is a very distant relative of Chinese, closer to Burmese and Tibetan.  Most of its closest relatives are various dialects of Chin, spoken primarily in Myanmar (formerly Burma).
Christianity is the fastest decling religion.  U are right, EUrope's population is declining because every woman is giving birth to 1.3 kids in average.  And there population is decreasing.  \n\nSecondly, Christians are converting into Atheism, Agnostic, and Islam.  If population is the main cause for the decline of Christianity in Europe, then Islam and Athiesm is the cause for its decline in North America.\n\nCanada for example was 90% Christian, and now recent study say that 60-70% are Christians.  In Toronto there is a mosque in which christians convert to Islam daily.
I'd be one of the following:\n\n1. A Healer\n2. An Inventor\n3. A Guardian Angel-type Hero\n\n1. It'd be a wonderful thing to be able to help all those people who are sick and without hope - especially in third world countries and in disaster zones...\n2. It'd be wonderful to be able to invent the car that runs on water - or make cold fusion work - or create some invention that reverses all sorts of pollution...\n3. If I couldn't do either of the first two, I'd want to go around and anonymously do good deeds - you know, magically set the homeless up with job skills and job to match so they can help themselves up... or magically castrate child molesters and rapists... good deeds like that. :)

I'm not talking about showing up with a box of donuts, or making one call, I'm talking about putting down what they are doing and spending some time working the phone to solve a problem for you? No, they don't.\n\nIn a meeting with you, do they spend time to teach you anything that they know? Or, do they say to you, ""very interesting what you've come up with, tell me more"" and after an hour, you've done all the talking, you now have more action items, and now they know what you know, and you have done all the work.\n\nOther people just ""like"" them, and they take advantage of it.\n\nThere was an interesting article in the newspaper a few months back, about the tendency of (and these are official psychological disorders) Narcissists and Antisocials (formerly called psychopaths or sociopaths) to rise to the top of organizations.

BINGO! Yes, America fits the description of the Prostitute of Babylon to a T.\n\nShe is hated by the world, including our Allies (Canada, France, and more) - The Muslims in many of these countries desire to burn America with fire (bombs, nuclear weapons, etc)\n\nAmerica is THE Epicenter of the global economy, with the United Nations and World Bank - you name it - situated in New York....\n\nShe flaunts her wealth and status of power like a brazen prostitute showing off her shame to gain attention .., many nations are corrupted by her and through her... many religions flows through her and if God viewed the Jews as prostitutes when ever they strayed to other religions - how much more does God consider a gentile nation who once embraced Christianity, then shoved God out the door for other pagan beliefs (Islam, Wicca, New age and on and on). America is  the safe-haven for every conceivable religion and evil there is.

Because if they lie to you once, chances are they'll lie to you again.

Yep....here ya go...
There are priests that like little boys because they know they cant get away with being gay with men their own age.\n\nIts a sin, but there are more people in church who are beyond help than those who are honestly religious.

"This is like asking, ""What does blue smell like?"" Blue is not in the category of things that have odor, so the question itself is flawed. In the same way, God is not in the category of things that are created, or come into existence, or are caused. God is uncaused and uncreated - He simply exists.  How do we know this? Well, we know that from nothing, nothing comes. So if there was ever a time when there was absolutely nothing in existence then nothing would have ever come to exist. But things do exist. Therefore, since there could never have been absolutely nothing, something had to have always been existing. That ever-existing thing is what we call God."

It will not be like most people believe. I think that many will be surprised to say the least. I think Hell will be living with the choices you made that prevent you from being in Gods presence and with your loved ones and the ones you care the most about. (REGRETS) Heaven will be a place of rest and continued learning.\nI lost my daughter and the pain of not having her in my life is horrible. I can't imagine spending eternity without her. See I know that with death I will see her again. The pain that I endure now will end with my death if I live the way I should and apply the atoning power of Jesus Christ into my life I can be forgiven and be with her and God again. To me that is what hell will be like. Being separated from all the ones we care about. and never at that point being able to change it.

Your wife has low self-esteem and keeps them as a moral booster when she needs them.  Demanding that she throw them out would only cause more friction.  But, to be warned, she does have a very high probability of cheating on you to make herself feel more complete.  You need to reassure her that she is a complete woman (to not only you, but herself) and that she is everything that she needs to be.  Moreover, she needs to come to the conclusion that those pictures need to go.  That part of her life is over and she needs to move on.  But that choice must be hers or it will come back in a vicious way.

"Yes.\nAhmadi Muslim (about 200 million worldwide) believe that Jesus was a humanbeing, a prophet of God Almighty. lived a human life ,died a human death inKashmir India where he tarried in search of the "" lost sheep of the Tribes of Israel.""\nJesus Son of Mary: Islamic Beliefs\nHis Virgin Birth \nMessenger to Israelites \nProphet of God \nMiracles of Jesus \nSurvival from Crucifixion \nMigration to India \nNatural Death \nJesus in Islam\nIslam is a religion which requires belief in not only the Prophethood of Muhammad but all the prophets of God, including Jesus (Qur'an 2:137).\nThe Holy book of Islam, the Quran, relates in detail the story of Jesus, including his birth, mission as a Prophet to the Israelites, and his crucifixion. Muslims believe that this story is in harmony with the Bible too. Indeed, a whole chapter in the Qur'an is named after the mother of Jesus (Chapter 19 - Maryam).\n\nBirth of Jesus\nIn Islam, Mary is described as a pious and righteous woman who symbolizes righteous believers blessed with Divine inspiration. Islam then affirms the fatherless birth of Jesus and rejects outright the opposing claim that his birth was illegitimate. \n\nWhereas, Islam recognizes the virgin birth of Jesus as a miraculous event, it does not consider it unnatural; the laws of nature are never broken. It just reflects the inability of man to fully understand the science behind various phenomena observed in nature. Numerous scientists have explained the virgin births. \n\nIn Islam, the immaculate conception of Jesus is not interpreted to mean that he was in some way a Divine Being. He was still a human being (Qur'an 19:31). \n\nDivinity of Jesus\nIslam presents Jesus as a human who believed in the absolute Unity and Indivisibility of God (Qur'an 3:52). \n\nMuslims consider the doctrine of Divinity of Jesus and Trinity as later changes to the teachings of Jesus. The New Testament itself furnishes abundant evidence to show that Jesus was only a human being whom God chose for the reformation of His people, and repeatedly contradicts the Divinity of Jesus. Jesus always referred to himself as having been sent by God (John 17:3) and his followers, too, considered him a man approved by God (Qur'an 19:37; Acts 2:22, John 3:2). \n\nHe was undoubtedly called the son of God, but this title has only been employed metaphorically and in fact is used for all the chosen ones of God (Matt 5:9, Exodus 4:22). The literal connotation of 'son of God' as a Divine Being and hence the subsequent development of Trinity Dogma was the result of Hellenistic influences on Christianity as it spread in the Gentile world. The Semitic usage of 'son of God' was misunderstood and forgotten and disputes about the exact status of Jesus erupted, as recorded in the early Church history. \n\nJesus prayed to God like all other God-fearing individuals (Luke 5:16), and engaged in spiritual exercises such as fasting (Matt 4:2). Furthermore, Jesus lacked knowledge of the future (Mark 13:32), as only the Divine Being possesses perfect and complete knowledge. \n\nMission of Jesus\nThe mission of Jesus was confined to the Children of Israel (Qur'an 3:50, Matt. 10:5-6; 15:24). He was commissioned by God to revive the true spirit of the Torah in the hearts of the Israelites and clear any misunderstandings about the Law. He purified and revitalized Judaism. As Jesus was a follower of Moses, he did not change or reject the Mosaic Law. He had come to fulfill the Law (Matt 5:17). \n\nMiracles of Jesus\nThe Holy Qur'an mentions several miracles of Jesus, including his ability to create birds, his ability to cure the leprous and the blind, and raising the dead to life. The ability to create birds is a metaphor meaning ordinary people who accepted the teachings of Jesus were spiritually transformed into birds soaring high into the lofty regions of the spiritual firmament above all worldly concerns. The healing powers can also be un"
That's not a very loving thing to say. You might not agree with them, but worse things have happened.
I don't know why, but I think of big hoop earrings.
the church will try to keep this hid everyone here knows about how they do yes you are right both knew better and where he repersents the church it really makes them look very bad and as for her at her age she might be your sister but to have .4. children she knew better as well you can bet that .sorry to hear what happened and from what i read no wonder the children wanted to stay with there father .being a mother as well a wife she forgot her place as a mother , the sad thing here is that the children had to suffer over what she as well as this missionary had done i truley feel sorry for the children as for her she made her bed , now she has to lay in it as for this missionary she was well in my opion looking at age difference just easy , yes both need to be ashamed but you can bet that the mormon church wont do nothing about him sad to say in my opion both are as low as they come her as well as there missionary. that is what makes the mormon church look bad nothing ever done but you can bet he aint the first missionary that has done this and went home like nothin ever happened in time in my opion on his part he will reap what he has sown sorry for the children as for what they have went throught as for you sister i am not and there father i am sorry he will find a woman who has something she lacked[morals]. very sicking on the .3. of them as well the mormon church as well at least the atholic church would have done something but the mormon church what a joke. read below what i am typing . www.nomanknowsmystory.com  www.exmormonnomore.com  www.packmanteleport.com. based on fact. teachings of the church as well doctorines as well based on fact?
Part of being Christlike is glorifying God.  So in that respect, no.\n\nChristianity contains moral instruction, but that's not all there is to it.  The most important aspect is having the heart and mind of Christ.  Someone Who was not just morally good, but involved in the help and growth of others (in a respectful way).\n\nI think it's relatively easy to be a good person just for the sake of being good if you were raised to think that way, or predisposed (personality wise) to be that way.\n\nIt's hard to get people who come from abusive or neglectful backgrounds to turn themselves around.  \n\nThink about the people Jesus hung out with and influenced.  They were not the people who had it all together or made the best choices.  Most were caught in sin and knew they were.  Those are the ones He came to heal and set free.\n\nFrom what I can glean from the answers I've read on the site, most atheists don't feel a need to be set free from anything, because they feel they are living good moral lives on their own.\n\nChristianity still is for, and appeals to, those of us who know we have a need for God.  Through Christianity we have the means to overcome hurts, neglect and addictions and as we mature, we are obligated and enabled to help others in need.\n\nI'm not saying that atheists never get in helping professions, but Christians are devoted to freely giving as we have been given no matter what career we choose.  I realize it doesn't always happen, but as we heal, we are to help others heal.\n\nIs it true that some people come to Christ and find that the healing process is too hard?  Sure.  Do some become interested in changing others before they've made the necessary changes in themselves?  Absolutely.  But misuse of any discipline is not proof that the discipline itself is flawed.
because the pig male society has put so much meaning to being blond and skinny with big knockers that women have this weird competitive thing going on. Im glad to be a lesbian and not have that hanging over my head as an expectation, but, even with lesbians, its like this. Its the unrealistic expectations that the male society has placed on females.
Do you know what it took to even ask the question? You have a physical machine called a body that is able to use its mind to ponder the question, relay visual information from a physical world of comparable low-tech computers through the optic nerve, into the brain, with the mind to comprehend the ramifications, then transfer that thought process to an incredibly complex systems of nerves, tendons, and touch to the fingers to type the letters. This then communicates a question of the soul. The soul is something that science cannot a.) explain and b.) create. It can only mimic with unsatisfactory results. That soul is concerned for the existence of an eternal destiny beyond time and space--that there is a world beyond the physical world we see in the here and now. You are an incredible creation who has been given the free will choice to believe, or not believe. A being that can love, write poetry, paint or play works of incredible complexity and beauty. To smell, and taste, enjoy. So, like you, I set out on a path to find my Creator. It is obvious that He exists, but is He personal or an impersonal force? My answer came through the study of prophecy in the Bible. Like the DNA strand and life itself, it was hard to dispute the evidence. Now with the realization of the truth of the Bible, God made it clear that He was not only a personal God, but One who wanted to know ME, and that He knew everything about me--even the number of every hair on my head.\n\nEphesians 3\nFor this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and depth and height-- to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.

"This is my opinion based on my 3 experiences:  \n\n1st time - a baby, sprinkled, don't remember.  \n\n2nd time - an adult, immersion in the name of the Father, Son & Holy Ghost, nice.  \n\n3rd time - adult, immersion in the name of JESUS,  Wow!, Wow! & Wow!  I saw a White Light, thought I had died and was going to Heaven.  Heard the pastor say, ""I need help up here, I can't get her out!""  (I'm a little woman, 130 #.)  I thought the pastor was a paramedic trying to save my life, and I kept trying to tell him to let me die, because it was so beautiful.  But he and 2 other men got me to my feet, and I was filled with the Holy Spirit and began talking in tongues.  Since then, I have experienced a ""peace which passes all understanding.""  \n\nMay GOD bless you this Sunday, and your joy be full."
James is defending the truth of justification by faith against those who say that all you need to do is merely believe or say  you believe. His point is that you are not saved by a dead faith. A true living faith changes a person and you can see it in them. Someone who says they have faith but has no fruit most likely has no faith at all.

I don't feel angels in a physical sense like you do.  I feel them in a spiritual sense,  such as knowing my deceased mother is present - constantly.  She's always with me.\n\nI also experience angels by being one with acts of kindness.  I don't label myself and an angel.  I use instinct in dealing with people who are in distress - many times helping strangers.  \n\nI have also experienced angels when friends or strangers have helped me. Once, while driving an hour from home in an isolated area,  a man in another car flagged me down. I stopped. When he approached my car,  he apologized because he thought I was his wife who drove the same model and color of car as me.  He thought it was she he was trying to stop.  As he was walking back to his car, he stopped by my front  and took a look.  He came back and told me it was in shreds and that it needed immediate attention.  He said that it could blow at any minute and possibly cause an accident.  He then told me where the next service stations was where I could buy a new tire - sveral miles down the same road.  I drove carefully to the service station where I purchased new a tire and had the shredded tire replaced.  I was relieved.  I'm grateful for this man.  He may have saved my life.  I'll never forget him - a true angel and example of how angels have touched me.

"Easter falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon after the vernal equinox (or autumnal equinox if you live in the Southern Hemisphere).  That's why it's called ""a moveable feast.""  It's a combination of Catholic (Sunday) and pagen (equinox, full moon) symbols. \n\nFather's Day and Mother's Day are determined by whoever makes them up.  Mother's Day was created by a woman to honor her mother.

I totally agree. Children today can be rude and intimidating. I'm only 24, but things are really different now to when I was a kid.\nFor a start, there was no way that my parents would ever think of taking my side over a teacher's if I got into trouble - let alone consider taking the school to court!\nKids today think that there is no comeuppance for bad behaviour, and they're totally right. A teacher who defends themself against a child may well get arrested and fired for assault. A parent who smacks their child can end up in prison.\nAlso, loads of kids have absent parents, or parents who don't really give a damn about them providing that they're out of their hair. When you add this to the fact that millions of kids, boys in particular, grow up with no male role model whatsoever so have no idea what good behaviour should look like, it's easy to see why things are so horrible these days.\nI think that the issue is that people are always so quick to look to the schools or the government to solve their problems - in fact, most of these things could be solved by a bit of decent parenting, a little less bloody liberalism and a return to (mild) corporal punishment at home and at school.\n... I'll get off my soap box now!
Why  don't you try posting the question with some proper English?
Noah and Moses were faithful servants of God just like we should be. They don't deserve to be worshipped anymore than we do. Jesus humbled himself by getting off the throne of \nGod to atone for our sins so that we could go to heaven. He died in my place and yours so that we could have eternal life in heaven. He did the work. All we have to do is accept Him as our Lord and Savior. We should attempt to be (with the Holy Spirits help) faithful servants just like Noah and Moses were. But our model should not be Noah or Moses. Our model is Jesus.

Look for the gifts it brings. Everything either teaches you a lesson, makes you stronger, or brings you closer to your true path in life. If you look back over your life, you'll usually be able to see that, without adversity, you would have missed out on a lot of fabulous experiences and you would not be the person you are today.

Try thinking differently on this subject. Think of the person you call enemy as someone whose intentions you dont yet understand, and think of negative thoughts as choices arising from mental confusion about your own intentions. You and I and everyone else, there are no enemies, only misinterpretation, so if you find yourself hating something, like a thought, or someone, like the person on the street with the exact opposite attitude toward life, attempt to determine why you could possibly be choosing these thoughts, or look at it from their point of view, and one of 2 things will happen:\n1) you'll stay there dumbfounded, working really hard at trying to determine first cause and fail, and by that time the stimulus that prompted such hate will have passed, or\n2) you'll work out how you/they came to such a conclusion, and correct your attitude/thought pattern or see the person as someone who is an individual, with different dreams, goals and aspirations in life that are taking them down a road of choices and consequences that would seem unconscionable from your point of view. This mindset, when used will open doors for you, as you begin to see people as friends that before you would have labeled enemies. Even your inner enemy will be silenced by the power of your intention.

An EXCELLENT question...\n\nConsidering current circumstances, I think having any more than two children is self-destructive, in both the personal sense (raising children isn’t easy) and in consideration of humans as a species.\n\nWe, as humans, have VASTLY overpopulated the earth to a dangerous extent. Through doing so, not only have we driven exponentially more animals to extinction than any other natural cause combined, but we are also driving OURSELVES to extinction by depleting our habitat - the entire planet - of natural resources and polluting the ones we do have. We all complain about death rates, but somehow our birth rates STILL exceed them. We complain about lack of food, shelter, necessities; we overcrowd our adoption centers and foster care systems with unwanted children or children of parents whom are unable to properly provide for them; and yet, if we were to STOP HAVING SO MANY CHILDREN these tragedies would slowly decrease and diminish all on their own.\n\nBy having more than two children, you are furthering the suffering of our species as a whole in lieu of your own selfish desire for more children. Only have as many children as will replace you and your partner when the TWO of you perish. After that, you are only contributing to the self-destruction of our species.

"TRINITY IN THE BIBLE \n\nReferences in the Bible to a Trinity of divine beings are vague, at best. \n\nIn Matthew 28:19, we find Jesus telling his disciples to go out and \npreach to all nations. While the ""Great Commission"" does make mention of the three persons who later become components of the Trinity, the phrase \n""...baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the \nHoly Ghost"" is quite clearly an addition to Biblical text - that is, not \nthe actual words of Jesus - as can be seen by two factors: \n\n1) Baptism in the early Church, as discussed by Paul in his letters, was \ndone only in the name of Jesus; and \n\n2) The ""Great Commission"" was found in the first gospel written, that of \nMark, bears no mention of Father, Son and/or Holy Ghost - see Mark 16:15. \n\nThe only other reference in the Bible to a Trinity can be found in the \nEpistle of I John 5:7, Biblical scholars of today, however, have admitted \nthat the phrase ""...there are three that bear record in heaven, the \nFather, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one"" is definitely a ""later addition"" to Biblical test, and it is not found in any of today's versions of the Bible. \n\nIt can, therefore, be seen that the concept of a Trinity of divine beings \nwas not an idea put forth by Jesus or any other prophet of God. This \ndoctrine, now subscribed to by Christians all over the world, is entirely \nman-made in origin. \n\nTHE DOCTRINE TAKES SHAPE \n\nWhile Paul of Tarsus, the man who could rightfully be considered the true \nfounder of Christianity, did formulate many of its doctrines, that of the \nTrinity was not among them. He did, however, lay the groundwork for such when he put forth the idea of Jesus being a ""divine Son."" After all, a \nSon does need a Father, and what about a vehicle for God's revelations to \nman? \n\nIn essence, Paul named the principal players, but it was the later Church \npeople who put the matter together. \n\nTertullian, a lawyer and presbyter of the third century Church in \nCarthage, was the first to use the word ""Trinity"" when he put forth the theory that the Son and the Spirit participate in the being of God, but all are of one being of substance with the Father. \n\nA FORMAL DOCTRINE IS DRAWN UP \n\nWhen controversy over the matter of the Trinity blew up in 318 between \ntwo church men from Alexandria - Arius, the deacon, and Alexander, his bishop - Emperor Constantine stepped into the fray. \n\nAlthough Christian dogma was a complete mystery to him, he did realize \nthat a unified church was necessary for a strong kingdom. When negotiation failed to settle the dispute, Constantine called for the first ecumenical council in Church history in order to settle the matter once and for all. \n\nSix weeks after the 300 bishops first gathered at Nicea in 325, the \ndoctrine of the Trinity was hammered out. The God of the Christians was \nnow seen as having three essences, or natures, in the form of the Father, \nthe Son, and the Holy Spirit. \n\nTHE CHURCH PUTS ITS FOOT DOWN \n\nThe matter was far from settled, however, despite high hopes for such on \nthe part of Constantine. Arius and the new bishop of Alexandria, a man \nnamed Athanasius, began arguing over the matter even as the Nicene Creed was being signed; ""Arianism"" became a catch-word from that time onward for anyone who did not hold to the doctrine of the Trinity. \n\nIt wasn't until 451, at the Council of Chalcedon that, with the approval \nof the Pope, the Nicene/Constantinople Creed was set as authoritative. \nDebate on the matter was no longer tolerated; to speak out against the Trinity was now considered blasphemy, and such earned stiff sentences that ranged from mutilation to death. Christians now turned on Christians, maiming and slaughtering thousands because of a difference of opinion. \n\nDEBATE CONTINUES \n\nBrutal punishments and even "
"In Romans 1:20, Paul says ""For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made.""\n\nI take this to mean that, if you aren't given the opportunity to learn about Jesus and what God did through him, you can still be saved if you pursue God in the best way you know him. So, the proverbial person in Africa who worships God as he is seen through nature, but never learns about Jesus can still be saved.\n\nBasically, I think God in his infinite wisdom and justice, has a formula that's a bit more complicated than the version explicitly laid out in the Bible (just as I don't believe Hell really is a bit fiery furnace), though I do think those who do learn about Christianity and then still scorn God's offer are setting themselves up for a fall."
I am the same. Its ok you only need to know the really wonderful words. You can teach him english, but really you can understand each other without speaking, i had a friend that was mexican and when i started talking to him he didnt understand one word of english but he just copied what i said. We mostly talked over the internet cause he couldnt speak english and now he speaks it better then i do.\n\nJust learn a few words a day, you can learn spanish as he learns english...\n\nSpanish .. romantic ... makes you melt.. or keep it the way it is and let your heart melt every time you hear a few words that you understand... \n\nIf you learn spanish ... will it take away from the special words he tells you .... \n\ni say let him learn english !!
When Jesus saved my soul, He made me a new person. One who wants to serve him, and live my life pleasing to Him. I seek the Lord for the will of my life. I now go to church, pray, and read my Bible. When God saved me, he put a new song in my heart. I put my Faith and Trust in Him. I no longer enjoy sin, or being around it. God made me complete, and gave me something to live for.
"my thoughts and prayers are with you and yours. i kow how hare it is, may 31 will be the one year anniversry of loosing my infant son. it will eventually get easier, just remember that she is in a better place and with our father. don't try to force her daughter to go. she is still greving in her own way. i also have a daughter, almost 5, she still talks about ""her"" baby all the time."
Why do you think?!  Use your head and think!  They got tired of being beaten, raped, worked to death and having their families ripped apart!
They have morals.  Everyone does. They are just lost on their journey as you and I once were at that age. We all find our way, eventually.

They are called floaters. I have them also. Floaters are the small spots you may occasionally see in your field of vision. The medical name for floaters is muscae volitantes. Floaters can be seen in many different forms, including dots, threads, or cobwebs. Floaters may seem to dart away when you try to look at them.Most spots and eye floaters are merely annoying but harmless when they temporarily enter the field of vision, and many fade over time. People sometimes are interested in surgery to remove floaters, but doctors are willing to perform such surgery only in rare instances.\n\nIf you suddenly see new floaters, or eye floaters accompanied by flashes of light or peripheral vision loss, it could indicate serious conditions such as diabetic retinopathy; vascular abnormalities such as retinal hemorrhages or carotid artery disease, or the beginning of a retinal detachment. The retina can tear if the shrinking vitreous gel pulls away from the wall of the eye. This sometimes causes a small amount of bleeding in the eye that may appear as new floaters. You should see your eye doctor immediately.
the speaking of tongues and other miracles that the apostles did back then, according to Acts, chapter 1 and on...was going to be cut off, no more of that...so if today someone speaks in tongues, and argues to have the holy spirit of God, Is really a Demons what he or she has in it...so be carefull and get away from it...
get back in the real world...
Accept Jesus as your savior.  Be baptized and receive the sacraments.
that is a dumb and ignorant question to ask
I think they get it. they get all our money and all the power and they get that people have been lying to each other for so long and there are so many countries that are alies that arent really and countries that owe countries that they just know how to play the game. they just dont know that all games eventually end.
Not sure what you're looking for here, but leadership comes from acquiring skills that allow you to guide others in positive directions, delegate, draw out the strengths of others, etc.  There are many good books available on leadership - try a book search and see what you come up with.

So can I be sorry and not belive?  Thats BS.\n\nIn defince to christians, justice is objective.  That is why so many people flipout over a judges virdicts.  And in japan it use to be common practice for a one man to serve anothers sentence.  Also think about the wipping boys from old Europe.
I would be if I were not saved. But me, no, I have repented of my sins, been baptized in Jesus' Name and have the Holy Ghost.  I plan to hold on to the Lord until the end and there will be no hell fire for me.

"Our society is . . . .\n\nundergoing such dramatic changes that for most of us the only pattern evident is total chaos.  Values that stood up for thousands of years mean nothing.  Culture that once seemed to evoke pictures of intelligence, compelling emotions and meaningfully poignant communication have been replaced by 'art' forms such as 'hip hop' and various apparently demonically-inspired forms of modern 'art' that seem to speak only to decay and irrationality.\n\nAnd yet, there has been greater scientific, medical, and practical technological advances in the last two hundreds years than in all mankind's previous almost three million years of evolution.  While much has been lost, much has been gained.  Slavery has disappeared 99.9% from the planet.  Women are gaining a larger measure of respect and 'equality' that previous times never allowed.  One man with right on his side inspired a virtually peaceful revolution that granted his country freedom from a tyranical colonizer; another man, inspired by the first, led a movement for freedom and equality within our own feudalistic southern states and further across the nation.  Mega-tyrannical oppressors and symbols like the Warsaw Pact and the Berlin Wall have fallen.  All is not perfect, but much has been gained.  Our society is in transition and whenever I have doubts about its direction I read ""I Pencil"" (see below)."
Nice thought, look at some of the answers here and you will see why it isn't happening.  The diversity of belief systems in this world will prevent it.  Plus some of us don't believe in the god of Christianity or Islam.  There are religions trying that and failing miserably.  It's a pipe dream and never going to happen.

Most Republicans are already Christian in their practiced religion.

In the Episcopal church, they have a retirement plan that they contribute to, just like a corporate manager.  They negotiate the details of this plan during the process in which a parish search committee hires a priest. In other respects they are like any employee, paying ss and disability taxes with the rest of us, and drawing social sec. upon retirement.\n\nI believe that Catholics have a centrally administered retirement system, since (I think) priests are assigned by the diocese.\n\nJust a wild guess, but I think the other protestant demonimations follow the same kind of strategy as the Episcopals.  \n\nChurch of England (Anglican) I have no idea.  At one time the priest was a government employee, of sorts.  Now, I don't know.
"Science_rebel said in response to a question:\nThe Persian Empire was a series of historical empires that ruled over the Iranian plateau. The political entity which was ruled by these kingdoms is the country now known as Iran (literally ""Land of Aryans""). Generally, the earliest entity considered a part of the Persian Empire is Persia's Achaemenid dynasty (648–330 BC), a united Aryan-indigenous kingdom that originated in the region now known as Fars and was formed under Cyrus the Great. Successive states in Iran prior to 1935 are collectively called the Persian Empire by Western historians"

As of now, we can not really prove whether they exist or not, but if you are talking about religion, then I would say yes. Religion and Belief is not something you need to prove, if it is proven, it becomes fact, therefore we must believe there is such thing as a soul. Souls probably do not have a shape, as God is all around, yet we can not see him as a solid shape. Like the Bible, God appears as a bright light, burning bush...

"I think that people sometimes ask for ""Christians only"" (or whatever group they're appealing to for answers) because they want responses from people who may be knowledgeable about the topic at hand from an insider's perspective. For instance, I've noticed that when people ask questions about Scientology, Satanism, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, or Jehovah's Witnesses, many rude remarks are made by those not involved in the organization. So they might say ""Jehovah's Witnesses ONLY"" to try to get an answer from someone who understands the theological issues unique to their belief system. Or if someone's contemplating a religious conversion, they might want information from someone who's actually a member of that particular belief group, not some outsider who's just engaging in idle speculation. \n\nHaving said that, though, diversity is pretty interesting, and the wide array of responses on this site is part of what keeps me coming back."

war is a fault of man, He gave man freewill.  natural disasters, on the other hand, are just that: natural.  God created everything, and set the world into motion.  at first everything was perfect, but after the flood, the entire surface of the earth changed.  the earth has been following the second law of thermodynamics, in that it is going from order to disorder.  \nanother thought is the thought that God was serious when He said that if we don't worship Him, the rocks will cry out in our place.

"That depends on your meaning;\n\nAs comedy through the ages and more often comedians of this age have shown us, mocking others is the core of how they make their living.  However, most nowadays preface their comments or follow-up by saying they really like ""focus of joke"".\n\nHOWEVER, if you are doing it as an intentional insult, to specifically draw attention to a person or group for the purposes of systematically and sincerely belittle them and portray them as smaller or less important than yourself, then you are totally in violation of any and all ethical conduct as we know it in modern western society.  In this way it would be rude and insulting.\n\nJust my personal opinion."

"Hi Kristy,\n\nI understand that Wicca does not actively serve the devil. \n\n(To be honest, I doubt anyone really actively serves diabolical forces. Who in their right mind would? )\n\nAnd I know a lot of motivation of Wicca is good -- my guess is that it wants to preserve nature, it wants to free people from destructive emotions, it offers a sense of peace and aesthetic beauty, it tries to remedy society's negative views of women, and so forth. \n\n(Please excuse my ignorance if I mistated something... or feel free to clarify something I missed.)\n\nI think most of the people here are simply thinking that a person either serves ""God"" or they don't, just as a person either serves Wicca or they don't. And by not actively serving the purposes of one, a person is automatically serving the purposes of the other.\n\nI think the distinction is extremely important, though, in how we relate to each other; and telling someone they ""serve the devil"" is a pretty lousy way to build relationships, or show concern for and interest in each other. I know I'd be turned off if someone said that about me, especially if my intentions were good.\n\nAs far as the verse you refer to (""Judge, lest ye not be judged...""), the context isn't saying that a person cannot come to an opinion about someone else and their behavior. People always come to conclusions, it's part of life. \n\n(After all, you yourself have just made a judgment: You've judged other people as wrong because you perceive they're judging YOU, right? My point is that it's impossible to live life without constantly ""judging"" other things at that level. We HAVE to make some judgements just in order to live.) \n\nJesus IS saying (very specifically) that, before I worry about fixing someone else, I need to look even harder at myself and see what needs fixing in ME. \n\n(""Why focus on the speck of dust in your brother's eye, while you have a beam sticking out of yours?"" That's one of Jesus' hyperbole's here. ""You goofball, take the beam out of your own eye, so that you can see clearly on how to help your brother fix his."")\n\nThe person who evaluates someone else as needing help has to first evaluate himself and at least acknowledge (if not deal with) his own issues first. Otherwise our intentions are in the wrong place."
Well here where I live there is this legend of a phantom school bus (yes I know sounds corny but hey here goes the story). Something like 50 years ago a school bus filled with kids was on their way to a historic cave on a history class trip. The bus never made it. It actually fell off the road down one of the most deepest cliffs. Well it is said that the kids that did not die on impact, burned to death. So now if you pass down this road you can see a floating school bus at a certain time at night. And believe it or not I was on a trip to that very place with my family like we used to do every other weekend about 10 years ago when we ALL saw it right there in living color. Of course we made it home in record time. ANd needless to say we haven't been back since.

I'm from Argentina, and like many people here, I'm a mixture of different races. My dad is a descendant from Italians and Spanish people (that's the commonest here).

If you take a look at the surnames in the book directory, you wouldn't know where exactly you are.
"Well, I personally don't hate Americans and I actually have very good American friends, but I'll answer your question.\n\nAlong history, we have seen the United States sticking up the nose in everyone's business, specially when they can take advantage of it. But nobody can say anything bad about the US because that could mean almost a diplomatic suicide. \n\nInvading other countries without the approval of the United Nations (actually, without any logical reason) is a good example of it. Mexico has a Free Trade Agreement with the US, refused to support Bush with this ""war on terror"" (haha... interesting title, by the way), and now the diplomatic relation of my country with the US is reaaaally damaged, and we're paying the price. \n\nThat's pretty much why..."

"Wait a minute.  If you are peeved at a person's personal preference, then how are you more ""deep?""  People like what they like.  A plain girl with a fun or interesting personality will garner as much attention as a attractive one.  A beautiful girl with a bad attitude will be almost as damning.\n\nThink of it this way:  A girl who is obsessing about pretty girls is not interesting or fun to be around.  Maybe you should just start having fun being yourself, and other people will want to spend time with you."
It's my opinion that those who claim to believe in a God are in reality placing their faith in those who told them of God, not the God itself.
"Originally a type of music, ""emo"" is short for emotive.

Yes. It provides a good grounding for actions. An understood way of behavior that allows one many things to count on from other Muslims. It treats families as important things, relationships as valuable and steadfastness to a certain mode of behavior as worthwhile.\n\nIn these ways it allows for a more predictable life in a world that is full of radical change. It promotes education and the work ethic. It promotes duty to your society and other believers.

The blood sacrifices in the old testment are a foretelling of the Sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross.  Jesus died on the cross so that we may be forgiven of our sins.  Because of his Sacrifice, we no longer have to give blood sacrifices for the remission of sins.  Now, all we have to do is pray to our Lord and Saviour, Jesus, and ask for forgiveness with a repenting heart and our sins are forgiven.  Jesus is the intercessor between us and God.  God no longer demands Blood Sacrifices.

They are bent out of shape because they are narrow-minded and unenlightened.

For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. \n\nJeremiah 29:12 You will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. \n\nIsaiah 45:22 “Turn to me and be saved, all you ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no other.” \n\nPsalm 147:3 He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds. \n\nPsalm 29:11 The Lord gives strength to his people; the Lord blesses his people with peace. \n\nPhilippians 4:4,6-7 Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
"What is your screen name?  Please don't simplify by answering ""Cesar d""."
Great idea.  But you would first have to get it on a ballot measure, and a majority would have to vote for it. Then, if all the people that voted for it had to kill themselves - problem solved. But if that were known before hand, nobody would vote for it. Smells funny to me. But you never know what will catch on. I'll watch my voters pamphlet.
well, you might wanna ask a question-- cuz you basically asked, 'how do you ask a question' wich is pretty ironic because thats a question in itself--
Oh, yes!  It makes me feel lots better about myself since I am not ignorant, white trash or a criminal and I am definately not on television with a tube top or wife-beater T-shirt on being dragged off by the police while screaming drunkenly through my 2 remaining teeth that I didn't do nothin'.  That's good TV, though!!
The use of SMS to Pakistan or anywhere else is not permited on Yom Kippur.  Just sit in the synagogue and pray on that day.
"No, inmates are not treated ""too well"" within the prison walls.\nTo anyone who says differently, I'd like to know What prison have you been visiting? I'd like to arrange for a cherished friend to be transferred there! The top notch medical/dental care I'm always hearing about would be nice!He had a small cavity in one tooth and the answer was to pull the tooth, he needs to see a doctor to renew a prescription for a chronic condition (no, it's not a drug with any recreational potential, it's Prilosec) but can't see the doc because he is not bleeding, and when he does get that script renewed, he'll be paying for it or rather either his mom or I will be doing so. The situation has gotten so bad with prison health care that a federal judge recently ordered the whole department into recievership.\nHe shares a 6 x 12 cell with one other man, and counts himself lucky that there are not 3 in that cell due to the amazingly overcrowded state of the facility, he gets to leave that cell about 4 hours a day, including shower, chow, dayroom and yard time... and THAT is when the facility is not on lockdown due to drastic understaffing, courtesy of a hiring freeze imposed by the Governor...on lockdown, it really is in the cell, 24/7, food passed through the door, etc the only thing that keeps going is the mail (and by the way, I send him paper,envelopes and postage, unless it is a letter to one's attorney of record AND there is no money on one's books, the prison does not pay for letters)....the educational programs, IF an inmate qualifies AND if there is a slot available in the class.....and surely you see the need to try to educate these people to improve the chances of their becoming productive citizens upon release?\nThe showers are hot and reasonably clean, but inmates buy their own soap, shampoo, toothpaste, etc.\nThe food is a joke, and is barely legal in quantity and quality... most inmates get VERY creative with the top ramen that is available at the commisary...\nWhat Gym/weight room are you talking about? My friend does an aerobic routine in his cell each morning and spends about half his time in the yard running his usual 3 to 5 miles, but there's no equipment available...I'm not complaining about that, but I'd like to know where you get your information.\n\nAs to other recreational activities, if there are video games, it has not been mentioned to me... Television in the day room where what to watch is decided by vote...any TVs or radios in the cells were not provided by the state, either the inmate or someone like me purchased them and like quarterly packages and phone calls (collect and incredibly costly) they are a privilige that is EARNED... Surely you can see the value of rewarding good behavior?\n\nBy the way, my friend is what they call a model inmate, he has had no disiplinary problems inside.\nI could go on and on, but I really want to know what prison all these stereotypes of fun and games are based on, because it sure as hell is not in California!"
Because they don't have too much to explain.
"Mircea Eliade (1907-1986) wrote a series of three books called  ""A history of religion"" that covers just about every aspect of all of the major religions and treats upon all sorts of minor ones all the way back to prehistoric religions."
"Remember, the last time organized religions ruled the world, it was called the Dark Ages.\nI think you have to separate your own faith in God from the power-grabbing, political, greedy tactics used by most organized religions today. They act like this at their own peril, because lots of people (like you & I) are becoming disinterested (or offended even) by their corrupted ""message"". Keep the faith, lose the BS."
"NO GOD. A number of reasons:\n\n1) No proof -- the bible is 2000 years old. We dont no who wrote it, and it is extremely contradictory, and in some places prejudice (ie against gay's).\n2) Humans -- people say that humans are proof of God, but there are other theories which are tested and questioned. Evolution has stood up to a number of arguments and is frequently questioned and always proved correct.\n3) The Big Bang -- This too has been tested -- evidence is Red Shift (i think that's what its called). People ask where gases came from to create the big bang, but where would God have come from?\n4) Scientists -- Scientists are extremely clever people and the majority of them say no God, and who better to trust? (Certainly not a man who wears a dog collar).\n5) Suffering -- If God is all caring and all powerful how does suffering happen?\n6) Can God create a boulder that's too heavy for God to lift? -- Yes- he's all powerful so can create anything. No- He's all powerful so can lift anything. Therefore the basic idea of God completely destroys any possibility of God.\n7) Why believe in something which has such little proof - it would be like saying that the matrix is real - we cant prove or disprove it - just like God.\n8) Next to no one believes in the old Roman God's, so why do we think that this God is not going to be lost like the other ones?\n9) Cause and effect. Everything has a cause, and the causes of all effects will eventually lead back to God, however what happens if we say ""what caused God""?\n10) Our Responses -- Those who believe in God will say things like ""we are proof"" or ""the bible in proof"" or ""because he exists"". They give no evidence unlike people who dont believe in God who put their ideas forward with good and sensible arguments."

Any language that is spoken in different places and among different social classes will have varieties.  The larger the number of speakers using that language, the greater the variety.  Regional varieties are called dialects.  Social varieties are called sociolects.  Subvarieties are occasionally called communolects and individual varieties are called idiolects.
The Meiji period (Japanese: 明治時代, Meiji-jidai) denotes the 45-year reign of the Meiji Emperor, running from 8 September 1868 (in the Gregorian calendar, 23 October 1868) to 30 July 1912. During this time, Japan started its modernization and rose to world power status.\n\nAfter the death of the Meiji Emperor in 1912, the Taisho Emperor took the throne, thus beginning the Taisho Period.

The Bible is one of the most racist books ever written.  It goes as far as to claim that god selects people for special dispensation based on their race.\n\nOf course, it was written in a time when racism was thought to be virtuous, but times change.

Yes. That doesn't mean that you can hurt others just because of your beliefs.
"The September 11, 2001 attacks (often referred to as 9/11 [1]) were a series of coordinated terrorist attacks upon the United States of America carried out on Tuesday, September 11, 2001. \nThe U.S. government also initially claimed that the White House and Air Force One were also targeted, although the source and nature of these threats was not disclosed. (BBC News, September 12, 2001, [7]).to end such things, let them do what ever they want.The Executive branch consists of the President of the United States and his delegates. The President is both the head of state and head of government, as well as the commander-in-chief of the military, and the chief diplomat. The President, the Constitution says, must ""take care that the laws be faithfully executed."" To carry out this responsibility, he or she presides over the executive branch of the federal government, a vast organization numbering about 4 million people, including 1 million active-duty military personnel. In addition, the President has important legislative and judicial powers. Within the executive branch itself, the President has broad constitutional powers to manage national affairs and the workings of the federal government, and may issue executive orders to effect internal policies.\n\nThe President may sign or veto legislation passed by Congress. He may be impeached by a majority in the House and removed from office by a two-thirds majority in the Senate for ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors."" The President may not dissolve Congress or call special elections, but does have the power to pardon criminals convicted of federal offences (though not crimes against a state), give executive orders, and (with the consent of the Senate) appoint Supreme Court justices and federal judges.\nThe National Security Agency / Central Security Service (NSA/CSS) is believed to be the largest United States government intelligence agency. It is responsible for the collection and analysis of foreign communications and for the security of U.S. government communications against similar agencies elsewhere. Officially established November 04, 1952, the NSA is a component of the Department of Defense and has always been directed by a three-star flag or general officer. NSA is a key component of the United States Intelligence Community headed by the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nIts eavesdropping mission includes radio broadcasting, both from various organizations and individuals, the Internet, and other intercepted forms of communication, especially confidential communications. Its secure communications mission includes military, diplomatic, and all other sensitive, confidential or secret government communications. Despite having been described as the world's largest single employer of mathematicians [1], the owner of the single largest group of supercomputers, and having a budget much larger than that of the CIA [citation needed], it has had a remarkably low profile until the break of the 21st century. For a long time its existence was not even acknowledged by the U.S. government. It was often said, half-jokingly, that ""NSA"" stood for ""No Such Agency""."

Because girls can be easily get jealous of each other... The best way to deal with girls are not tell them something that may cause their jealousy. For example, just don't show off in front of them how great your boyfriend treats you or how happy you are with your boyfriend. They probably will think up some tricks to damage your happiness because of their jealousy!!
"Because just anyone can get a hold of one. I think the US should make a new gun law that makes people who want to own a gun take saftey classes before they can own one. Its also in the media espcially in music. In ""rap"" music singers portrait gun violence and killing people cool. I think people who pass saftey classes and police interviews are the only ones who should be eligable for gun ownership."
The churches continue to follow the Bible in order to maintain control over people. If they questioned or changed their own scriptures then this would make their followers doubt them. It would make it seem as if they were wrong all along.
Many things in life are BEYOND our CONTROL :)\n\nThere were many times I felt helpless: in romances (some relationships are not meant to be), at work (failure to meet deadlines, receiving discouraging remarks), at home (relatives die, arguments over small things).\n\nBut I know that there is a place free from these pain, suffering, disappointments, shams, drudgery, broken dreams. Christ promised this to all who believed in Him and who seek to be like Him. Also, Together with prayer, this always comforts and touches me in dark times :)
Jesus isn't dead. He is still alive. He will return again. But those who want to kill him will go to Hell. They deserve the Hell.

I wonder if you're mad at the complete waste of paper product and disregard for the environment or just the silly method in which the person uses a napkin. Either way, it is a different pet peeve than most, but not weird. When people do this, they are being eccentric and weird. Anyway, the waste of paper would get me a little upset because there is no need to contribute to deforestation because this person can't use a whole napkin and uses like 50. (Now if you're eating really greasy and drippy BBQ wings, it's fine, as long as you're using them to their fullest potential and trees aren't being cut down and animals' homes destroyed in excess for no reason because of your dumb habit, but I recommend a reusable cloth napkin instead of so much used (but not wasted) paper).
It's half your fault for saying yes when you didn't feel right about it and it's half his fault for not being understanding about the situation.
"Luther and the rest of the Protestants didn't throw those books out of the Bible. They were never part of the Jewish canon or the Jewish Bible, but were respected documents by both Jews and Christians alike.\n\nThe Protestants chose to limit the Christian Old Testament to only those books that were considered authoritative by the Jewish rabbis at the Council of Jamnia in 90 BCE. Even the Catholic Church considered these books of lesser authority. The Catholic Church called these books ""deutero-canonical,"" indicating their lesser, although still important status.\n\nToday, those books are not included among the 66 books of the Christian Bible that are the most authoritative, but are included together with others in a section Catholic, Protestant and Jewish Bible Scholars call ""The Apocrypha.""\n\nWhile Lutherans today do not consider them as authoritative, as say Jeremiah and Isaiah are, they still revere them and find much that is valuable and faith-enriching in them. You'll find that Lutherans, Episcopalians and Roman Catholics honor these books today, even if they do not consider them ""canonical"" the way Genesis, for example is.\n\nHope this helps."
"No, the Church of England regards this story as a myth. This myth is alluded to in William Blake's Hymn ""Jerusalem""\n\n""And did those feet in ancient time \nWalk upon England's mountains green? \nAnd was the holy Lamb of God \nOn England's pleasant pastures seen? ""\n\nAnd did the Countenance Divine \nShine forth upon our clouded hills? \nAnd was Jerusalem builded here \nAmong these dark Satanic mills? ""\n\n...The answer infered by the poem being, No, with the Ironic reference to the Dark Satanic mills.\n\nWould make a good Movie though!!"
Good question.\n\nHowever your question seems to assume that we have to fight our way to peace. Although this is sometimes necessary as in WWII, I don't think true peace will be arrived at by a crushing victory over our enemies. The survivors will still be our enemies. The war may be over but there is no peace.\n\nI think true peace is reached by achieving justice. When everyone is treated as a neighbor, when poverty, famine, preventable disease, and other unjust issues are resolved then we will be on our way to true peace.\n\nThere are not many people who really want to make the needed sacrifices for this to happen.\n\nWith love in Christ.

Duh, because all is not forgiven.  All people have to go by when they hire someone that they do not know personally is their record.  When people screw up and do bad things they have to suffer the consequences of it.  People should not be expected to just blindly trust someone because they have served their time.

'If I were ...' is actually a past subjunctive form.  'I was ...' is (simple) past indicative.\n\nWith most verbs in English the two forms above look the same - so we hardly even notice we're using them.\n\nIt's quite a complicated area so, to understand it, you have to start with three (basic) kinds of conditional sentence:\n\n1. If he asks, I'll help him.\n2. If he asked, I would (I'd) help him.\n3. If he had asked, I would have helped him.\n\nEach of these uses a differnt combination of tenses to convey\n\n1.  A certain future action based on a likely future condition.  (I think he could possibly ask ...)\n2. A possible future action based on a less likely future condition (I think it's nlikely he'll ask)\nAND\n3.  A (now impossible) action based on a hypothetical (and now impossible) past condition.  (He didn't ask).\n\nThe past subjunctive is used in the 'If' clause of number 2.  This is NOT actually a past tense (although it nearly always looks like one in English).  It is not about the past but about what could be at any time.\n\nThe verb 'be' is the only real exception to the rule that the past indicative and the past subjunctive verb forms look the same in English.  Hence, 'If I were you ...'.\n\nMany native speakers 'smooth out' the rule to use 'If I was you ...'.  Rather than the debate about 'What is correct?' - a more interesting question is 'Is this language change in progress?  Is the fact that the difference is now only vestigal, meaning that it is in the process of dying out (like 'whom') and other vestigal grammatical constructs in languages as they change and these items become less and less useful over time?
According to Greek mythology, The Amazons were a nation of women dwelling about the river Thermodon. They were, as a race, considered to be the children of Ares and Harmonia II. \nThe Amazons of Libya were much earlier in point of time and disappeared entirely many generations before the Trojan War; but those about the Thermodon river were in their full vigour a little before that time. \nThe Libyan Amazons were also known for having waged war against the people of Atlantis, the most civilised men of the region, who dwelt in a prosperous country and possessed great cities.
I don't consider it sad.  sad would be drinking an entire 6-pack by yourself, making drunk phone calls, and then passing out and not remembering what the Hell you did before you passed out.  there's nothing wrong with enjoying a couple of cold beers to unwind at the end of the day.  it's when it becomes abusive that it's sad.

Descartes said the same thing.\n\nIf the God that you believe in is naive enough to be fooled by such reductive reasoning, he surely must not be worthy of your, or anyone's, faith.\n\nThe wise and safe way is always the correct way; the one that stays firm to your beliefs and convictions. If you are a believer only because you are afraid of hell, then I seriously doubt your convictions.\n\nPeace :)

The grace of Christ is an undesevered gift of being forgiven of our sins. It is to be shared with all. As Christ told Peter if you love me Feed my Sheep. Those who will accept the precious gift of Grace (which the is the Pearl). Christ is telling us to feed those willing to accept it humbly but not to waste it on those who scuff at it and refuse it. There is no conflict here just instruction on how to handle two different situations. I pray I am not casting my pearls of God given wisdom before any swine here.

If we all went to the bottom, we wouldn't be a coherent society.  But on occasion, we send out the scouts to gauge the depths.  That way, not all of us have to go there.\n\nNot all of us die in traffic accidents either, but we know its out there.  I think the Road Gods demand blood tithe when we travel faster than we can run.  Same with hitting bottom.  Our bad habits extract a pound of flesh from us, or someone like us.

Is it the translation of the Da Vinci code by Dan Brown. I would say it is a master piece of fiction based on hhistory. However, the grip was losened by the author as the story went by. Some how the climax was really an anti climax, what with any body who read Alexander Pope and visited WestMinster  Abbey, could have guessed. Finally, it appears that the danny boy submitted to religious pressure and exonerated every such person.
Romanian...not only does it sounds good, but it's fun to learn..good luck...I'm a Romanian native speaker, so i know what I'm talking about..:))
I do feel we are a society that has come to make excuses for everything and responsibilty falls to the waste side.  Either that or we just pass the blame along til we forget what the blame is.  If you have a clean cut case.  He killed her with a gun in the lobby.  Its simple.  He goes to jail.  Case closed.  But when it comes to the tougher issues.  He killed her with a gun in the lobby but he has been on meds since 85 for an illness he cant help and some one forgot to remind him to take it.  Thats where blame gets passed along like a basketball.  Do we blame him or blame the person who forgot to remind him to take the meds that keep him balanced.  \nIn my honest opinion we have become a society who is weak.  We look for the easy way out.  We dont look at the source of the problem.  We assume that either the man or the caregiver of the mentally ill is responsible.  We do not look at the illness and say, how could we have helped him better before this happened.  We dont want to take the hard cases.  And so the ball keeps going around the court.

Sexuality just is a strange affair.  Despite Freud analysis, it remains a various unexplored world.\nThe stereotyped “straight” people call your pleasure “deviation” to underline as you’re far from their conventional (limited?) and pre-set normality! Who decided that? By now, as many do, I think that wherever there’s love should be no deviation or bad affair.\nMen or women, they simply love, because sex, whereas there’s respect and no violence, is love mainly!
well all you have to do is read Matthew, Mark,Luke and John and you will know. But because they thought that Jesus was going to save them from the Romans,Because they miss read the signs they were very sad and confused, then they were mad and confused.But then they saw the truth.
This was during the time that Jesus spent 40 days and 40 nights in the wilderness, but it doesn't mean literally that all the Kingdoms of the world could be seen from the mountain.  Satan showed visions of the whole earth and all its riches, tempting Jesus into domination of the world and ownership of all these treasures. The same way some people are tempted to exaggerate qualifications to get a good job with good money.  How often do we sell our souls?  Too often, I'm afraid.

"Christians denied other gods because they are monotheistic, meaning they only believe in one God. And since they still believe in at least one God, then that makes Christians theists. \n\nThe term ""Atheist"" means one who doesn't believe in any gods whatsoever and tries to disprove the existence of any god. Christians believe in a God, so that makes them the opposite of an atheist."

"are you the dentist?!  i'd go in a heartbeat!  haha lol seriously i wouldnt give it a second thought if my dentist had tatts, my orthodontist has bad breath and i'd much rather see some ink than smell some stink.  my sister and brother in law are both covered in tattoos.  they are good people and are kind, loving parents.  i get tired of the looks people give them.  they are just like anyone else and yet people judge them as losers, low lifes etc by their artwork.  sad but true.\n\nas far as donating blood, i only had to wait one year after i got my tattoo before the american red cross was kind enough to ""accept"" my apparently tainted blood again.."

"Fact.\n\nIn 1993 I was driving a clunker of a Ford Fairmont, stopped to get gas, and the car failed to start. The mechanic on site offered to jump-start rhe car by way of the solonoid, and the car took off in reverse straight into traffic. Three guys ran after the car, one got trapped between the open car door and a light post, but they managed to stop the car and pull it back into the station. One of the guys said, ""Don't kill the engine"", the guy who drove it back up got out and closed the door, and it took off AGAIN only to be stopped by a brand new pick-up truck that still had the dealer's tags on it. The police came out, but couldn't find a law on the books to issue a citation, because nobody was driving the car either time."

We are all different folks, of different orientations and beliefs. When we come together as a community, we see ourselves as the rainbow. No one is the same, but together we make up something wonderful and beautiful.
Love.\n\nI CORINTHIANS 13:13\n    And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.\n \nChsrity means; 'GIVING OF YOURSELF TO OTHERS'...which is what the Love of God is.\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/bibletruths_forbelievers/
Have you ever heard of a game called Rochambeaux (pronounced row-sham-bow)?  It's where two guys take turns kicking each other in the nuts until one of them gives up.  It's a really good thing in that game if you get to go first ... to my knowledge, there has never been a second kick in a single game of Rochambeaux!
"pseudo means ""fake"" or ""pretend"".  Pseudoliberalism is something that many politicians are.  They ""pretend"" to be concerned about liberal issues - the environment, women's rights - but really, they couldn't care less and actually harbour very conservative values."
"If a gay man is a top only, it means he will not receive anal sex, he will only give it. This can also mean that he will only recieve oral sex, he will not give it.\n\nSometimes it reflects a man's personal tastes (just like some heterosexual men don't like giving oral sex and some do), but other times it can reflect on the feelings he has on what it means to be a 'real man'. There's a stereotype that ""real men"" don't receive anal sex or give oral sex to another man, that doing those acts are demeaning and degrading and only for [insert derogatory slang term for gay men here].\n\nThere's another twist to this. If a man is on the ""down low"", a phrase that African-American men use to talk about being a closeted gay or bisexual (often times even closeted to themselves), and about the gay sex they have in these situations, then for some reason they believe that if they only top, then they're not gay or bi.\n\nI hope this helps."

No. I would report it to the police. I know that criminals come in all colors. So do good people.
First of all the Bible does not say thou shalt not kill. It says thou shalt not commit murder, and there is a vast difference. Secondly the same Bible that says thou shalt not commit murder also says whosoever sheds man's blood by man shall his blood be shed. Also the same law that the ten commandments is in teaches clearly the death penalty for murder and several other crimes as well including rape, blasphemy, etc. We Christians don't make up our own religion we follow what the Bible taught. You misquote our Bible, that I don't think you have ever read, and then use your misquote to try and refute us. Read the Bible yourself before you throw it at us.
"Well, as far as a line of reasoning, you could start with existence itself.  We all agree that the universe exists. Astronomers have observed that the universe is organized into a system of galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and super clusters of clusters of galaxies.  \n\nIf you're open to the possibility of a higher power, you'd have to ask if this power is responsible for the universe.  If you answer yes, then your next question is, is the universe an act of creation, or is it an accident?  Either way, your next question is ""why?""  This line of questioning will bring you either to the biblical explanation of god, or the scientific explanation of god."
Of course you can, you just miss out on so much.

Because people view issues and subject matter differently and most people are so arrogant that they refuse to accept other peoples opinions.  Take the bible for example, look at the number of different religions there are based on the same book.  But one little difference in opinion and a new religion is formed.  Even people of the same religion can't agree on some of the subject matter.  This is one of the main reasons I quit supporting organized religion altogether.
Yes, I am. When I was small I saw a scary twilight zone that had an evil puppet-like clown thing that would mess with you and then finally kill you. My parents thought they would show me that there are only good clowns. So they both dressed up like clowns one day whole I was out, and when I got home and walked in, they were each sitting at the kitchen table making clown cookies; plus circus music wasplaying in the backround. I know my parents were trying to do something positive, but they terrified me even more, just seeing them there freaked me out. I HATE CLOWNS.

"Because Christianity and Bible were modified right after Jesus Christ(PBUH) was taken to the heavens. He did not die(as Christians believe) he'll return on earth before the Dooms day. The same Jew(John) who planned to hang and kill Jesus(PBUH) later converted to Christianity and was the first modifier of Allah's(GOD) message revealed on Jesus'(PBUH). The Bible of today is not in the exact shape as it was at the time it was revealed on Jesus(PBUH). It was being modified. Qurran is the only Holy book which is in the same form as it was revealed on Prophet Muhammad(PBUH). Qurran is the continuation of Gods messages. Jesus(PBUH) was the Prophet of God not son. Adam is the first Prophet and Muhammad is the last Prophet. Qurran is the last message form God. You need to study about Islam before judging it. To all the non Muslims: Have ever seen a miracle sent by God as a proof of ur religion? Islam has so many miracles sent by God. Does anyone know about the miracle Fish bearing Allah found in Rossendale, Lancashire, UK?Today I read in a newspaper that another fish was found in Kenya bearing a Qurranic verse ""WALLAHO-KHAIRUR-RAZIQEEN."" These r not the only miracles. Allah has said in the Holy Qurran“Soon we will show them our signs in the regions, and in their own souls, until it becomes manifest to them that this is the truth.” There is a forest near my town named Ziarat where Allah is written naturally between the forest.\nI saw another miracle on TV which showed a Aubergine bearing Allah on one half and Muhammad(PBUH) on the other. I saw another picture in a Mosque which showed Allah witten with clouds. Don't you think it is a clear sign of Allah's existence. Just wanted to know ur opinion.If u guys know about any such miracles plz share it.To all the negative thinkers:Dont't answer a question just to shoot down someone else's beliefs. Move on to the next questions and say nothing. Better yet, learn something!if it doesnt mean anything to u it might to others"
No. If one claimed to be a Mormon but denied all the basic tenets of Mormonism — that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, that the Book of Mormon is true and divinely inspired, that god was once a man who progressed to godhood through keeping the laws and ordinances of the Mormon Church, and that the Mormon Church was divinely established — the Mormon Church would reject such a person’s claim to being a Latter-day Saint. One cannot fairly call oneself a Mormon if one does not believe the fundamental doctrines taught by the Mormon Church. By the same token, if the Mormon Church does not hold to even the basic biblical truths believed by the greater Christian community down through the ages, how can Christians reasonably be expected to accept Mormonism as authentic Christianity?
A good teaching on the subject
"The Latin explanation is correct, but it's slightly more complex than that.  ""Numero"" actually means ""in number"".\n\nThe basic form of the word in Latin is ""numerus"".  ""Numero"" is  the ""ablative case"" form.  The ablative form was used here because that fit the usage English writers needed when they introduced the form into English in the 17th century  (in expressions of the sort ""men, in number three"").\n\nA couple of notes on this form & how to use it:\n\n1) The numero sign used to always use a RAISED (or ""superscript"") O.  (Typewriters could not handle this very well, unless you wanted to manually move the carriage up and down.  But wordprocessing, personal computing make it much easier.)\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numero_sign \n\nThis use of a superscript at the end is another indicator that it is the letter stands for the case ENDING, rather than, say, the second letter of the word.  (The practice of abbreviating a word by its first letter or two plus the case ending is ancient.  For example, in the early church --by the 2nd century-- copies of the Greek New Testament would abbreviate the divine names by using the first letter or two followed by the case ending, with a line over the whole to mark it as an abbreviation.)\nhttp://www.skypoint.com/~waltzmn/NominaSacra.html\n\n2) Even though the abbreviation is borrowed from the Latin, you should never SAY the Latin word when you see it.  That's just an unusual habit in English -- to use Latin abbreviations to stand for English words.  \n\nIn the same way, when you see ""e.g."" you say ""for example""; for ""i.e."" say ""that is"", for ""viz."" say ""namely""; for ""cf."" say ""compare""; and for ""etc."" say ""and so forth"".  (Many other European languages have equivalent abbreviations, but base them on their OWN language.)\nSee: http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=19971217\nand list - http://list-of-latin-phrases.area51.ipupdater.com/"

It means through a chain of no more than 6 people you can connect yourself to any person in the world.  It may not be universally true, and it requires certain channels of communications (eg. a famous person you know is a better link than Joe Blow).\n\nFor example, I met my member of parliament in Canada.  He works with the Canadian Prime minister.  The PM knows the US president.  Shrub has (probably) met your senator.  And you could meet your senator.  That's a separation of only four people to get from me to you.
No.

Having just taken a crash course in dream interpretation, I would conclude God is calling me to take arms against ignorance, especially the brand of it perpetrated in His name:\n\nThe two-headed monkey is a symbol of the confusion surrounding evolution. The green cape is both another pointer to the same confusion, but this time re to earth sciences, and a reminder that a great effort is called for – a cape is typical super-hero attire.\n\nThe golden shoes are allusions to how much has been invested in resources, time and effort in education - and yet these dunderheads grow more ignorant and blind. (Hence the 2 sets of spectacles). \n\nHe is also telling me to expose their anti-scientific approach as lies. This is why he has a crocodile’s tail, which is obviously a metaphor for “their tale is a croc.”\n\nThe white mustache is yet another attempt by Him to get me to appreciate Salvador Dali. On this I am a heretic\n\nWith this gaudy get-up, I can only assume it's a Bonobo chimp. And that would be a whole messsage unto itself.
"I doubt if your friend truly dislikes ""thinking about religion and spirituality"" since she's willing to ""take everything in"". Perhaps at this stage in her life she's still NOT READY to TALK ABOUT her feelings on the subject.\n\nGive her some space to do so. Wait until you are asked about your own spirituality, otherwise talk about other things instead.\n\nMeantime, to answer your question, she'd be considered as an Atheist by your definition.\n\nPeace be with you!"
Have no way as the way. Pick the best teachings from each religion and you have a recipe for happiness. Only thing, you might confuse yourself a bit if you try to follow both religions completely.

"Lil' Samycat is right, Adams is the home of the ""Bell Witch"".  A great synopsis of the Bell Witch legend is given on the about.com site, from which I quote:\n\nADAMS, TENNESSEE, in 1817 was the site of one of the most well-known hauntings in American history – so well known that it eventually caught the attention and then the involvement of a future president of the United States. \nKnown as The Bell Witch, the strange and often violent poltergeist activity that provoked fear and curiosity in the small farming community has remained unexplained for nearly 200 years, and is the inspiration for many fictional ghost stories, including the recent film, The Blair Witch Project. The facts of The Bell Witch case share little in common with the mythology created for The Blair Witch Project, except they both attracted a great deal of public interest. And because it really happened, The Bell Witch is far scarier.\n\n\nCheck out the link, it's a great story!"

John was the only one of the disciples who died of natural causes.  You should look him up in a Bible dictionary to get his whole story.\n\nRemember that the Judas book is NOT Scripture.
"Unless you are talking about statistics, I'm pretty sure you mean ""medium"". In fact, God does not ""speak"" at all. When people are said to have received direct communication from the Almighty, it is actually the Voice of God that does the talking. Not the voice of God, as in God's voice, but the Voice of God. This role was filled, I believe, by the archangel Metatron.\nThe reason for having a Voice of God is that when God says things, they are things like LET THERE BE LIGHT; not things that are appropriate for human ears. When He needs to say something like ""I am what I am,"" He does so via the Metatron.\n\nNote: this answer is based on, and is consistent with, a lot of research into Judeo-Christian theology; not on personal belief."
Reincarnation is the return to life in another form. You didn't cite one example of reincarnation.\nMan dies once, then the judgment. God's rule, which by your examples show that judgment hasn't come yet. Revelation also shows us that the judgment hasn't come yet. Not one person, dead or alive has been judged yet. No one is in heaven (except the Trinity and angels) and no one is in hell yet. Jesus the carpenter is probably still building our houses there :-)

"~Voices were translated into radio signals, sent across space and received by receiver/translaters.  People turned dials marked ""on"" on little boxes called radios and the receivers translated the signals back to voices, which caused the peoples' eardrums to vibrate, sending signals to their brains, which were perceived as sounds (most notably voices)."

I just graduated from high school and I was classified as either popular or the guy who seems to know everyone and was nice. Though I kinda wish I could have just gone through without a stereotype. Though I guess thats asking to much.
Sure I do...and so do you! You believe in gravity, don't you? You believe in sound, and wind and that the sun will come up again tomorrow, don't you? You can't see any of those things, yet you believe in the effects of them! I have just as much faith in the fact that there is a Grand Creator and that He loves me. I think He is pained by all the wickedness and hatred He sees on earth, but if He interfered, the issue raised in the Garden of Eden regarding the ability to choose for one's self as to right and wrong would go unanswered. Satan told Adam and Eve that mankind could rule himself and choose for himself, and he would not die, as God had said.  God has given mankind all this time to A) prove to himself that he cannot rule himself and choose wisely as to right and wrong and B)to prove that there are those among humans who WOULD serve God out of love. God will make all as it should be after Armageddon, when a New World Order is here on earth and man has the chance again to do what Adam and Eve lost the chance to do..live forever in a perfected state on a perfect earth.
The Czech Republic belongs to the mild climatic region. January is the coldest month (on average -0.2 °C), July the warmest one (on average 9.5 °C). The total radiant energy per year varies from 3670 MJ.m-2 in the north to 4600 MJ.m-2 in the southeast. The driest area, around Zatec, has an average annual rainfall of 410 mm, whereas near Jizerske hory in the mountain region the average annual rainfall amounts to 1705 mm. The yearly average number of days with snow is less than 40 in the low-land regions and up to 120 days in the mountains.

"I don't think most laws are tied to the Church.  However, our legal system is based on our Judaic/Christian heritage.  \n\nThe notion of separation of Church and State is not in the Bible nor is it in our Constitution, Bill of Rights, or any of the founding documents.  The phrase comes from Thomas Jefferson but has been taken out of context and twisted around so bad it is not funny.  Go to the 1st link below and you will see what I mean.\n\nThen read The Amendments to the Constitution at the 2nd link.  Note the first section of the 3rd amendment:\n""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;""\n\nThis means that congress is not allowed to make laws establishing a national religion nor interfering with the freedom of worship.  That was one of the great abuses in England.\n\nSome of the states did have official religions for a while and this was not prohibited by the national government.  The prohibition was only on the Federal government.\n\n\nThe Constitution that REQUIRES a separation of church and state is from the old Soviet Union.\n\n\nAs to whether we would still have some of the same laws if we had not had the Ten Commandments--I think so because God created us in His spiritual image.  He has placed within each of us a sense of what is right and what is wrong.  Granted many people work hard at ignoring that sense BUT I still believe it is there."

"""Let him who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches"". Revelation 3:6\n\nJesus foretold that anyone who was truly searching for the Truth would find Enlightenment in The Word. One has to have the heart of a child: meek, humbled, and willing to fully comprehend it, and even then we fall sadly short.\n\nMatthew 11:25-- ""I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes""\n\nI discourage the dogma of fundamentalism which says ""this is how I was raised to believe such and such a verse...""\n\nThe Bible was written in such a way that the wise are confounded, yet the pure and simple hearted can easily percieve it's profound truth. \n\nThe Word of God is far from cryptic concerning Biblical principles and standards of living (like abortion, homosexuality, marriage, finances etc.)\n\nSo when you say ""keep an open mind""--it doesn't mean that we let ourselves accept man's errent translations/transliteration, but it does mean that we keep our hearts sensitive to the guidance of the Holy Spirit, who teaches us all things.\n\nJohn  16:13-- ""When the Spirit of Truth is come (that is, the Holy Spirit), he will guide you into all truth""\n\nwith all that said, some people choose to remain stubborn fundamentalists because either they:\n1) have already received an inner witness that what they believe is right OR--\n2)are too full of fear to even consider any doctrine that vary's from what they have tradtionally been taught."

"It was not Satan that fell. Satan is the English version of the name Shaitan (spelling) which is Hebrew for ""Accuser"". Which is a type of angel. In the book of Job, in the original text, it reads that A Shaitan came before the throne of God. So take that for what you will."
You can have fun playing with them, so long as everybody knows you are playing.\n\nSome have roots in fact. For example, haggling is popular in some cultures. Non-hagglers tend to say the people in those cultures are cheap. The label is probably because the hagglers pay less money and non-hagglers are just jealous.\n\nIt can be handy to know the stereotypes and their roots (the stereotype alone is often worse than useless). Also, people are individuals - that makes stereotypes generalizations which may be interesting, but not may not be helpful (and even cause you trouble) in one-on-one interactions.
When you stand in front of the group, make a connection with only one person at a time.  Just look at him/her and talk as though he/she were the only one in the room.  Then at the next phrase or so, switch to another person, and talk to him/her like you would if you were sitting in your kitchen.\n\nAs for what you're saying, practice your points, so you know what you're saying, but just remember why you're talking about it -- do you want to help people?  Excite them?  Remember that as you make a connection with the audience, one person at a time.\n\nYou can also try Toastmasters, which is a great way to get practice.
Any baptized male Catholic can be elected Pope. Being single is not a requirement. Although the chances of a non-cardinal being elected if very small.\n\nIf the person elected is not yet a bishop, then he is ordained a bishop before accepting the office of the Papacy. \n\nTheoretically we could have a married pope before we have married priests.\n\nWith love in Christ.

"The man of lawlessness is one who comes to do away with the law. Daniel 7:25 says that he will ""try to change times and laws"".  This person will probably attempt to replace the Biblical times and holidays, attempting to do away with Pesach (Passover), change the time the day begins from the biblical method of starting at evening (perhaps changing it to ""the witching hour"").\n\nAnd this person will say the law is done away with. This person will deceive if possible even the elect. Something to watch for."
OK- assuming this is a real spirit case and you are not crazy, the best thing you can do is not be afraid. He never hurt you before because you were never afraid before. It is like the movie Skeleton Key. Second: DO NOT TRY TO CONTACT HIM. You have no idea what you are doing, and you could get in way over your head in which case you could get hurt. I don't have an old family recipe for protection against spirits, so I could help you know more than a book or a google search on specifics, but there are plenty of books on protection. If you feel you need to call someone like a physic, but be aware that most are just frauds, and don't pay anything up front. I don't really have any better advice for you than that. Just don't fear him and he cannot harm you.

No!  THERE IS NO EVIDENCE FOR THIS IDEA.  It is an idea speculated about from people who have an agenda to tear down Christianity.  Any spreading of such an idea that has no evidence from a credible source is immoral and morally reprehensible.  It is a violation of the Commandment not to bear false witness.  This is why the Da Vinci Code is repugnant and disgusting.

"Anything is possible, and there is much we don't understand about human consciousness.\n\nWe have a ""physical body"" that operates on a real mechanical level, but we've never quite figured out where consciousness lives. Is it totally in the physical component of the brain, or is there a ""soul"" aspect that continues to live separate from the body?\n\nIf the person is entirely physical, what does that say about our value? Is there anything enduring about us as human beings, or does death mean the end? If death is the end, does anything we do have meaning or value? \n\n(Eventually everything dies, thus nothing will last -- so what's the point in the long run of doing evil or good? It's a good question.)\n\nAnyway, we simply do not have the means to determine whether life exists after death, from a science standpoint. We have a few stories of ""people who came back,"" and we have supposed ""ghost sightings,"" but the evidence doesn't really give us much to go on. Much of our belief in life after death comes through faith, not science.\n\nI would say, though, that a lot of things about human beings don't make sense without life after death. Why do we even have the desire at all? What about all the times we ""die"" to things in real life, in order to grow (i.e., give up a behavior or a crutch that feels like death -- then find ourselves better, stronger, and more rejuvenated?) \n\nThere are patterns in this life that suggest life continues after death... there's just no tangible evidence that we can ""prove"" it."

"The main key is found in Acts 21:8  --\n\n""On the next day we departed and came to Caesarea, and we entered the house of Philip the EVANGELIST, who was one of the SEVEN, and stayed with him.""\n\nIn the passage you asked about --Acts 8--  we find Philip sent specifically to declare the good news, that is, to act as an evangelist, calling people to faith.  And that is what happens, and people believe and are baptized.\n\n---------\nThe question is --Was he a ""DEACON"" ?!\n\nThis is not quite as clearcut as many think.  In Acts 6 and 21 he is referred to as one of ""the seven"".  The word ""deacon"" never appears! \n\nThe reason people have taken to calling these men deacons is the WORK they were given to do, and esp. Peter's statement in Acts 6:2 - ""It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables."" The word ""serve"" here is diakonia.  But in fact the Greek words used are often very general ""diakonia"" = ""service"" and ""diakonos"" = ""servant"".  They do NOT always refer to the more specific ""office of deacon"" that we find later on (in Paul's epistles).\n\nIf you look at how ""the seven"" where chosen in Acts 6, and their subsequent ministry, it is clear they did more than oversee the ""ministry of mercy"" or finances associated with the special office of deacon in the church.   Rather, these were known leaders of the Greek-speaking (Jewish) Christian community.  So it's not surprising to find Stephen preaching (Acts 7) and Philip evanglizing (Acts 8).  (For that matter, the picture of Acts as a whole seems to be that PAUL takes up the work of Stephen!)\n\nIn fact, the Spirit-filled Seven of Acts 6 strongly echoes an Old Testament story (in Numbers 11) of the Seventy ELDERS of Israel who were given the Spirit to help Moses when the people grumbled about the food!   I'm not saying the Seven should be called ""elders"", just that ""deacons"" is not necessarily accurate."

According to the Glorious Quran:\n\nAl-Qiyama(The Rising of the Dead)\n\n75: 1.  Nay! I swear by the day of resurrection. \n75: 2.  Nay! I swear by the self-accusing soul.  \n75: 3.  Does man think that We shall not gather his bones?  \n75: 4.  Yea! We are able to make complete his very fingertips  \n75: 5.  Nay! man desires to give the lie to what is before him.  \n75: 6.  He asks: When is the day of resurrection? \n75: 7.  So when the sight becomes dazed, \n75: 8.  And the moon becomes dark,  \n75: 9.  And the sun and the moon are brought together,\n75:10.  Man shall say on that day: Whither to fly to? \n75:11.  By no means! there shall be no place of refuge!  \n75:12.  With your Lord alone shall on that day be the place of rest.
That is very sweet of you to look out for your friends.\n\nThere is a good chance that nothing will ever happen between any of them.\n\nIf by chance, any of the two friends does start to get more serious with this person, then it would be best to warn your friend - but the stars may be in this person's eyes, and he or she may think that you are jealous.  That is why you are warning her or him.\n\nKeep a close watch on them - as you are - but don't make a move until they get into the line of fire.\n\nYour friends will also have to learn who is truly sincere and who is a phony - so you can't always protect them - they need to learn this on their own - even if it hurts - because otherwise, they will make the same mistake over and over again.\n\nGood Luck And God bless you all.

I don't know why, but I could list about 50 things I don't like about you.  I would strugle to get out 5 things I like about you.\nIt seems easier to judge people in a negative way.  It might be something in our nature or instinct, like a defense mechanism.  \nThink like a wolf.  If another wolf comes in your territory, will you go over and play?  Hell no, you'll snap at him before he snaps at you.  You will try to show him your the biggest wolf around.\nWe try to immediately tear people down before we even meet them.  We will snap before being snapped at.  It's human nature.  It takes lots of training and practice to overcome that.\nGood luck.
No. Never for someone disagreeing. If name-calling comes in to play or if peeps type in a short A like *, then they just did it for 2 pts. I've seen that twice tonight. The A that was given usually indicates that the A wasn't  appropriate...gaming for pts... name-calling, etc

Population growth is falling in many parts of the world, and has been for years. Some expect the population to top out around 2060 and then fall for a while.\n\nIn many regions with ongoing population increases, you can blame religions and religious governments (see: GW Bush) that actively work against the use of condoms and other birth control methods.
Doctrinially, it is possible for even a lay Catholic to be nominated a Cardinal. However, in most if not all cases, Bishops are nominated Cardinals.

I myself know six people who've committed suicide...all men....3 relatives, 2 high school friends and one friend from college. I think that everyone has a different method of coping and everyone's method isn't as good as others. And I also think everyone has limits to what they can handle and if people haven't learned how to cope with life's struggles, it's easy to see how they can succumb to suicide.\n\nI've forwarded the following link to friends and acquaintances many times who've said they've reached their limit. I tell them to read just page 5, if not the entire book.\n\nhttp://www.hopeline.com/docs/suicide.pdf#search='suicide%20the%20forever%20decision' \n\nIt's a PDF, so you'll need Acrobat Reader to view it.\n\nThere was a time more than a dozen years ago when I reached my limit and someone who could tell, saved me by asking me to read only page 5. I ended up reading the entire book. And I'm still here, so it must be good stuff.\n\nAnd luckily after surfing the Internet one day I found the book, now free on the Internet as a service to others.\n\n:)

I heard salt works but thats if you put it on your porch. try thretening one with a gun. they will go away pretty fast. anyways it violates freedom of religion for a christian to preach to you.

God is below morality.  I have no clue why anyone would want to spend eternity with him.\n\nGod says in the bible that he is a jealous god.  He even says my name is jealous.
Good story. Full stop. Don't read too much into it and you won't get stressed. Simple.
because they don't know... humans tend to make what they don't know and understand, or are not a part of, evil and/or not being worth joining to begin with. Being a mason you can move to ANY city in the world and go to the local lodge and by the end of the day you could have a job, etc.
Satan doesn't have the power to create according to your religion. The bible says repeatedly that ONLY God has the power to create life. It is impossible for any christian to attribute a living organism to the doing of Satan >PERIOD<\n\nDiseases exist because ours is a random world and bacteria and viruses exist because of whatever reason. Perhaps they were created by an entity, perhaps they evolved. I believe that life may have evolved, and because I believe that I understand that many creatures exist whose sole purpose is to infect host bodies to survive, like many viruses. Do you honestly think a perfect and loving God created these viruses knowing what pain they cause and the fact that they most of them serve no purpose except to harm their hosts? Yeah......no one can quite convince me that he did because it would mean God isn't that kind. \n\nDo you believe God made disease? It is interesting to me that the bible says Jesus went around curing people of their diseases quite often. It seems to me that if Jesus really didn't like to see people suffer, as the bible leads us to believe, that he and his daddy just wouldn't have made disease causing agents when they supposedly created the world to START WITH, but there are so many flaws with the xtian way of thinking I just won't get into that. The question is this, if things happen for a reason, such as many xtians believe that you only get sick because god allows/wants it, why did Jesus go around curing those suffering? Was he not undoing their illness that they got in the first place because he and daddy allowed it in the first place? Deep, but go figure......it doesn't add up.\n\n Viruses are very interesting. They don't have all of the characteristics of living organisms. If you studied biology you might know that. They adopt to most things very well as do bateria and they do evolve ( It is a proven fact) to more deadly strains. That is why this Avian Flu is such a deadly strain. It hasn't always been around and it is very powerful. Do you think a god tweaked the virus so it would become even more deadly and powerful just to aggravate the human population on earth? The only other option is to accept that it just randomly evolved into what it is now, which is how scientists and rational people understand it.\n\nIf there is a God I can't explain some of the awful things he does if he does indeed control everything. I prescribe to Agnosticism, which means I am not so sure there is a god, so I don't have to make up excuses for the unfair and insidious way the world works and make biblegod look good at the same time like you poor xtians do.\n\nKeeping in with the christian viewpoint I am sure you hold, God made all living things, and that would have to include the virus and bacteria, therefore all illnesses caused by those organisms can be attributed to him.\n\nGod is such a nice dude if he is real.
"The text says that Judas did not betray Jesus, but that Jesus asked Judas to make the sacrifice of turning him over. That's the basic idea. \n\nHowever, the gospel of Judas is not credible. Scientists believe it to be the work of gnostics, a mystical early Christian denomination. People in those times did not have the access to the scriptures as we do today. They rarely had more than one or two books of the Bible at one time, so they often did not know what the other parts said. Gnostics often wrote stories of the way they thought things might be. The gospel of Judas is a philosophical conjecture, not scripture. It was also written at least 100 years after the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John - the 4 gospels present in the Bible that tell of Judas's betrayal.\nAlso, because ""gospel"" means ""good news"", and the good news is that Jesus died for our sins, the text would have to include the crucifixion and resurrection to be classified as a gospel. The gospel of Judas tells of neither. \n\nThe gospel of Judas has indeed been authenticated - that means that it is indeed as old as it seems. It does not mean that it is a work of scripture. If you want to back up what I have said, go to the link for the National Geographic Channel and either watch for the next show date of their special, or order the video. You can also read the text at this site."
"I think you may be confusing things a little here.  You're really asking to very different questions without a purpose.  The Spiritualist movement of the early 20th century started out being about communicating with loved ones who had died.  Although some mediums were the genuine article (they could 'talk with the dead'), most were in it strictly for the money they got by fleecing wealthy and usually elderly women looking to talk with their dead husbands.  If you want an idea about this, rent the DVD ""Ghost"" with Whoopi Goldberg.  To the best of my knowledge, they do not hold a specific belief about 'elements', such as fire (or water, etc.).\n\nNow, if you want to focus your 'energies', that's another question all together.  You're not talking about 'stones', per say, you're really asking about crystals.  Again, the question is way too broad to even address here.  I've provided a link below that may illuminate you (only one of many online).  I HIGHLY recommend not 'playing' with things you don't know about.  Try to find a couple books...better yet, take a class!\n\nGood Luck,\nRev Debi Brady\nMetaphysical Minister"
Did somebody see Thnk you for Smoking?\n\nAlcohol.\n\nAlcohol-related crashes are the second leading cause of death. Alcohol use is linked with deaths by drowning, fires, suicide and homicide(not always guns, but knives, bats, etc.) Alcohol consumption during pregnancy has been known to cause miscarraiges and stillborns. Alcohol causes severe liver and kidney damage which is known to result in premature death.  Alcohol poisoning.\n\nI am looking for the site where i found this information and this is not US alone it was worldwide statistics, the US it is 2nd to smoking also.

In Bolivia, Mestizo refers to someone who is mixed Native American and european.  There's also an unspoken caste system that implies the less Native you are the more privilege you are.  Kind of like here in the US where white folks receive more preferential treatment over Minorities.\n\nI'm sure if you take away the Native blood that there really wouldn't be much of a person at all.  As the european blood makes up only a small small fraction of it.\n\nHere in the US, many Native American groups include those of mixed backgrounds up to a certain %.  Why aren't they called Mestizo?..to be simply put,  because they choose not to.   They either choose to be of that Native group or part (big or small) of that Native group or even exclude that side all together.   It's really up to how that individual identifies with.  The reason why the term Mestizo isn't used is because of language.  In the Americas Mestizo is mostly used by Spanish/Portuguese while here in the US we say things like Mixed or Other... etc.
of course its rude, but shes trying something i refer to as being passive aggresive, try it back on her a few times. never let her see you sweat kiddo
I so agree that god loves us unconditionally,,but it's the people that don't,love one another,,,would you believe that people are kinda looking down on you,if you are from the north part of united states or south,,it's as if the civil war is still on,,wow,,and that is starting from our leaders or management or whatever,,,sad
If it's dressed properly, yes it can become established.  If you put it out there in it's formal syllogistic format, you won't sell it.  Dress it up with flowery language and kill some people who doubt it every once in a while, and you grant it legitimacy.  Would that humans could always break things down logically and reject those things that don't meet the basic tenets of logical validity.  It saddens me that people are swayed by logical fallacies on a daily basis.\n\nOh, and I took that as an invitation to report abuse, so I reported you Wayknow T.  Have a nice day.

Whether you believe in Adam or Eve or that man descended from some primitive Ape-like man, at some point there had to be incest.  Mankind has 46 chromosomes.  Apes have 48.  If mankind resulted from a genetic mutation, there still had to be incest within the first few individuals in order to propogate this mutation.\nIncest is only wrong in that it can cause mutations which are recessive to be displayed.  Incest is therefore forbidden in order to prevent birth defects and aberrations.
"I think they are very relevant to toady. Apart from the religious side, the bible speaks of ending oppression and slavery, treating everyone else as equal, etc. none of which have yet been achieved. In fact, politically and socially it is far more radical than any government that has ever existed.\n\nIf you believe that God does exist this adds another dimension; God doesn't ""go out of fashion"" and he doesn't ""need to get with the times"", as He created time itself. Therefore, it is still very relevant on that level."

No, it's not compulsory for British princes to get military training. At one point it was traditional for the second son to join the services and doing so was seen as a suitable 'occupation' for them and some have made a career of it. Prince Harry has wanted to be a soldier since he was a child so his joining the services right out of school is not surprising. \n\nPrince William went to University before deciding on military training. It's unlikely that he will see combat but the training that he receives will serve him well when he becomes King. As Sovereign, he will automatically become head of the armed services.
We're never told to pray to anyone except to God. When the disciples asked Jesus to show them how to pray, He directed them to the Father. Not to angels or other beings. You're free to follow opinions but you're better off following the infallible word and example of Jesus. Who did Jesus always pray to? The Father.

"I can understand a lesbian not liking men and therefore not liking gay men since we are a subset of men -- -- but not liking JUST gay men or thinking its wrong.\n\nThat's frankly very hypocritical -- although I imagine it comes out of the idea that men are there 'for women'  -- are you sure she's really a lesbian and not some sort of a pseudo-lesbian who ""decided"" to be a lesbian no matter what her body felt or wanted?   People who don't follow what is natural for them, for any reason -- are usually pretty f**ked up, and I've known some WAP women who weren't really lesbians, but lived as them.

Being a true Christian means more than just accepting Jesus Christ into your heart as your Lord and Savior.  It means putting nothing else in life ahead of Him.  It means keeping your relationship with God open and strong.  Its never doubting your faith.  Its going out there and witnessing to others about the goodness of our God and telling people how He has worked in your own life.
Yeah, the bunch of ungrateful guys
"Well......there are so many......and I look like a lady, so the best thing is the shock value!!! \n\nThis is a good question, it's got me thinking. I have strong feelings about this!!! I really do not like it when people use c**t as a form of abuse - because its abusive to women. I  know there are male equivalent, but as a woman I don't mind so much....and though I'm not a Christian, I don't like religious words used for swearing.....apart from that, anything goes.\n\nI didn't want my infant son to swear, so I started saying ""Oh BASINGSTOKE!!!"" all the time, and it worked...if he said it, I said ""Shhh! Don't say that!"" just like a normal parent would if their child said fuck. He grew up OK but I've probably offended a lot of people who live in Basingstoke.\n\nI like it when people are creative and don't just say one thing all the time, because it loses its impact.\n\nI guess my favourite swear word changes every so often, but probably the main one is Oh Sh*t... I'm going to think about this some more and invent some new ones."

give everything you own away travel to a remote island and live of the land and sea take only some pens and a lot of paper write about your exsperiances in life and return after 2 yrs go on oprah and sell  a gasillion copies give it all away and do it again people are so nosey if they havent been able to keep track of you they will pay anything for your story good luck in life and have a happy 50th birthday  i am still a few years behind you so tell me about it in your book.whoops who  to give the money to i know have a monument built to yourself and a huge plack exclaiming your wonderfull accomplishments in life so far . the second time a bigger monument if nothing exciting comes to mind to place on the placks spend some money on a wildadventure  baloon across america naked or somethng out of the ordinary fly a kite along the california coast line it would take a while and draw lots of attention to you as you tell people along the way what you are doing.like when i saw the movie forest gump people i think would follow someone back and forth accross america just to be part of something  because in the end we are what we make of our lives. make yourself a good one.follow your own path if you know what it is or try what i suggested it can't hurt any.
I'm so sorry to hear that.  I know you're hurt and feel betrayed...because you have been.  Give your friend his space and don't strike out at him.  He's probably embarrassed that he gave in to an impulse he could not resist.  His rejection of you is not because he's not interested in you -- he just can't face himself.  Give him time and with enough understanding and patience he may realize you guys can still be friends.

"The bible was written in Hebrew which is a figurative language and Greek, and unlike English words, words in these two languages can have different possessive meanings compared to their corresponding English words. \n\nFor example while in the English translation of the bible the blanket word for every form of love is ""love"", in the Hebrew and Greek, the words used for love will determine what kind of love is being referred to. Love can be described as phileo, storg, agape eros etc, these names are all called love in the English but mean different things in the Hebrew and Greek. \n\nThe words used for the English ""son"" in the Hebrew and Greek for the scriptures above refers to in for example in 1Chron.22:10, 2Sam.7:14  is (Ben), which refers to a son who is a builder of the family name in the widest sense. But the words that describe Jesus as a son of God in (John.13:31, 14:13, Rom.1:3-4, 8:29,32) is (huios) which is a son, used very widely of immediate, remote or figurative kinship.\n\nWhat i am trying to say is that Jesus is the only begotten son of God. Every other persons called son are at the highest adopted sons of God or just figurative sons of God. Adopted as in adopted because of what Jesus did on the cross of Calvary. Its like me saying my friend's son is my son, figuratively i am correct but it is not true biologically."

Please take note that the Islamic religion does not support terrorism in any way. However, the reason most of the terrorists that we know of are Muslim is because the Middle East is where the most terrorists are currently coming from. Since the main religion there is Islam, it's just a very negative affect on the rest of the Muslims. Some people still believe that our own government was behind the 9/11 attacks.

"Possibly you can find solace in the following:\n\nDo can refer to:\n\nIn English, do is a verb whose use as an auxiliary verb is often grammatically required for negation and for interrogative sentences. \n\nIn solfege, do is the name of the first note of the scale. The note C in the Major scale of music. (See also Middle C). \n\nThe Chinese character 道 (Pinyin: dào; Wade-Giles: tao⁴), which is pronounced dō in Japanese and do (도) in Korean. Its primary meaning is ""road"" or ""way,"" and derivative meanings include ""Daoism,"" ""province,"" and the very general meaning of ""circuit."" \n\nIn Korea, Do is the designation for ""province,"" as in Gyeonggi-do (경기도; 京畿道). See Provinces of Korea. \n\nIn Japan, Dō means ""circuit,"" when used in the name of Hokkaido (北海道) prefecture. See Prefectures of Japan. \n\nIn Japan, the character also means ""road,"" as in Tokaido (東海道) and Nakasendo (中山道). \n\nIt is used as a suffix for various arts and implies that they are not just techniques but have spiritual elements. In this circumstance it is usually translated as ""the way of."" For example, Japanese tea ceremony is called ""Sado"" (茶道) and flower arrangement is called ""Kado"" (華道), these translate to ""the way of tea"" and ""the way of flowers"" respectively. Since the Meiji era, Japanese martial artists have adopted this suffix for names of martial arts such as Aikido, Judo and Kendo.

Naamah, the daughter of Lamech, descendant of Cain. (Genesis 4:22). \nNaamah, a woman identified in the Midrash Genesis Rabbah as the wife of Noah, who is not named in the Tanakh. However, the 17th century theologian John Gill identified Naamah as the name of the wife of Ham, son of Noah, whom he believed may have become confused with Noah's wife. The wife of Noah is identified in the Book of Jubilees as Emzara. See Wives aboard the Ark. \nNaamah, a city of Canaan, listed in the Book of Joshua (at 15:41), as having been conquered and subsequently settled by the Tribe of Judah. The city may possibly have been a tributary of the Canaanite royal city of Makkedah. \nNaamah, an Ammonite wife of King Solomon, and mother of his heir, Rehoboam, according to both 1 Kings 14:21, 31, and 2 Chronicles 12:13. She is the only one of Solomon's wives to be mentioned, within the Tanakh, as having borne a child. \nNaamah, an angel of prostitution, one of the succubus mates of the demon Samael in Zoharistic Qabalah. She is the mother of divination. This Naamah is generally regarded as being the daughter of Lamech; how she became a demon is unclear. In Gnostic Kabbalah, she is called Nahemah. \nNaamah, one of the Companions of Elua in Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel's Legacy saga. \nNaaman is the masculine version of the name; a Syrian army commander by this name appears in the Book of Kings.
"Why does this kind of nonsense puzzle people?\n\nLook, the whole Jesus story reads a little too much like old Greek legends.  Hercules was half human, half god.  No big deal.\n\nThe fact that Jesus was god, or semi-god, but still could be killed by a bunch of Jews/Romans...what kind of god is that?  Or that people make a fuss if Jesus did something actually human like had sex or fathered children...why?  I would not worship some god that appeared to be human and ended up getting killed as a virgin in his mid 30s.  \n\nThe inane ""Da Vinci Code"" crowd, of course thinks Jesus's children were the Merovingians, some Frankish (French) kings with long hair.  Whop de de.  I imagine if Jesus had children, they would like middle eastern kids--like Israelis or Palestinian kids.  But would they have their daddy's ""magic""?  Leave me alone.  It doesn't matter.  Look outside.  This world is a mess.  If Jesus had kids, they didn't do a very good job against the forces of evil."

I think it is prophesied that because they hated Jesus they would hate his followers.  Let's face it, who more closely follows what Christ asked the entire population to do but the Jehovah's Witnesses.  This evil system is misleading people so the Witnesses are feared because they ask for nothing and volunteer to go door-to-door providing accurate Bible studies.  \n\nI'm not a Witness, but I have big respect for their service. I've seen families divide over a Witness not participating in holidays and the like, but they are actually practicing what they preach.  \n\nMost people want to warm a church seat, that is easier than actually applying the Word of God into your life and living without sin.
Even I'm scared about this. ;-)

Christians know that they don't have to memorize the Holy Bible word for word, it should be interpreted and understood with the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Without that guidance, the interpretation can be as numerous as the stars in the sky and the understanding can be as wide as the universe. In other words, those who attempt to interpret it by himself without the help of the Holy Spirit can even create a different story which sometimes lead to the foundation of new christian churches. Hence, the protestants, Seventh day Adventists, the Baptists, the Mormons (Latter Day Saints) and more. Now, Born again Christians are becoming the trend. All point to the Catholic Church as a Doomsday Church. But if we try to observe, the Catholic church never ever tried to show resentment with all the negative propaganda against it. Instead, it always try to preach forgiveness and unity no matter how offensive the accusation it has faced since then.\n\nWhat actually opened the gate to the different Biblical versions is nothing more than the upholding of human freedom. Freedom is a very delicate but admittedly the best possession man can ever have. Absolute freedom is precious to those who understand the positve attributes of it but likewise can become a dangerous social factor to those who refuse to respect it and would otherwise abuse it instead. \n\nWith freedom at hand, human mind was freed from the bondage of the past. It gave him the power to think freely, speak freely, believe freely and to choose freely. It freed the human mind from fear, anger, disillusionment, mental suppression and instead encouraged it to be creative, intuitive, critical, argumentative, reasonable, resourceful and productive. Thus, it is easy to see now why people have created airplanes, ocean vessels, space shuttles etc. including the discovery of the different sect coming from the one Christian Church of Jesus Christ as the Head. Can you see now what freedom can do? But all are individually answerable to God no matter what he or she believes and practice in his or her lifetime because a religion can never save you, it can only guide you towards God but the choice will always be yours. \n\nI am a Roman Catholic and I believe I too has accountability towards God and whatever God decides for me at the end of time, I will wholeheartedly accept because I know I can never question Him and It is Him who alone can save me.

"Austin's famous saying is ""Keep Austin Weird"" and it is definately true.

I went to college for 3 years just 30 minutes south of austin 2 years ago and it was great. 6th st is where all the big clubs are, well, 4th st is where most of the gay clubs are, and they have some really good ones that encompass all parts of the glbt community and every genre of music! if you moved there i would think you would really like it, course i dont know where you are moving from. i personally love texas and cant imagine living anywhere else again, even though the gay marriage amendment didnt pass, im not moving! hope all goes well, if you move hit me up! we could totally hang out!"
Overcrowding is one.\n\nLack of harsher penalties would be an obvious reason. They should make it a mandatory, MANDATORY 5 years for a sex crime, whether the victim was a child or an adult, you should always get at least 5 years. Repeat offenders, well..I think if you get caught twice doing something that bad, then they should castrate you, or at least 50 years, NO possibility of parole.
I saw the trailer for that new movie Al Gore filmed about global warming. I can't recall what it was called. Looks very good and very eye opening. \n\nWhat is really sad though is that we were learning about global warming back in 1994 (and sooner I imagine) during my early college days. \n\nI fear we have caused too much damage to our environment. \n\nSweet dreams. lol.\n\nEDIT. I THOUGHT YOU WERE ASKING FOR IDEAS THAT YOU MIGHT  DREAM ABOUT. SORRY. There is no way to ensure your dreams. Sorry for the weird answer.
At the moment that Jesus said those words, God the Father could no longer look at Jesus because the sins of the human race were on him.
I apologize, but it took me some training over the years to have the courage to say I'm sorry and understand that it does not make me inferior, on the contrary, it makes me a better person to admit my mistakes.
Well, how about using birth control like we are allowed to do?  Condoms are allowed.  God cares about our health, which is why he prohibited us from drinking and eating certain things.  For example, a woman just has a baby.  Right away, she gets pregnant again and that baby is born sickly and has many problems.  Right after that baby, another is born with even more problems.  Islam says we can not harm one another and we can not harm ourselves.  Women need time to recover from childbirth, and it's in the best interest of the next child so that it will be healthy and strong.  The mother also needs to get her strength back.  So, islamically, condoms are allowed.\n\nIf you are HIV positive, I think you should tell your spouse and get a divorce.  Don't take the chance of passing this on to him/her or your children.  Just think about them, care about them, think about their future and leave.
There are degrees of racism and we can't get over that fact.  Racism is a human trait that is fueled by our own fears.

"You have good instincts.  At one time, only Bishops were allowed to preach.  Even priests were not allowed to interpret the bible.  I think there was a reason for this, but it escapes me at the moment.  Truly, then, you needed to fervently pray for that person who did the interpreting.  This followed along the lines of the Hebrew priesthood, where the scrolls were handled by the descendants of Aaron, who had to be perfect in body and soul before he even touched the scrolls.  That's where the word ""Aryan"" and ""Iran"" come from.  Perfection before God.  Aaron, the priest chosen by God.  Scary, isn't it?"

Yeah I agree that the parents need to know. She is only 14 and does not know what marriage really means at that age. GIRL TELL YOUR PARENTS NOW! She will be mad but eventually she'll get over it.

"WE can't, but individuals can. Our society right now is incredibly casual compared to other times in history. We no longer dress up to go out except to meat market clubs, restraunts don't enforce dress codes or manners.

Christianity doesn't teach manners except in the ""turn the other cheek love thy neighbor way"" that most christians don't seem to know about."

"the road is the path you are on in life, the wooded areas are the snares and brambles, troubles and temptations that are around you..you ran out of gas which means spiritually you were to a point that you were drained, and couldn't go forward in the ""vehicle"" that you had made it that far in...that vehicle could be a specific church, or a doctrine from a church, maybe even another religion...the hill is the battle to find the truth of GOD...the perception of time that it takes to get to the service station symbolizes the amount of time totally that you have spent seeking and pushing forward...there may have been times that you sought, then stopped seeking, then started again...the black panther stalking you was the enemy-he thought by isolating you that you were unprotected..the fact that the Alpha wolf howled was a call to the warrior angelic host to intervene and keep you from the claws of the enemy...JESUS walks with us, protects us and leads us back to the power source, FATHER GOD."
No, if there was no money at all and everything was free, there would be no such thing as stealing.
OK I am an atheist, but I have spent a LONG time reading up about religion so I figured I could answer this question as well as anyone else.\n\nI guess this question is easier to answer if you believe Genesis as being absolutely true, in which case humans haven't existed for very long (despite all the evidence I must say!) in which case there were no ancient people as the human race started with Adam and Eve, both of whom knew of the existence of God.\n\nIf you believe that Christianity is an man-made 'invention', as you question suggests, then it doesn't matter about those before as its just make-believe anyway! \n\nAs for all the Christians out there who don't believe in Creationism then you need to re-read your bible with the understanding that it is 'the word of God'.

Because all they see is the tv, nintendo or pc. Blame their parents.  Monkey see, monkey do.  If the parents are active and creative then the children will be too.  I see this in very young children.  My kid is 16 mos. and loves to watch (and chase) birds, pick flowers, throw balls, play on the swing set, and 'read'.  When she goes to the daycare for an hour while I work out she plays with the toys (what a novel idea!) while most of the other kids her age are zoned out to the boob tube.  The fact is that technology is an easier way to entertain a child while creative play sometimes takes some fresh ideas from Mom and Dad.

When I asked my dad that he told me there is no God, and told me that he has always wondered why man is so vain to presume that there is a God who had made us in his image? Why are we all different shapes and colour and sizes? He said the only thing about the bible that had any credence was the creation myth, if the Earth was truly made in 6 days it would explain why there were so many problems in the world, as God clearly didn't put any thought or planning into it.

"Absolutely more important to live as Christ. It's sad, but sometimes ""church-goers"" can be rather judgemental and this makes outsiders feel less welcome to the whole church scene. That defeats what a church should want, which is to pull in those from the outside and worship one with another, as they say. However, I feel that every religion is just going on what they've come to believe, because someone else, like their parents, told them to. No one really knows what is true or not. That's why it's called faith. As far as the Bible goes, everyone has their own interpretation of what it means. How are we to know what is right. Therefore, I think those so obsessed about the ""religion"" of it are missing what is really important- what God, or Christ, or whatever you call that source, would want. Obsessing over religion leads to separation, fighting, wars, and as we've seen in recent years, horrible acts of violence. What a shame, I believe. I know this is because people feel so passionately about religion, but if they'd only feel that passion for their fellow humans, and for love, then that would be something to be proud of. What a wonderful world that would be! Often, people are just brainwashed, especially as with the terrorists who believe they are doing ""God's"" work?! I mean how do you come to that conclusion without severe brainwashing, unless you were just nuts to begin with. I believe that ""God"" as what we know that to be, would generally just want us to live by the golden rule- treat others as you want to be treated. Just so u know, I've been raised in church all my life, christian faith, and I still attend with my child, my husband, and my family. However, as I've grown older, I have my own feelings and beliefs that would probably not fit with the church's. I know God loves me anyway. I know my heart is good."
"Gnosticism is heresy. Here are two outstanding features which invalidate this ""view"".\n\n1) The dichotomy of man is infact two parts, however they do combine for a man. What is done to the spirit affects the whole, not just the spirit and vice versa. \n\n2) If there was a secret knowledge to get into Heaven, why then, when Jesus was on the cross did he tell the robber he would see him in paradise? There was no knowledge passed on."

Sexually abusing a child means a kid is forced into doing something against his or her will, hence the touching in an involuntary way and serviced by the abuser to sexually exploit a child's body. Male and female child can both be treated sexual wise by man or woman.
"I do believe in a higher power than myself... things are put together all too well to not have some force behind it. My problem is with organized religion. You don't have to go to a church to be in god's house just walk outside that is the house that was created for us. Think about the savage acts that we carried out ""in the name of god"" the crusades, 9/11, ect. ect. it goes on through out history. I personally don't believe that this is what the higher power had intended. That is my ""issue"" with god and I would imagine that I am not the only one."
"The Chinese characters work very well for Chinese because Chinese has no suffixes on its words.  But when Chinese writing was borrowed into Japanese it didn't work so well because Japanese sentences REQUIRE the Japanese suffixes.  You can't write suffixes with Chinese characters, which the Japanese called Kanji.\n\nSo the Japanese invented a set of symbols, a syllabary, to represent the Japanese suffixes to follow the Kanji characters.  Actually, two different sets developed, the hiragana, which is more ornate and is often called the ""woman's hand"", and the katagana, which is simpler in form.\n\nIn modern Japanese, the word stem is written in Kanji, and the suffixes are written in either hiragana (in literature oriented towards women) or katagana (in business writing and literature oriented towards men and children).  Foreign words are written phonetically in katagana.  Sometimes you even see the Roman alphabet for words that are recognizable."

"There is nothing wrong with wanting a deeper relationship with God. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with a person wanting to throw out their make-up and jewelry because THEY believe that it inhibits their relationship with God.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with following the Bible. Jesus said, ""If you love me, keep my commandments.""\n\nA person's convictions are their own. That is where God wants them to be at a certain point in their lives. And it doesn't matter if that conviction is strange, like not having a T.V. or computer. That is their belief based upon the leading of the Holy Spirit in their lives. \n\nThe trouble is when people get personal convictions mixed up with Biblical standards of Christian living and morals.\n\nA Christian does not have the right to decide where another is in their walk with God. They do not have the right to decide that Sis. Sally and Bro. Bob are leagalistic because they dress a little more conservatively. The only people, I believe, that have the right to correct the saints of God are those who are set in authority over them, i.e. the elders, the decons, the bishops, the pastor/minister."

I read the NT years ago and bits and pieces of the KJV recently.  The more I read, the less I believed it was the right religion or Path for me.  So yes, I would recommend someone to read a bit of the bible (not neccessarily all) if they are searching, so they can make a INFORMED decision on whether Jesus is to be in their lives or not.  :-)  It has been my personal experience that informed decisions have more power than uninformed decisions in someone's life.   Excellent question!

Its a difficult question this!\n\n30+ sunscreen is the sensible answer. But I find if I just do this then I get terrible heat rash and sun blotches.\n\nI find personally if I have a few sunbed tanning sessions before I go on hols, (I know its not good for you but I dont think heat rash and blotches are that good for us either. lol) Then I have a tanning treatment such as St Tropez. So I look lovely and tanned before I get there. THEN I still use 30+ protection for the first few days and drop the sun protection factor gradually.\n\nWhenever I do this I come back home with a nice tan. I dont burn and I dont get the very embarrassing rash and blotch effect?\n\nHope this helps

Which one has more experience. I couldn't tell u. But Islam only evolved about 1400 years ago. So, by looking at the fact, maybe (not necessarily be correct) Christian has more experience than Islam.\n\nLooking at the history books, Islam won over Christian in Crusade's War. But based on current situations, maybe Christian will win. The Christian nations have arsenal of weapon of mass destructions . They have from Stealth bombers, submarines, Tomahawk missiles, carpet bomb, atomic bomb and the most fearful, the hydrogen bomb. There is no way that (using rational thinking) that Muslim nations can win against them. \n\nBut u have to note something which is very important. The black golds. Muslim countries are blessed with unlimited oil resources. Should Christian want to fight Islam, they have to find another fuel first. Otherwise, their tanks, coppers, and birds will not move in battlefield.\n\nLast but not least, from Adam until now, history has a bad habit of repeating itself. So, once again, Christian might stumble again just like in the Crusade. Who knows.\n\nBut talking about war, shouldn't we talk about peace. What they don't realise that all they have to do is drop their guns and shake each other hands . It is just simple as that. It is frustating that they failed to realize that.
As professionals they know exactly how to behave, in medical a person must be dedicated for the job, or else is no good at all.

Ecstasy isn't 100% legal but bars will test it for you to check purity, Cannabis, Hash, thujone but you can get that in most of Europe in Absinthe.\nMushrooms are totally legal even in the UK but have to be sold fresh not dried fresh they are considered produce.\nKhat also sold fresh, Salvia, Speed Benzedrine, Dexedrine, amopholiphedirne and meth amphetamine is not 100% legal but again you can have it tested in bars for about 1 euro\nThey will tell you what it is and how pure it is.\nCocaine is very frowned upon and heroin is forbidden.\nI never gone to Holland to buy or take drugs but I have been there on a company trip a few times and asked the same questions. It was a working weekend so no party on the company

"It has been historically proven that the Bible, the entire Bible, is historically accurate.  Which therefore proves that yes, He really did die on the cross.  He did rise again from the dead three days later.  For anyone to become a Christian, all you have to do is believe that Jesus is the Son of God, that He came to the earth as a man, took on all the sins of the world and died out of love for us on the cross.  You have to believe that He rose again from the dead on the third day and now is in heaven with God.  Jesus said, ""I am the Way, the Truth and the Life.  No one comes to the Father (God) but through Me.""  The choice to believe, to accept Jesus into your heart and life, that is what makes you a Christian."

When you put it that way, you sound pretty convincing. I had always thought the urge to convert was done out of 'kindness', but perhaps it is one of the inevitable outcomes of following a meme.
"clueless_clown,\n\nThe Old Testament law was easier to follow than the New Testament. Those who paint Christianity as easy very often do a disservice to those who listen. In the New Testament, we will be judged for our words and actions and our motivation and our endurance. We will be held accountable for what we did with what we received. We have been given much and much is required.\n\nThe New Testament gospel teaches righteousness that is a gift. We are given the freedom of innocence whether we understand it or not. We can respond to God with obedience and fulfill the law. Jesus said that if we love God with all our heart, soul, mind and strength and love our neighbors as ourselves, then we have kept the law. We are not immune from the law, but are responsible for keeping a higher law that takes into account our motivation. We are expected to love. We are given everything that we need to succeed, and we will be judged accordingly. Jesus said that He can tell who is going to heaven and who is not by whether we love our neighbor. Let’s read His words:\n\n""When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, He will sit on His throne in heavenly glory. All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will put the sheep on His right and the goats on His left. \n\nThen the King will say to those on His right, 'Come, you who are blessed by My Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave Me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave Me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited Me in, I needed clothes and you clothed Me, I was sick and you looked after Me, I was in prison and you came to visit Me.' \n\nThen the righteous will answer Him, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You something to drink? When did we see You a stranger and invite You in, or needing clothes and clothe You? When did we see You sick or in prison and go to visit You?' \n\nThe King will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of Mine, you did for Me.' \n\nThen He will say to those on His left, 'Depart from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave Me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave Me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite Me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe Me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after Me.' \n\nThey also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help You?'   \n\nHe will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for Me.' Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life."" Matthew 25:31-46\n\nGod bless."

Id trust science over religion any day.
"I think it means ""being done with your work"", so Heaven. Since God's rest came when His work was done, so we will too. The Sabbath is just a way to observe God's day of rest until we go through it in Heaven. I think.... so God bless you and I hope this will help."
Most of the time I don't, because judging by the answer they give, I assume they are children.  But sometimes I get rude answers (not very many, though), and I e-mail them to see what their problem was.  Most of the time we laugh it off.
NO BUT. \nIf I swore you were an angel,\nWould you treat me like the devil tonight
"Yes, I do.  However, even the most diligent parent can have a child who is just so strong-willed that it is a constant battle.\n\nI have a 17 yr old son who is saved, believes in God, but is yet to mature enough to see the value in ""honor thy mother and thy father"".  It is a constant battle.  We do control the keys, though, and that helps :) !\n\nI wish that my husband would have taken more of a lead in the spirituality department with our kids, but I know that they are going to be alright, and that they have the right moral values to use when things get tough for them."
I agree with you that ex-muslims who admit publicly that they are no longer believers are very brave.\n\nHow brave it is, to risk your life by admitting you are an ex-muslim.  For every one that admits it, how many are justifiably afraid to admit it?
whether your a giver or a taker its just heaven and hell,heaven and hell.
Even though life sucks sometimes, I try to think it will not always suck.  So, no, i would not erase myself from this life.
surely its more to do with the effectiveness of the pill. in britain you can take it upto 72 hours later, but if you wait that long its only 50% as likely to prevent pregnancy than if you take it straight away.\n\ni think its more to do with the fact that the longer you leave it, the more likely it is that the embryo will have planted itself in the uterine lining, and that the body will have signalled the release of progesterone - the pregnancy hormone. after this time, you are pregnant, and only a much stronger pill that will cuase contractions of the unterus to dispell the embryo, will work.
I agree that our society is hypocritical, but i don't think that is a good example as my 7 year old knows killing is wrong, but definately is too young for any adult behaviour. At 15 we should be held accountable for killing... that is not something that only adults should know. At 15 we do know right from wrong and murder is murder!\nI do however agree that we are hypocrites and it is frustrating for teenagers who are in so many ways treated like an adult, and in so many ways considered a child! But that's adolescence- somewhere in between, and very lost! It is such a hard time, and i wouldn't want to go back to the problems that go on in your head when you're a teenager. But saying that, i remember life being a blast once i reached about 17- so there's something to look forward to.

I am European and I wrote my 7 (with line) because that's how I learned it at school. That way it's easier to distinguish from 1, which was a pointy top.\n\nNow I live in the UK and my 7s still have their line, but my 1s are just a dash now:\n\nONE = |\nSEVEN = 7 with dash\n\nIt's all a matter of teaching how to write. Does ZERO take a dash or not? How to we write AMPERSAND (&)? It's just different printing standards that probably date back centuries ago and that have carried out now...

"Okay, first of all- most ""psychics"" out there don't have the gift in reality.  Second, you can't become a psychic just by sleeping with one.  Third,  it sounds like your psychic was one who was good at interpreting cards, but had no real gift.  Be happy you didn't have relations, you would more than likely have been taken advantage of.\n\nPS- in an attempt to illuminate a few people: just because you have psychic abilities it doesn't mean that you know everything.  I think they summed it up best in the movie ""Stir of Echoes""...  Psychic abilities are like a flashlight.  Everyone has one, but not everyone's batteries work.  Of those who's batteries do work, not all of their lightbulbs are the brightest, you know?"
Go get a second opinion. If the second opinion confirms the first, your doctors most probably are right. If the second opinion does NOT confirm the first, you are right.

do not wear denim jeans with a denim jacket! that would make you look like a poor cowboy. Khakis would be okay or courdaroy. Nothing pleeted.
I would wish for my husband to come home and we can finally have a family.  Life is to short and if you have someone special please spend as much time together cause you never know when it can be taken away from you.  And pray for better days until peace love and togetherness is one.
"""in the nick of time - It means, of course, at the critical or precise moment; just at the instant when our hero was saved at the last moment from onrushing death, for example.\n\n\n The expression about three centuries old, formed when someone added the redundant 'of time' to the older expression, 'in the nick,' which meant the same thing. \n\nA nick is a groove, a notch, as made with a sharp knife when one cuts a V in a stick of wood. Nothing could express precision more accurately than a notch so formed, especially when applied to time."""

"This is a different answer than many you will receive.  If you dont' want any remaining preconceptions challenged DO NOT CONTINUE READING.\n\n-----\n\nNow if you are still with me.  The Bible is, while a very nice book that is the basis (in one form or another) the basis of the three great monotheistic faiths of the West -- actually a book of myths, and some of them are pretty horrid myths.\n\nThe earth is not flat, it does not have corners, and it is not established on pillars.  Beetles do not have four legs, they have six.  Rabbits do not chew their cuds, they have none.  Ai and Jericho were both abandoned when the Israelites came to them and Jericho NEVER was walled.  Oddly, though a million Jews (more or less) marched around the wilderness for 40 years and ALL died there, we cannot find a single skeleton from the march, even though we have found the remains of tribes of 200 non-semites in the same area. Pi really DOES work, and a perfectly round pool cannot be made that uses a pi of 3.0 rather than 3.14 -- it would leak through a gap in the side.\n\nThe god of the old testament, almost certainly either a rendition of one of the great Annunaki of the Sumerians or of Ra of the Egyptians, is a monster who cannot possibly deserve worship, even if real.  He accepts human sacrifice, demands genocides, and wipes the faces of his priests with dung.  He is, in very real terms, anthropomorphic, having a palace on top of the firmament (the dome covering the earth) where he keeps snow and hail ""against the time of troubles""  (war???)  [If you want to read up on this type of thing, there is a fair list on the site I maintain.  Go to www.rebuff.org and read the three pages under bible on the left hand menu.]\n\nThe short version of what I am saying is -- its myth.  Fairy stories, like Grimm's and like Santa Claus.  Furthermore, Christianity, despite what you have been told, was not HISTORICALLY based on the Bible as you know it.  The canon was not established universally in anything resembling a form you would recognize until the Council of Carthage, hundreds of years after Christ.  The early church had 40 gospels, but no one church had more than one book or maybe a very few.  Often a gospel, or a letter -- or sometimes nothing at all.  Different bishops wrote different canons, just as they had different theologies (gnostic/anti-gnostic for example). The Council of Nice (Nicea) established the creed by vote, and many things (trinity) won by only one or two votes.  Divine inspiration?  Not unless you count assasination, quite a few occurred connected to Nice and to Carthage.\n\nThe idea that the Bible is infallible is no different from the idea the Pope is, and it is even newer.  \n\nSo, should you be concerned?  No.  If you want a Christian community to belong to then, if you are protestant, look for a United Church of Christ congregation, or a morelight presbyterian, or contact me and I will suggest more.  If you are wanting to experiment with a more traditional liturgy, try calling your local Episcopal diocese and asking to be recommended to a parish that is welcoming to gays.  Don't be afraid, just ask.  If you are near Pittsburgh -- maybe not, that bishop is nuts, so is ours in Albany but not so badly -- most are ok.\n\nHope that all helps.  Don't worry, you won't go to hell.  God knows that the Bible is a myth.\n\nRegards,\n\nReynolds Jones\nSchenectady, NY\nhttp://www.rebuff.org"
"Turkish people are mostly from Mongolia and they aren't really ""yellow"" (which is btw more or less Chinese). They also assimilated with others like Greeks, Arabs, other Europeans..Also my roommate was Turkish and he wasn't yellow, so I say white."
Oooh yes, yes i do what you got in mind?
"The only way I can see to do so, is to propose a question like this to them.  It IS blatantly obvious to the rest of us, but until you can get them to understand this basic principle, all other arguments are lost on them.\n\nThey will always retreat into the ""I have my faith"" cave otherwise.\n\nExcellent question.\n\n\nEdit - The funny thing is, you can see by some of the responses here, they're actually using this argument right now, and they don't even realize they're doing it.  Absolutely incredible."
"First the author of the Davinci Code did not study the bible or theology.  He wrote it as a work of fiction.  Second why your first fact is true, it does not mean that Jesus had a wife.  If the bible would say that he had a wife Christan's would not have a problem with it.  You can't add on to Jesus story just because you think this or think that.  Third where is your prove that the bible is full of holes.  Did you study the dead sea scrolls in it original language, or are you just going on what you heard.  Lastly I wonder if the bible is such ""crap"" why are you fighting so hard to discredit it?  I have no problem with you being a non believer, but why do you attack Christianity?"

Is it proper to think that you should be judging God?  There is no reason why you should be asking what you asked.
Yes I know. It's very obviously against the Second Commandment: Thou Shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain.\nIt's horrible how it has become such a habit, with myself as well as for everyone else. My dad used to use it all the time when I was growing up. *sigh* I don't even realize I say it when I do.\nThanks for the reminder:)

"If you take good care of yourself (=your eyes), you HAVE to keep them on, because if you take them off, your eyes are used to the light they get through the sunglasses and with the sudden ""shot"" of light that comes by taking them off, your eyes have to take in a massive dose of overexposure to UVA/UVB sunlight !!\n(Which explains why from a healthcare point of view, sunglasses aren't helpful att all!!)\n\nHappy sunbathing!!(without glasses,that is)\n\nCheers,\n\nLaurens."
"Many don't want to know or believe God loves them because then they would have to acknowledge the guilt they feel when they do something they know they shouldn't be doing.\n It is quite amazing, but if any of you have ever experienced the death of a very close friend or family member, I am sure you can relate to the thoughts that ""now they can see everything I am doing"". It can be kind of creepy, but sometimes it stops a person from doing something they really shouldn't when they think someone will know exactly what they are doing and how they are doing it.  When a person acknowledges God and His Love they then feel open and perhaps vulnerable and therefore accountable for their actions.  Some don't allow God's Love in as well because then they would have to admit also that they were ""loveable""!"
after looking at your new persona, I really don't think you have a conscience....:)

both or neither... it depends upon the person... plus I think it's good to see how someone acts around other people as well as how they are with you one-on-one.  some people are so fake/insincere in a group setting.  I would be cautious if someone acted completely different in the two settings.
The face and body of the Oriental people result from adaptations to the bitter cold. The body, and particularly the head, tends to be round, increasing body volume. The evaporative surface area of the skin is thus reduced relative to body volume, and less heat is lost. The nose is small and less likely to freeze, and the nostrils are narrow, warming the air before it reaches the lungs. Eyes are protected from the cold air by fatty folds of skin. Racial differences also result from the particular tastes of individuals via sexual selection.\n\nThe reason why white people don't have slanted eyes is because they probably evolved in a warmer climate, more like modern day Germany or Michigan in the US, which had cold winters and warm to hot summers, hence they didn't need protection from the year round severely cold climate/elements. It would also explain their comparatively more linear body structure. The climate they evolved in was probably a rainy one without a ton of sunlight, and they also must have lacked a significant source of vitamin D to consume and so they evolved lighter coloring to absorb more Vitamin D during the long Spring, Winter and Autumn months.
Let me state a few facts that may be unclear or distorted by the false image the media creates; Islam as a religion doesn't approve of killing innocent ppl, regardless of their color, ethnicity, religion, beliefs, etc....\n\nArabs or those living in countries that speak Arabic can be non-muslims as well, like in many countries I've been to for e.g. Egypt, Morocco, Lebanon, Syria, & Jordan there are many Christinans who belong to diff. sects, & there are still a minority of Jews living there cos it's their home.\n\nTo answer your question, I think that violence will help solve nothing, it will breed more hatered & distruction regardless of it being unorganized like the WTC attacks or organized like the invation of Iraq where also thausands of innovent Christian & Muslim Iraqis died since it began.\n\nI hope i helped....May tom. be a better day
Because they use that hand to wipe with and it is considered a huge insult to shake hands or eat with the right hand.\n\nAlso, some religions (Islam) have taboos about shaking hands with the opposite sex.
"I think there are a couple of significant differences\nbetween marriage and civil union.\n\nThe first is emotional.  ""Marriage"" has a deep meaning\nto many/most people, and to be able to be married means\nmore to them than just the financial/legal aspects of\na civil contract.\n\nThe second is that there really are some legal areas\nwhere a civil union provides fewer rights than a marriage.\nMost notably, except for those states which\nhave recently passed laws to the contrary, marriage\nin one state is recognized in other states, whereas\nthe same is likely not true of civil unions.  I believe\nthat in the few states that have same-sex civil unions,\nthey have granted most of the same rights as marriage;\nhowever, there are many cases where corporate policies\nhave not followed suit.  For example, if a company\nwould let someone cover their married spouse on the\ncompany medical insurance policy, will they allow that\nsame coverage to a civil union partner?\n\nAs for how to decide if one of the partners should\nchange their last name, I don't have a clue."

"Some people who claim to be Christians don't only hate homosexuals, they hate all kinds of people. I know people who claim to be ""good Christians"" but they are the most hateful, racist jerks.

Any idea of evil is always painted as ugly.  All the villains are ugly in all the fairy tales and comics.  That's just societies way of trying to depict good from evil.  However, I've known some ugly people who were angels and some beautiful people who I swear are the spawn of Satan himself!!
because so many people that ask religious based questions are doing it purely to get a reaction out of people.  They are meant to offend and nothing else.\n\nIt's hard to tell who is serious and who is just being a troll.
God lives in Heaven but He is constantly watching and considering each one of us as individuals.  Reading the Bible and praying to God are the best ways for us to draw close to Him but He is always close to us and awaits our attention.
"He didn't create evil, evil is a consequence of separating from Him (which is what Lucifer - one of His created beings chose to do).  Evil is the anti-God state.  Not His creation, but the lack of Himself.\n\n\nI don't believe we are guilty by relation.  We become guilty when we make a choice to sin.\n\nI think those who believe in ""original sin,"" from what I understand, have misinterpreted David in Psalm 51:5  ""Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,  and in sin my mother conceived me.""\n\nI think that means that David was conceived and born into a world where sin exists and is pervasive.\n\nIt also could be from Exodus 20:5-6  ""you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.""\n\nI take that to mean that children suffer consequences of the decisions/sinfulness of their ancestors.  Think of the generational effects of alcoholism or incest.  Those sins are visited upon their children.  It's not that those children are guilty of the sins of their fathers, but they suffer the effects of the lives their parents have lived.  (Please note that I do not believe that any time a child suffers it is because of something a parent did.  We all suffer because of sin and it's influence and effect on the world.)\n\nI don't believe that God holds us responsible for what our ancestors did.  He offers us a way out of the bondage of our ancestry.  We leave the ways and dysfunctions of our earthy fathers and take Him as our Father, so that we may learn mercy, forgiveness, love, longsuffering, truth, honor, reverence, goodness, kindness, faith, joy, gentleness, and self-control.  Notice I say LEARN these things.  Depending on our baggage and our level of ability, these things take time.  And practice.  You'll never hear me say that Christians are sinless, or better than anyone else.  We've just accepted the offer of salvation and are becoming Christ-like.  It's a process.\n\nBecause of Jesus we have freedom from the cycle of dysfunction and abuse that our fathers visit upon us.  He doesn't hold us responsible for their actions, but offers us a means of escaping repeating them.\n\n(What makes you think that Angels don't have a soul? Clearly they have free will, otherwise Satan could not have rebelled against God.  See Revelation 12:9 and surrounding.)"
i think you're right
Still more significant, there is UNITY in that diverse culture !
"Pagan: A follower of a nature-based religion. It is important to remember that all Wiccans are pagan, but not all pagans are Wiccan. There is a very wide variety of pagan religions, Wicca is just one of them. \n\nPOLYTHEISM - The belief that all of the various deities are separate and distinct individuals \nPANTHEISM- The belief in a single deity exhibiting aspects_ a composite or sum of the self-ware universe \nMONOTHEISM- Holds that there is only one deity with a singular aspect & usually places the universe as a product of that deity rather than a part of it. \n\nThere are many types of witchcraft, many of which overlap and all of which can be defined in different ways by different people, but here are some rough guidelines for their designations: \n\nAfrican witchcraft: There are many type of witchcraft in Africa. The Azande of central Africa believe that witchcraft causes all types of misfortune. The ""gift"" of witchcraft, know as mangu, is passed from parent to child. Those possessing mangu aren't even aware of it and perform magick unconsciously while they sleep. \n\nAppalachian Folk Magic: Those who practice witchcraft in the Appalachian mountains see good and evil as two distinct forces that are lead by the Christian God and Devil, respectively. They believe there are certain conditions that their magick cannot cure. They also believe that witches are blessed with paranormal powers and can perform powerful magick that can be used for either good or evil purposes. They look to nature for omens and portents of the future. \n\nGreen witchcraft: A Green witch is very similar to a Kitchen/Cottage witch (see below) with the exception that the Green witch practices in the fields and forest in order to be closer to the Divine spirit. The Green witch makes his or her own tools from accessible materials from outdoors. \n\nHedge witchcraft: A Hedge witch is not part of a group or coven. This witch practices magick alone and works more with the green arts, herbal cures and spells. In the early days, Hedge witches were local wise men or women who cured illnesses and gave advice. They can be of any religion and are considered traditional witches (see below). \n\nHereditary witchcraft: Hereditary witches believe in ""gifts"" of the craft that are with a witch from birth, having been passed from generations before. \n\nHoodoo/Conjure/Root witchcraft: Hoodoo is a type of African-American folk magic that combines African folkloric practices and beliefs with American Indian botanical knowledge and European folklore. Hoodoo uses the magical properties of herbs, roots, minerals (especially the lodestone), animal parts and the personal possessions and body fluids of people. \n\nKitchen/Cottage witchcraft: A Kitchen witch, or Cottage witch, practices magick around the hearth and home. The home is a sacred place, and the use of herbs is used often to bring protection, prosperity and healing. Kitchen witches often follow more than one path of witchcraft. \n\nLuciferian witchcraft: Luciferianism is often mistaken for Satanism because it is the worship of the deity named Lucifer, but Luciferian magick is used for both good and bad. \n\nPennsylvania Dutch hexcraft or ""Pow-wow"": When the Germans first arrived in Pennsylvania, Native Americans were there, so the term ""pow-wow"" to describe this practice may come from observations of Indian gatherings. Pow-wowing includes charms and incantations dating back to the Middle Ages, as well as elements borrowed from the Jewish Kabbalah and Christian Bible. Pow-wowing focuses on healing illnesses, protecting livestock, finding love or casting or removing hexes. Pow-wowers consider themselves to be Christians endowed with supernatural powers. \n\nTraditional witchcraft: Traditional witchcraft often follows science, history and the arts as its foundation. While sharing the same respect for nature as the Wiccan witch (see below), traditional witches do not worship natu"

"Thing is, the Bible doesn't claim to be a novel.  It doesn't label itself with a fiction stamp.  Its many human authors (though God wrote through them) all claim it to be the inspired word of God Himself, the ultimate truth handed down to the human race containing what we need to know of who we are, what our purpose is, who God is, how we reach Him, and how we find value and meaning, not just in this life, but for eternity.  \n\nThere are 66 books in the Bible, last I heard, Star Wars was up to like 6 or 7 movies :)  The Bible has been espoused as reliable by the founding fathers of science like Newton, Galileo, and Pasteur.  Famous presidents and even Napoleon have spoken of the Bible's reliability and Jesus' divinity.  The Bible has more bibliographical backing then any other historical document in history, just read Josh McDowell's ""More Then a Carpenter"" where he applies the 3 tests applied to historical documents to the Bible.  There are hundreds of credible prophecies[1] which even Israelite scholars like Edersheim who deny Jesus as the Messiah, acknowledge as Messianic, and which fit Jesus to a ""t"".  There are numerous, numerous archeological finds[2] supporting the Bible.  There are thousands who have died for the name of Jesus Christ and thousands more who risk death daily around the world for His sake[3].  The apostles and many Christians since like the anabaptists have died peacefully, loving and forgiving their enemies, even as Jesus did.  \n\nUnlike the Koran or Vedas, the Bible's authors tell of their mistakes.  David tells of his sins with Bathsheba and how God punished him.  Moses tells of his breaking of a Messianic prophecy and how he couldn't enter the promised land because of it.  Job ends his book repenting of speaking of things he shouldn't have, as he says ""I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.""[4]  Isaiah admits himself a ""sinful man"" and is frightened when meeting God, for he is unworthy[5]. Paul calls himself the ""chief of sinners"" and says he doesn't even deserve to be an apostle because he persecuted the church, while thanking God for His abundant grace and mercy[6].  What you should be realizing is that this is not human nature, to so freely admit our mistakes and say we don't deserve God's mercy.  It's not our nature to humble ourselves.  Not only does this very consistent practice through the Bible suggest authorship divine, for the human authors exalt God while abasing themselves, but also suggests that rather then seeking to exalt themselves, as in the Koran, they are intent first and foremost on telling the truth, including the undesirable truths about themselves."
"Tell my friends and family how much I loved them.  Clean up my stuff as much as possible for those that have to deal with it.  Write out a will.  Tell my ""Crush"" that I love him, and give him a kiss.  Eat all my favorite foods.  Sing at the top of my lungs.  Laugh as much as possible."
The males of those regions have the innate desire to dominate, and more particularly, to dominate women.
"Matthew 18:15ff and Galatians 6 are the clearest NT references.  \n\nBut there are more.  One very good one is the often missed original setting of the ""second greatest commandment"" --\n\nLeviticus 19:17-18\nDo not hate your brother in your heart. Rebuke your neighbor frankly so you will not share in his guilt.\nDo not seek revenge or bear a grudge against one of your people, but love your neighbor as yourself. I am the LORD. \n\nAlong the same lines is a set of instructions by Paul in\nEphesians 4:25-27 Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor, for we are all members of one body. ""In your anger do not sin""[=Psalm 4:4]: Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold.\n\nThis echoes Paul's call in v.15 to ""Tell the truth in love."" as part of building up the body in love (and avoiding deceit and error).\n\nFor some reason many separate the warning about anger from the call to be truthful.  But I believe they are intended to be read together.  As in Leviticus 19 the warning is against keeping it to yourself and nursing a grudge rather than correcting and RESTORING your brother and (in the case of sin BETWEEN you), of reconciling/making peace/restoring the RELATIONSHIP (cf. Matthew 5:23-24 which looks at the other side, calling us to go seek restoration if someone has something against US).  \n\nNote: the purpose must NOT be to ""get it off my chest"", for my own sake [so I won't be a hypocrite?]  It's about not allowing your brother to continue in sin without warning or seeking to restore him [thus we tell him as an expression of LOVING our neighbor] and the related sin of allowing a grudge to fester in my heart.  This is were the Galatians 6 call to be gentle & humble comes in.\n\nAlso note that there is not some generalized command to bring EVERY sin to people's attention!   It is for the sake of that person's good, for the health of the body, for restoration and reconciliation...    There are MANY sins for which the final word should be ""Love covers a multitude of sins."" (1 Peter 4:8)"

"Transmutation is a little used English word and biological term.  In plain English, it means to change the nature of something.  In biology, it means to change one species into another species; ""speciation"" is more commonly used.  Transmutation is commonly used in nuclear physics where it refers to changing one element into another by changing the element's nucleus.\n\nIn the book, ""Macroevolution"" Steven Stanley lists a half dozen confirmed speciation events which occurred in modern times.\n\nOne classic example of beneficial mutations is the peppered moth.  In its original form, about half of individuals were light and half dark.  When pollution darkened tree trunks, the light peppered moths stood out and were preferentially eaten.  The composition of the population shifted to mostly dark colored moths with only a few percent light colored ones.\n\nAdditions to the genetic code of a species occur when an error during reproduction results in (1) part of the species' DNA is copied twice and (2) DNA from another species is incorporated.\n\nIcarus62's three statements do deal with mIcroevolution.  What you don't understand, is that mIcroevolution is simply mAcroevolution observed over a short time.  Read his question!!  Basically, he was saying, ""We all agree that mIcroevolution occurs.  Given this, what is to stop mAcroevolution from occuring?""  \n\nTo be taken seriously, creationists will have to do something other than nitpick at evolutionary theory.  They must develop theories of their own.  Creationists are a laughingstock because they make no attempt at generating testable scientific theories, and then testing them.\n\nIcarus62, good job!"

Don’t worry about your english. Its just fine.\n\n1. Allah did create us into tribes and communities, so that we may know each other, recognise each other. Allah never distributed us on the religious lines as your question says. Religion has always been One. And that is - that worship Allah alone. Don’t associate partners unto Him. That’s been the message of all the messengers of God. \n\n2. Islam does allow fighting, but only against those who create trouble on earth. Sometime force has to be applied to establish peace. That’s what our police and military does. At the same, Qur’aan also says that if you a kill an innocent person, then its like killing whole of humanity.\n\n3. Allah does have power over everything. He is Supreme. There in none like Him. If Allah had wanted, he would have guided everyone on the Straight Path. But this is life is a test. He has shown us path through His messengers. Its up to us make or mar our lives.  \n\nWish you the very best.\nTake care
On a purely statistical basis, yes.\nCounterexamples such as Bill Gates are nonsense. Of course you can find single cases in contrast with every statistics, but you should look at the average trends emerging from big numbers, not single cases.\nThe reason for this correlation is evolutionary: good looking people have - on average - more choices for mating. On big numbers this means an advantage for better mates in all respects, including wealth. On the opposite, wealthy people can choose easily good looking mates.\nGood looking wealthy people will breed children who (again, on average) will inherit both money and good looking aspect, so the whole process is self-sustaining.

"If there is any ""blatant disregard"" here, it's for the Truth.\n\n6bits, please familiarize yourself with ""Sacramentals"".\n\nImages and Statues\nDeut. 4:15 - from this verse, Protestants say that since we saw ""no form"" of the Lord, we should not make graven images of Him.\n\nDeut. 4:16 - of course, in early history Israel was forbidden to make images of God because God didn't yet reveal himself visibly ""in the form of any figure."" \n\nDeut. 4:17-19 - hence, had the Israelites depicted God not yet revealed, they might be tempted to worship Him in the form of a beast, bird, reptile or fish, which was a common error of the times. \n\nExodus 3:2-3; Dan 7:9; Matt. 3:16; Mark 1:10; Luke 3:22; John 1:32; Acts 2:3- later on, however, we see that God did reveal himself in visible form (as a dove, fire, etc). \n\nDeut. 5:8 - God's commandment ""thou shall not make a graven image"" is entirely connected to the worship of false gods. God does not prohibit images to be used in worship, but He prohibits the images themselves to be worshiped. \n\nExodus 25:18-22; 26:1,31 - for example, God commands the making of the image of a golden cherubim. This heavenly image, of course, is not worshiped by the Israelites. Instead, the image disposes their minds to the supernatural and draws them to God. \n\nNum. 21:8-9 - God also commands the making of the bronze serpent. The image of the bronze serpent is not an idol to be worshiped, but an article that lifts the mind to the supernatural. \n\nI Kings 6:23-36; 7:27-39; 8:6-67 - Solomon's temple contains statues of cherubim and images of cherubim, oxen and lions. God did not condemn these images that were used in worship. \n\n2 Kings 18:4 - it was only when the people began to worship the statue did they incur God's wrath, and the king destroyed it. The command prohibiting the use of graven images deals exclusively with the false worship of those images. \n\n1 Chron. 28:18-19 - David gives Solomon the plan for the altar made of refined gold with a golden cherubim images. These images were used in the Jews' most solemn place of worship. \n\n2 Chron. 3:7-14 - the house was lined with gold with elaborate cherubim carved in wood and overlaid with gold. \n\nEzek. 41:15 - Ezekiel describes graven images in the temple consisting of carved likenesses of cherubim. These are similar to the images of the angels and saints in many Catholic churches. \n\nCol. 1:15 - the only image of God that Catholics worship is Jesus Christ, who is the ""image"" (Greek ""eikon"") of the invisible God. \n\nRelics\nMark 15:43; John 19:38 - Joseph of Arimathea sought Christ's dead body instead of leaving it with the Romans. Joseph gave veneration to our Lord's body.\n\nMark 16:1; Luke 24:1 - the women came to further anoint Christ's body even though it had been sealed in the tomb. \n\nJohn 19:39 - Nicodemus donated over one hundred pounds of spices to wrap in Jesus' grave clothes. This is also veneration of our Lord's body. \n\nMatt. 9:21; Mark 5:28 - the woman with the hemorrhage just sought the hem of Christ's cloak and was cured. This shows that God uses physical things to effect the supernatural. \n\nActs 19:11-12 - Paul's handkerchiefs healed the sick and those with unclean spirits. This is another example of physical things effecting physical and spiritual cures. \n\nActs 5:15 - Peter's shadow healed the sick. This proves that relics of the saints have supernatural healing power, and this belief has been a part of Catholic tradition for 2,000 years. \n\nRev. 6:9 - the souls of the martyrs are seen beneath the heavenly altar. Their bones are often placed beneath altars in Catholic churches around the world. \n\n2 Kings 13:21 - Elisha's bones bring a man back to life. The saints' bones are often kept beneath the altars of Catholic churches and have brought about supernatural cures throughout the Christian "

I believe in God because in studying physics, you find that everything has an explanation.  If you drop a ball from 100 meters, you can calculate how long it will take to hit the ground.  All you need to know is the acceleration of gravity, the air resistance, etc.  But you can't do that with humans.  Even if a supercomputer plotted out every atom in a person's body, physics, or any science for that matter, couldn't account for his actions.  Therefore, there must be something that gives us choice.  I don't think God controls us, but he did give us free agency, and we will be judged according to how we use our free agency.

"Typically a covering over the hair. Think of Orthodox Jewish women and you will get the picture. The practice in Paul's day for Jewish women to cover their hair was about the same as it is today. It is a sign of the power of God over their lives, just as the yarmulke (kippah / skullcap) is a sign of God's authority over men. It is a sign of respect.\n\nYes it is a sign of authority, but not in the way the church would normally take it.  A careful reading shows that a man doesn't have any authority above him except for Messiah. There is not supposed to be a ""covering"" over him like a pastor, bishop, archbishop, cardinal, pope, priest or rabbi.  All of these are unneeded. The concept of a hierarchy that the church has established over people is unbiblical.  Each of us are to be independant thinkers!\n\nMessiah is the head over the Body. He has authority over the Bride. Similarly the husband is to excercise the same sort of loving authority over his household. Messiah is not a tyrant and the husband is not to be a tyrant over his household either.  Way too many men over the years have gotten that wrong.  They look upon their wives and families as slaves, servants, etc, instead of as helpers and advisors. The person answer above who claimed that women didn't get respect is incorrect. Read Proverbs 31:10-31 about how the virtuous woman was viewed. There is no disrespect there. She make decisions to purchase property on her own, she is a good business woman. This passage, called Aishyt Chayl is read by the husband to the wife every week at the beginning of the Sabbath in a Jewish home.\n\nMany Christians dispensationalize this passage and say that it was for the culture of Paul or Corinth but is not for our culture today.  But the verse which you cite doesn't speak of human culture, rather it speaks of angels. To dismiss the command in this way is to claim that the ""culture"" of the angels has changed.  So my own belief is that the command is still in effect.\n\nThe second way in which this command is dismissed by many Christians is to say that the covering is a woman's long hair. This is based on their understanding of verse 15.  However, verse 6 would appear to deny that since it says if she doesn't wear the covering she should have her head shaved. So a woman who doesn't have long hair should have her head shaved until she gets long hair? No, of course not. Rather it is a scarf that she wears over her hair, and if she doesn't wear the scarf, she is to shave her head as well.\n\nSome will claim that the command is only to a married woman. But I will point out that verse 5 says ""every woman"", not ""every wife"". It is a general command and is not specifically for married women. The scarf is a symbol of the power and authority she has in Messiah, whether she has an earthly husband or not.\n\nThe fact that women cover their hair is also attested to in Numbers 5:18. The fact that women always covered their hair is widely attested to in regards to the women of Israel. Paul was speaking to the formerly pagan women of Corinth and giving them general instruction in the reason why this was done amoung the women of Israel.\n\nAs to whether you choose to start wearing a scarf, that is between you and God. Hopefully this will help you to arrive at the correct understanding of the passage."
"God does tell his through his word that ""no man knows the day nor the hour.""  Because of this, we should live our life as if Jesus were to return today.  Even if Jesus doesn't return today, you never know when he may call you home.  Life is taken to much for granted, it can be taken away in a blink of an eye.  If that were to happen, are you ready?"

castes which claim to be in minority and devoid of benefits.\nthe basic point is that many people out of these so called obc are quite affluent.. for example look at our political leaders like laloo prasad yadav (yadavs are obc), sharad yadav. they have shit lot of money. \n\nit is quite sad that the caste system was established. but that cannot be undone.\n\ntoday there are just 2 divisions in society according to me-\nrich and poor..\n\nso the benefits should be extended to the poor people.\n\nwhat is wrong in india is that reservation in educational instituions and jobs is indiscriminately being given to sc, sts and obcs.
Cornish.\n\nApparently it means 'What awful weather!'.\n\nAs I understand it, this is something people in Cornwall have plenty of occasion to say. Now, of course, when they say it, they say it in English as the last native speaker of Cornish died in the 1950's or something like that. Now they're trying to revive the language - which is a Celtic brother of Gaelic, Welsh, Manx and Brittany. Good luck to them.

Hurrah!  Sense!\n\nI am happy that people believe in God if it helps them, but it seems to me that it is out of a need to make sense of the universe when the fact is that you can't - it is, it wasn't created by anything or anyone.  When you die, you won't go to heaven or hell so put your energy into living and not dying.  What is the point of trying to make your children christian (or any religion) so that they can go to heaven when their world is being destroyed and polluted?\n\nWhen you die, you die.  Your atoms disperse and eventually you become the air, the grass, the trees, birds, people, animals.  You become viruses and plagues and sunsets and rainstorms.  You don't go to heaven.  Heaven could be here on Earth but because people are so busy squabbling over which God they believe in (when it is perfectly plain to the non-religious, and to many switched on religious people, that it's all the same God, anyway - so why kill for it?) no-one is making an effort for the society of today.  Why does it matter that you say God, someone else says Yahweh and yet another person says Allah?  Why does this make people hate other people and think that they are justified in killing them (and I am specifically not referring only to Muslims because I think Christianity has enough to be ashamed of without tarring a lot of innocents with the brush of some extremists).  \n\nWhen I think of all the horrors that have been comitted in the name of religion (crusades, witch burning, KKK, heretic burning, Spanish Inquisition, wars, murder, subjugation of races and women, human sacrifice, the list goes on and on) I can't think why anyone would think that it should apply to today's world.\n\nI think we should take the best from all religions (such as loving your neighbour, tolerance, respect for others) and ignore the bad (incitements of violence and hatred - and it's there in every religious book, be it Bible, Torah or Koran) and work forwards in that way.\n\nI'm not having children of my own but I want there to be a world for my neices and their children to live in, and I don't think clinging to religion is going to create it.\n\nLooking at the answers above has brought up something that I find deeply upsetting - the idea that this world is sinful and that life is something to be endured rather than celebrated - how can this kind of thinking ever create a world worth living in?  When suffering is almost invited?  This world is not sinful, it is your life and it's the only one you are going to get - live it, love it and don't for God's sake waste it by devaluing it in the hope that when you die there might be something else?  I get a lot of people telling me, well, you'll regret not believing in God if you die and discover that we were right - I say this - what if you die and discover you were wrong?  You will have wasted your whole life!  Don't!

"Ignorance and insecurity.  \n\nUnfortunately, many people in society are uncomfortable around anyone that's different from them.  So whether it's a different race, religion, style of clothing, or differently-abled, most ""normal"" people reinforce their sense of belonging and ""superiority"" by putting down those who are different.\n\nMany people also have little to no exposure to those with severe hearing loss, and therefore don't understand the culture, or that most deaf people have normal intelligence.  And be aware that when someone speaks a different language, the communication barrier is intimidating and often frustrating.  \n\nBut please don't think that ALL people are like that.  Especially in a one-on-one interaction, you'll find that most hearing people are kind and even curious enough to want to learn more about you and what your life is like.  But teasing most often occurs when people are in a group (and especially during the teenage years, when ""fitting in"" is perceived as a high priority).  \n\nBe proud of who you are and prove the ignorant people wrong by living your best life with dignity.  Good luck!"
Ok, I am  going to  cut thru the blindfolds that many seem to have , lol, and fill you  in on some facts about the blind. \n OK! Here we go.\n\nNo, the blind are not afraid of the dark. WHy should we be? Seriously, its dark 24/7/365 for us!! HELLO!?!?!\n\n2. Very few of us are scared of heights. But Before I lost all of my vision , I was stuck on top of a TALL ferris wheel with a blind friend who didn't realize how high up we actually were ( I could still tell!! ) and he would rock the cart / seat thingy and  yet I could read the sign saying NOT to, that it WOULD tip over!! I have been terrified of heights ever since. However... huh, I love to fly. Go figure. \n3. NEVER grab a blind person's arm and try to show them where to go by PUSHING them ahead of you. THIS is scarey, you could shove us down stairs and we'd have no idea!! Rather, offer us your arm, and let us grab it around the elbow and guide us, letting us follow you. Then if you step up or down, without telling us ( whih you should tell us if you do, please ) we will feel you arm go up or down with your body's  movements. \n\n4. IF you run into someone with a Guide DOg for the Blind, there are a few rules there as well. Please, NEVER PET ONE unless you have asked permission. I mean, it is a TOOL that is being used just like a  jackhammer or a screw driver. You wouldn't ask to pet THOSE while being used, would you?? LOL \nALSO, never ever feed things to guide dogs when you find them. They have very strict diets so that the person who uses them knows when they eat , and thus, when they will need to relieve themselves so that the person  using them can maintain a strict schedule. We have to clean up after our dogs, remember. No matter WHERE we go. \n\n5. Always speak to a blind  person directly, perhaps slightly touching them on the arm to let them know that you are speaking to them, if you don't know their name. Never ask questions about them or to them THROUGH someone who might be with them. We're blind, ok? Not deaf and obviously not nearly as DUMB as some of the idiots we are forced to deal with, trust me. Oh, and you don't have to yell at us, it doesn't help us understand you. LOL \n \n\nI hope this information helps you out a little. I conduct seminars teaching more courteous and effective communications between waitstaff/personel and the disabled to create better relations. You wouldn't BELIEVE some of the things people have heard and been taught about the blind.  It can be hysterical at times. Thanks for wanting more info!!
The only things secret are our ceremonies.

I have always been uncomfortable with housekeepers in my home. I have not had any in the past, and here are 3 reasons:\n\n1. I do not like the idea of someone rummaging through my personal belongings. It is a creepy thought to know that someone will be touching and moving my things.\n\n2. I am afraid that my things might get stolen or damaged. Even a housekeeper with the best intentions may be confronted with a situation in which he/she may need money. How can I be sure that he/she will not steal from me? Again, I know not all people are thieves, but that is a risk I do not want to take.\n\n3. I like to clean my own house so that I can be reminded of what I do have and do not have. Notice that I did not say I enjoy cleaning my house, but I do like it because it means that I have a house of my own to keep neat and tidy.\n\nThese are my 3 reasons why I am opposed to having a housekeeper, briefly stated, of course. :o)

You're right that writing is indeed a powerful tool not just in sharing facts but on stirring other peoples minds and inject senseless claims that he himself can't prove.  \n\nThe book has strayed you from the facts after you are claiming that what he used are facts.  You gave me an impression that you believe Dan Brown's misrepresentation of the Church as a murderous institution and also that the Christian faith is utterly false.\n\nNow, you should know why the Vatican is against it.  Brown was deaf tone to the feelings of millions of Christians.  It is irresponsible and offensive for Brown to impugn the faith of countless Catholics in this fashion. He has no solid evidence to support these contentions, and in the absence of such evidence it is unacceptable to smear the faith of millions with these charges.\n\nA comparable smear would be saying that Lutherans have been murdering the descendants of Luther or that Jewish leaders have been murdering the descendants of Moses. If such charges were made, particularly with no evidence, they would be regarded instantly as vicious and bigoted slanders against what other people hold sacred.\n\nClaiming that Catholics have been killing the descendants of their God is a vile and unacceptable assault on their faith. People of all faiths should regard Dan Brown as the viciously bigoted man that it takes to make this kind of charge.
"It is true, many pastors do not have all of the answers to all of the questions, but those who say, ""Ask your pastor,"" probably do not know either. It can not hurt to get a pastor's opinion though. Being a pastor, I would hope you would understand this and give your opinion, stating it is your opinion, and them help them to seek out the answer for themselves as well as yourself. In this way, you would be able to help the next person with the same answer. We, as a people, always need to strive to for excellence. This especially includes our religious beliefs. I am always willing to help those who come to me for help, but if I do not know how to answer them, I refer them to my pastor. If he does not know the answer, I would imagine he either finds it or tries to find someone to help him. After all, no one is perfect and no one has all of the answers.\nAlso, I never ever take the pastor's word for anything I hear him say. I have heard pastors misquote the Bible, misinterpret scriptures and many other things from behind the pulpit. I always enter a church service with an open mind, but an educated mind."

I don't have time to review the link.  But for me as an atheist, I don't care to try and convert people.  So you ask how I would convince someone else, well I really wouldn't.  I am an atheist because I see no credible proof that any of the major religions is right.  I've read extensive portions of the Bible (very few people have read it from cover to cover) and I see it as being full of contradictions and mistakes.  I therefore deduce that it cannot be the infallible word of God.  I see how Islam treats women and so want no part of it.  So that's the main two right there.  I see no reason to head off on some spiritual quest to discover more about other religions.\n\nThe only time I enter into a debate about Christianity is when judgmental Christians make harsh judgments or outrageous claims about how things are.  I will then challenge them on it, in the same way that I would challenge anyone who made outlandish supernatural claims.\n\nThere may be some kind of superior being or deity, but I would be shocked if any of the world's major religions have it spot on.  I live and good moral life and if some kind of deity wishes to one day judge me harshly for that then so be it.

"About this Site Basic Islamic Beliefs What's New \nMuslims Today History & Civilizations Schools & Family Life \nWomen in Islam Women of Afghanistan Companions of Mohammed \nConverts to Islam Islamic Books & Media Links \n Join our mailing list Search this site \n \n\n \n \n \n\n Islam, Culture and Women\nby Ruqaiyyah Waris Maqsood\n\nHow can anyone justify Islam's treatment of women, when it imprisons Afghans under blue shuttlecock burqas and makes Pakistani girls marry strangers against their will? \n\nHow can you respect a religion that forces women into polygamous marriages, mutilates their genitals, forbids them to drive cars and subjects them to the humiliation of ""instant"" divorce? In fact, none of these practices are Islamic at all. \n\nAnyone wishing to understand Islam must first separate the religion from the cultural norms and style of a society. Female genital mutilation is still practised in certain pockets of Africa and Egypt, but viewed as an inconceivable horror by the vast majority of Muslims. Forced marriages may still take place in certain Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities, but would be anathema to Muslim women from other backgrounds. \n\nIndeed, Islam insists on the free consent of both bride and groom, so such marriages could even be deemed illegal under religious law. \n\nA woman forbidden from driving a car in Riyadh will cheerfully take the wheel when abroad, confident that her country's bizarre law has nothing to do with Islam. Afghan women educated before the Taliban rule know that banning girls from school is forbidden in Islam, which encourages all Muslims to seek knowledge from cradle to grave, from every source possible. \n\nThe Koran is addressed to all Muslims, and for the most part it does not differentiate between male and female. Man and woman, it says, ""were created of a single soul,"" and are moral equals in the sight of God. Women have the right to divorce, to inherit property, to conduct business and to have access to knowledge. \n\nSince women are under all the same obligations and rules of conduct as the men, differences emerge most strongly when it comes to pregnancy, child-bearing and rearing, menstruation and, to a certain extent, clothing. \n\nSome of the commands are alien to Western tradition. Requirements of ritual purity may seem to restrict a woman's access to religious life, but are viewed as concessions. During menstruation or postpartum bleeding, she may not pray the ritual salah or touch the Koran and she does not have to fast; nor does she need to fast while pregnant or nursing. \n\nThe veiling of Muslim women is a more complex issue. Certainly, the Koran requires them to behave and dress modestly - but these strictures apply equally to men. Only one verse refers to the veiling of women, stating that the Prophet's wives should be behind a hijab when his male guests converse with them. \n\nSome modernists, however, claim that this does not apply to women in general, and that the language used does not carry the textual stipulation that makes a verse obligatory. In practice, most modern Muslim women appreciate attractive and graceful clothes, but avoid dressing provocatively. \n\nWhat about polygamy, which the Koran endorses up to the limit of four wives per man? The Prophet, of course, lived at a time when continual warfare produced large numbers of widows, who were left with little or no provision for themselves and their children. \n\nIn these circumstances, polygamy was encouraged as an act of charity. Needless to say, the widows were not necessarily sexy young women, but usually mothers of up to six children, who came as part of the deal. \n\nPolygamy is no longer common, for various good reasons. The Koran states that wives need to be treated fairly and equally - a difficult requirement even for a rich man. Moreover, if a husband wishes to take a second wife, he should not do so if the marriage will be to the detrimen"

"1FoolN6Billion:What proof do you have that there was a Jesus who was called king of the Jews?\n\nKepha: It’s been recorded by several eyewitnesses that Pontius Pilate ordered a sign be put on the cross, “King of the Jews”, and I mean by more than just what’s in the bible. \n\n1FoolN6Billion: What writings have been found before 150 years after the supposed fact?\n\nKepha: The Gospels were generally accepted as scripture by 130 AD.  People don’t die over a myth or story, they die because they were transformed and refused to break their fidelity with God by giving homage to Roman gods. An atheist is blind to such things. \n\n1FoolN6Billion: And to answer your initial question, the myth caused the dark ages, where people were kept, by their religious authorities, from being literate, \n\nKepha: This is a flat out falsehood.

Constantine was never a priest or bishop, and did not have any church authority at the Council of Nicae, (or anywhere else) which took place 12 years after his famous “Edict of Milan”, which was nothing more than a removal of persecuting laws still on the books. You are in serious revision mode. \n\n1FoolN6Billion: Then it caused the inquisitions, killing more people in a short period than just about anything else thus far, where Jews were required to at least say that Jesus was an historical person if not the messiah.\n\nKepha: I dare you to document this hogwash.

aretus60,\n\nI really admire your courage to ask for help here, and I was surprised to see that you received quite a few answers that were compassionate and caring. I really want to help you, but there’s nothing that I can do. You have to talk to Jesus yourself.\n\nIf you ever knew God, you need to repent (change your direction) and ask Jesus to save you all over again. If you have never done it, you need to understand that you have made mistakes. Then, ask Jesus to forgive you, and tell Him that you will gladly follow Him. If you do that, and mean it from your heart, He will do His part and save you.\n\nDon’t trust in a religious upbringing; don’t trust in what you were taught. Talk to Jesus and trust only in Him.\n\nAfter you have done that, please read my newsletter for May on my Yahoo! 360 page. It will give you some wisdom about dealing with the drinking and partying and anything else that you are struggling with. \n\nSomeone has been praying for you, and I have prayed for you, too.\n\nGod bless.
Twenty years ago was then, this is now, and the influx has increased to the point where it is now becoming a major issue.  It is estimated by 2010 some 14% of the US population will be Mexican, and half of that illegal. An idea of the scope of the problem is that right now 25% of all automobile accidents in North Carolina are caused by illegal Mexican drivers.\n\nWe have ID now. This is not the issue.  We do not need one more form of ID which will be just as readily forged as Social Security cards. The problem is the willingness of government to tackle the issue. An example of disservice to America is that socialistic pig from Massachussetts, Ted Kennedy, who is an open supporter of illegal imigration and should be evicted from the Senate and jailed.\n\nThe borders need to be secured first to stop the Mexican invasion, and then the issue of hiring illegals needs to be addressed.\n\nThe US is willing to send hundreds of thousands of troops to foreign lands to help the people there, so what about sending 100,000 troops to patrol our southern border?  That would put one solder every 31 feet.  Arm them heavily and that should put a stop to the swarming hoardes of criminal immigrants sneaking into this country.

I need to break some out since you made me think of it. Pink Floyd did some things that I just loved, ""Shine on You Crazy Diamond"", ""Dark Side of the Moon"", ""The Wall"", great albums, genius. I was a Hendrix freak when I was younger, then I was exposed to the Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia. So much of that music is so poignant and relevant to me and the way I experience life. I think it will be something in my life forever. In fact, I have had that same thought, about my funeral. I have a couple of Grateful Dead songs I want played. If you are familiar, I am going to have ""Brokedown Palace"" played. It almost makes me cry every time I hear it, a very beautiful piece. I also want to have ""Sing Me Back Home"" played too. I know it isn't a Dead original, but I just love to hear Jerry's voice on songs like that. I have decided to go back to school for a career change and I am there every day with a bunch of 18-19 year old kids. Most have no idea what any of that music sounds like. All they know is hip hop rap or death metal. I often ask myself if I too am a dinosaur. I'm right there with you."
My friend is an urban planner.  It takes a lot of hard work in college, and a basic spacial awareness.  He got hired to work for a firm before he even graduated, and so did most of his classmates.  The average salaries from what I've heard are from 35k to 45k, with average benefits.
yes
No one really knows, but if cultural norms for her time and place are any indication, probably in her mid teens.\n\nBefore anyone shudders at this thought and starts making it out to be some kind of sick thing, though, remember that people lived much shorter lives back then -- therefore, they tended to marry and have kids much earlier than we do.\n\nAlso remember that today's laws dealing with minors simply did not apply 2,000 years ago.  In fact, they didn't even exist.
Think of it like a bully who feels the need to torment someone just to boost their ego. Samething.

no! no! no! if you are a Christian. no! Jesus said, I am the Way the True and the Life, no man goes to the Father except through me.\necumenical movement, of all religions, is one world religion. anti-Christ.
"I have seen several of these marriages, and have studied rulings in islam,According to my knowledge in Islam, \n\nYou cannot marry her being a christian (you have to covert and become a muslim)even if you marry her out of religous consense Islam does not recognise such a marriage and it views your relationship as adultry. \n\nIf you are convinced she is the ONE and you have studied Islam and view islam as the right guidance and religion convert and marry her else read below you got only ONE CHOICE \n\nI know it is upseting to you, so let me try and explain some points I know about islam and why it so. \n\nIslam views/gives prominance to the balance of the Islamic society, anything which can spoil the balance is eliminated for example (you cannot have bars in your city and tell people not to drink so in Islamic surounding No bars)\n\nLikewise in the system Men are responsible to provide for the family and the wife should be obedient to the husband by listening to him and caring for the family so if a non muslim is the husband it is illegal for her to listen to him because he does not beleive in the rules of islam.\n\nReligous guidance in islam is given mostly by the father so if the father is a non muslim these children will become non muslim too Islam will not tolarate anyone going out of its fold.\n\nThere are other reasons but this is just to give you the message that you have to become a muslim to marry her \n\nAllah says in the quran ""There is no compulsion in religion"" you can foget about all these and go your own ways but you know you are going against rules of god and he waiting to catch you after death. \n\nI would like to invite you to learn about islam like ME it has answered a LOT of questions that I had its a very logical religion not like christianity where answers are not logical most of the time"

Dark, VERY lonely, worms that never die, demons tormenting, gnashing your teeth with regret.  No, you won't be playing cards with your friends there.  Will be no friends there.  Jesus said it would be better to cut a limb off than to go to hell with it.  Your worst horror movie couldn't come close to it.  Eternal separation from God and all the glories you could have had.\n\nJesus spoke of hell with great warnings.  He didn't die to save you from nothing.

Its genetic, different races have different traits.  Blacks are taller than whites, they have lower body fat % and are more athletic.  Certain characteristics are genetic, and others are just society.  Asians are intelligent, its hard to say whether or not this is because they are born with bigger brains, or education is just more emphases in their families.  Someone should do a study that charts how someone of different racial back round goes through life when being raised in a different culture.  If an Asian boy was raised by a black family, would he still do excel in school? Or would he be more athletic?  Its hard to say, but as far a physical attributes go, cultures are made different to adapt to their environment.  It doesn't matter if you believe in evolution or not, black people have dark skin for a reason, its hot as hell where they are from, and the sun is scorching.  this could go on forever, but i hope this helps kind of answer your question.
If you asked a group of guys what their essence is, I bet it'd turn into a farting contest or something.
Yes. When I was eighteen years old, I was living on my own. I ran out of toilet paper for a few days. So everytime I took a dump, I jumped right in the shower. I spread my cheeks off for a rinse and then took a shower as normal.
"I totally agree with you!\n\nJames 2. 14-17\n\n14. What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him? \n\n15. Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. \n\n16. If one of you says to him, ""Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed,"" but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it? \n\n17. In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead."

Because capital punishment is abolished in some states such as NY, therefor ppl there can only recieve life for the most henious offenses.\n\nAlthough the Rosenbergs were executed for espionage by the federal government in 1953, it is unlikely for someone to be sentenced to death except for committing murder(1) with one of several aggrevating factors to put some ppl to death such as murder with rape, buglary, etc. \n\nThen everyone serving life terms are not in for murder, such as habitual sex offenders and some ppl who recieve life sentences are subject to parole.\n\nMany recieve clemency. In addition, some ppl such as minors and the mentally ill who recieve life are barred from the death penalty but may be given life in prison. Some believe that a sentence of life imprisonment is just as bad, if i was sentenced to 344 years in prison without parole, life without parole, or death id be screwed either way.\n\nAlso many juries refrain from sentencing death because of their beliefs. Some see it as cruel and unusual. Hanging, Firing Squad, Electocution, and the gas chamber all have evidence of suffering. And it even took John Wayne Gacy to die in pain for about half an hour for a debotchment in his lethal injection.\n\nAnd finally contrary to popular believe, it causes tax payers more to execute someone then to keep them in prison for life. Although life imprisonment is expensive over time, a death sentence is a big burden at once as it scost millions.
It is FICTION.

"You knew the consequences of the ""work release"" when you were put on it.  So why ask now how to avoid going to jail when you knew you would if you didn't finish your work release?  You can't avoid jail.  They trusted you to keep up your end of the bargain and you betrayed their trust.  You made the choice not to follow through with your responsibilities, now you have to pay for it in another way."

Well, I grew up in the country and I currently live in the city, and I have to say I like them both equally. \n\nThe country has more space, fresh air, people are more easy going, but a lot of the time you have to drive really far just to get somewhere (ie: My best friend growing up went to my school but she lived three towns over) \n\nBut the city has more services, there's a lot of things to explore, but there's always a lot of people around. \n\nSo really, it's just up to what you're willing to give up for something. I love them both equally, but I would probably snatch up a chance to move back out to the country
Most people who immediately jump to conclusions about movies portraying Christians don't even know what they're about. I read the book and I don't think it degrades Christ; it just offers up another point of view. If you are happy with your beliefs, you shouldn't care what other people think. No one should be able to shake that. And I don't get how the name is childish. It revolves around a code created by Da Vinci. It's not like they're calling it Disney's Da Vinci Playground.

It depends on what you are putting your faith in. If you are putting your faith in a chair that you know is broken to support you weight and hold you up so you dn't fall, then you may not be right to put your faith in that chair. If you are putting faith in your brakes to stop your car, and you know that your brakes are working great, then you may be right. \n\nDo we only put your faith into things that you know, I think you should always make an effort to put faith in things with consideration of the thing or person you are putting your faith in.\n\nIf we are talking about putting faith in God to save your soul, then it may depend on what god you are talking about. It depends on what god has said regarding faith. If you are hindu, what does god say about faith. If you are Muslim what does it say... and so on... \n\nIf you are going to put faith (hope, trust, love,) into something it shouldn't be done blindly... It should be done with the utmost care and consideration.\nDon't get me wrong there are somethings that can not be tested, tried, etc... so you have to go on your gut feelings, but somethings can be.\n\nI have faith that Jesus died for my sins, and he died and rose aging from the dead.. Is this something I can prove??? I can look at history, and things of that nature, come to a conclusion to support my willingness to put faith in what I am reading in the bible is truth, and this gives me the assurance that putting faith in Jesus is good. I can look at history, the earth, humans... so it really depends on what you are putting your faith in and why.
"Prophet Mohamed the son of AbduAllah (570-632) "" PBUH"" was the last of all prophets he delevired the quran and the quran was his miracle.. even b4 he got his message he was knows as the sincere and truthful one ... at the age of 40 his message started to descend he tried to deliver it all around the world and guide all the people to Islam at first it was hard he had very hard time but then because of how true the Islam is it was known in a lot of places and many ppl came into Islams as it is the religion of truth he was a very gentelman and very honest and kind he never hurt anyone or anything...you may also wanna check this http://www.cair.com/muhammad/page.asp?pageid=lsp  If You want anymore info. u can talk to me online angry_sue\n\nthe event in which Muhammed ""PBUH"" was a part of was Islam and the message from God and the quraan bu5t if you mean abt wars and stuff.. Prophet Muhammed""PBUH"" leaded Muslims to victory on the battle of Badr and he was a part of all the wars because he wasnt afraid to die and he didnt send other muslims to fight his war.. and the purpose of all the wars was to spread Islam and to give the people the liberty to choose their religion.. \nMualims arent terrorists as  many may think Islam is based on Peace and the real Muslim is peacuful kind man and the biggest example for that is our Prophet Muhammed""Peace Be Upon Him"" he was a true peace maker he showed us how to make peace even with our enemies."
"Fish is not considered meat according to Jewish laws, but primarily the biblical support of the notion is in that, aside from fish, there are no specific accounts of Jesus eating meat.\n\nThe old testament suggest that seeds and fruits are men's appropriate diet -Genesis. The prophet Daniel and his companions were vegetarians according to the old testament, and were healthier that way than eating as the king did, based on an informal test mentioned that was conducted by their Babylonian care takers, to make sure they, as advisers to the king, were taking good care of themselves. Ezekiel also mentions food appropriate for vegetarians in the now famous - Ezekiel 4:9.\n\nGenerally speaking, religions which end up widely successful in their efforts to encourage humbleness regard vegetarianism preferable for that purpose, though usually do not require it. The accounts of Jesus in the Gospel support this notion. By suggesting those justified before God are the sinners that can't even lift his face to pray from shame, but still praying humbly, correlates with the saying ""The weak man only eats herbs, but the strong man eats anything."" Jesus never spoke without Spiritual importance reflected in it.\n\nVegetarianism is encouraged to aid in developing a refined approach to life of the spirit, and is recommended for the humility involved,. St. Paul spoke of nothing being unlawful in truth, but if eating meat offended his fellow men and women, that he'd remain vegetarian for their sake.\n\nThe vegetarian diet is also easier on the land, taking only 1/30 the amount of land for the same amount of nutrition as meat production, since most of the energy from the food goes to the animals rather than the humans intended."

On my way to school one time, I was sitting in the back seat of my friend's mother's car. He farted so bad that she gagged, and then barfed, all over the interior of the car, and then hit a telephone pole , while we were moving 40-45mph, I got thrown into the windshield from the back of the car, my friend paul had his seatbelt on, and so did his mom. the car was totalled. SO YES ONE CAN PASS OUT. I did, I recieved a massive concussion, 47 stitches on my head...
Use yourspell check on your computer. Not everybody spells right but its nice to try and practice makes perfect.
are you giving any out side theories any consideration?\nfrom what i see there have been some valid points in the 30 something questions you have written along these lines and you have shrugged every one of them off because you right..why are you so dead set in believing there's no god ?\nwould it not be nice to know the people you love are going to a better place?\ni think you do want to believe in god your just stubborn\nand so you want to be convinced beyond a Shadow of doubt.\nbecause your the kind of person that feels it's better to think the worst and if the worst happens oh well you saw it coming then hoping for the best because if that doesn't happen your not prepared...\nwell as smart as you are when you do come face to face to god your not going to know what the fuck to say.

I think that the universe is divine. That the expanding and contracting correspond to the Hindu view of the great cycle of Brahman breathing in and out. We begin at the starting point, evolve until we return to that same point. So what you've described above, that united existence, is pretty much the way it is regardless. (And before someone jumps on this and says they, aka scientists, no longer believe in a contracting universe ... That was before they discovered that each galaxy has a black hole at its center that draws everything in on itself. Once the galaxies have folded in upon themselves they will begin to draw each other until ... Contraction. Funny how contractions always come before birth. lol )

Isaiah 14:12 (KJV) is where the devil is referred to as Lucifer, other versions refer to him in that passage as morning star or another name. I'm not sure if the Bible ever refers to him as the King of Babylon. I couldn't find a reference to that in about four different translations but there are so many... you might try the website www.biblegateway.com it's a very useful tool
but who are you to know the truth? i mean why is your truth better than the person you are teaching it to?? \n\nif anything, you could use facts and figures, otherwise its your word against theirs. No truth about it. \n\neveryone thinks their truth is the real truth, so there is no reason to believe one more than the other, unless it can be supported in some sort of way.

"""Emo"" is actually a style of music as well.  Try searching for the emo music style and you will find out a lot about the culture.

"Yes, religion exists. For example, in Russia before the fall of communism, although religion was banned from practice, people did meet to discuss god, faith and religion. If a priest was present, they would also perform a liturgy and receive communion.\n\nHere is a story: There was a town in communist Russia. The local government asked for all the people to meet at the local sports arena/field. The people were told they are communists, long live communism, this is what you now believe, etc., etc. So everyone is like ""okay...whatever you say,"" but not much more. Then a government official asks if anyone has any questions. An old man around 80 stands up and comes down to the podium. All he says to the crowd is ""Christ is risen!"" EVERYONE in the crowd shouts back, ""Yes, truly He is risen!""\n\nThe power of faith never dies no matter what others try to force on you."

OK-I asked a few rabbis, and people from my community, to see what they think (I couldn't quite remember what I saw before...), and so far, I had answers saying that they did not think there was one specific simply (i.e. a Jewish star, a cross, etc.).  I'll contact you ASAP to let you know if I've found something.
This is the best question you have asked yet. Congratulations. I'm really proud of you. It is exactly stubbornness and insensitivity that makes people unable to accept evidence when it's clearly presented to them. Most of the time they refuse to even consider the evidence - however voluminous it is - because they have political and/or religious motivations for not doing so. Another important factor is education. The ability to consider information and evidence in a rational way is an important part of a healthy education. Those who don't receive it unfortunately fall prey to demagogues and people with a malicious desire to foment discord among people. We must not allow them to win.\n\nThe truth is out there for all those who choose to seek it.

Allah is Arabic for God. It comes from the Hebraic word Elohim which si the Jewish word for God. Arabic and Hebrew are cousin languages. \n\nChristian Arabs feel comfortable using Allah for the Christian God. \n\nAgain it is a word. Obviously how each party defines this word is quite different. The muslim view of God is very different than the Jew or Christian.
"Judas told the priests that he would lead them to Jesus, and show them who Jesus was by kissing him. Therefore, he betrayed Jesus with a kiss. Jesus was a ""blasphemer"" in the Jesuits eyes because he was proclaiming he was the son of god. And judas didn't hand jesus over to the romans, he handed jesus over to the high priests. They didn't have trials over someone as trivial as a carpenter. Also, i think Judas might have been dead by that time (he hung himself)."
hopefully, yes.
You're wasting your time you cannot argue a matter of faith using references outside of that which their faith considers truth.  Your reference to the Buddha's teachings are irrelevant to a Christianist.  But I think all religionists are wrong, with the exception of Hindus and even they are slightly wrong.

The survey, released this week, points out several disparities based on lifestyle, beliefs and political persuasion:\n\n•Republicans are happier than Democrats. \n•People who worship frequently are happier than those who don't. \n•The rich are happier than the poor. \n•Whites and Hispanics are happier than blacks. \n•Married people are happier than the unmarried. \n•Dog owners and cat owners rate the same. \n•Sunbelt residents are happier than everyone else. \n\nAbout 45 percent of Republicans said they were very happy, compared with 30 percent of Democrats. Republicans have been happier in surveys going back to 1972, the Pew study notes. \n\nThe reason might seem obvious, since ""Republicans tend to have more money than Democrats, and—as we've already discovered—people who have more money tend to be happier,"" the report states.\n\nBut even after adjusting for income, poor Republicans are happier than poor Democrats, and rich Republicans are happier than rich Democrats. \n\nWhat about religion? \n\nForty-three percent of people who attend religious services weekly or more say they're very happy compared to 26 percent of those who go seldom or never. The Pew analysis does not answer the question of how religion, Republicanism and happiness might be related, however.\n\n\n\nStarcameo, I pasted the entire article based on this Pew Research study on happiness which is almost 2 months old. If you assume that people who attend church more often are people of faith, then we are happier.\n\nGod bless."

The most important thing is develop your own beliefs.  If you believe in something; study it so that you have a foundation to what you understand, that will leave you less open to manipulation.  Most religions are about self improvement not social, so in developing religious beliefs you should be improving yourself which means some study.  Most manipulators rely on peoples ignorance not their own knowledge of the truth.  \n\nWhile fellowship is important in sharing and asserting what you believe it isn't where you should get your ideas.  Study what you believe and think deeply about it.  \n\nNever be afraid to question yourself or your beliefs because it leads to understanding.

Based on my own experience, having saved many a drowning persons life(I work in a bottle depot, it happens).\nMany times you rescue a blonde and she is often in fact a redhead, this is something you encounter in the recycling business a lot(oh I could tell you stories). Many redheads actually dye their topcoat(I am thinking of new and better ways to get past the Yahoo censors). This is a ploy to fool the sun into thinking the redhead is actually a blonde, voila less sunburns, the sun moves on to seek out another more obvious carrot top.\nI have to digress. I would only save one person, the blonde because she is also the redhead.\nIf not ,who cares the world could use one less redhead. Personally I would be gunning for Ron Howard, but I am sure that is just a pipe dream.
He comforts my broken heart...He hears my cries or my prayers and remembers them as I go through my day.  He has mercy on me, and protects me...as well as my family and friends.  He understands me...He knows my heart and He directs my path.  He stays by my side after I get off my knees instead of runnin' out the door to somebody else...and He becomes my best friend, day after day.
i'm stuck at work. in a small cubicle. with people that talk about the same things everyday. i feel like i'm living in the movie office space.
Angels are much the same way that God is.  They don't have a gender to be exact.  They can appear as women, they can appear as men, but because they don't pro-create, they are created, there is no need to assign gender.
No, Christianity is too contradictory and hypocritical. It is impossible to follow it. Don't fault the Christians for not being able to follow the religion, no one can. But do fault them for following it in the first place.
"Don't need to look for signs, Kiddo ... Look in the mirror!  You ARE a part of God, just as the air you breathe, from the moment you wake, and every little thought and action you take:  all are included in the universal ""plans"" for us all.  If you have a thought, any thought, this would reflect that you exist, right?  So, if you live and breathe - so does God!!"

Why are we here?
"No one deserves a disease. You'll find this out one day if a family member or friend dies of one. You may also die of some disease as well. How can someone say ""Amen"" to someone else getting a disease. Do you religious people believe that God wants someone to get a disease? I thought God was perfect. You people are cruel. No one deserves a disease. I don't know how you can wish that on anyone. Wait until someone you love dies of something. When it happens, come back and edit your response."

Well you are partly right. He became seperated for GOD for a short time so he  could take the sins of all of us upon him. God can not look upon sin so Jesus was alone and human on the cross. He paid the Ultimate price.He never lost his faith because he and GOD are one person. There is a passage that when he was praying in the garden of Gesemane he said Oh that you would take this cup from me(his crucifiction) but he then prayed but it is your will not mine that be done.So I dont know if this helps you any but it shows the fulfilment of the prophsey and that he had to be human to die for our sins yet never lost his faith or beliefs.

When you get older you become what they call, ""responsible"" and tend to recognize the consequences of your actions on your own..Then you see how they relate to all the things your parents say.. Or in some cases never said.."

Absolutely. And my wife and I used to go garbage picking in various neighborhoods the night before garage pickup. We've gotten all kinds of good, resaleable things. Such as a wine cart, book shelves, expensive electric typewriters, more things than I can even think of right now. It got so bad, we've had to quit, because we don't have room for everything. A good place we found to dumpster dive was behind a local Kmart. We've gotten a power saw, drills, flowers, plants, books, bags of dog food, cat food, lots of unopened potato chips bags, gum, health food bars, etc.. that had just recently expired. \nThe funniest time (looking back) was when I was in a dumpster and it started raining, I had trouble getting out, then it started to lightening, and it was amazing how I managed to fly out of that metal dumpster. My wife, who was watching, thought it was hilarious.
I was born on the 13th of January.  I have even had my 13th birthday on Friday the 13th!  I never gave 13 the chance to be unlucky for me.  I made it my favorite and lucky number.

"According to Hegel's thinking--reality constantly moves from thesis to antithesis into a synthesis of whatever is valid of thesis and antithesis.Then the a-t becomes another thesis  and it goes on and on.Historical m of Marx is the application of this dynamic into the process of history driven by economic materialism which also involve the dialectic of history with same pattern.This grand interpretation of history rests on a false major premise that history is driven only by economic forces.There is another imp premise that history is driven by the reality of human persons.This is so with the great men and women who influencce history whether for good or bad.Kings- queens-state persons-scientists-explorers-dicoverers--philanthropists-the giants of religiouns such as Christ AND THEOLOGIANS ETC.This personality orientation of history whih is supraeconomic has been argued by H.G.Wells i books inOutline of History."" Will Durant in ""History"".And most of all Arnold Toynbee ""civilization on Trial"" and twelve volume -study of history."
I believe Jesus was deeply in love with Mary. I believe the romans hid this, a better example or roman conspiracy is how they moved christmas from the summer to the winter. This no christian can hide because of the wise men follow the north star which is not visible in jerusalem during the winter. It's a known fact that they had to move christmas to coincide with another roman holiday as to avoid being killed. Do I believe that there is still a bunch of people tracing their blood line no. I think that just isn't worth it. Mary's bones would be gone by now. Returned to dust.\n\nthere are many conspiracies in the catholic church and since the church is the ones who put the bible together decideing what to put in or leave out then yes it is corrupt. All of the desciples had journals and thus all should have been included.

Ok, so I met this girl at church. Beautiful indian girl, so my natural macho instinct drew her to me. Some months later she invited me over for lunch, everyone else went inside the house so I was getting ready to make my move, then.................bbbrrrraaaaaaappp!! That girl farted up something  wicked, I swear I was going to die or that she was already dead! She was very embarrased, she ran into the house came back out and apologized like a million times. The damage was already done, I never spoke to her again.
"Who has heard the saying ""As you are now, I once was. As I am now, you soon will be"". It's not good to dismiss the dead, because they are right in saying this. We will all join them one day. There is no ""him or me"". We should hold their memories in respect"

"Amen is a universal word, and it comes from Hebrew. Every religion has it's own beliefs, Islam has that particular belief of 'amen' and angels. See explanation below and follow the other links to get information on the history and use of the word AMEN. \n\nFrom Wikipedia,\n\nThe word Amen (Tiberian Hebrew אמן ’Āmēn ""So be it; truly"", Standard Hebrew אמן Amen, Arabic آمين ’Āmīn) is a declaration of affirmation found in the Hebrew Bible and in the Qur'an. It has always been in use within Islam. It has been generally adopted in Christian worship as a concluding formula for prayers and hymns. In Islam, it is the standard ending to suras. Common English translations of the word amen include: ""Verily"", ""Truly"", ""So be it"", and ""Let it be"".\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amen"

I wouldn't think that they're gay. They're just having fun torturing one of their buddies, guys do that when they're really close. The guy I'm dating wrestles with his roommate and they're both definitely not gay.\n\nIs it gay that guys wrestle? They're all sweaty and touching each other. What about when they're working out in the gym and spotting each other? Stop making assumptions.
I believe if we care enough for one particular person they can become our 'soulmate'.  I don't believe they're just out there waiting for us to bump into them.  It's like anything else, there \nmust be commitment, trust, respect, love.  if you show those qualities to a person you care for, and they return those same feelings, they will be what you term a 'soulmate'
Be content with what God has given you. Stop thinking about yourself.
The primary reason is that most faiths or belief systems accept, as one of their tenants, that they are required to attempt to convert others into their religion; for the good of the other, but also for the good of the faithful (which is important).\n\nI understand that it can be frustrating.  In my own life, I try to remind myself that people attempting to convert me are (usually) well intended.  That doesn't mean I buy what they're selling... but I can accept that they are attempting to help me, within the confines of their understanding.\n\nAn easy example are Jahovah's Witnesses.  When they come to my door, I remind myself that they are putting their faith into practice.  What's more, since they believe I will actually go to Hell for not accepting their religion (which, of course, I don't believe)...  I can actually be grateful that they are willing to make the effort.  I can't bring myself to be angry with a person for trying to keep me from being condemned to hell.   Which is, after all, what they believe. Make sense?\n\nOf course, I often feel pity for them as well... because they have accepted that God will condemn them to hell if they don't go out and try to convert others...  It must be terrible to so fear their all loving God...\n\nI was six years old when I first realized that many people will attempt to 'help' me by sharing their fears & limited understanding with me.  And, of course, I've encountered some actual hostility by people attempting to convert me 'out of their love for me'.  Idiots I find easy to dismiss.  The fearful people I encounter generally just move me to pity and I'll often make a brief attempt to encourage them, and suggest to them that they needn't be so fearful.  They're usually too terrified to listen...\n\nPagans & Muslims, you'll find, are less inclined to attempt to convert you.  Christians, at large, are very likely to.  No need to sit and listen to their schpeal...  but, for you own sake if nothing else, attempt to understand their motives.  Most followers are just that...  fearful, terrified, followers.  As for leaders of many churches...  we'll, their motives are often entirely power based and materialistic.  They're a different story...  But, they're not typically the ones out trying to convert you.
their is no process, you just simply make the decision to let go and forgive. People hold grudges because they want to prove to the person that they are the one that's right, and don't want to see their own mistakes in the matter.
No not really I think I will stay with what I am. I get kicked around the way it is now don't want to get crippled being another race.
We live life in order to make the decision to follow God, through Jesus Christ.  That is my opinion as a Christian.  I feel that we are supposed to bring as many people as possible with us to Heaven and to live as good a life as possible.  We are called to strive for perfection, even though we can never attain it in this world.  We have no idea what we will know or remember when we die.  We will know our loved ones, but we will not cry.  It may be that just the bad memories are taken away.  I can't presume what Heaven will be like, but it is supposed to be better than this world can ever be.  It is perfect.  Blessings to you and good luck in your search.
uh...NO it is complete fiction!!!

Truthful people are generally repititive because Truth comes out automatically & u have to plan to tell a lie.\n\n4.Truthful people are generally stable in their family & professional life, Because to survive with truth in this tough world u ought to have a strong character.\n\nlook for these traits in the individuals & remember these traits are only indicative & not suggestive.\n\n Moreover after finding these traits use ur Sixth sense,intuition & listen to ur hearts voice in judging that person & at last Pray almighty God that u have taken a correct decision because we have many black sheeps moving freely in the society pretending....

Mithra was an ancient Persian god, who became a major deity of Zoroastrianism. He is cognate with the Hindu god Mitra.\n\nThe Persian Mithra apparently was the prototype for the Roman god Mithras, which became the object of a popular mystery religion in the Roman Empire; see Mithraism.\n\nThe Apollo asteroid 4486 Mithra was named after this Persian god.

"The concept and spirit of freecycling is awesome. There is no reason to throw away a perfectly good coffemaker just because you want a shiny new one. Give it to someone who can use it! \n\nThe thing that sucks about the official ""Freecycle"" (with caps) is that the so-called official organization (The Freecycle Network) is now trying to crush local groups who are also trying to do good. They are aligning themselves with major investors, and getting away from their original purpose... which was simply to help us be kind to the environment and help each other. It's too bad... hopefully the little guys will win, but somehow I doubt it. Watch for a major commercialization of ""Freecycle"" coming soon to a town near you."
Lennydog, I can't agree more. You've captured my perceptions and, I think, there are many more people who walk this earth who think as you do.  Religion is a means of controlling people and to make them act as you want them to act.  I think of myself as spiritual.

"Religion simply serves to validate homophobic feelings that will naturally arise, especially in men, in a patriarchal, macho society. In general, people find the sexually ""deviant"" acts of other people disgusting, although they have no problem with the ones they themselves engage in. For example, although both oral and anal sex would be considered deviant according to the Bible, most conservative Christian males only have a problem with the idea of anal sex because it implies male on male sex, which disgusts them personally because they're not attracted to men. But the idea of oral sex performed on a woman doesn't bother them. And in fact, some of them even engage in anal sex themselves, with women of course, but have no problem criticizing homosexuals who do the same. It's basically a double standard based on personal preferences and rationalized using religion as an excuse.\n\nAnother way you can tell it's a hypocritical double standard is to look closely at the verses in which the Bible appears to forbid sodomy and compare them to verses forbidding other things. For example, although sodomy appears to be forbidden only in the Old Testament, and is usually only mentioned in the context of another string of perversions as if sodomy alone were not the true problem, divorce and remarriage are forbidden not only in the Old Testament but in the New Testament as well. Jesus expressly forbids the separation of two people who have been brought together in marriage in God's name, but he says nothing whatsoever about homosexuality. Furthermore, if you look at the book in which the majority of the verses supposedly aimed against sodomy appear, Leviticus, you'll notice that it comes down equally as hard on a number of other behaviors which we have not vilified, including talking back to your parents. Therefore it's obvious that religious scripture is not the source of homophobia. The true source is a double standard born of personal preference and intolerance and rationalized by selective reading of religious scripture."

I do not share your faith, but will speak only as a person, as you ask. \n\nA life is the span of years alotted to a person to spend on this earth. It can be spent well or badly, but it WILL end. This is what gives it value. When it does end, many of us believe we go on to something else. I believe that. I have also seen some evidence that one who has died can influence those still among the living. When a life ends, I think it appropriate to celebrate that life.  It's good to remember all that the person brought to those around them and did in that life. \n\nIt is too bad that your uncle had to leave his family behind. Death is hardest on the living. I am sure he feels the love the family still has for him. It may help to think of him as not all that far away. Death brings a certain peace. Your uncle has been freed of his pain.

Well, your question is a bit ambiguous, kind of a catch 22.\n\nIn my case, I would prefer to be the athlete.  I would get lots of money, up-front.  During my athletic career, I would invest it as I would if I were a business man.\n\nOnce my career was finished I'd have a LOT more capital to use and can then approach my new business with more choices.  Keep in mind that part of being a successful businessman is in your ability to attract people, and certainly athletes are among the most popular of people.  Therefore, when they are done with their career, have a good portion of their income available for business, I would have to say I MUCH prefer being an athlete first!
No, it ain't.  The Church opposes it simply because this could influence a lot of Catholics..........................
women are just as spiritual as men ,probably more so. i would trust a women to be a pastor more than i would a man. i think they care more, and listen better, and understand the little things that can go wrong in your life can be big problems and i know that they have alot more patience!

"if it starts to drive me nuts i'd tell her that it's not cute to ""always"" look like twins"
Probably the time I was out walking around just minding my own business and just thinking about nothing in particular when it suddenly dawned on me that somewhere theres probably like another person doing the exact same thing as me but that if we were to meet up probably we wouldnt even realize thet we were both doing just about the same thing which really didnt matter since we werent doing much really and that if we never met probably woulnt matter since we wouldnt care since were just walking aimlessly and kind-of hanging out without much of anything important to do, but keep on doing it anyway 'cause tyats probably the purpose of anything at the moment to just hang in the moment so its liike my world and my space so whatever happens is all good so long as its out there and its free and so its like a gift or sumthing so whoever that other dude or lady is doing mnoything but just hanging out so cool for you too cause its all good and free and keep it real. whatever.
European artists first depicted what Jesus looked like. Anybody with a brain knows where he was born there weren't white people. The only thing that may be accurate is his hair color may have been at least lighter than those around him. He was describe as having a glow around his head, either his head truly had a glow around it or he had a blondish color hair. Just because humans make bad judgment calls or say things that aren't true shouldn't determine whether or not you believe. You were smart enough to figure this one out. Why not read some more of the bible and make your own decision on whether or not you believe. Good luck and God bless.

Because they think their better then everyone else.They think they can kick anybodys butt(when they can't).Or they just like to make peoploe think they can kick anybodys butt so no body will mess with them cause they know their weak and if they did fight they would get their butt kick really bad. So they make you think they can kick butt in hopes onebody will mess with them.Otherwhys they would get hurt.

Well, I can tell you that most people who dismiss things quickly are ignorant. Though every man woman and child is entitled there own opinion, I think that there would be alot more beleivers, if people sat down and did a little research beofre hand. Proof is such a funny word really, and its becasue people asign proof to the word TRUTH, which is not always the case. I beleive that FAITH, is more powerfull and TRUTH or FICTION, as it is a part of ones soul, and is what one must really tap before forming an opinion or beleif. So, in matters of ghost, religion, ect., I simply think that people do not beleive, or research wether or not they beleive is because they lack the proprer balance of Fact, Fiction, and Faith

Always ignore idiots
I'm a student and that would be great, but I also realize how much it would cost, people counld then jsut take blow off classes and get paid for something remedial. You think how much our govt. would be paying out every year to the millions of school we have?
Of course I would help as much as I can. I would definitely help out my best friend who saved my life and taught me so much. \n\nI just watched a tv show here in country and it was a show that helps good people who deserve it mainly poor ones.\n\nHere's the story:\nThey made a set up where there was this dis-abled man (a cripple) what he did was go up to people (he was on a skateboard) and ask if anyone would help him buy medicine for his mother (he had a prescription). People assumed he was asking for alms. So most declined. There was even a well dressed guy who stopped but flat out said no. He turned out to be sa pastor of some sorts (I think he just preaches at the street to make money).\n\nSo they changed location. The guy on the skateboard went toward a cigarette vendor and asked if he would help. (cigarette vendors here are very poor and usually live in shaty towns or just the streets). It turns out he helped the guy buy the meds. First the guy was suspicious that the vendor might just take the money and won't return. But the vendor return and with complete change.\n\nSo the show gave him a small store. Guess what happened next. Amazingly he packed some goods in plastic bags and went back to the place where he usually sell cigarettes and gave the food to his fellow vendors (of course he left things for him to sell) but I was surprised to see that. It was extremely touching.\n\nSo there. I hope you liked the story. It just goes to show that there are still people here on earth who are genuinely nice just like my best friend.

He doesn't knock me for going to church on Easter, and I don't knock him for his form of worship either.

Verrrry carefully and with a lot of patience!! lol  \nI guess it depends on WHO the bipolar person is ... you spouse, or a roommate or a parent or a child.  \nI am bipolar and mostly what's helped me and made it livable for those living with me, is \n1) they make sure I don't stop taking my meds (bipolar ppl are usually fine as long as they take their meds; sometimes they stop because the meds can make you feel a little blah) and \n2) they've let me know that they're supportive of my struggle and they're not judgmental.\n\nIt depends a little on how their behaviour manifests.  Lots of bipolar ppl go on spending sprees while manic; others just can't shut up and are bouncin' off the walls.  That would be me! lol  If I shopped as much as I talk, I'd be in a perpetual state of bankruptcy! lol\n\nIf you're just starting to live with someone who's bipolar, you should sit down and have a very truthful, all cards on the table, kind of conversatino about what you expect of eachother and what you are, and are NOT, prepared to do.\n\nI hope this helps.
Your not missing much, you sound pretty intelligent, and good for you that you searched it all out, instead of just accepting it.\n\nBut your header asks, why have faith? Faith, in its essence, is believing in something you have no proof of. As long as you are searching religion, you will NEVER find one that has hard truth for you to stick to. Faith is what makes religion what it is, not proof, or proven facts.
A husband in Islam is obliged to satisfy his wife sexually  in terms acceptable in Islam and the wife may divorce (by fasakh) her husband on counts of not fulfilling these sexual duties.\n\nEDIT:Compare it to today's divorce standards. A wife can divorce her husband even if the husband satisfies her fully and treats her well.
Smile, be courteous, and tip generously.

Because every one say that they are right and all are wrong.
Its not true. India, to be frank, is a very cultured country. These happen in mostly the Islamic and the Gulf countries. In India, people think a lot about their reputation in society, and even the society takes care of its members and their wellbeing. I don't say that this practice is 0%here, but it mostly prevails in the Muslim dominated areas of India. I do not blame Muslims for this, neither do I abuse them for the same, but it is so. And what I say is true, 'coz I am am an INDIAN. Here, the entire lives of people is dedicated to taking care of thein children. Those who have such habits, are simply boycoted.

Mary Magdalene. Her distinguishing name (meaning “Of (Belonging to) Magdala”) likely stems from the town of Magdala (see MAGADAN) on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee about halfway between Capernaum and Tiberias. There is no record of Jesus’ ever visiting this town, though he spent a great deal of time in the surrounding area. Nor is it certain that it was Mary’s hometown or place of residence. Since Luke refers to her as “Mary the so-called Magdalene,” some think he implies something special or peculiar.—Lu 8:2.\n\nJesus expelled seven demons from Mary Magdalene, reason enough for her to put faith in him as the Messiah and for her to back up such faith with outstanding works of devotion and service. She is first mentioned in the account of Jesus’ second year of preaching, when he and his apostles were “journeying from city to city and from village to village, preaching and declaring the good news of the kingdom of God.” Together with Joanna the wife of Herod’s man in charge, Susanna, and other women, Mary Magdalene continued ministering to the needs of Jesus and his apostles out of her own belongings.—Lu 8:1-3.\n\nThe most prominent notice of Mary Magdalene is in connection with the death and resurrection of Jesus. When Jesus, as the Lamb of God, was led to the slaughter, she was among the women “who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee to minister to him” and were “viewing from a distance” as Jesus hung on the torture stake. In her company were Jesus’ mother Mary, Salome, and also “the other Mary” (No. 4).—Mt 27:55, 56, 61; Mr 15:40; Joh 19:25.\n\nAfter Jesus’ burial, Mary Magdalene and other women went to prepare spices and perfumed oil before the Sabbath began at sundown. Then following the Sabbath, at the break of dawn, on the first day of the week, Mary and the other women brought the perfumed oil to the tomb. (Mt 28:1; Mr 15:47; 16:1, 2; Lu 23:55, 56; 24:1) When Mary saw the tomb was open and apparently empty, she rushed off to tell the startling news to Peter and John, who ran to the tomb. (Joh 20:1-4) By the time Mary got back to the tomb, Peter and John had left, and it was now that she checked inside and was stunned at seeing two angels in white. Then she turned back and saw Jesus standing. Thinking him to be the gardener, she asked where the body was, that she might care for it. When he replied “Mary!” his identity was immediately revealed to her and she impulsively embraced him, exclaiming, “Rab·bo′ni!” But there was no time now for expressions of earthly affection. Jesus would be with them only a short time. Mary must hasten to inform the other disciples of his resurrection and that Jesus was ascending, as he said, “to my Father and your Father and to my God and your God.”—Joh 20:11-18.

yes, and its a pretty gruesome process.  they don't do it in a hospital, they do it in a tent.  the surgical tool of choice?  an old rusty razor blade.\n\nFemale Genital Mutilation (FGM) is an invasive and painful surgical procedure that is usually performed without anesthetic on girls before puberty. There are about 100 to 140 million women who have been circumcised. An average of about four girls a minute continue to be mutilated. Their clitoris is partially or completely removed. This inhibits or terminates sexual feelings. It has been a social custom in Northern Africa for many centuries. \n\nMany people link FGM with the religion of Islam. Actually, it is a social custom that is practiced by Animists, Christians, and Muslims in those countries where FGM is common. There are many Muslim countries in which the mutilation is unknown.\n\nFGM is occasionally performed in North America on girls of families have immigrated from countries where FGM is common. An analogous practice, Intersexual Genital Mutilation, (IGM) is sometimes performed on intersexual infants born with ambiguous genitalia\n\ngoogle it----
"""Son of man, speak to your countrymen and say to them: 'When I bring the sword against a land, and the people of the land choose one of their men and make him their watchman,  and he sees the sword coming against the land and blows the trumpet to warn the people,  then if anyone hears the trumpet but does not take warning and the sword comes and takes his life, his blood will be on his own head.  Since he heard the sound of the trumpet but did not take warning, his blood will be on his own head. If he had taken warning, he would have saved himself.  But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet to warn the people and the sword comes and takes the life of one of them, that man will be taken away because of his sin, but I will hold the watchman accountable for his blood.'  Ezekiel 33:2-6\nGood job buddy33, keep up the good work.  Further the kingdom."

"From you: to each the Mom, MIL and the wife something luxurious that they would never buy for themselves.  A Spa day at a luxurious spa? If they are friendly, maybe they cold all go together and have a day with the ""girls"". But, do not give exactly the same thing to each. Make each one special in some way.  Make your wife's gift the most elaborate. Your Mother's next most elaborate, then your MIL's.  But don't make any one look ""chintzy"" or cheap next to the others.\n\nI am a firm believer in kids creating their own gifts, and discouraging store bought gifts from kids.  I think having them think they must buy something leads to feelings of inadequacy and to expecting others to take responsibility for their gift giving for them.    Little kids can color and create beautiful cards, and pictures, make clay hand-prints. or take pictures of themselves and mount them on thin Styrofoam and a base so they stand up.  Mom's and G-mom's love this stuff that just can't be bought at the store.  Breakfast in bed is always a good thing for the wife. The kids can help make simple foods and carry it to her and all snuggle around her while wishing her a Happy Mother's Day. Special Dinner out a favorite restaurants could be good, either all at once or a special night out for you and the Wife.  It all just depends on your family dynamics and finances."
"As I've responded to various similar questions, abortion was legalized solely to appease feminists. It was legalized by men, not man enough to tell feminists ""Abortion is murder, no matter how many bras you burn!""\n\nAbortion is nothing short of women murdering children for the sake of ""empowerment"" and ""liberation"". It is supported by feminists trying to free themselves from their God given natures. Women offended by being the child-bearer and nurturer. It is supported by feminists who want to be sexual whores, like men, and kill the children. Claiming, the child was conceived in accident, as if they aren't aware that sex is procriation.\n\nAbortion is also held dear by feminists for competition's sake. Feminists know, if the mothers of the, estimated, 1.2 million babies killed anually, in the US alone, were not allowed to abort, woman in the work force would be few. Such an insentive is nothing short of barbaric. Women using murder to compete in the work force, is no different than white, rich, men taking advantage of others for their selfish gain.\n\nThe only truth abortion has proved, is that woman can be just as careless, and selfish as any male ""oppressor"".\n\nAlso, I do not support abortion in any situation. Including rape or incest. Murder is murder, no matter the inspiration. Pro-lifers often say they would support abortion in the cases of rape and incest in fear of sounding callous. However, morality and justice can not be compramised. The value of a human life can not be compramised. Fear can not cause those who stand for justice to compramise."
Build the facility in a way that you'd want it to be built if you were the one who was going to have to work or live there.  Don't skimp or do shoddy work, serve the clients with a smile. . . that sort of thing.  Manage it in the same way.  Jesus said to love God with all your heart, and your neighbors just like yourself.  Apply that simple rule to any choice you need to make when building or managing the facility, and you'll make the right choice.  God never makes it difficult to know how to serve Him.
Greece and its too hot
"There is no Biblical reference in the Gospels of Jesus approving of killing, even in self defence he points out it isn better to be hit again than to hit back.  \nIt seems completely against the teachings of Jesus to execute another person as it is fundamentally against the idea that a person can repent sins and be forgiven.  It is also against the idea of not seeking revenge - which is the main point of execution.  And it is against the idea of ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you""."
yup, they did. thats just science. its been proven scientifically. however, the bible teaches us that man is flawed, right? well, the bible was written by men, a few hundred years after jesus died. so, isnt it safe to say that if man is flawed, so is the book he's writing? just because a book says that god made men before animals, and its been proven wrong, that doesnt mean that we werent still created by a greater power, or for a specific purpose. i think ppl are too worried about the book having every word be literally true, and not concerned enough with going through the day trying to be a good person.
"The word 'Son' as far as God is concerned refers to his creations. When we pray, do we not say ""Our Father in the Heavens""? We humans cannot understand how grand he is - but he doesn't want us to fear him and so he lets us call him 'Father'. We can all relate to a father; most of us have had one.\n\nJesus was created before the angels, before the earth, before anything and everything. He helped God create everything else. Jehovah God himself calls him his ""only-begotten son"". He's the one he sent to earth to redeem us. \n\nAs for the Bible suffering corruption - just think about this, if God is powerful enough to create us, to destroy us, don't you think he can preserve his word alive? The key is research - if you look in the right places, you will find what you are looking for - and sadly, Yahoo answers very rarely meets expectation.\n\nI hope this helps!"
There is no such thing as black magic.  Wiccans don't tend to send out cards to anyone they don't know with '79' scrawled on them in red marker pen.  Occultists are people who study the occult in its myriad forms and probably wouldn't have time to bother sending out cards to random people.  \n\nThe numbers 7 and nine are sometimes considered to be lucky numbers.  Everyone has heard of 'Lucky number 7' and 9 is thought to be a number with positive and powerful connotations for wiccans/witches/pagans/occultists whatever you want to call them because it is 3 X 3.\n\nI have never heard of them being combined to do harm.  Just ignore them.

We can, but most choose not to.  There has be a liberalization of etiquette in our American culture over the last couple of decades and this has lead to a general reduction of etiquette with our society.  Remember that the choice is an individual one that can be encouraged by family, friends and loved ones.  Having proper etiquette is a way to show others around you that you have respect for them.
Because they don't has any sense.  These parents are too much of a wuss and lack common sense to teach their child the proper way to act and get along with society.  They need to keep their children beside them at all times while at your house or in public.  If not, the minute the kid is out of site he'll be getting into to something he has no business getting into.
"If your question is the same as the other one, then there is something your friend can do.  Most ""head shops"" carry drinks that are specifically formulated to clean your body of any trace of marijuana.  I've never smoked the stuff myself, but I have friends who have passed drug tests only a day or two after smoking because of the system-cleaning drinks they bought at head shops.  Wish your friend luck for me."
"There is a 06/06/06 every 100 years, so what is the big deal with this one?  Twice a day the time is 6:06 and 6 seconds, so we should be worried? We aren't promised even one more day, so we should each day as the Lord intended. I think people are worried because this is Satan's ""number"".  It says in the Bible that no one not even Jesus or the angels know the day of judgment, so I don't believe he would pick a day of 06/06/06... be blessed"
If Jesus came back, nobody would believe him anyway and they would throw him/her in a funny farm like they do with everyone else who claims to be Jesus.
"I've heard this before - actually when I was teaching English in France!\nIts not meant to be taken literally, its more of a satirical look at the way other countries see the States. For example, have you also got one which says ""In England, you must always start a converstion with a comment about the weather"" ? That's because we do like to talk about the weather here. Its a kind of stereotype, for our modern times.\n\nIt is also not meant to offend anyone!"

If she's shallow you don't want her anyways.\n\nWhen I was shallow an immature (back when I was 17-18) I dated a few guys cause they were ""hot"" then I grew up.

Gee! This is really tough to figure out. Why would a female expose her boyfriend to a sexy exotic dancer with all the connotations that go with that lifestyle?\n\nI don't know, You've got me.

To touch wood or knock on wood is a superstition action to ward off any evil consequences or bad luck, perhaps because of some recent action you’ve taken or untimely boasting about your good fortune (“I’ve never been in danger of drowning, touch wood”); it can also be a charm to bring good luck.\nThe origin is unknown, though some writers have pointed to pre-Christian rituals involving the spirits of sacred trees such as the oak, ash, holly or hawthorn. There is, I’m told, an old Irish belief that you should knock on wood to let the little people know that you are thanking them for a bit of good luck. There’s also a belief that the knocking sound prevents the Devil from hearing your unwise comments. Others have sought a meaning in which the wood symbolises the timber of the cross, but this may be a Christianisation of an older ritual. It wasn’t always wood that was lucky: in older days, iron was also thought to have magical properties, and to touch iron was an equivalent preventative against ill-fortune.\nThe phrase itself is relatively modern, as the oldest citation for the British version of the phrase, touch wood, that I can find dates only from 1899. The American equivalent knock on wood is roughly contemporary, with my first example from 1905.
Jeroboam.  I Kings 12: 25-33
Because their preachers and pastors try to entice them into hatred for other religions and cultures so that they dont' deviate away from Christianity. Doing so, ensures that the pastors keep getting their follower's money and living lives that are far from humble. Don't believe me? Look at the most prominent telavangelists on TV and look at their homes and lifestyle. They all have atleast $1,000,000 in the bank, and drive nice sports cars; which they could of used the money instead to help the needy instead of being greedy.\n\nThe Bible states that all sins carries the same weight, and yet you see Christians bashing gays, and promoting the lies of Santa Claus and Easter Bunny to their kids. Ironic, isn't it?
I used to have one as a kid and I loved it. I didn't take it seriously though.  They just change color based on temperature.  The typical stone will turn blue when it's hot, black when it's cold, and green or red in the middle. Not much to it really.

According to the Bible, God loved Abraham and promised him that from him he would make a nation. Abraham had faith in God's promise even though he and his wife Sarah were getting very old and had no children. Sarah did not share the same faith as Abraham. After some time, she presented her slave Haggar (an Egyptian) to Abraham so that they could conceive a child. Hence, Ishmael (Arabs) was born. Sarah later became pregnant with Issac (Jews). Once Issac was born, Sarah could not bear to look at Haggar and her son. Sarah made Abraham send Haggar and Ishmael away. Genesis ch.15-18, 21.\nBoth Isaac and Ishmael are fathers of nations. The Jews are God's chosen people because the orginal promise was for Abraham and his wife Sarah.

"If by nature you mean as a person is born, including heredity and genes, I believe this influences human behavior by about 50%.  However, the nurturing a human receives via parents, friends, teachers, and others a person meets and/or sees in life then influence a person's behavior by about 50%.  A person starts out with certain characteristics and learns to deny or appreciate, accept or seek out scenarios which then show that person what he/she enjoys or not.  Life is choices.  So I would need to say ""both""."
"It turns out there isn't a third word that ends in ""gry"", at least not a common one. Augery, the practice of divination by inspecting the innards of sacrificial animals (usually chickens), is sometimes spelled “Augry”, but it is far from common. \n\nThe “gry” question comes from a riddle that has been distorted. As a preface, here is a much more common riddle:\n\n“Railroad crossing, watch out for the cars. How can you spell it without any R’s?”\n\nIf you write the railroad crossing riddle with correct punctuation, as opposed to saying it aloud, the second sentence is:\n\n“How can you spell ‘it’ without any R’s?”\n\nAnd the answer is obvious – “I-T”. The first sentence just diverts your attention. A minor variation asks you to spell “that” without any R’s.\n\nHowever, if someone overheard the railroad crossing riddle on the playground, didn’t hear the answer, came home and asked “Dad, how can you spell ‘railroad crossing’ without using the letter ‘R’?”, the riddle would be so distorted that it would be impossible to answer.\n\nBack to the three words that end in “gry”. It started out as a riddle, with the same structure as the railroad crossing riddle. The original form is:\n\n""Angry and hungry are two words that end in ‘gry’. There are three words in the English language. What is the third word? Everyone knows what it means and everyone uses it every day. Look closely and I have already given you the third word. What is it?""\n\nNote the structure; the first sentence diverts your attention and has nothing to do with the question. The last three divert your attention too. The second and third sentences, with proper punctuation, are:\n\n“There are three words in ‘the English Language’. What is the third word?”\n\nThe answer to the riddle is “Language”.\n\nI hope you can see the double exterior quotation marks and the single interior ones in this font, by the way. Punctuation is important. Back to the riddle – for some reason it is quite popular in its distorted form: \n\n“There are three common words in the English language that end in ‘gry’; ‘hungry’ and ‘angry’ are the first two. What is the third?” In that form, the question is impossible to answer, just as you cannot spell “Railroad Crossing” without using the letter “R”. (Yes, you can say \n“A-I-L-O-A-D   C-O-S-S-I-N-G”, \nbut that isn’t spelling it properly.)"
"What do you mean ""less oriented""?"
Honey, your age difference shouldn't matter--that isn't much and it sounds like an excuse to me.  I think that is his hint that he's not interested in you as a sexual partner.  You could remain friends if you can tolerate the situation, but don't expect more.  Look elsewhere for someone who deserves your affection and devotion AND returns it in kind.  It's very difficult trying to find your soul mate  and you've only just begun.  In my experience, it takes gay men alot longer than lesbians to find their lifelong partner.  Good luck.
It is a very logical way to think and to assume that you either believe or disbelieve.\nGranted.\nHell is never meant to be everlasting; otherwise God is not Merciful.\nHell is transitory, meaning that whoever enters hell would emerge eventually a reformed soul.\nAll Divine religion teach about the same One God, obedience to Him and submission to Him, to worship Him etc.\nReligions went through phases of development, as man has also undergone development all over the universe.\nIf you analyze all religions, every single one of them is a National Religion, a Regional religion or a religion for a particular tribe.\nIslam is the only Universal religion, calling and beckoning all to its fold.\nJesus was Jewish and sought after the Jews alone, who rejected him.\nMuhammad (PBUH) came to the entire human race.\nHell is likened to a hospital, in Islam, so after the cure you go on to an everlasting life in Paradise.\nWelcome to Paradise!!

"I've heard that when Judaism originated, the Israelites regarded their god as their national god and recognised that other peoples had their own gods, but I'm not sure how true that is. I do find it interesting that in Genesis, when Adam and Eve eat the forbidden fruit, god says, ""Now he has become like one of US!"" So it's possible that the Jews originally thought of pagan gods as real rivals to their god, rather than non-existent beings."
I love the Amplified Bible. It gives insight into things like this. The NIV, which you are quoting, is not very accurate, by the way - use a parallel Bible with several versions beside each other, and it'll help.\n\nMoses neglected to circumcise one of his sons because his wife (Zipporah) was opposed to it. Therefore, he was honoring the will of his wife above the command of God.\n\nIt was very important for Moses to learn that God means what he says at this point, because he was going to be leading the nation of Israel and representing God to them.
it's a symbol of the pentagram with two points going upwards as a sign of duality and three points going downwards as a sign of defiance of the holy trinity and has a goats head inside of the star. it is used in Satanism. was made popular by Anton LaVey (founder of the Church of Satan). there is also another version of the baphomet that has a goat siting on a rock with black angel wings, two hands spread out (one pointing up, the other down), has a female chest, a blanket or robe wrapped around it's lower body, has words written in each fore arm, and some times depicted without the blanket or robe to hide it's phallus. both versions are a physical representation of Satan, hence why they are used in Satanism. if you want to actually see what they look like, just type in baphomet in the image search part of Google.com. you'll find better results with the safety search off. you could also try the Church of Satan web site.
IMHO..It depends on the age and maturity of the child.  Also, do you mean work as in chores or work as in flipping burgers at the local burger joint? Because chores are always a wonderful teaching tool for all children.  Flipping burgers..depends on the child's level of responsibility and maturity
No, I would not defend my religion IF my religion was proven wrong.  It serves no purpose to stick with something that is not right.  Unless of course you like it that way.  Everyone has that choice though.  Personally, I would convert if I found something else to be right.
All the above.
If god really is on your side, then what's with the paranoia? surely he has everything under control, yes?
Put your hands over your eyes and claim you are invisible? Actually it would depend on the layout of the theater.  One large megaplex local to me has a hallway where people exit and if you walked in through the doors while others were exiting you'd never get caught unless someone asked you for your ticket.  They key I've found to anything shady like this though is to act like you belong there and know what you are doing.  Do that and you can accomplish almost anything.

Too bad parents don't have that right...or at least be given lesser punishments.\n\nI've always heard that child predators are ""taken care of"" in jail by the other inmates.....I sincerely hope that is true.\n\nShort of that, I think cutting off their offending appendages would suffice."
With my dad it's religion AND politics.  He's pretty rigidly conservative republican and I can't understand it.  I don't want to change his views, but I'd like him to accept that mine are valid.  We have to really avoid talking about these things to remain civil when we're together.  It's gotten pretty ugly at times.
"In Genesis when God created Adam he became a living soul.(Gen.2:7)Also,throughout the Bible,animals are called souls.\nThe soul is not immortal--that is a false teaching that is found nowhere in the Scriptures.At ezekial 18:4 it tells us that ""the soul that is sinning,it shall die."" In the book of Acts it tells us: ""And it shall come to pass,that every soul which will not hear the Prophet,shall be destroyed from among the people."" (Acts 3:23)\nWhen a soul(person) dies,they return to the dust ,awaiting a resurrection to either life in heaven or to life on a paradise earth."
You keep on going up the corporate ladder until you either find someone who treats you fairly. If that doesn't happen, you do not let it go, you do something about it; get a lawyer and sue the company so that that kind of crap stops, alert the media and do an interview on television, make a difference, stand up and be heard and don't let anyone treat you different!

"I would say 80% of the criticism given to Mormons is just as applicable to the person's religion giving the criticism.\n\nDo you have faith? Because you really HAVE to if you believe in ANY religion. What are you? Likely a Protestant sect, maybe Catholic? Have you seen YOUR history? Gosh--there is dirt everywhere my friend! If you really looked at all that has happened to Christianity since Christ's ascension--it make's Mormon's history look good! Constantine, the Crusades? Oh--perhaps that little habit of burning at the stake for those that spoke against the church? How about a very loooong list of sexual atrocities committed by those in Christian church authority throughout history? (Or even recently i.e. the Catholics) \n\nWhy has God let all of this happen?? It has happened because imperfect people lead churches of imperfect people. In some Christian sects this imperfectness is actually perpetuated. Gosh, paying in advance for sins you want to commit? Who are you really kidding?! You think you or your religion is squeaky clean? Just name it and I'm sure we can round up a nice big list. \n\nThe Mormon religion went through a lot during the period in which it was restored. There was a lot of really awesome things that happened. And yes, a lot of really bad things to counter that. You can't look all the imperfect people that make up a church to pass judgement on it. Ever heard of, ""By their fruits ye shall know them""? Look at the Mormon church today. Their beliefs today. The good they do in the world today. It is a church of real people. Real people that have hope that they can improve their lives and maybe even help improve the lives of those around them. \n\nPassing judgement is easy. Trying to understand people is much harder. It's worth it though--give it a try. Here is where you can start: \nhttp://www.mormon.org\nhttp://www.lds.org\nhttp://www.lds.org/newsroom"

Nah, I figure if Jesus can walk on water, he can actually zap a few bits of cholesterol!
Neat trick. I'll tell the subs to not answer my questions. I wonder if it will work?
Yes, because they push a false belief that pulls away from God, and from trusting in Him.  \n\nThe same goes for those horoscopes that are in the newspaper.  There is absolutely no evidence that the movements of stars and planets, coupled with our birthdays, has anything to do with either our personalities or our future lives.\n\nAnd like tarot cards, they pull people away from God.  People who fall for this crap are basically saying that God isn't good enough for them -- that they don't have to trust Him and can find out their futures through some magic means.
believe and pray to God for help and I guarantee He will answer ALL prayers.  Given it may not be as you want it to be but only God knows all the answers and reasons so you just have to trust and I promise He won't let you down like all these humans.  He is the only one I know that will protect and care for me no matter what\nso all in all God loves you so much that He gave his only son's life for you.  Could you do that for someone you loved?  I truely don't think I could so that shows you how much he loves us all.
"As a child the chandelier used to swing from side to side, and the radio would turn on by itself in the middle of the night.\n\nOne time on a camping trip I was walking back from the bathrooms at that moment right between day and night and I saw someone walk across the front of the site and stop behind a tree. So I figure one of the people is going to jump out and try to surprise me, so I pull out my flashlight, walk up to the tree, turn on the light, and there's no one there.\n\nOne time I was alone in a house, and I felt a presence. I looked at a mobile hanging motionless, and said, ""If there is anyone else here, make the mobile spin."" The next moment, the mobile began to spin.\n\nOne time I was driving into Ponca State Park to set up a large camping gathering, and the sides of the road were lined with spirits. All standing there, clearly visible to everyone, calmly welcoming us back.\n\nOn another camping trip, we felt a spirit near the bon-fire. We had a ring of 40 tiki-torches around the bonfire. It was a still and windless night, but all the tiki flames near the spirit bent in. One of the people in the circle had a fancy camera. After the campout she went to get the film developed, and all the photos from before the visitor turned out, but after that all the film was blank. She took the camera in to be repaired. The repairman asked if she'd been in a nuclear power plant. All the innards were fried from electromagnetism\n\nMy grandmother died while my niece was in utero. After my niece was born, she would look up at areas where no one was standing, and laugh and giggle. We all knew that she was looking at gramma, so we never showed her any pictures. Finally, at about a year old, she could speak, and my sister showed her the family photo album. My niece picked out her photo and said, ""That's Old Gramma."""

Yes I have, but first I want to talk about what it means to be worst or first. Success isn't achieving a popularity contest after you've been nothing to the crowd. Success is overcoming your own personal weaknesses and making them strengths. \nThis is my success - eight years ago I was critically injured, damaging my brain and fracturing bones on one side of my body. After a coma, I had months of therapy every day. Learned to open my mouth, make noise, hold my head up, sit up, move on command, make sounds, into words, stand up with the help of a person, sit in a wheelchair. You get the idea - stand up by myself and walk, to speak and talk to people. Count, write, and went back to college later that year with a wheelchair, then a walker, then crutches. It was hard, but I wanted bad enough to keep going. Finally I walked on my own, took driver's ed at the university, studied, became part of the national honor society in my field, and graduated from college. After that, I became a personal trainer, then a massage therapist. Please don't assume that because I went so far, it was easy. It wasn't. It was grueling and exhausting. I was dealing with depression and had to fight urges to hate myself.  \nI am a success. I don't say that because I work downtown, training executives in an office building, or massage across the street at the city's swankiest hotel. I am a success because I never gave up. Life's not over, I still don't give up. That's success, you just keep going.

"This was done for a prophectic, visual analogy.

Shame.\n\nKeep it in context, folks."
For me it was my grandmother.  She was 76 when I was born and almost 87 when she died.  She had Alzheimer's, although in 1975 they did not use that term - it was just 'senile' then, and had to live the last four years of her life with constant care in a nursing home.  I visited her three times a week and even though she didn't have her mind I think she always knew who I was because even though she didn't verbalize at that point she always got upset when my father (her son) visited without me (he stopped every day on his way into work).\n\nWhen I visited my grandmother I noticed the many other men and women in the home who did not have anyone visiting them.  Being the young child I was I started visiting them too so that when I went I had my 'rounds' to make.\n\nIt caused a lot of happiness in these people to be remembered even if it was only by a small child who was not biologically connected to them in any way.  It taught me a lesson in love that to this day I will never forget.  It also taught me that every human life has value and should never be forgotten.\n\nI am thankful for the lesson that that experience has taught me.
It's because Wiccans don't judge other religions the way Christians do.  They believe all religions are correct in their own way and that as long as you are living a good life and not harming others - there is nothing wrong with what you choose to believe.  Christians on the other hand - believe it's their way or the highway.  They think they are right and everyone else is wrong and anyone who doesn't believe what they believe is going to hell.  Basically - they're hypocrites.

Let me add, that we have a Governor General of our country and Lieutenant Governors of our provinces, who are reps of the Queen for state occasions.  We play God Save the Queen and O Canada for them.  We still have tremendous ties of affection with Britain and the Queen.  Her Majesty gets a warm welcome from Canadians when she visits.
It isn't for begging.  Some people do beg, but really it is just conversation with Him.  That is the case in most religions... They talk to their god.  Just as we ask for things from our earthly father - we can ask things of our Heavenly Father.
crvena veštica - red witch.\n\nThat is a way we called one extremely evil person - Mirjana Marković, wife of Slobodan Milošević, Yugoslav and Serbian president and war criminal.\n\nHis wife was even more evil than he was, so she got a nickname red witch. Red because she was a leader of one neo-communist party.\n\nShe run away from the country, and went to Moscow. never came here again not even for the funeral of her husband because if she does she will be arrested, and probably sent to jail where she belongs.\n\nAnd I believe she will stay there for her own safety
Profound.  He who draws the biggest circle wins!
The word itself is extremely demeaning and I don't neccessarily like using it but because it was a word said to us to make us feel inferior many black people believe that we have ownership of this word thereby determining who can say it and how it will be said. the general concensus is that if you are not black and use the word it automatically reverts back to its orginal meaning whereas if a black were to say it to another black person it becomes a term of our endearment. usually it doesn't make sense to those who are not black but this is the way the majority of feel and hope it helped have better insight on the situation.
Maybe you'd prefer they all act like skanks? I hope not.\nPerhaps they're simply not interested in YOU, not all black men.
Some people (Paris Hilton, for example) are waaaaaaaay expired on their 15 minutes.  I had my picture in the NY Times once, but not my name.  I hope that doesn't count for me, LOL!
Islam is not the problem.  It is fundamentalists of any religion that are the issue.  Christianity killed more people during the Crusades and the Inquisition then any Islamic groups are doing today.\n\nI'm not condoning either... and I believe that both are valid religions - just not in a judgmental mode. \n\nLook at the Sufi texts - they are a sect of Islam that is very spiritual.

You contact the immigrations dept of the country, online. If there is no website, you contact the ambassador's office in Washington DC and ask for the information. It is my opinion that you will be unable to get detailed information, so I would suggest that you make a visit to the country (passport will be required) and get in touch with a representative of the government on a local level. Good luck !
i just think it's overpriced.
his point is that he can not pray at school and work , which are two public places. there have been many cases where children have been sent home for wearing Christian t shirts, reading bibles , and turning in reports with bible quotes in them. we are given the freedom of religion not freedom from religion.

"Many (MATT.7:14)christians try to cite verses(1TIM.1:7)(MARK 7:7) to say the ""10 commandments are done away with""; when they don't know what the passage is saying. They want to attack Jesus; so they're against Christ; so I wouldn't call them christians. But back to your question--\nSome (MATT.7:14)christians still keep the law because the Bible tells us to. These same christians follow Jesus (Col.2:6).\nHere are the verses for the 10 Commandments in New Testament:\n     ROM.3:31; GAL.3:21; JOHN 14:15; 15:10; 1JOHN 3:4,24; 5:2-3; REV.12:17; 14:7,12"

"Dude,\nSorry about the ""abuse"" but I hope you won't judge God, or even all Christians, by all those who claim to wear His label. Please realize that just because someone has accepted Christ into their life, doesn't mean that they are suddenly all knowing  or perfect. I've been a Christian  for a long time, and there were many times that I thought my ship had come in spiritually, only to find that I'd washed up on the shore again. Wonder how many people I hurt? I meant meant well, but was just confused. We're still humans, and humans (of all sorts, even Christians who are trying the best they can,) make mistakes.\nI hope that somewhere in your seeking, you run across someone who is serious about their relationship with God, and that they are a good reflection of who He is. I know that once you see Him for who He really is, you will be awed. I was. I still am. You are in my prayers."
"First off, why would you have an orgy during a waning moon? That would be crazy, it would have to be a full moon or we should just take the moon part out.

We aren't required to have long beards. We are encouraged to. This is so that women or men(who have homosexual tendencies) do not get aroused. I guess it's sort of a turn off for women. We don't keep long hairs. You're probably thinking of Sikhs.
"You've asked a BRILLIANT question. Indeed, if psychics ""know all"", why aren't they able to control their own lives, avoid accidents, get rich on stocks or the lottery? \n\nThe answer is clearly, they DON'T know ""all"", in fact, they don't know anything except how to bilk money out of gullible people. Commercial psychics use tricks of observation to ferret out ""tells"" (like in poker) about someone and make general statements that could apply to anyone similar to the poor deluded client. Using their powers of observation and generalizations about people, they tell the client amazingly accurate things that they figured out (no spirit doing the channeling, sorry.)\n\n Here's a prediction; despite being debunked, psychics will continue to have customers, because as Barnum said ""A sucker is born every minute."""

Well, it's a touchy situation, but you have a few options:\n\n~You could charge the guy rent, but then he'd have the right to be there full time.\n~You have the right to ask your roomate to limit overnight company to 1-2 nights a week max.  Anything past that is inconsiderate.\n*****If trying to work it out with your roomie doesn't work, or if your requests get ignored, then it's probably time to find a new roomate or move out.\n\nThe creepy guy sounds like a free-loader.  Him and your roomate are being very inconsiderate and unfair to you.  \nA person who sleeps at your house at least 1/2 of a week--EVERY WEEK--lives there, albeit on a part-time basis.  But this dude is living at your house for 1/2 the month.]\n\nIf you were not consulted about this living arrangement and or given the opportunity to give your consent or approval, then you have been wronged.

"my philosphy is to each his own =)\n\nThe English word ""Taoism"" is used to translate the Chinese terms Daojiao (道教) and Daojia (道家). The character Tao 道 (or Dao, depending on the Romanisation scheme one prefers) literally means ""path"" or ""way"", but in Chinese religion and philosophy has taken on more abstract meanings. The compound Daojiao refers to Daoism as a religion (i.e., people worshipping at altars); Daojia refers to the activity of scholars in their studies. It must be noted that this distinction is itself controversial and fraught with hermeneutic difficulty.\n\nMuch uncertainty exists over the meaning of ""Taoism"". In some countries and contexts (for example, the national ""Taoism"" organisations of China and Taiwan), the label has come to be applied to the Chinese folk religion, which would otherwise not have a readily recognisable English name. However many, if not most, of its practitioners would not recognise ""Taoism"" (in any language) as the name of their religion. Moreover, the several forms of what we might call ""elite"" or ""organised"" Taoism often distinguish their ritual activities from those of the folk religion, which some professional ""Taoists"" (Daoshi) tend to view as debased.\n\nChinese alchemy, astrology, cuisine, several Chinese martial arts, Chinese traditional medicine, fengshui, and many styles of qigong breath training disciplines have some relationship with Taoism."

That is all nonsense. You have to wait 4 months and 10 days days after your divorce before you can get re-married(just to make sure you are not pregnant). Is it important where it is written if you are not ready to understand and abide by it?

I dont know why people are racist. It's just been an ongoing thing that has happened since eternity. If you asked me, I think it's absolutely stupid, as well as ignorant. Theirs this whole mentality, in which people believe their superior to other races, but in reality we're all the same people. The only thing that's different is our skin color, and our cultures. But deep down, you have the rebel person from a culture, that relates to another rebel in a different culture, you have the preppy person that relates to another preppy person in a different culture, you have the shy kid from a culture that can relate to another kid in a different culture. To sum things up, WE'RE ALL THE SAME, no matter what. I just wish people would take those topics into consideration, and just realize that we are the same people, and leave behind the fact of wanting to put others down, or block their successes just because of their races.

"yes.\nvocubulary is arbitrary.  It's no different than using the word ""monkey"" in training your dog to sit.  Sure, you could say ""sit"", but it's a dog, it associates the sound with the command.\n\nNow, because language has been in use with humans for between 50,000 and 250,000 years, we're quite a ways removed from the arbitrary naming of objects.  most all words today are a product of language evolution, so the simple answer to the roof/ floor question is : that's how the sounds evolved from earlier languages\n\nthe complex answer is that the earliest words were 'purportedly' onomatopaeic: meaning the word resembled the sound.  This is in modern examples like Flush, Swoosh, Bark, boom, etc.\n\nSome linguists think that the earliest words in human vocabulary were us imitating the sound.....that perhaps we called a dog such because that was how we interpreted the sound. \n\nA newer theory is one based on synesthesia, a phenomenon in which humans perception gets 'cross-wired'.  It's where we might 'see' music or 'hear ' color.  it's very rare, between 1 in 25,000 or 1 in 250,000 experiences it.  Theoretically, all humans have it, only a small percentage retains it after the first 2-3 years of development.\n\nThis theory predicates that our first words were part of a synesthetic response to the action: The prime example being that you clench your teeth when you're angry or when you're punching or kicking you exert a sound....supposedly our 'action' words (also known as verbs) came from this response to forming our mouth in certain positions as we observed or experienced actions."

"My Savior was beaten and tortured beyond recognition.  He was crucified which was the most humiliating method of death at the time.  He was cursed, spat upon and denied.  Although it is in my heart to share the changes in my life that came from the simple faith in that, what makes you think words of mere people can shake that?  It's frustrating that something so simple is beyond the grasp of so many.  Like the jokes about ""college-educated people"" having no common sense, non-believers are so insistent on needing science to prove this and that.  I read all those books, saw artifacts and evidence of biblical truths before I was saved and they didn't mean anything to me then either.  Trying to talk to non-believers about Christ is like talking to many teens about moral issues.  They don't understand that we were teens listening to ""all that"" at one time, too.  Then came some point, some event in our life where we grew up.  I am a Christian.  I have given up nothing of value to accept Christ.  Nor can I describe to someone who's never experienced it, the joy or peace I feel inside now.  I don't understand why they're so concerned that I ""waste my time"" believing in something they don't.  I know what happens after my time here, but even if they had been right, what would it matter?  They all believed we'd die and that's it.  Bless you for asking, but my faith is in great shape, thanks."
"Eek! I'd never heard of this stuff before!\n\nAnyway, I found lots of sites with the word ""buspar"" or ""buspirone"", and some with ""バスパー""\n\nI also found this site, which indicates that it's available in Japan -\nhttp://www.jisapp.com/suimin.htm\nThey sell a pack called ""APO BUSPIRONE"", and one called Buspin 10. The 2nd & 3rd items on the page. There are very nice pictures too, so if you go to a shop you know what you're looking for ...!\n\nIncidentally, don't bother looking at something called ""バスパーシュア"" - because it means ""bath pursuer""!\n\nGood luck!"
I don't fondly remember ALL the people involved in my past.  Some of the kids I grew up with were downright mean and nasty to me.  Still, having to deal with them taught me valuable life lessons. However, I don't smile when I think of the individuals.  \n\nOn the flip side, I was fortunate to also have other people in my life who showed unconditional love and acceptance.  They became my role models.  THOSE are the people who make me smile.\n\nI think life is too short because we don't always choose to live life, and allow life to live us.\n\nCarpe Diem!

In markets they buy things extermely cheap Jordon is known for making silver so any jewelry thats slivers you can get cheap. My mom was married there. She loved her 10 day stay.

There is a possibility that there may be a change in the near future there are so many who have accepred Christ in India.  There is a great revival going on.  I use tracts with scripture, but I can see you are interested in reaching youth.  Pray that God will send you some Indian youth to influence.  I find in getting to know people they begin to trust more and are then willing to listen.  Also, check out Operation Mobilization.  They can give you first hand experience.  Interested in going to England for the summer?
All children are rebellious to a degree. I think that most parent's concerns are that if they discipline their children then their children won't love them, or end up doing something worse than what they are already doing.  Then of course there is the threat of what our society condones as discipline as being taken for flat out abuse.\n\nWhat I have learned, and I have two that are very rebellious, 13 years apart, one is grown and one is hitting puberty, that using a system of Love and Logic works everytime on every kid.\n\nWhat this means is that you have to learn to separate yourself from your children's emotions.  Give them choices and if they do not abide by those choices then they suffer the consequences, be that they owe you time, a chore, or a time out, whatever.  This teaches them that they are fully responsible for their actions and will learn to think before they act or react.
don't need death
I think it would be rude to say no. They are being very gracious to allow you and your family to stay with them, the least you can do is be gracious in return, by doing a favor when asked. If they were not kind enough to take you and your family in, would you have had to work longer hours, or overtime to rent a home? Regardless, I think, yes, do the work.
we are ethnocentric and geocentric...and both those words are probably getting looked up online right now. Most of us have never traveled outside the US. Most of us only speak one language and are equally offended and embarassed at our ignorance. Most of us vote for American Idol faster than for an election. We like top ten lists because anything that is more critical and complex is too hard to understand. We like fat gross food. We read simple newspapers like USA Today rather than anything more substantive. We complain about $3 gas when the UK pays $6.40...simply because we don't know what the hell is going on in the rest of the world.  Many of us reading this answer probably aren't even sure if the UK means England, Scotland, Ireland, all of the above or none of the above. We vote for our president based on sound bites. We want easy, plain vanilla answers. Sex scares us in real life but we like it in movies and ads. We lack any historical perspective of both our own country and the rest of the world. When we encounter foreigners we speak LOUDER so that they understand us. We shy away from anything other than hamburgers, steak, and hotdogs. We wonder why the rest of the world cannot be more like us.

"What were Darwin's religious views?\n\nCharles Darwin was baptized on November 17, 1809 at St. Chad's church in Shrewsbury, and his mother, Suzsanna, took him to services at the Unitarian church in High Street. She died when Darwin was just eight years old, but he continued to attend church on a regular basis with his sisters. There is very little known about Darwin's religious beliefs during his childhood. He was sent to Rev. Case's day school at St. Chad's for one year, and afterwards was sent to Dr. Butler's Shrewsbury School where he studied until age sixteen. It is, therefore, safe to assume that Darwin received a proper religious schooling during his childhood.\n\nWhen Darwin was a young man he found it very difficult to let go of his religious beliefs. Indeed, during the Beagle Voyage he was very orthodox, and would often quote passages out of the bible to the ill-mannered sailors on board. By the time he returned to England in 1836 he had come to view the events depicted in the Old Testament as allegory in nature. What events during the Beagle Voyage caused Darwin to become less religious? During the Voyage he had ample opportunity to see the cruelties of slavery and wondered how god could allow such inhumanity to exist. He also could not accept that a kind god would allow humans to live in such a wretched state as the natives of Tierra del Fuego. Why would god allow such suffering in the world was an internal conflict Darwin could not resolve.\n\nDuring the next twenty years of his life, Darwin was engaged in research on the origin of species. He came to see that species were not fixed over time, but rather they adapted to their changing environment from one generation to the next. This flied in the face of the Church which held fast to the notion that all species were created by god as perfectly suited for the environment he placed them in. There was no need for change in the perfect world that god created. Over these twenty years Darwin became less and less religious as he slowly uncovered the laws of natural selection. \n\nBack in his Cambridge days he believed in William Paley's ""Argument from Design"" as evidence for god's place in nature. By the time Darwin wrote ""Origin of Species"" he held the view that: ""The old argument of design in nature, as given by Paley, which formerly seemed to me as conclusive, fails, now that the law of natural selection has been discovered. We can no longer argue that, for instance, the beautiful hinge of a bivalve shell must have been made by an intelligent being, like the hinge of a door by man. There seems to be no more design in the variability of organic beings and in the action of natural selection, than in the course which the wind blows. Everything in nature is the result of fixed laws"" (Barlow, Page - 87)\n\nNow, there appears to be a common misconception regarding the religious views of Charles Darwin. First of all, Darwin was never an atheist. While it is true that in his later years he was not religious to any extent, he never entirely discounted the existence of god. In his Autobiography, Darwin says he was a theist by the time he wrote ""Origin of Species"" and that he believed in an intelligent first cause. However, it was his view that the nature of this ""first cause"" was something beyond man's vision. The death of his daughter, Annie, on 23 April 1851 was a crushing blow to his religious beliefs, and from this time forward he stopped attending church with his family. It was only after a very long and slow process spanning his entire life that Darwin came to be an agnostic. \n\nHow did Charles Darwin resolve the supposed conflict between science and religion? Well, for Darwin there never was much of a conflict. He saw religion as a strictly personal matter and regarded science as completely separate from religion. In general, he thought that the question of god's existence was outsi"
1, Jesus did not say He was not God, He asked WHY to see if he would acknowledge Him as coming from God as the true Son\n2.Evidence-Isaiah 53:10\nYet it pleased the LORD to bruise Him; He has put Him to grief. When You make His soul an offering for sin, He shall see His seed, He shall prolong His days, And the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in His hand.\nHebrews 2:9\nBut we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that He, by the grace of God, might taste death for everyone.\n3. The Trinity is One God who has revealed Himself in three persons, all equal in the Godhead.\n Phil 2:5-7  \n Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus,  who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God,  but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men.\n4. Jesus was worshiped so He either is God in the flesh or a hypocrite.\n1 Timothy 3:16\nAnd without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, Justified in the Spirit, Seen by angels, Preached among the Gentiles, Believed on in the world, Received up in glory.

The Da Vince Code (book or film) is a fictional story based, on part, on some interesting historical facts, assumptions and hypothesis ... with much of the hypothesis unable to be proved either way.\n\nI would hope that any interested folks will take the time to read wider and do their own research rather than taking any of it (or indeed the counter-opinions) at face value.\n\nBottom line ... come up with your own opinion before someone gives one to you.\n\nPeace out
Excellent question! A lot of the time, whatever a persons religion, they will interpret the bible their own way(or whichever way they are told). With reference to your point about not writing anything else, there have been many adaptations of and additions to the bible during the latter years, the only one I can currently think of is the Mormons. Someone claimed to have had more information from God, which he wrote as an adaptation of a current bible. Some people won't believe in anything they have never seen if it doens't say it's true in the bible. Others are more open minded.

"I have heard Him many times. Never the audible voice, but no doubt it was God. Just one quick example. About ten years ago I was driving down the road. There was a fairly large cardboard box in the middle of the road. Now I like a little sport and I admit I have lead in my shoes, so I thought,"" Gonna bust that box wide open."" I distinctly heard a voice say ,""NO!"" so I served to miss it. I looked in my rear view mirror and watched a toddler crawl out of the box. I locked my car up and pulled over. Walked him into the fenced yard he came from, locked the gate. I was trembling. Couldn't thank God enough."

thats a form of night terrors, sleep paralysis. I used ta have them and still do occassionally. After/sometimes not even after have a weird dream its like demons steal my vocal chords and im callin out but its jus like mumbling and whimpers and no1 else in the house can hear me, and then when I ACTUALLY do wake up I end up screamin lol. not really funny when its happenin tho. But ya, scientist and ur average joe will just say its somethin about transition between lightsleep to not quite reaching REM sleep. but as a Christian I know demons are real, so I believe they may also play a role. But everytime I have a crazy nightmare, whenever I call on the great name of Jesus I always wake up, or I fends off watevers around me.
Defense Against the Dark Arts: O\nPotions: O\nTransfiguration: O\nHistory of Magic: E\nCharms: O\nHerbology: E\nAncient Runes: E\nCare of Magical Creatures: O\n\nDefense Against the Dark Arts would be a high priority for me because I think that it is very important to know how to defend yourself. I would love the dueling club! Potions would be my favorite class because I find the possibilities utterly fascinating. I did quite well in chemistry, so I expect that I would excel in potions too. Transfiguration definitely appeals to me. It sounds like a difficult class, but I'd be determined to master it. The ability to transform objects, or myself would be worth the effort. History of Magic would be a challenge because Professor Binns drones on in such a mind-numbing way. I think he covers valuable information though, so I'd do my best to pay attention and take proper notes. Charms seems like an interesting class with practical application outside of the classroom, so I'm confident I'd do well in it. Herbology would be important to me, since I'd want to be familiar with all the plants I might potentially use in potions. I also excelled in Horticulture, although it wasn't of great interest to me, I seem to be a natural at it. Ancient Runes seems like it would be difficult, but I hate to fail at anything that I attempt so I'd study with a partner. Care of Magical Creatures would interest me because various creatures have usefulness, such as unicorns, whose horn and tail hair are used in potions. It would also be an opportunity to learn about creatures like the runespoor which I'd like to have as a pet. With Hagrid teaching I would be vary wary during classes, but I think Grubbly-Plank would be great.
"In recent years, experts (FBI) have begun to recognize that many ACEs are organized crime structures that merely lack a formal name. A number of years ago, the FBI developed a definition of an Asian Criminal Enterprise that defines the concept as: \n""A continuing criminal enterprise, motivated by profit. Criminally diverse, the members engage in a variety of hi-tech organized criminal activities. They are multi-jurisdictional and/or international in nature. They engage in a pattern of racketeering activities, which usually focus on one type of highly profitable criminal activity while committing other ancillary crimes to further the enterprise and/or for personal gain. The enterprise is often comprised of a network of highly mobile, diverse and loosely linked criminal cells. The lack of structured hierarchy and membership with many of these ACEs creates a challenge for law enforcement."" The management of Asian and African Criminal Enterprise sub-programs is handled at FBI Headquarters by the Asian/African Criminal Enterprise Unit of the Organized Crime Section. The mission of this unit is to reduce the threat to society posed by identified criminal enterprises whose members originate predominantly from Eastern and Southeastern Asian nations."
If your intimate with him....then a great gift from almost any guys perspective is if you buy yourself sexy underwear and wear it for him. \n\nAnother direction you can go is a book for a book reader. \n\nIf he is into video games....any of last years playstation games can be purchased in that bracket. \n\nIf he is a movie guy....buy him a movie that was released last year. \n\nAnother good way to go is a Best Buy gift card.

"Snakes (in western civ. and Freudian psychoanalysis) usually symbolize sexuality, temptation and possible corruption (the whole Garden of Eden thing). \n\nThe underground part symbolized either the womb or the underworld (the ""bad place""!). \n\nI think dreams are one of two things, or often both: the reliving of our waking pursuits and thoughts AND symbolic of our needs, desires, fears and so on.\n\nPerhaps your father's presence (usually an indicator of an authority figure) symbolizes the need for you to drive the serpent (sex and/or temptation) out of you. (Is your father very religious?).\n\nBeing crucified  is more a wish for those raised to admire Jesus (he died, yes but but was supposedly resurrected AND then worshiped!). You may feel you have greater things in store for you, that cannot be achieved in this lifetime, only by martyrdom.\n\nAccording the the Jungian based site: ""The universal hero myth always refers to a powerful man or god-man who vanquishes evil in the form of dragons, serpents, monsters, demons, and so on, and who liberates his people from destruction and death.""\n\nHowever, since the father is crucifying you, the ability to act as saviour is impeded.\n\nOn the third link (levity.com), there is a semi-humorous interpretation from (East) Indian mythology involving turning into a snake as a type of crucifixion (???!). \n\nI'd work on THAT aspect!

"I hesitate to say we have ""A"" soul mate, I believe marriage is something you have to continually work on and compromise through, and the idea of a soul mate tends to bring to mind some kind of sublime bliss that does all the work for you because you were ""destined"" to be together. Having said that, I DO believe that we are certainly more compatible with particular types of people such as those that share our long term goals, our faith, want children (if we do also), etc...but I think it's possible to love more than one person in your lifetime, such as in the case of the death of your spouse, I believe it WOULD be possible to love again under the right circumstances."
Frigg, a Norse goddess, asked everything in the nine worlds not to kill her son, Balder, who was doomed to a tragic death.

But I heard it somewhere before, and it was something like: Frigg thought it should never again be used for something so terrible, so everyone should hang it over their heads and kiss under it.

Families,especially parents, like to raise you in their likeness.  Therefore, they don't understand when you become independent and are able to think on your own developing your own ideolgy of things.  I think you should always be true to yourself and your beliefs.  I also believe in God and No One can tell me any different.  Even of they are my family members.  Just ask for their respect as you will give them yours.  It takes a strong person to sometimes stand up and take a stand about something they believe in.  If you believe in God you know that all things are possible in him.  Good luck, stand tall, and believe in yourself.

Because of a supreme court decision that created a so called separation of church and state.  Before this decision many schools  in the early to mid 1900's actually used scripture to teach reading.  \n\nYou will find nowhere in the writings of our founding fathers the concept of a separation of church and state.  In fact the writings of our founding fathers indicate they saw an important and necessary interweaving of a belief in God and the decisions and actions of state.  The best I can describe the vision of our founding fathers was a one way wall.  This wall prevented state from interfering in church.  But did not in any way seek to prevent a belief in God from influencing state.\n\nThe founding fathers understood the dangers of state interfering in church.  That's one of the primary reasons the colonist left England -- to escape state mandated authority over religious practice which came from the Church of England.  Their writings, though, were very supportive of faith in God influencing the state.\n\nAnd no matter what you hear to the contrary the founding fathers where CHRISTIAN in their religious beliefs.

There are 11 letters in your name.\nThose 11 letters total to 67\nThere are 3 vowels and 8 consonants in your name.\n\nYour number is: 4\n\nThe characteristics of #4 are: A foundation, order, service, struggle against limits, steady growth.\n\nThe expression or destiny for #4:\nOrder, service, and management are the cornerstones of the number 4 Expression. Your destiny is to express wonderful organization skills with your ever practical, down-to-earth approach. You are the kind of person who is always willing to work those long, hard hours to push a project through to completion. A patience with detail allows you to become expert in fields such as building, engineering, and all forms of craftsmanship. Your abilities to write and teach may lean toward the more technical and detailed. In the arts, music will likely be your choice. Artistic talents may also appear in such fields as horiculture and floral arrangement, as well. Many skilled physicians and especially surgeons have the 4 Expression.\n\nThe positive attitudes of the 4 Expression yield responsibility; you are one who no doubt, fulfills obligations, and is highly systematic and orderly. You are serious and sincere, honest and faithful. It is your role to help and you are required to do a good job at everything you undertake.\n\nIf there is too much 4 energies present in your makeup, you may express some of the negative attitudes of the number 4. The obligations that you face may tend to create frustration and feelings of limitation or restriction. You may sometimes find yourself nursing negative attitudes in this regard and these can keep you in a rather low mood. Avoid becoming too rigid, stubborn, dogmatic, and fixed in your opinions. You may have a tendency to develop and hold very strong likes and dislikes, and some of these may border on the classification of prejudice. The negative side of 4 often produces dominant and bossy individuals who use disciplinarian to an excess. These tendencies must be avoided. Finally, like nearly all with 4 Expression, you must keep your eye on the big picture and not get overly wrapped up in detail and routine.\n\nYour Soul Urge number is: 2\n\nA Soul Urge number of 2 means: \nWith the Soul Urge number 2, your motivation is centered on friendships, partnerships, and companionship. You want to work with others as a part of a cooperative team. Leadership is not important to you, but making a contribution to the team effort is. You are willing to work hard to achieve a harmonious environment with sensitive, genial people. \n\nIn a positive sense, the 2 Soul Urge is sympathetic, extremely concerned and devoted. The nature tends to be very sensitive to others, always tactful and diplomatic. This element in your nature indicates that you are rather emotional. You are persuasive, but in a very quiet way, never forceful. You are the type that makes really close friendships because you are so affectionate and loving. \n\nIf this number is over-emphasized in your makeup, you may be over-sensitive, with a delicate ego that is too easily hurt. You may be timid or fearful, too easygoing for your own good.\n\nYour Inner Dream number is: 11\n\nAn Inner Dream number of 11 means: \nYou dream of casting the light of illumination; of being the true idealist. You secretly believe there is more to life than we can know or prove, and you would like to be provider of the 'word' from on high.
There's an informative article on Snopes that might shed some light on this subject for you.\n\nhttp://www.snopes.com/crime/gangs/sneakers.htm
Christians basically see themselves as larger than and more important than everything else in Nature.  That's why they had problems with the news that the Sun and stars don't circle the Earth. Dominion over the planet is interpreted by Christians as meaning conquest and plunder.  Buddhists, on the other hand, see themselves as a small harmonious part of Nature and dominion over the planet means guardianship.  Conquest and plunder paradigms encourage materialism. Harmony paradigms do not.  You will never see Buddhists bombing people for Middle East oil, for example.

In fact Buddhist philosophy actually requires evolution to take place -  all things are seen as being transient, constantly becoming, existing for a while and then fading.  The idea of unchanging species would not be compatible with Buddhist ontology .\nBuddhism is the only major religion which acknowledges a large area of ignorance about external matters. Unlike other religions, it does not even attempt to answer questions like 'What is the purpose of life, the universe and everything?' . Buddhism regards such questions as at best unanswerable and probably intrinsically meaningless. The only purpose of life is what we personally give to our own lives. Buddha suggested that the most meaningful use of life was to seek liberation from ignorance, suffering and the cycle of samsaric rebirth, both for one's self and others. But this 'meaning' does not reside 'in the sky' or in any way outside of the individual, and it cannot be imposed, but must be freely chosen.\n\nMost other religions go further than Buddhism, and if asked 'What is the purpose of life, the universe and everything?' will usually come up with an answer along the lines of 'To fulfil the will of God.'\n\nThis invites the further question of 'What is the will of God', which usually brings forth an answer to the effect that 'God's will is to create life, the universe and everything'.\n\nno, because the belief in the creator god is not necessary. but, there are some same things about other religions that we can share with (example: love & charity).\n\n***We don't want to say that Buddhism is a kind of Christianity and Christianity is a kind of Buddhism. A mango can not be an orange. I cannot accept the fact that a mango is an orange. They are two different things. Vive la difference. But when you look deeply into the mango and into the orange, you see that although they are different they are both fruits. If you analyze the mango and the orange deeply enough, you will see small elements are in both, like the sunshine, the clouds, the sugar, and the acid. If you spend time looking deeply enough, you will discover that the only difference between them lies in the degree, in the emphasis. At first you see the difference between the orange and the mango. But if you look a little deeper, you discover many things in common. In the orange you find acid and sugar which is in the mango too. Even two oranges taste different; one can be very sour and one can be very sweet.
"It is a serious problem, and, as others have said, the teachers are a large part of that problem, not the solution that they should be.\n\nMy grandson brought home a handout from his Language Arts class (see - they don't even hide that they're not teaching English). It was rife with spelling and punctuation errors, total lack of parallelism, and incomprehensible composition. My  favorite part was the paragraph that contained three references to missed work - once it was ""makeup"", then ""make up"", and just to cover all bases ""make-up"". A very close second was a statement that the teacher expected common curtsey. At first I thought she wanted them to bow to her - then I realized she messed up ""courtesy"" so badly the spellchecker never missed a beat. \n\nDid a proofreading job and sent to the Superintendent of Schools. Never got a response.\n\nP. S. To those of you questioning the word ""illiterateness"", I would suggest a good, unabridged dictionary."

I don't know much about their church itself. I have studied some about their religion, and I never could get past a book of the Bible being given to a modern day prophet.. but that is my own reaction to that. I would never judge a religion in it's entirety just because of my aversion to some of it's teachings.  I am associated with Jehovah's Witnesses, and I know first hand how it feels to be turned away before you get a chance to hold intelligent conversation!  :)   I know when I go to a door, I appreciate someone who has time to speak with me doing so, and someone who does not, saying so.  In return, I open my door to anyone who has anything to say about God.  How could I not and expect anyone to open their door to me?!   Because of this, I met two of the nicest young men on their mission, who began to come by as often as twice a week to talk.  They never changed me from a Witness to a Mormon, and I never changed them to Jehovah's Witnesses, but we had fine, long, spirited, wonderful discussions about the Bible. They knew their Bible. They were polite. They went door to door in spite of naysayers as per the Bible's instuctions. They were helpful, honest and warm, and if every Mormon I ever meet is as great as these two kids, I'd be pleased to make their aquaintance!   Don't believe all the bad (or good, for that matter) about anything until you get all the facts!!
I know that I don't get special treatment and your ignorance doesn't phase me.
In order for a marriage to be valid, the man and woman must be free to marry and do so of their own free will and with sufficient knowledge and maturity to enter into a life long commitment.\n\nGiven these requirements, the following are some of the reasons for an annulment.\n\nOne or both the man and woman were pressured into the marriage either by the other spouse or outside parties.\n\nOne of the spouses withheld information about himself or herself that would have made the other person decide not to get married.\n\none or both of the persons was not emotionally mature enough to get married.\n\nOne of the persons in the marriage never intended to remain faithful to the marriage from the very beginning.
"'Hephaestus  is the Greek god whose approximate Roman equivalent is Vulcan; he is the god of technology including, specifically blacksmiths, craftsmen, artisans, sculptors, metals and metallurgy, and fire. He was worshipped in all the manufacturing and industrial centers of Greece, especially Athens.\n\nThough his forge traditionally lay in the heart of Lemnos, Hephaestus was quickly identified by Greek colonists in southern Italy with the volcano gods Adranus of Mount Etna and Vulcanus of the Lipara islands and his forge moved here by the poets; the first-century sage Apollonius of Tyana is said to have observed, ""there are many other mountains all over the earth that are on fire, and yet we should never be done with it if we assigned to them giants and gods like Hephaestus"" (Life of Apollonius of Tyana, book v.16)."

Having a black family in your neighborhood will not bring anyone's neighborhood value down.  Sadly enough, usually when a black family moves in, you will find out who the biggest bigot is first.  Because they will be the first to leave.  By you being 17 years old, you have a chance to educate yourself and not fall prey to ignorance.  Sadly enough, these people are the first to enter the church on Sundays.  Why would anyone think that God would allow anyone into Heaven that does not love their brother and sister(regardless of the skin color)?     Arm yourself with knowledge before you buy into stereotypes that have been passed down from generation to generation.  After all, where you will spend eternity depends on you.

Depends on the girl.  Is she worth it?  I dumped a guy recently because he couldn't give it up.  Obviously the weed was more important to him.  I tried to explain how his personality had changed when he smoked it (he became a chronic user) and he went from being a funny, animated, quick witted person to someone I didn't even want to watch a movie with.  The choice is always yours.  What do you want more?  The girl or the high?

Interesting question.\n\nSure there would have been far less wars, but then again both world wars had nothing to do with religion.\nThere wouldn't have been any witch burnings, but people would still have been hung, or tortured or killed for stealing to survive or for looking at a monarch the wrong way. \nSure you wouldn't have people knocking at your door hoping to shove the bible or whatever down your throats. Instead you'd probably get some scientist trying to verify his theory about where the world came from, and how we really are floating on the back of a giant turtle!\nThere would be less murder, but would there be less compassion?\nLess rasicsm? Not by much. \n\nThe annoying thing about religion is, we need it. There are those amognst us who don't, but the majority do. Without it people wouldn't live as long, wouldn't be as happy, life would have no purpose, no meaning, those who seek the easy answer would never find it. \n\nThe idea of God is a great one, and his main message is pretty good too. The only problem is all the other shit that gets mixed up with it, people are human, and humans are corrupt, therefore there will always be those who will use religion as a way of controling, or surpressing, or going to war. \n\nBut people have survived thanks to religion, if you ask the question would there be anarchy and sin ruling the world without religoin, my answer would be slightly different...But you didn't ask that, so...In answer to this question. No I don't think the world would be a better place without religion. But I don't think it would be choas. It would just be slightly worse.
Chuck E. Cheese was orginally a rat but was later changed to a mouse. So technically you both were correct.
God *does* judge the thoughts and intentions of your heart.  But He also knows that you are trying.  Peace.
just tell her whats in your heart. It will know the words. The fact you are so nervous is not only the right way to feel but darn cute. That's how most women feel at first. Being with a woman is the best feeling in the world. When you are all shy and giggling. then a small shaky kiss.. Aw to be young and new again. \nJust tell her what you just said and you will do fine sugar
To be honest there is no other way than telling them, unless you have a mutual friend who you think might do better.  I find with things like this it is not what you're saying, but the way you say it.  If someone has spent hours and hours and hours preparing food and then someone comes in and says 'I don't want to eat the vast majority of what you've prepared.' then that can for obvious reasons be insulting.  However if you let people know, with as much notice as you can give and say it on a non preaching way, just with simple honesty, then most people would appreciate that.  For me, as a host, one of the key things to a good party is making sure everyone who visits feels comfortable and able to enjoy themselves!
"Check out the book Cliff and Joy Penner's ""The Gift of Sex"". It was recommended to all married couples in our church by our pastor. The best advice is to actually (horror of horrors) talk to each other and find out what each thinks about different positions etc.\n\nAs for the films, don't bother. They do not promote healthy sexual relationships rooted in love and tenderness towards each other."

Christianity is not the only way.  To think so is arrogant beyond mere words to describe.  But to address your question regarding the circumstances of your birth, there are many spiritual paths that have a far better grasp of this issue.  Buddhism being one of many.\n\nMight I suggest that you take a look elsewhere?  You might be startled and amazed by the answers and guidance you can receive from other spiritual paths that understand the fundamentals and mechanics of reincarnation.  From that point, you could well handle your personal challenges better and hopefully live a more positive life.  And finally...\n\nWhatever belief system you have that keeps you going under what I can see must be difficult circumstances, Bravo!  Go about your business and life as you see fit and let the fundies stew in their own juices.  It is your life, no matter how it happened, so enjoy it to the best of your ability.
Go to any large Pentecostal church on any given Sunday, large women in the floor, amongst others.  BIG HAIR sweaty and stringing down into plumb red faces.  Several of the same people are weekly inspired to speak, others never, or only after they have been urged to repent, repent, repent (they like to say it 3 times), and then speak, speak, speak.  If this isn't action enough for you, then attend a revival meeting, in a large tent in the south, if possible.  Whoa, then you see some tongues being spoken.

"Marijuana is classified as a depressant.  This is an oversimplification.  It has many depressant effects, like the relaxation you refer to, but it also stimulates the brain's frontal lobes, where ""executive thought,"" or ""higher order processing,"" occurs.  This means that the area of your brain where you do most of the thinking that you're aware of is stimulated, so you're going to have more thoughts than usual flowing around up there.  Some people are mentally strong enough to use these thoughts constructively, and we call this ""being creative.""  Some people cannot control their thoughts, and we call this ""being paranoid.""  Some people can usually control their heads, but in certain situations, cannot.  So the subjective experience is different for every person, every time.  \n\nI had a creative writing teacher once who discounted all drug stories.  ""You don't really know if that's insight, you were just high, and that was just a drug thought,"" she would say.  She was completely wrong.  You get to take credit for every positive thing you do on drugs, just as you are responsible for every mistake you make, high or sober, as if it makes a difference."

"I suppose it comes from our ""Puritan"" roots.  The first pilgrims to come here (European, mainly English anyway) came with the intent of setting up religious communities.  That is where we get the idea of freedom of religion- because they were escaping persecution in Europe- but in reality their rules were every bit as (if not more so) religiously tyrannical than where they came from.  I guess that rather than dying out through the years, the idea that ""our way is the only way and you can go to hell if you don't follow us"" has continued and in some ways grown."
At your young age, it would be best if you did not pursue marriage or children at this time; you will appreciate this advice later.  You may be bi,  know what you are and what you want in life before you start involving children.\nFollow your heart, ignore fundamental Christians.  I'm a Christian, and think they are bigots and way off base.  If you really feel f****d, then see psychological counsel who is educated, but not working through some church.  Listen to his professional advice.  Often one session would do.  Also explore non-judgmental churches if you are Christian or interested.  The Episcopal Church is a good place to start.  They are welcoming and non-judgmental.  Some things are definitely between you and God, not the large haired ladies, and wild fanatics that visit this room so often to spew hate.  When in doubt, read John 3:16, feel secure and safe.  Watch out for the bigots, they can be murderers while preaching love.
Why shouldn't they, many other religions that do not celebrate Christmas profit from it.  I know you're probably trying to be funny with the kosher reference but it just does not work for me!

"Let everything be done in love...\n\nIf you are seen to be a stumbling block, out of love you should try to reconcile and ask forgiveness if there is a valid point on their part. If there is not, then state your case plainly, and do not let your liberty be a cause for them to stumble. You can agree to disagree and find another, more understanding church if need be. \n\nSome churches are so wrapped up in their particular doctrine and dogma, that they can't see that their ""control"" issues are hurting the body. You first and foremost must ask and answer to God for your decisions and choices as to God's will in your life. He is Lord, not the church or it's elders. \n\nGod does gift pastors and others, and you can be sure that if their motives are of God, then there will be love and understanding, and God's Spirit, right there in the middle of it all.\n\nThe ""sin in the camp"" statement suggests that this is a Pentecostal church. They sometimes feel that any sin within the body hinders it from doing it's work. They seem to forget that the work of the church is to minister to sinners. That all who attend are now saved by God's grace, and are at different stages in their growth in becoming what God would have them to be.  \n\nWill they still sin?  Of course, especially those new in the faith. Should we bludgeon them with guilt and fear? No, we should love them through it. Help them to see the error and consequences of sin in a sincere, understanding and loving way. We are all the same, no better or worse than anyone else. We are all one in this faith and hope, and in the love of God. All brothers and sisters in the Lord. Let everything be done in love..."

"Matthew 7:15\nBeware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.\n\nIslam's allah was nothing more than a throw away idol. The present meaning of a word is irrelevant to what it meant in ancient times. The word ""Allah"" is a good example. When confronted by the historical evidence that the word was used by pagan Arabs in pre-Islamic times to refer to a high god who was married to the sun-goddess and had three daughters, some Muslims will quote dictionaries, encyclopedias, etc. to prove that ""Allah means God."" They are thus using modern definitions to define what the word meant over a thousand years ago! What ""Allah"" means now has no bearing on what it meant before Muhammad.\nmuhammed was a liar and a pedophile. Many of his prophecies failed making him a liar, which islam says a prophet cannot be! He went to the pagan kabba, went through 350 idols and found allah and declared it the god of islam. Islam's allah was nothing more than a throw away idol. Some Muslims have claimed that the word ""Allah"" is in the Bible because the Biblical word ""Allelujah."" They then mispronounce the word as ""Allah-lujah"" But ""Allelujah"" is not a compound Arabic word with ""Allah"" being the first part of the word. It is a Hebrew word with the name of God being ""JAH"" (or Yahweh) and the verb ""alle"" meaning ""praise to."" It means ""praise to Yahweh."" The Arabic word ""Allah"" is not in the word.\nThe same error is found in the Muslim argument that the word ""Baca"" (Psa. 94:6) really means ""Mecca."" The valley of Baca is in northern Israel.\nthe quran is a book made over 100 years after mohammed. A book NOT in its original form because all the draft copies were burned under fear of death. A book claiming lineage to Abraham from Ishmael, and that since Ishmael was born before Isaac, he was the firstborn and the one taken to the mountain. God did NOT recognize Ishmael as the firstborn though as he was born out of wedlock. Abraham was to sacrifice his son as proof to God of his faith. The Lord stopped him from doing that though as we know. That being the case, a sacrifice had to be as pure as possible. Ishmael being born out of wedlock did not fit the bill, this was overlooked for the blessings to come by God. Isaac fit perfectly! More here...\nhttp://planttel.net/~meharris1/mikescorner.html"

"I don't think the question is stupid at all and if it is any consolation, the people that snicker at your question will probably roll on the floor at my response. Some time ago I was doing research in St. Louis. Now, I don't know if it is because of a certain popular series set in and around the area or other reasons, but St. Louis has a fairly large number of people that claim to be supernatural creatures or possess magical abilities. I interviewed dozens of witches, vampires, aliens and no less than 6 varieties of shapeshifters including werewolves. The 'Aliens' were less than impressive, the Witches completely convinced me of their authenticity, a couple of the 'Vampires'  gave a very impressive demonstration. And then there were the shapeshifters..... most balked at giving me any 'proof' of what they claimed... the usual responses were 'has to be a full moon' or 'I am too dangerous when I change'. One interview, however, said why not? Without breaking line-of-sight with me he proceeded to give me his 'proof'. First he smiled and suddenly his jawline didn't look quite right... it wasn't the slow streching out of a muzzle like in the movies, but it suddenly wasn't shaped right and all his teeth were sharp little points. Then his eyes went yellow.. it was like he blinked and they changed, I didn't see his hands go near his face, they just changed. My first thought was: ""Wow! Great slight of hand, I didn't even see him put the teeth or contacts in! And those are really great contacts and great fake teeth!"" . My second thought was: ""Don't the idiots that stand there screaming or just watching the change usually get eaten? Or end up terminally furry?"" \nI left the scene. Very quickly. The interview contacted me later and appologized, even offered to do the demonstration some where of my choosing. I declined. So, I don't think the question is dumb because I am not sure either. Was it (as logic would demand) a really, really, really good act..... or was I in a room with a real life werewolf?"

Jihadists today invoke the Qur’an to justify the worst terrorist crimes. Throat slitting of infidels is mentioned in the Qur’an. Al-Mawardi (d. 1058), the prominent 11th century jurist quoted this verse, specifically,  « When you encounter those who deny (the Truth) then strike (their) necks. » (Qur’an 47 :4), in his learned discussion of jihad. This ritual execution is also mentioned in other Muslim legal texts and in narratives of Christian and prominent Muslim historians. Today it is performed against infidels and recorded on videotape for the edification of Muslim audiences. \n\nWhen the average pious Muslim reads a verse like 2:132 (“And this was the legacy that Abraham left to his sons, and so did Jacob; ‘Oh my sons! Allah hath chosen the Faith for you; then die not except in the Faith of Islam’”) or 3:67 (“Abraham was not a Jew nor yet a Christian; but he was true in Faith, and bowed his will to Allah’ (which is Islam), and he joined not gods with Allah”), he understands what so many imams tell him: that the true Jews and Christians of today are the Muslims, and the people who go by those names are renegades and rebels against God. \n\nThis is of course nonsense.\n\nThis argument does not rest on any idea that Abraham or Moses observed specifically Islamic rituals, but on the idea that they were prophets of the True Faith which was restored by Mohammed after it was corrupted by Jews and Christians.\n\nThis is of course nonsense.
Short answer.., Fear\nLonger answer, it's in our genetic make-up.\nAs organisms, we are programed to survive and reproduce.\nAs complex organisms with social structures, we have acquired competitive responses which enable us to acquire and control resources and power.

To Ally, the Hijab is not a sign of oppression for women.  It also does not symbolize weakness.  The Hijab represents our faith.  It represents our strength.  We don't conform to what society wants us to do.  Imagine the number of stares Muslim women get and they still wear it.  Muslim women are aware of the negative connotation surrounding the Hijab but they understand the meaning behind it and still wear it.  It takes a strong women to do that.  Also, the Hijab puts Muslim women on a pedastal.  The Quran tells Men to lower their gaze.  It allows Men to focus on our faith, our personality, and who we are rather than our beauty or lack thereof.  It prevents us from sexual desires with people we do not know.  It is like women are precius gems that should not be touched.  I am a Muslim woman and I thank Allah that I am. Thank You for listening.

Nobody knows for sure. But, as usual, that hasn’t stopped lots of people coming up with ideas. We are sure that it was originally an American expression, first recorded in the 1920s, and very popular especially in the 1930s, though it never quite took over from cop. In Britain, it was popular in the sixties, though it would now be regarded as dated slang.\n\nOne suggestion is that it’s a variant pronunciation of fuss, this being something that policemen are prone to do over matters that fussees may consider trifling. It’s also been said that it comes from a mispronunciation or mishearing of “Feds”, that is, federal agents, which hardly seems probable.\n\nYet a third suggestion has been put forward by David Dalby, a specialist in West African languages, who argues that it comes from the Wolof word fas for a horse, which was taken over in a much modified form into the American slang expression fuzzy tail for a sure bet at a horse race (not to be confused with another usage of that phrase to refer to the very lowest category of vagrant or tramp), from there to a mounted policemen, and so to police in general.

That's not true, a good example was at my auntie's wedding a couple of years back. At the dinner she stood up and gave a speech on 'first impressions not being the last impressions' saying that when she first met her husband, she thought he was boring and dry and she couldn't stand him. Then after knowing him a couple of months, she fell in love.\nThe only time that this statement is true, is when you meet a person and don't meet them again for say two or three years or never meet them again, then you will only have that one impression to base them on.

I personally believe that Baptism is just an outward expression of an inward change.

As a young teen, I worked as a missionary in Mexico. I could forever remember the smell of the plaster on the walls of my room, and the smell of the smoke-filled foggy mornings. I remember the children and the dirt and the imprint it made on my soul. It changed me forever and made me so thankful to live in the US and have so much!\n\n30 years later, I returned to the same orphanage. Wonderful to see so much progress... electricity, water, clean and healthy children. I yearned to smell that smoke (which was actually trash fires) mixed with the morning fog...but it didn't happen. The wet plaster smell of the buildings was gone as well. It all came back to me when I started loving on the children...the smell of kids! Like tortillas and dirt! How I love the tight grip of the children pulling me in each direction to come and play! In the distance, the pungent aroma of tripe being cooked, and the sound of barking dogs and roosters crowing. It's like I had been there forever. \n\nI'll be going back again this month. So wonderful to create new memories and build on the old ones!

"I've asked my husband, and he was honest. I've gained some weight since I've been stationed here and he said that I have ""some chub"" I said straight out, no I'm FAT. (10lbs is a lot for someone as small as me. Eventhought no one else in the world will tell me I'm fat. My family and friends all think I'm crazy, but I do have chub on my belly. I'm so glad he's honest) but I think guys should always always be honest. I want him to tell me I'm fat so it'll motivate me to go to the gym more. Or have him tell me to have less unhealthy foods when we eat. It's helpful. It's embarrasing, but don't punish him for your own mistake!\n\nToo many women get so sensitive about being fat, but the truth is, YOU PROBABLY ARE FAT! so don't get mad if someone says you are. The average Amerian is overweight. Being fat is gross. If your man can tell you that you are overweight or say you could do with losing a few pounds, you should love him more for being honest.

No -  imaginative, but incorrect.\n\nThe word Zion is a representation of a Hebrew word  tsiyyon which is unrelated to any of the other words you have mentioned.\n\nTheo- as in theology is Greek, but also unrelated to the others.\n\nZeus, on the other hand, IS the Greek equivalent of Latin deus, and Germanic Tiw, the god that Tuesday is named after.\n\nThe older form of Deutsch was Thiudisc; although in modern German, the H in such words makes no difference in pronunciation, this was not originally the case. Old English Theodisc is to Deutsch as Theof to Dieb (thief); if the word had carried on into modern English, instead of saying German, we would say maybe Thedish, like Swedish. The original sound of the TH was as i English thief.\n\nBut Theodish is Anglo-Saxon did not mean specifically German; on the contrary, it meant national, related to a Gothic word Thiuda meaning people, which has some related words in other Indo-European languages.\n\nThe sound represented by TH in Theodisc etc. was always distinct from the T sound of Tiw, etc. They are not plausibly related. Deutschland just means National land, the land belonging to a people.

The answers goes back many centuries.  In the past there was a  HUGE risk of miscarriage and death during birth due to poor medical practies.  Due to this birth rates were very low and there was a legitimate threat of a society dying out.  Religion, then, as it does now, attempted to fix a societal problem by outlawing masturbation in the hope that if they outlawed masturbation people would be more interested in the opposite sex, would have more sex, and hence create more babies, alleviating the concern that a population crisis (too few) would ensue.
"I have always felt that the slander and smear tactics that politicians use steer away from the actual question of ""What can THEY do to help the country?"" You, as a politician, telling me what this other candidate did or didn't do has nothing to do with what you're going to do. If anyone follows politics, they would already know what that person has done or not done politically. Just once, I would like to see a candidate not talk about his opponent in a demeaning way and talk about what they plan to do to help this country. Don't insult our intelligence by trying to distract us like little children. When you finish bashing your opponent, I still want to know what YOU'RE going to do."

Morality can't be decided by popular opinion, because right is right and wrong is wrong.\n\nJust as we can't decide the sun should move west to east -- we think whatever we think, but that doesn't change reality.\n\nHarm is wrong. 'Cause suffering sucks.\n\nWhat people DO decide, sometimes sorta by popular opinion, are laws, which are another matter (it would be nice if law and morality were better matched).\n\nAlso, changes in the arbitrary aspects of ettiquette are determined by popular opinion.\n\nUntil whoever it was in a previous answer said it was a shame that rape is considered wrong (if I'm understanding that comment), that person had a pretty good handle on it.\n\nBut clearly rape, as a particularly devastating form of violence, is clearly wrong.\n\nBut the basic idea that morality has to do with what we are, the kind of critter we are, is right.\n\nThe problem with the 10 commandment is that several of them are arbitrary and even silly (most of the people who go on and on about them violate them every Sabbath by watching sports, for example), and the list as a whole leaves out a lot of things that are wrong.\n\nFor example, it's wrong to put another person in a double-bind or lose-lose situation, where no matter what they do they are hammered or punished.
tattoos only hurt depending on where you get them, my recommendation to you is to get a small tattoo that can be easily consealed by clothing or is concealed by clothing if you are wearing a shirt and shorts. the reason being is that if at some point down the road you absolutely hate your tattoo then you can at least keep it covered, it wont affect your ablity to get a job (because it is covered) and if you dont use colors other than black and blue it can be removed easier. and as far as what to get, get something that says something about you, not something you might change your mind on later in life. for example my gf got a tattoo of autumn leaves on her ankle because her middle name is autumn, which isnt likely to change. so dont be getting tattoos of what is cool now, get something that is relatively timeless

It's fairly well-established that he had a male lover.  It really wasn't uncommon in those days.  In ancient Greece, older men often wooed a younger man.  The men would teach the youths wisdom and how to conduct themselves properly in society, and they would get some play for their troubles.  Read Plato's _Symposium_.  It's pretty awesome.  These guys all got drunk and started talking about love, and there was a speech or two claiming that the love between two men (and they don't mean chaste, platonic love) was higher than that between a man and a woman, because it was between equals.
because you are a nice open and friendly person?

"Ah! I see..What you guys should do is have a long talk. me and my partner swing. so..If you don't need it, tell him. Let him know. But I think you guys would be better suited for for ""soft swap"" if you do decide to countine swinging. If you like attention (all of us fiesty leos do ;) ) Go to a swinggers club, they are everywhere, just well hidden. And keep things between you and your partner, but offer ""shows"" But, before you go on with anymore, you need to get these jealousy issues out in the open and taken care of. If either of you get jealous, things will go sour FAST. Be sure you are showing each other all the affection you can though!! And always play as a couple. If a night is just for him, be there anyway!! or vice versa..if you play alone, things could go bad. \n\nBut, if he keeps tossing this up, that he wants it, then he doesn't, tell him to stop. it's not healthy. If, next time he says he wants a full/hard swap, then I want you to go through with it. Tell him that if he likes it, then you can keep doing it. But if he gets any icky feelings (jealousy) then you two are never going to full swap again. \n\ngood luck..."
1)  Sin is literally defined as missing the mark, as in archery.  No one is able to live up to the standards held by God (except for Jesus).\n\n2)  Yes - except for Jesus\n\n3)  People are born into sin.  Just look at a young child.  Ask him or her if they ate the cookie and they'll lie - even when no one has ever taught them how to lie.  \n\n4)  Death - separation from God.\n\n5)  For a Christian, you are not in fellowship with God.  Repentance and request for forgiveness restores the fellowship.  I don't believe that you will ever lose your salvation, as Jesus said that you are in His hands and He is not fumble fingered.\n\n    For the non-Christian, it keeps you from a relationship with God.  To alleviate that, one must accept the free gift of salvation provided by Jesus death on the cross and His resurrection, repent (turn away from) sin.

"Angels are spiritual beings created by God to serve Him, though created higher than man. Some, the good angels, have remained obedient to Him and carry out His will, while others, fallen angels, disobeyed, fell from their holy position, and now stand in active opposition to the work and plan of God. The holy angels are messengers of God, serving Him and doing His bidding. The fallen angels serve Satan, the god of this world (2 Corinthians 4:4). \n\nThe doctrine of angels follows logically the doctrine of Christ, for the angels are primarily ministers of Christ's providence. When areas of theology are slighted, this will likely be one of them. One has only to peruse the amount of space devoted to angelology in standard theologies to demonstrate this. This disregard for the doctrine may simply be neglect or it may indicate a tacit rejection of this area of Biblical teaching.\n\nA careful study of Angelology, we will examine the following:\n1. Terms used of angels; \n2. The existence of angels; \n3. The creation of angels; \n4. The nature of angels; \n5. The classification of angels; \n6. The ranking of angels; \n7. The ministry of angels; \n8. The identity of the Angel of the LORD [Jehovah]; \n9. The identity of the sons of God in Genesis 6:1-8; and \n10. The role of angels in medieval Jewish thought (optional). \n\nThe terms used of angels are as follows: \n1. Angels; \n2. Holy ones; \n3. Host; \n4. Chariots; \n5. Watchers; \n6. The Angel of the LORD [Yahweh or Jehovah]; \n7. Elohim; \n8. Stars; and sons of God. \n\nThough other words are used for these spiritual beings, the primary word used in the Bible is angel. The Hebrew word for angel is mal`ach, and the Greek word is angelos. Both words mean ""messenger"" and describe one who executes the purpose and will of the one whom they serve. The context must determine if a human messenger is in view, or one of the celestial beings called ""angels,"" or if it is being used of the second Person of the Trinity as will be discussed below. \n\nIllustrations of uses that do not refer to celestial beings: \n\n1. For human messengers from one human to another (Luke 7:24; James 2:25). \n2. For human messengers bearing a divine message (Haggai 1:13; Galatians 4:14). \n3. For an impersonal agent, Paul's thorn in the flesh described as ""a messenger of Satan"" (2 Corinthians 12:7). \n4. For the messengers of the seven churches (Revelation 2-3). It is also used in connection with the seven churches of Asia, ""To the angel of the church in ..."" Some take this to mean a special messenger or delegation to the church as a teaching elder, others take it to refer to a guardian angel. \n\nThus, the term angelos is not only a generic term, pertaining to a special order of beings (i.e., angels), but it is also descriptive and expressive of their office and service. So when we read the word ""angel"" we should think of it in this way\n\nHoly Ones\n\nThe un-fallen angels are also spoken of as ""holy ones"" (Psalm 89:5, 7). The reason is twofold. First, being the creation of a holy God, they were created perfect without any flaw or sin. Second, they are called holy because of their purpose. They were ""set apart"" by God and for God as His servants and as attendants to His holiness (cf. Isa 6).\n\nHost\n\n""Host"" is the Hebrew tsaba, ""army, armies, hosts."" It is a military term and carries the idea of warfare. Angels are referred to as the ""host,"" which calls our attention to two ideas. First, it is used to describe God's angels as the ""armies of heaven"" who serve in the army of God engaged in spiritual warfare (Psalm 89:6, 8; 1 Samuel 1:11; 17:45). Second, it calls our attention to angels as a multitude of heavenly beings who surround and serve God as seen in the phrase ""Lord of hosts"" (Isaiah 31:4). In addition, tsaba sometimes includes the host of heavenly bodies, the stars of the univ"

Learning English should be treated in the same way that you learned your mother tongue.\nFirst you learned to listen, to your parents.\nthen you practiced speaking, and learned to speak. Then you learned to read, and eventually to write.\nThe most important thing about learning English is learning to listen.\nListen to English songs, English Radio, and English TV. Then try to imitate what you hear, until it sounds like the speaker.\nReading will help with vocabulary, and writing will help to pull it all together. As suggested by someone else, reading out loud will help too. Keep a diary, in English, and each day write what you have learned. Then you can look back and see your progress, and this will motivate you to continue.
"""Avoid"", you ask?\n\nRather than ""avoid"" discussing bible truth, the Witnesses are among the most prominent seeking to ENCOURAGE such discussions. Globally, more than 6.5 millions Jehovah's Witnesses share in the public ministry each month. One cannot be considered an ""active"" Witness unless one preaches.\nhttp://jw-media.org/people/statistics.htm\n\nAs true Christians, Jehovah's Witnesses work to please God and Christ rather than man or selves. It does not even matter if anyone listens to their message, since the bible foretold that many (such as the questioner) would not ""put up with the healthful teaching"". The Witnesses continue to preach because they value the bible's direction more highly than empty accusations and lying slander.\n\nTrue Christians do not work to persecute godly ministers; true Christians do not avoid teaching the Kingdom good news from house to house. Jehovah's Witnesses are proven to be true Christians in that they follow this command of Christ and example of the early Christians.\n\n(Matthew 28:19-20) [Jesus commanded] Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, 20 teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded\n\n(Acts 5:42) Every day in the temple and from house to house they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ, Jesus.\n\n(Acts 20:20) I did not hold back ...from teaching you publicly and from house to house\n\n(2 Timothy 4:3-5) For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the healthful teaching ...and they will turn their ears away from the truth, whereas they will be turned aside to false stories. You, though, keep your senses in all things, suffer evil, do the work of an evangelizer, fully accomplish your ministry.\n\nLearn more:\nhttp://watchtower.org/library/jt/article_04.htm\nhttp://watchtower.org/library/g/1998/7/8/article_01.htm\nhttp://watchtower.org/library/w/2003/3/1/article_01.htm"

yes you do have an aura and although you may not be able to see it yourself sometimes you should be able to  feel it.if you imagine it to be similar to a mood ring where they change colour in perception to the way you are feeling then try visualising a glow around you depending on how you are feeling. this is your aura and it appears naturally which more than most can see. although its not just dependant on your mood you also have a natural aura which you will have to ask somebody who can see it what shade it is then you can get a better explanatio hope this helps xxx
Amen to that!
Undoubtedly one of the hottest areas of debate in discussions between Christians and Muslims is the Christians dogma of the Trinity. Almost invariably, Muslims are convinced that Christians believe in three, separate deities, whilst Christians are adamant in affirming their absolute commitment to monotheism. Without question, the concept of the Triune deity - indeed, the whole doctrine of God - is difficult to understand, but this difficulty is unnecessarily accentuated if an uninformed or incorrect view of Christian dogma is held by Muslims. The purpose of this paper is to set the record straight, and also to compare and contrast aspects of the doctrine of God in both religions.........
The Bible speaks of heaven and hell, saints and angels, and Satan and demons.\n\nIt does not talk about life on other planets.\n\nWith love in Christ.
Yes, actually that is very true. Also, another part of the body that never stops growing is the bone above your eyes where your eyebrows are. Also, the skull at the back of your head. That is  why a lot of human skulls from several thousand years ago have long looking heads and big brows that cause them to look ape like. It turns out it is just men that have lived up to 900 yrs of age. One of the most famous skeletons ever found that evolutionists claimed to be a link between ape and man was just a human in this 900 yr age range. The man just had extremely bad osteoporosis causing him to have a major hunch back and then the skull had the same shape I mentioned above. These features made evolutionists believe it was an ape starting to walk up right like humans. All along it was just a pour old man that lived to long! Thank God that He doesn't allow us to live that long now.
This is exactly what they’re doing. It takes time, they are not permitted to interfere directly, so they reveal a little at a time. Their goal is always to free developing intellectual mammals from the clutches of mass delusion. Once a planet has accepted that there is no all-powerful being in the sky, they reveal themselves openly (otherwise they would be attacked by Christians who would think they’re demons). Yes I would go to be sure if they offered, but I am not so fortunate.
Dan, I really think Americans currently live in fear. Fear of losing their jobs, fear of their credit score falling, and fear of jail and becoming a part of the 'system'.\n\nAt first this sounds like crazy conspiracy theory, but I do not subscribe to conspiracy personally. \n\nI see a war that the people do not support, and no one is marching against it this time (as in Vietnam). I see people being held against their will without charges and no one seems to care (as in Guantanamo Bay). I see employers being allowed to cut the rug out from under the worker (pay, benefits, etc). and yet no one quits or demands unions. \n\nPS, heaven help you if you step up and start to make a stink. I did for racism at my work place and my boss held a meeting and all but laughed in my face. Had to leave that job in the end over the whole matter.\n\nThe best thing I can recommend is educate yourself as much as possible (college and more college, current events, local politics). Vote. Support the things that need it, because for the most part they are under funded and under supported. \n\nAnd pass on the word that we all need to stop coasting, waiting for our 'shift' to end and start living. Participating and making the world a better place.

Quakers belong to a religious organization called the Society of Friends. They don't believe in wars or anything, they believe in peace. They also believe that all men are created equal, no matter what they look like. They think that women and men are equal, too. They think that you don't need a churchbuilding, Bible, or minister to worship God. They think you can do that without those things. i reccomend that you google it.

because people needed something to believe in.  I don't think people on here are going to be very happy with my explaination but I personally feel it was started/written to oppress women.  Is it a coincidence that all the women in the bible, with the exception of Mary, were whores and evil sinners?  When it said in the bible that because we are women we can't serve the lord in the same way a man could...what's that about?  Christianity has been oppressing women for years and I believe that was their intended future when they started the religion.  Sorry if I offend anyone.  \n\nFYI ~ I was raised a catholic and went to catholic school so I have heard everything you will say in response to my explaination.

"I am gay.  I knew I was gay when I was 4, though I didn't know there was even a label for it.  I was attracted to men.  I went through puberty at 8.  By 12, my sexual orientation was fully functional.  I had a wonderful childhood.  Two loving parents, as perfect a home as you can get in all respects.  I was never molested.  I was never raped.  I was never sexually abused.  I had my first ejaculation at the hand of another boy when I was 12 - he was 12.  We were equals who happened to have very strong feelings for each other.  We were textbook best friends in every other respect.  I dated girls in high school because I enjoyed their company, not because I was romantically attracted to them.  I married at 19 because that's what we are ""supposed"" to do.  I was married 12 years and we have 2 wonderful kids who are now adults themselves. (19 and 17).  After 12 years, we decided that we both needed the freedom to find our own paths in life and we divorced amicably.  I have been in a healthy, monogamous gay relationship ever since. My kids are well adjusted and love my partner - they call him Dad2.   I have never done drugs, don't drink alcohol, and have never had the desire to smoke. I have never been, or had the desire to, be promiscuous.  My parents were born in the early 1920's.  They are still alive and kicking with sharp minds and moderately good health.  I occasionally go out to gay clubs to dance and socialize. All in all, it's been a very good and rewarding life.  Choice?  Not likely.  At the age of 4 one hardly has enough pieces to comprehend choice, let alone make them.  It was always there - at no point did I have to make a conscious choice whether to be gay or not.  I just am.  Yes, I was married and have kids.  Just because I am gay doesn't mean the plumbing doesn't work, or that I am sterile.  Sex is simply a biological process, nothing more and nothing less.  Love, however, is deeply complicated."

"Yes, it's true.  Developing dark skin was nature's way of providing more protection from the sun's rays. That's why people tan, it's to help protect the skin. Light skin burns easily. Light eyes are more sensitive to bright light. Have you also noticed that  most black americans are not real dark like true africans? They aren't exposed to that harsh sun anymore and have lightened up. I'm not sure about the hair ""curling up from steam"" it sounds reasonable, but actually, straight hair when seen under a microscope is round like a pencil, and tight curly hair is flatter like a ruler. Soft curly hair is oval shaped. It's the follicles that determine curly or straight. But hey, it might have originated that way from heat, I don't know.\nps. I think brown skin and green eyes are gorgeous, and also shiny black hair with ice blue eyes too. It's different."

Hmm. I bet a lot of Asian American women are scoffing at the idea of the docile woman who stand one step behind her man.\n\nAsian culture and maybe Latin (not too sure) does place an emphasis on female roles and what they are (more home maker) BUT these are respected and not seen as servitile lesser jobs but as equally important (it is just as important to bring home a paycheck as it is to raise kids that don't rob, cheat, steal, and expect handouts.).\n\nBUT yeah, don't think Asian and Latin women are all begging to cook and clean for you (unless you buy her desperate butt out of a magazine).\n\nAny race can have the woman you want or not.
Very good question, but I'll warn you, some of the radical Christians will flag it as a violation just for asking it.  If he could have written it, it would have only been the New Testament. It was written by the men of the time to serve their own purposes, just as people today only quote the passages which support their point of view. If the Christians truly lived as Jesus did (if he ever existed) they would not be so judgemental.  If they lived as Jesus did, life would be a lot better for everyone.    As for the second part of your question. Nothing in the Bible makes sense. It contradicts itself every step of the way. It's full of violence......murder, rape, beatings......I grew up in the church & read the whole thing once & parts of it several times. I've explored several other religions & am now agnostic.

"God says that man shall not be judged by what he puts in his mouth, but what comes out of his mouth because that is what comes from the heart. It is not good to over eat, and we should treat these bodies as vessels for the Holy Sprit, but we have no ""nos"" or ""yes"" on what to eat or drink."

Aristotle believed the universe always existed.  St. Thomas Aquinas stated that if the universe just began, his proof of God would be trivial.  \n\nGiven those few words, read Antony Flew, God and Philosophy.   \n\nWhat is truly happening is that science is stuck.  And I know math and science very well.  \n\nEvolution is a mixed concept: fossil record (true) and how did it happen (????).  The issue is, can we show that new DNA information can occur naturally.  Not a new breed of dog.  Not a new antibiotic resistant strain of bacteria.  \n\nA new function, a new species.  If this can be shown, religion is dead.

It was the way they went about it and the reasons they use to obtain Christ Crucifixions That causes the uproar.  There was never a doubt that Christ was born to die. Nor was there any doubt that Christ death would bring about the means for humanity to no longer have to sacrifices animals etc. To gain forgiveness. Now they have a more direct way to ask God to for that. Also remember that  Christ did not seek power thru his teaching. But those that were in position of power, saw Christ as a direct threat to their well being and use every trick in their book to have Christ put to death by the Romans. And even today they will never admit their part in Christ death.

It is very cool of you to continue to be his friend. Please try to be thankful that he was finally able to admit it before you two got married. Some people do know they are gay from childhood and never have any straight relationship. SOme people know it from childhood but have been raised to believe it is sick and wrong, and so work hard to subvert those feelings.

There has never been a book that has out sold the Bible, so wherever you heard that, it is incorrect. As Christians, we use the Bible for many different things, including instructions on living good lives. Good Luck!!!!

The premise of Radio-Carbon dating relies on an unproveable assumption. Namely, that the rate of deterioration of the measured isotope has been consistant throughout the entire period of the earth's existence. Since the rate of deterioration is variable under different atmospheric conditions, then we are brought to the question of atmospheric and climactic changes of what is assumed to be millions of years of the earth's age. \n\nWith the Bible giving us a historical record (whether you accept the Bible or not) of drastic changes in atmospheric conditions at the time of Noah's flood, then the question will remain open to further proof. What science does acknowledge is that there was a massive flood in the past, though they term it a regional to the Middle East.

"No one can know when the end will come (Matt 24:36).  So the only Biblical answer about when the end times will come is ""soon"" (Rev 22:7, 12, 20).  ""Soon"" is the Greek ""tachu"" which can mean ""shortly or soon"" but also ""quickly, suddenly, unexpectantly"".  \n\nGod has wanted Christians to live as if Christ could return anyday.  That's why the end times will come without warning.  Although, there are many, many signs that the ""season"" is close at hand.\n\nMy personal view of how it will unfold (I am a teacher of prophecy, end times, Revelation for the past 5 years):\n\n1) Rapture of the church\n2) Start of the 7 year ""tribulation""\n3) Christ returns to earth\n4) Christ sets up his kingdom; 1000 year reign on earth\n5) Great white throne judgment for the lost\n6) New Heaven and New Earth\n\nAnd yes, I am ready.  God bless"

"Same thing--a ""beard"" is just someone who helps you keep a secret, any secret.  Like a fake beard disguising your identity."
"Malevolent demonic spirits will always approach you, or speak to you, from the left side of your body (the left ear).  Spirits from the Divine Nature (God), being the Holy Spirit and benevolent angels, will always approach you, or speak to you from the right side (the right ear).   This is so because the ""righteous"" stand at the right hand of the Father, and that which is against God stands at the left.\n\nThere is a “test” in the Bible to determine if the spirit is from the Divine Nature or the demonic nature, located in the book of 1 John 4:1-4… “Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world.  By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God.  And this is the spirit of the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming, and is now already in the world.”\n\nHence, demand of the demon if it acknowledges that Christ incarnated into flesh, was Crucified and Resurrected.  They will deny this, and thus you will know it is a demon.\n\nAs far as eliminating the evil presence, speak to a Christian Deliverer, they are equipped in these matters, but be prepared that it may require that you may have to go through the Rebirth in Christ to secure His security.  It may just as well be that God has allowed all of this so that you may know Him."
"I went to a catholic school, that's why I know this.. the story about our lady of Fatima it's from a town called ""Fatima"" in Portugal and it's about three little kids that saw virgin Mary and received messages from her. This messages were the ""three secrets"" and involved some kind of warning for the human race. \n\nThe Guadalupe story comes from Mexico, and involves a mexican indian called Juan, who as well saw the virgin Mary. He asked her to give him some kind of proof to show everyone that he wasn't lying about seeing her, and thats how he got a paint of a virgin on a ""poncho"". \n\nI don't know if this is true or not, but for the story of our lady of Fatima, the catholic church still keeps the ""third secret"" as a secret, The only person who was supposed to know the secret was John Paul II. \n\nFor the Guadalupe story, there's some kind of controversy trying to present the poncho as a miracle. The poncho still exists and there's have been some test done to it to verify the authenticity of the story (don't know the results). The poncho lays at the ""Guadalupe's Basilica"" in Mexico City, and it's beautiful, I have seen it :)"

i read that article only a few minutes ago and thought the exact same thing. They are comparing the two and they have nothing to do with eachother. Unlike the actress, Mary did not get pregnant because she slept with her boyfriend. I think that article will lead people astray and lead them away from the real gospel. That is what Satan wants...distortion of the truth. The movie, however, looks like a pretty good movie. When I see it though, I may be bugged the whole time thinking about that article. God bless you!\n\nP.S. I am in no way judging the actress here. I'm proud of her for choosing life for her child. I'm only commenting between the comparison between herself and mary that the media has made.
Anti-Semitic accounts in the New Testament have taught mankind to hate the Jew. As long as the New Testament continues in print (at least in its present form) the Jew will be hated. Here are but a few verses from where Christianity borrowed its anti-Semitic sentiments.\n\n“The children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” (Matthew 8.12)\n\n“O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Behold your house is left unto you desolate.” (Matthew 23.37,38) Then answered all the people (Jews) and said, “His blood be on us and on our children” (Matthew 27:25). 1 “But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you to councils, and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten” (Mark 13.9)\n\n“He that believeth not shall be damned” (Mark 16.16)\n\n“Ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar and the father of it. And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. Which of you convinceth me of sin? And I say the truth, why do you not believe me? He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God” (John 8.43-47)\n\n“Stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so you do. Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers” (Acts 7.51-53)\n\n“It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing you put it from you and judge yourself unworthy of everlasting life, we turn to the Gentiles” (Acts 13.45-51)\n\n“For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision: whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake ... wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.” (Titus 1.10-14).\n\n“The Jews, who both killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God and are contrary to all men: forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.” (l Thessalonians 2.14-16)\n\n“Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is an antichrist, that denieth the father and the son. Whoever denieth the son, the same hath not the father” (l John 2.22,23)\n\n“I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan ...” (Revelation 2.9,10)\n\n“Behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews and are not but do lie; behold I will make them to come and worship before thy feet...” (Revelation 3.9)\n\nnow examine the words of some Christian “saints” and leaders and notice how their anti-Jewish expressions are based on New Testament verses listed earlier in this article.\n\nOrigen: “Their rejection of Jesus has resulted in their present calamity and exile. We say with confidence that they will never be restored to their former condition. For they have committed a crime of the most unhallowed kind, in conspiring against the saviour.”\n\nSt. Gregory: “ Jews are slayers of the Lord, murderers of the prophets, enemies of God, haters of God, adversaries of grace, enemies of their fathers’ faith, advocates of the devil, brood of vipers, slanderers, scoffers, men of darkened minds, leaven of the Phari
How often does God forgive you? Does He limite his forgiveness?  Then should we? I don't think so.  We are to be imitators of God and Jesus Christ. Although He said 70 X 7, He meant that we are to continually live in forgiveness.  It means we are to see others who hurt us as victims of Satan, not just as people out to get us ...

You assume responsibility for the sin of someone else.  You, a sinner, insist upon paying the price for another person's sin, which is not Christ like.  A sinner cannot save another sinner.  There is no salvation in this poem for you or the suicide victim.  Structurally it is good, though.  It does express an idea that most people are oppressed by, that the failures of others are somehow their fault.

I don't know that you will feel better about these kids behaving that way, and its okay to be sensitive to it. Alot of people laugh at what they don't understand and that is wrong. I think the best thing you can do is be an example. If you see the person with Down's walking down the hallway, walk with him and say hi. Offer to sit with him at lunch, things like that. This will show the other kids that not everyone feels the way they do and there is nothing wrong with being nice to someone with a disability. You are very mature to feel the way you do, and you should be proud that you do not act the way they do.

"God has promised us that the whole earth will soon become a paradise just as the garden of Eden once was.\nThese are God's promises regarding our earth and those who will live forever on it--\n\nISAIAH 11:6-9--  ""And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder's den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.""\nPSALM 37:9-11--"" For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be. But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.""\nISAIAH 2:4--""And he will judge between the nations, and will decide concerning many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.""\nISAIAH 33:24--""And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.""\nMICAH 4:4--""But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken it.""\nISAIAH 29:18---""And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.""\nISAIAH 35:5-6--"" Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing; for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert."" \n\nWhat blessed times we'll realize--if we keep our eyes on the prize (of everlasting life on a perfect world)"

there are so many. This most important of which is the belief in one God, who has no partners,children, and parents. \nThe second is that Muhammed (peace be upon him) is the last and final prophet of God.\nThe Quraan- our holy book- is the word of God, revealed to the prophet Muhammed (pbuh). The Quraan has been unchanged from the time of revelation and every day 10000s of muslims memorize it regardless of their age or level of faith.\nIn Islam we believe that Jesus (peace be upon him), Moses, Jacob, Aaron, John, and many other prophets that the christians and jews believe in were all prophets of God.\nThe belief in the last day, heaven and hell, ressurection are all central to the Islamic faith.\n\nThere are five pillars in Islam:\nTo believe that there is non worthy of worship but Allah and that Muhammed is the messenger of God.\nTo pray five times a day.\nto give charity (2.4%  every year of ones wealth every year)\nto peform hajj- pilgrimage- once in a life time for those who can afford to.\n\nwell thats just some of it.\n Alcohol is forbidden in the Islamic faith\nso is the eating of pork.\n\nAnd being a women in Islam is very liberating!!!!!!\nfor 1 a man recieves a bit more inheritance than we do but the fact is with his money he has to oversee all the muslim women who have nothing, his responsibility is the old lady next door, and the bag lady on the street.\na woman can use her money to buy jimmy choo boots no problem there.\nsome of you are as good as racist and your ignorance pertaining to other faiths continue to amaze me. \nIslam does not teach us to kill as the media and some muslims have lead you to believe.\nInfact it is tottally forbidden except for in the an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth case, and in war women,children, the old, the sick, those praying and the innocent cannot be harmed.\nsuicide is forbidden.\ndonot let the ignorant lead you to believe otherwise.

"Actually the sentence you have here is not correct, it should be ""Jane and Paul were late because they forgot the present"" or ""Jane and Paul were late; they forgot the present"".  The semi-colon SUBSTITUTES for a coordinating conjunction at the sentence level:  ""I thought about leaving the party; the hostess was quite boring"", versus ""I thought about leaving the party because the hostess was quite boring.""  And, actually, neither ""for"" nor ""because"" are coordinating conjunctions anyway.  However, there is one instance where you would use a semicolon followed by a coordinating conjunction--in complex list.  ""John ate oysters, mussels, and scallops; a bean stew; a tomato, celery, and lettuce; and a good steak.""  Note that the semicolon precedes a coordinating conjunction."

"There is nothing outside of the Catholic Church to state he was a pope.  All evidence shows he visited Rome, but he did not stay there, for one thing.  Another... and this is a big one.... how is it that Priests are not allowed to marry, yet Peter, this supposed first pope, was indeed married?????????  Seems to me it's contradictory in that alone and knocks out most other ""evidence"" the Church supplies to show he was Pope.  That and the fact that the term Pope was a Pagan title during that time... and usually meant ""Father""... as in a wise man who guided others on spiritual matters... though NEVER claimed to be infallible.  Merely a helper.\n\nA little bit of study into this will show anyone these things.  And it's all historical evidence outside of what the Church states as historical.  I have a hard time believing that any church or any other particular group has the Truth while everything else in the world shows something different.  Not everyone is out to lie when they write about history."

Wow people, if you don't know what your talking about, why answer?\n\nAccording to the last census, the Asian population of the US was about 4.2%.  However, Asians are a very fast growing racial group, that number has risen slightly in the past few years.\n\nYour right, the Chinese population is just about 1% of the US population - they are the largest nationality among Asians in America.  The reason this number seems so unreasonable to you is because Asians, and Chinese specifically, tend to live strictly in urban areas on the coasts.  For example, I live a suburb of Seattle with an Asian population of almost 30%, and Chinese are about half that number.  There are many places in California where Asians and Chinese are numerical majority.\n\nHowever, there are very few Chinese people in much of the Midwest, South, etc - rural areas in these regions very likely have nonexistant Chinese or Asian populations.  Most states in this country have very small Asian populations, and are only slightly balanced by California, Hawaii, Washington, New York, Texas - places where there are larger proportions of Asian people or major cities (where Asians, specifically Chinese, tend to live).

I so agree with you! There is no reason to take tradition out of holidays and the classroom. As a child I loved the Christmas parties we had before Christmas vacation. Now we can't call it Christmas vacation its winter break, and most classrooms aren't even allowed to have a Christmas tree in them. We can still have a winter party as long as it doesn't have any traditional Christmas images, this includes Santa (because if he doesn't represent all races it is also politically incorrect) For reasons like these, I stopped teaching and am homeschooling my children, they are being robbed of some very fun activities because of a few people that just don't get it.\nWhat cracks me up is we can't pray in school even if we want to but then there are others fighting to be allowed to pray to their Gods because their religion requires pray at certain times of the day.\nWe have tried so hard to make everyone else feel welcome and happy that we have forgotten about the whole premise on which this country was founded on, the freedom of religion.\n\nHappy Holidays and have a GREAT day!\n\nPS... For all those saying Christmas is a pagan holiday... yes and no, all of our holidays have traditions from other religions from around the world not just paganism. And, technically since being celebrated in the states it has been considered by most a Christian holiday (regardless of the original origins) for the Christians that say it wasn't even Jesus’ real b-day, you are right, but it is the day that was chosen to observe it, considering the calendar had been changed so many times we really have no idea when it was.

"I hate the term cracker.  It makes no sense whatsoever and really displays the stupidity of the person using it.  This and the even worse term, ""honky"" are specific slurs that were, at one time, used against immigrants from certain countries but they were never in widespread use.\n\nFurther, there are no negative stereotypes to associate with the words, making them ridiculous.  The N word has a great many negative things associated with it.  It is an unfortunate fact that many of those stereotypes are embraced by many black people.  That's what gives the word its potency.  If someone calls you that and you know that many other black people have the qualities the word implies, the word has potency as an insult.\n\nBut for cracker and related terms, there are no negative associations.  The average white person is like, I'm not even sure what that means.  You might as well make up a word for all the meaning it has.  At least when the nation calls us white devils, we know what the hell they mean by that, even if it is ridiculous by nature of being obviously untrue."

Society tells people that their idea of beauty is a size 7 and blonde. They look down on full figured women as those who have no will power to control their eating and that they need to go on a diet. I've seen some beautiful full figured women and they rock some outfits these skinny chicks can't even surpass. I get stares too when I eat as if I am not entitled to eat a good meal. I've had men compliment me for being sexy at my size and not looking like a bag of bones, but someone who can sit down and get down on a meal like everyone else. I am working on taking some weight down, but even at my size I have guys who say I am fat and ugly when I am not worried about what they think since it's their ignorance doing the talking. I see so many guys pass over a beautiful and intelligent full figured woman for one of these skinny ditzy bimbos just so their friends won't laugh at them.\n\nThe sad thing is that a lot of these skinny females don't help things when they get together with their friends and start gawking and laughing at larger women for the fact that they can't get into certain outfits like baby tees and other clothes. Yet they get mad when a BBW gets attention from an attractive man, I had that happen to me before these narrow minded white girls making fun of me for not being able to fit into their clothes, yet I got more attention from the guys who saw me well dressed and put together and not sloppy like these girls were. It's up to us to write the media and start voicing our concerns to them about the images they put out there telling both men and women that certain traits and looks are what will make you more popular.\n\nWhat happened to the power of diversity and the unique world we live in, but it won't be that way when we have the film, fashion and music industry defining to us what is beautiful and what is considered sexy. I think the anorexic look has got to go because what man will find some woman with her bones petruding to be sexy? I agree I want to lose the weight without surgery or dangerous drugs. Too many women are not celebrating what God gave them and to accept themselves for how God made them. I have no problem with being a full figured woman since I get mad compliments for the way I carry myself and the stylish clothes I wear and being a lady and not being too out there.\n\nAs a full figured woman I am given mad respect for not looking like a dog's chew toy which is what my guy friends refer to skinny women as because I look like a real woman not some starving scarecrow trying to be cute. Do your thing and who cares if some people don't like women like us and are only aiming for eye candy because in the end they're losing out on getting to know a really great person who's full of wonderful, thoughts, ideas, and a sense of humor to match.\n\nA lot of men miss out on good women when they pass them over for not having the physical part down meaning she's a size 9. You would be surprised at how many men want to date women like you and me, but don't worry you're a good woman and there's men out there who would be honored to be with a beautiful woman who's got class and style and a great personality. Only ignorant people will base their opinion of what society feels is considered the ideal woman. It's up to us to change the way people think about others especially for their differences and accept the fact that women come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and ethnic backgrounds.

"""luctari"" means to wrestle or to struggle.\nSo the Latin verb (luctari) is in the passive voice. No active voice exists in Latin for this verb. Yet it translates into English verbs in active voice (to wrestle, to struggle).\n\nHence, ""luctantur"" means ""they wrestle"" or ""they struggle"", not ""they were wrestled"" or ""they were struggled"".\n\nThere is no ""luctant"" in Latin, only ""luctantur"". Some verbs in Latin are just like that. They use only the passive form but have active meaning. So to translate them you just use active voice as if it didn't worry you one bit why the Ancient Romans chose to use these verbs in this way. ;)"

"Catherine of Aragon was married to his brother Prince Arthur. When Arthur died aged 16, Henry's father, Henry VII, didn't want to have to return Catherine's dowry to her father, King Frederick of Spain, so he simply ""transferred"" her to Henry, who was only a child at the time (I think he was about 11 but am not sure).  Later, Catherine argued that her marriage to Henry had been valid because she and Arthur had never consummated their marriage, however, it's a matter of historical record that she and Arthur shared a bed for at least six months and what teenage boy of 15 or 16 would sleep in the same bed with a reasonably attractive young woman and not have sex with her?  Her marriage to Henry was only allowed by the Pope on political grounds.  Had they not been royals, and paid money for the dispensation, their marriage would have been regarded by the Catholic church as illegal and immoral.  Plenty of people were telling Henry VIII this LONG before he himself grew dissatisfied with the outcome of the marriage and he used to punish them.  The fact that his motives for changing his mind about his marriage were not genuine does not make the marriage to Catherine any more legal.  The marriage was not made in good faith, it was made for cynical, political reasons - if Henry VII could have sent Catherine back to Spain after Arthur's death, without having to refund her dowry, that is probably what would have happened.\n\nHenry is generally accepted as having had six wives though.  If you accept that his marriage to Catherine was legal, then it seems to me that you accept the Pope's ability to make it legal and therefore his ability to refuse to dissolve it (on equally political grounds - the Pope at the time was afraid of Catherine's nephew Charles, the Holy Roman Emperor, who'd threatened to invade if his aunt Catherine's marriage was dissolved) and therefore you accept that his marriage to Anne Boleyn was invalid. If you accept that his marriage to Catherine was illegal, then he was free to marry Anne and that marriage was valid. He murdered Anne to marry Jane Seymour; Jane Seymour died giving birth to his son, and his marriage to Anne of Cleves was dissolved on the grounds of a supposed precontract she had with another man - i.e. she was supposed to have agreed to marry someone else.  This was all very convenient.  Katherine Howard was executed after being caught cheating with two other men and she was known to have been very promiscuous from her early teens.  Katharine Parr had buried two husbands and there was no doubt both she and Henry were free to marry."

Did you try the prawns at the beginning of the meal.. as you might have left them to get cold.. i said yes i tried them  at the beginning, middle and end.. \nIt was indeed the prawns...  my partner had the same dish same feeling and we both went home after paying fully. \nHopping for no repercussions.. if you know what i mean.

"The dumb blonde is a stereotype typically applied to women (but may be applied to men) with blonde hair color, which achieved a degree of prominence in popular usage. Several notable actresses have been labelled ""dumb blondes"", Marilyn Monroe and Suzanne Somers (due to her role as Chrissy Snow on Three's Company) being perhaps two of the most notable examples. Dolly Parton is an example of a singer who used this image to her own benefit, singing songs such as ""Dumb Blonde"". Goldie Hawn is best known for playing a dumb blonde in several roles, including the stage persona she used on Laugh-In. Jessica Simpson is famous for her 'real life' dumb blonde persona. Paris Hilton is also considered a prominent dumb blonde judging on her many escapades that leak into the tabloids and the media. The bimbo is a similar stereotype, though a bimbo can have any hair color.\n\nStereotypes are ideas held by some individuals about members of particular groups, based solely on membership in that group. They are often used in a negative or prejudicial sense and are frequently used to justify certain discriminatory behaviors. More benignly, they may express sometimes-accurate folk wisdom about social reality."

"Sunni\nThe Sunni are the largest group in Islam. In Arabic, as-Sunnah literally means ""principle"" or ""path."" Sunnis and Shi'a believe that Muhammad is a perfect example to follow, and that they must imitate the words and acts of Muhammad as accurately as possible. Because of this reason, the sunnah (practices which Muhammad established in the community) is described as a main pillar of Sunni doctrine, with the place of hadith having been argued by scholars as part of the sunnah.\n\nSunnis recognize four major legal traditions (madhhabs): Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanafi, and Hanbali. All four accept the validity of the others and a Muslim might choose any one that he/she finds agreeable to his/her ideas. There are also several orthodox theological or philosophical traditions (kalam).\n\n\nShi'a\nShi'a Muslims, the second-largest branch, differ from the Sunni in rejecting the authority of the first three caliphs. They honor different accounts of Muhammad (hadith) and have their own legal traditions. The concept of Imamah (leadership) plays a central role in Shi'a doctrine. Shi'a Muslims hold that leadership should not be passed down through a system such as the caliphate, but rather, descendants of Muhammad should be given this right as Imams."

"I do sympathize with you, and it is unfortunate that people have such an attitude towards you and your family.  There is a spiritual principle involved in tithing, and it is best expressed in Ecclesiastes 11:1, ""Cast your bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.""  In other words, what you give to God will be returned to you in abundance.  Also, in Isaiah 55:11, ""So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.""  \n\nI quote these two scriptures to let you know that whatever you give to the church will be measured back to you proportionately.  I understand that you have obligations to your family that you must meet and the Bible is very clear on the subject of a man meeting those obligations.  Do not allow the ignorance of some people to keep you out of church.  Give what you can and the Lord will increase your income and your ability to give.  Giving does not always have to involve money---time as a volunteer in the church can be of more value than money"

Fasting for religious and spiritual reasons has been a part of human custom since pre-history. Vrat is fasting in Hindism. They obseve fasting for various reasons.Fasting is a very integral part of the Hindu religion. Individuals observe different kinds of fasts based on personal beliefs and local customs. Some are listed below-\n\n- Some Hindus fast on certain days of the month such as Ekadasi (the eleventh day of each lunar fortnight) or Purnima (full moon). \n- Certain days of the week are also set aside for fasting depending on personal belief and favorite deity. \n- Fasting during religious festivals is also very common. Common examples are Shivaratri or the 9 days of Navratri (which occurs twice a year in the months of April and October/November during Dussera just before Diwali, as per the Hindu Calendar). Karwa Chauth is perhaps a form of fasting unique to the northern part of India where married women undertake a fast for the well-being, prosperity, and longevity of their husbands. The Fast is broken after the wife views the moon through a sieve after sunset. \n\n- Methods of fasting also vary widely and cover a broad spectrum. If followed strictly, the person fasting does not partake any food or water from the previous day's sunset until 48 minutes after the following day's sunrise. Fasting can also mean limiting oneself to one meal during the day and/or abstaining from eating certain food types and/or eating only certain food-types. In any case, even if the fasting Hindu is non-vegetarian, he/she is not supposed to eat or even touch any animal products (i.e. meat, eggs) on a day of fasting.\n\nOthr religions like, Muslims, Sikh, Jains, Jews also observe fasting due to certian religious beliefs of their own.-

The Day of the Dead (Día de los Muertos, Día de los Difuntos or Día de Muertos in Spanish) is an ancient Aztec celebration of the memory of deceased ancestors that is celebrated on November 1 (All Saints' Day) and November 2 (All Souls' Day).\n\nThe holiday is especially popular in Mexico where it is a national holiday, and is celebrated in the Philippines, in Mexican-American communities in the United States, and to a lesser extent, in other Latin American countries. It is a public holiday in Brazil, where many Brazilians celebrate it by visiting cemeteries and churches, bringing flowers, lighting candles and praying.\n\nThough the subject matter may be considered morbid from the Anglo Saxon perspective, Mexicans celebrate the Day of the Dead joyfully, and though it occurs at the same time as Halloween, All Saints' Day and All Souls Day, the traditional mood is much brighter with emphasis on celebrating and honoring the lives of the deceased, and celebrating the continuation of life; the belief is not that death is the end, but rather the beginning of a new stage in life.\n\nfor more click here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_dead#Origins

I happen to have tried just a few weeks ago to find an indigent person in HI.  \n\nFirst off, if the indigent person gets state assistance, you can inquire with the state.  They can choose to or choose not to answer your questions. \n\nSecondly, you can contact the local police and see if the person you have has a record, and they can choose whether or not to give you information.\n\ncopsysop@ilhawaii.net\n\nthat's the local police in the Island of HI.  They looked up information for me and my person didn't have a record there, but they did tell me to try the local police on the other islands. \n\nHope that helps

Well, there are a lot of Arabs around Detroit... I think it is the highest percentage of Arabs in the entire US. There are also a lot of African-Americans, Hispanics, and Caucasians throughout the entire state, although there are fewer African-Americans in the Upper Peninsula. In the UP and in the northern part of the LP, there are a lot of Native American reservations, and although there are not a lot of Native Americans the population percentage is relatively high.
yes, pretty much.... and the jesus and tree of life must have been plagiarized from greek and scandinavian mythology respectively.

"When you say ""Scottish"", do you mean Scots or Scottish Gaelic?  They're two completely different languages you know.  Scots, the original language of Lowland Scotland, is related to but not the same as Old English.   It's descended from the dialect of the Jute tribesmen who were cousins of the Angles and the Saxons.  All three groups invaded Britain at roughly the same time in the Fifth Century."
Mav stayed away from Church for years, not because of what they said, but of what they did.\n\nMav saw six days of gossiping, six days of not caring, six days of selfishness, then for an hour or two on Sunday they were wonderful. \n\nThat's why Mav stayed away from Church for years!  Then Mav met some wonderful Christians who lived their faith every single day.  THEY are the reason (and Mav's offspring) that Mavs heart softened to what God had to say.
Maybe, I think everyone can probably turn theirself on at a point of time. How do you think people masturbate? Something about them has to turn theirself on to be able to get any pleasure from it.
"THANK YOU, Andy.  I am always dismayed by the lack of logic and the inconsistency displayed by so-called ""pro-lifers"" who justify abortion in some cases.  Either abortion is murder, or it is not.  If it is murder, it cannot be justified.  Perhaps inconsistent pro-lifers are too worried about what other people think of them and don't want to be perceived as too ""radical,"" or perhaps their desire to show compassion to the mother causes them to forget that the child is equally deserving of compassion.\n\nFor more on these topics, see:\n\nRape and Abortion:\nhttp://www.deathroe.com/Pro-life_Answers/Answers.cfm?ID=31\nhttp://www.afterabortion.info/Victims/index.htm\nhttp://www.focusonthefamily.com/focusmagazine/sohl/A000000103.cfm\nhttp://www.dakotavoice.com/200611/Guest/20061101_GR.html\nhttp://www.afterabortion.info/PAR/V2/n1/RAPESUM.htm\n\nIs Abortion Ever Necessary to Save the Life of the Mother?\nhttp://www.advocatesfortheinnocent.com/motherslife.html\nhttp://www.all.org/article.php?id=10682\n\nI am pro-life and anti-abortion without compromise, without exception, and without apology."

No.  Deism is not a religion.  It's a belief.  Just like atheism is not a religion, but a belief, deism is simply the belief: there is a god but that god has never revealed itself to its creation.

Those are 2 good ideas you mentioned (the snowman and the cookies)...I had to this years ago when I was on the volleyball team... I made homemade cards with some new greeting each time I put one in their locker (you can do it on your comp if you have a printer) and taped Christmas candies to them. You can also go to a dollar store and get a small stocking and fill it with $1 items that the person may like or find cute...like pencils and pens and stuff like that. There's all kinds of stuff...just use your imagination.....GOOD LUCK!!
Even if you break up with him, chances are he will see you again, right? So, he's gonna know eventually. If he is sweet and accepting of things and you feel safe telling him then you should. Even though it will be hard. Maybe he will accept you, maybe he won't  but you should give him the chance. Good luck! And remember, if he doesn't accept it, someone else will.
FREE PSYCHICS\nI’m often asked about how to find free psychics. Although I’m a professional myself and work for a fee I realize that there are psychics out there who offer either totally free readings or a free psychic question here and there.

Nam, huh? It takes an old lady like me to remember we were ever there.  \n\nThis is a tough one for me.  I believe that spirituality is psychological.  I am not sure how it applies to the banana.  It could be that we, as Americans live in an affluent country.  I am far from comfortable but I m still guilty of the more I have the more I want.   I also see the banana story as a group of people..  A small group would share the peel but a large group would be afraid that they would not get their share so they would grab as much as they could.  I am not sure that I am anywhere near what your are saying but I gave it a shot.

I am Black and love the legend and lore concerning Faeries. I grew up waiting for the tooth Faerie, believing Cinderella had a wonderful Faerie godmother, etc. I would love to see Black, Latin and Asian images of Faeries as well.
"People ultimately are responsible for the actions they take.  We are all beings that have a mind and should be able to use it.  The problem is you are going to see those type of examples in a world where its easier to shift blame then to take the responsibility.  \n\nIt's so much easier to shift the blame saying I was abused, or this happened to me, so feel sorry for me.  In this way the person becomes a victim and the blame and responsibility is shifted to another source.  This creates an endless cycle as the blame just keeps getting shifted.  In doing so those originally responsible often get sympathy and their deeds will not seem so bad to many.\n\nPersonally, its tiring to consistently see someone push the blame away that way.  We as people are individuals and ultimately responsible to what happens to ourselves.  If you are strong enough to shirk your responsibility to others or yourself, then you should be strong enough to say, ""Yes, I'm responsible.""  \n\nHowever this type of blame game will continue as long as society allows it to and thus is shifted to the deeds of the past."
I practice Vodou.  It is a religion that focuses on helping, healing, the community, and family.  To use lwa you must know how to petition them.  There are no spells in Vodou.  There is working with the spirits, the lwa.  We ask the lwa to help us.  We give them offerings and they in turn help us with what we need.  \n\nBaron Samedi is the lwa of the cemetery.  He is the one to call is someone is very sick or dieing.  This is because he controls life and death.  If you need to ask for help from the lwa you need to speak with a Mambo or Hougan, they are the priests of the religion.  They can petition the lwa for you.  There is always a charge for the service though.  Some Mambos will allow you to make amends some other way if you can not pay.\n\nYou can also try to use wiccan or hoodoo spells.  I will look through my books and email one to you.  I would prefer not to post on this.

i think that adults believe that if santa, or werewolves, or vampires, existed, there would be independently verifiable proof of it by now.
The beliefs within Wicca are diverse.  There really isn't any one set belief.  It is an earth-based religion, meaning we find all creation sacred, yet we do not worship creation.  Some Wiccans are witches, some are not... that is a personal preference and not mandatory in order to be a Wiccan.
That's the middle-ground belief that there may be a god and there might not be a god and all religions have a possible truth to it, and they might not.

"Before we were conceived we were in a place sorting out things from our previous lives, getting ready for when we would start all over again as the baby of someone else (usually in the same family as we had been in before).  Being in that other place can last many years...it lasts as long as it takes for us to be ready to return.  \n\nMy daughter gets mad when I call her ""Nana"".  My Nana died when I was 6 so she apparently waited 19 years to be conceived again.  That's my theory, anyways."

I believe I was reincarnated. My whole life , well, since I was seven years old ( I am nearly 18 now ) I have had memories of being a blonde Victorian woman. I do not know where I lived but I loved to shop like how I do now. My last memory of her was when I was standing in the middle of the street looking up at the store I was going in.\n\nFAMILY MEMBERS:\nMy sister believes she was reincarnated from Hitler ( I  think she was joking about that but you never know )\n- My mom had two reincarnated pasts\n- Her first was from the early 20th century and she was a rich old woman who liked to have tea and she had a heart atttack which made her die\n- Her second was from the early 1960s ( and she was born in '68 ) and she was a bohemian artist with long black hair and was raped.
Some people have no sense of humor... how do they get through life with such miserable attitudes?
"There are some technical problems that God would have faced in including dinosaurs in the creation account. There is no word for ""dinosaur"" in the Hebrew language. Now, God could have invented a Hebrew word for dinosaur and explained what those animals were like and how they had died out. However, this is a one page description of the creation of the world and life in it. Trying to explain about an extinct group of creatures would have taken a lot of space and distracted from the rest of the creation account.\n\nObviously, there were a lot more creatures than just dinosaurs that were left out of the creation account. If God were to have included every creature in the creation account (well over one billion), such inclusion would have completely lost the spiritual significance of the passage (and would be much longer than the Bible itself). The purpose of the Genesis creation account is to give an account of how God created mankind and provided for him. The account, like the entire Bible, centers on God and His miraculous workings for mankind. Therefore, in the creation account, we find the supernatural creation of the universe by God, indicating that the universe wasn't always here, but created by God for man. Next, it talks about the creation of plants, which are important to humans, since we eat them, and also important to the animals that we rely upon, which also eat them. Then, it talks about the sea creatures and birds, which we also eat. It next talks about the beasts of the field, which we eat and use for labor. Then it talks about the creation of mankind and how he is to have dominion and manage the earth and its creatures.\n\nThe second chapter of Genesis gives a spiritual account of the creation of mankind and man's relationship to God. The entire account is centered on God and man. Therefore, one would expect the creation account to describe events that are important to mankind.\n\n And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.\n\n And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\n\nThe fact is that dinosaurs are as unimportant to us as they were to the Hebrews to whom the creation account was given. The purpose of the creation account is to provide an explanation of how God provided for mankind and created him as the one spiritual animal on earth. The account is purposely brief and centered upon mankind - the only creature God created on earth to enter into a personal relationship with Him. The Genesis creation account contains all the information necessary to fulfill the purpose given for the recording of the pages of the Bible. As an exercise to illustrate the point, you might want to write your own one page creation account. In doing this, you should center the account on mankind and the creation miracles God used to prepare the earth for him. What you will find is that there is not room to discuss dinosaurs or any other extinct species of life."

Wow.\n\nOK, for starters, she has put you in a very difficult situation.  Leaving aside her request to get back together, just her confession of being transexual is enough to throw you for a loop.  I know.  Or, at least I think I know.  I start therapy next week for my gender dysphoria issues.  I forsee many of these conversations in my future as well.\n\nI see where she is coming from to a certain degree, even if I do not agree with how she has handled it with you.  (Please bear with me if I refer to your ex with feminine pronouns, for if she is truly transexual, this is how she sees herself.)  She is terrified, litteraly drowning in a sea of turbulent emotions.  So she has latched on to what she feels is her best chance for survival.  You.\n\nYou don't give any background regarding the dynamics of your relationship, and Lord knows I am not a psychologist, but I would guess that when the two of you were together, you were the strong one, the decision maker.  And if that is true, then she is looking for you to be that person again in her time of need.  That is unfair.\n\nThis is her battle.  Offer whatever support you feel comfortable offering, but also set out clear guidelines regarding what you will and will not do.  You may hurt her feelings, and that's too bad.  But if she thinks she can go through this transition without any hurt feelings, then she is incredibly niave, and hurting her feelings may just be a blessing in disguise.  Just remember, you can hurt somebody's feelings reluctantly or you can do it cruelly.  It sounds to me like you would prefer the former, so be firm, but gentle.\n\nIf she is serious about this, then it is time for her to put on her big girl panties and get to work.  I would not give her chances for survival as a woman much hope if she is not willing to do some very hard work, accept a bunch of disappointment, and deal with quite a bit of rejection.  If her desire is strong enough, she will make it.  I will be pulling for her (and for you too)  Good luck to the both of you.

"Analyzing the Cuban revolution and the actors involved is a complex endeavor. Personally, I admired what he set out to achieve. Cuba, prior to the revolution was being ""pimped"" agriculturally, culturally and was becoming a stronghold for organized crime. I can see why they wanted to break away from this exploitative relationship with the US. However, it is unfortunate that they alligned with the Solviet Union during the cold war. Che (Ernest) Guevara came from a priviledged background and could have chosen to live lavishly, turning his back on the poor. His intent as a revolutionary was to end poverty and exploitation of the poor. While I do not condone buying into the communist government and economy, I can see that he did want to help the poor and exploited."

The reason it was made illegal in the first place was because the oil from the seeds can be used to fuel an engine, and so the oil lobby, along with the media who were making profits from cutting down trees, found a way to make it illegal. The law was passed as a part of the tax law, which introduced the name marijuana, so that nobody would realise that they were restricting the use of hemp.
I agree.
For food have everyone bring a side, and you provide something like turkey or fried chicken or pizza.  \nFor movies, something holidayish, maybe Christmas Vacation or The Grinch.  \nGet a cd from somewhere like Target which has current artists singing classic christmas songs\nOk, for an activity, have a white elephant.  Basically everyone brings a gift (you set the price range, usually between 5-20 dollars)  The gifts can be something cool, or a gag gift.  People take turns drawing numbers, and they select a gift from the pile and open it.  The next person can steal a gift from someone who has already opened it, or select something else from the pile.  This game is so much fun!  I've attatched a link with more detailed instructions.\nThe point is to have fun.  Have a happy Holiday Season!
Yes I did say this. I don't think there is anything wrong with speaking about death as far as children are concerned. Death is a part of life and it is only scary if you do not bring God into their life to balance it with hope. Children already in this day and age know about death what they don't know about is God. More children today should pray this prayer. Death should not be swept under the carpet because it happens to everyone.

Tut was the son of Akhenaten and Kia.  His stepmother was Nefertiti (remember the bust of this beautiful lady?)\n\nTut returned Egypt to the ways of the old gods after his father had gone to the one god concept and worship of Aten.\n\nHe died at age about 19.  At first it was thought he was murdered, but recent study of the body shows he died of an infected leg wound.  His tomb held many beautiful things.  Some think that as he died so suddenly, and there was no tomb ready for him, someone else's tomb was used.  There are signs that his name and identity were carved in over someone else's identity.  There is even speculation that his father's tomb was robbed to fill Tut's tomb.  People wanted to disrespect his father because of his one god concept.\n\nThere are tales of a curse placed on all who had anything to do with the opening of Tut's tomb-----so many died.  But, coincidents happen, and there was no curse.

Jesus was really buff. Why ?!?  Wild locusts and honey. Locusts don't mix well in a blender ( but they didn't have blenders in those days.)  Locusts have a great amino acid profile.

"I am not sure oppa would be used for husband, but what you call a wife depends on whether you are talking about another person's wife or your own wife.  If is another person's wife you would say poo-een.

I do not have the specific legal information to answer this question but there are several legal links online:\n\n\nTo get what you want, write it into your Will. Aside from distributing your estate, your Will should specify what funeral arrangements you want — in any degree of detail. It should also name a personal representative (perhaps your partner) to carry out your wishes.\n\nAnother document that will help your partner in the event of your death is a Relationship (or Partnership) Agreement, identifying the possessions in your household that belong to each of you. This will help assure that her or his property is not improperly involved in the settlement of your estate.\n\nRather than relying solely on a Will to communicate your funeral instructions, you may prefer to choose a funeral home and select — even pre-pay — your desired arrangements in advance. Prepayment plans often entail price protection and installment plans. If you make plans with a funeral home, just make sure your partner and relatives know that you have done so. Also, describe the arrangement in your Will.\n\nhttp://www.gaylesbianretiring.org/legal.htm\n\nhttp://www.rainbowlaw.com/\n\nFor legal documents: http://www.rainbowlaw.com/legal_documents.htm\n\nhttp://www.legalaid.wa.gov.au/InfoAboutLaw/aspx/default.aspx?Page=Family/GayLesbian.xml\n\nhttp://www.nolo.com/resource.cfm/catID/F896EE61-B80C-4FE1-B1687AC0F07903BA/118/304/\n\nhttp://www.nolo.com/product.cfm/ObjectID/65E7D52B-E9E5-435F-A51F24A3045B2369/118/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.buddybuddy.com/partners.html

Well...when the bible has prophessed many things, and so far ALL OF THEM, have come true - it means that is REAL, and you should fear what the word of God is telling you. Now, if people are pushing it on to you, thats another thing, and yes it is wrong. But read the bible yourself, its quite interesting. Their main interest is for you to have a safety seat in heaven. Bible hitters are very into it, b/c God has talked to them in MIRACLES in spirtiual manners. Just pray more.

The purpose of the cauldron is to be a vessel for water, one of the stronger elements. It is necessary to contain the elemental form ( along with the various liquids it is a part of ) of water, in order to use the power of that element to invoke the spirits that are associated with it or offer thanks to the goddess, who created and replenishes all the elements. The cauldron is also a symbol of the goddess, as she is the vessel through which life is perpetuated again and again through the endless cycle.
"OK, first: ""normal"" vs. Lesbian.  There's nothing, IMHO, abnormal about being a lesbian, so be careful about how you use that term.  It's not ""uncommon"" for a woman to have a crush or fall in love with a woman such as a teacher.  Whether that's your orientation, however, depends on you and your make-up.  You say you cannot imagine ""to love a man"".  Why?  Are you simply not interested in men?  If you find that all of your emotional and sexual attraction is to these two women, then, yeah--you're probably a lesbian.  As for whether a woman will love you in return....love is a strange, many-faceted emotion...and you may be more loveable than you give yourself credit for here.  Be ready to have your heart-opened, perhaps broken, and re-opened again.  Peace."

It was never changed. In order to understand this you have to know first that the Jewish day starts from when the sun sets. in The 14th (before sunset) they put the blood on their doors and in the midnight G-d killed all the first borns (already the 15th because it's after sunset). when the egypcian found out what happened they begged the jews to leave, the jews were in such a hurry to leave that they didn't have time for their bread to raise up properly and that's why we eat the unleavened bread.
No.  The figure is every 7 to 28 minutes, not 28 times an hour.   And even that figure is an average, so one guy might think one every 2 minutes, while another once a day.  It also depends on age.   A teen might think a sexual thought every few seconds, while a middle aged man rarely at all.  Mostly these are over simplified statistics from actual studies.
Hmm i have so many favs.........\nI love: Where are you christmas, THe christmas song,mary did you know, come all ye faithful and Christmas all over again
"Because Christmas is based on Yule. The early Christians adopted this timing to coincide with Yule in order to try to win over the Pegans. \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yule\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Trees#History\n\nPegans used fire/lights light up the dark winter and to scare off any evil spirits that may be lurking. They brought evergreens inside for the same reason. Then they started putting presents ONLY on a tree. Putting candles on the tree was a much later developemt in an attempt to combine the lighting and evergreen traditions. The electric lights we have today haven't been around for very long....only since 1882.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_lights\n\n\n\nBTW: ""Chanukah"" is a JEWISH Holiday. It has NOTHING to do with Christianity.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanukah"
I have no idea.  Why does it matter anyways?
"It's somewhat disappointing, yes, but just because it would make me feel better to believe in eternal life doesn't mean that it's realistic.  \n\nOf course I know that ""something other than their body"" makes people special.  It's called ""personality"" and ""zeal""."
"Hey Susan,\n\n I had bever heard of vocable before. \nThis might help:\n\n""A vocable is a word used without meaning. They are used in Blackfoot music and other American Indian music and other music such as Pygmy music and the music of the Maldives.\n\nThe Blackfoot, like other Plains Indians, use consonants h, y, w, and vowels.

Anyone can mail a letter to Santa at the North Pole (located in Canada, not Alaska by the way)\n\nVolunteers at Canada post will reply to the letter.\n\nRest assured that all mail addressed to Santa will be delivered to the North Pole. While Santa certainly gets his share of international mail, his address is completely valid and he has one of the most recognizable postal codes in the world - HO HO HO. Letters addressed to Santa will have no trouble reaching their destination, however, he has asked us to remind all of his pen-pals, no matter where they live, that it is very important to include their return address so that he can write back. \n\nThe volunteer Canada Post employees who help Santa with his mail would like to add that while Santa likes to receive the beautiful crayon drawings many children include in their letters, the envelopes should be addressed in ink, to make sure the address doesn't smudge or become unreadable. As always, Canada Post encourages all children (and adults!) to do their holiday mailings early - Santa is ready to receive his letters anytime! \n\nSanta's address is: \n\nSANTA CLAUS\nNORTH POLE HOH OHO CANADA

Stay away from all people who disgust you. Fat or thin, tall or short, if they disgust you, go away from them. Trust me, they do not want your prejudiced self around them. \nPeople of all sizes have breathing problems, a typical asthmatic is skinny, they burn off all those extra calories just trying to breathe. The noise comes from trying to eat, and breathe at the same time. Hold your nose closed, and try to eat and swallow with no air, and maybe you will see how other people have to live, and not be so judgemental.\nAs far as noisy chewing, some people have poor teeth, and have problems chewing. Some people have conditions that make swallowing difficult. And some people just have never been taught manners.\nSorry to say, but you would know about that last cause. You are missing a few manners yourself.\nI am sick and tired of all the race, color, creed, sexual orientation and fat bashing here.

It's called Direct-to-Consumer advertising and it started in 2000.\nIt has been estimated that for the 25 biggest drug companies advertising on TV for every $1 spent in advertising they rake in $4.20 in drug sales...that's a pretty nice profit. It is directly responsible for 12% of the increase in drug sales (2.6 billion)\n\nWhat makes me laugh about the whole thing is half the time they don't actually tell you what a particular drug is prescribed for..then they tell you to call and ask your doctor if it is right for you... can you imagine actually doing that? Hey doc, should i take #$%^&*?....imagine if you ARE a woman and it's for ED!  Boy, would I feel like an idiot....\n\nThe second thing about it is they always list all the complications and side effects that could arise from taking the medication..talk about a turn-off....most of the time I'm sitting there thinking I might just prefer to stay sick  if this stuff could potentially blind me for life, give me a heart attack, or leave me sitting on the toilet for most of the day..(at least..it's a good thing for truth in advertising though)..\n\nI think in general the drugs that are advertised are sending pretty good messages...it probably helps people with depression, ED and cholesterol problems to realize that they aren't alone and that there are ways to fix their problems...I'll tell you what though..if that Bob guy loses his swimming trunks just once more on TV in the middle of the day..I'm going to have to call some kind of ethics committee..tee hee\n\nHope this helped

We never could! Look at what Bush has done in just 6 years! Regardless of any recent events, look at what Bush and his ilk have done in the name of God and country. Even die-hard conservatives are coming out against the Bush regime now, and encouraging conservatives to either vote democrat, or stay home and don't vote at all. Sad, isn't it, when your own base can't stand you and is catching on to your lies and half-truths?
He was a very great and Holy man. I remember being in Rome in 1979 and seeing him do an outdoor mass on the feast of Corpus Christi.  It was as if the whole world was standing still as he raised the Host. It was such a moving experience. He truly was a Saint.
Since your budget seems willing to spend a little. Here is a great idea. Since you have created your list. Look in your photo albums and find your favorite (nice) picture of you and your friend (each of them or you all as a group). Go have copies made and buy frames for them. Take the time to hand write out what made you pick that friend and that picture. It will make the reciever appreciate your friendship knowing that you think the world of them. Put the nice picture in a box and wrap it up with bows and ribbon. It will be a unique gift. Or you could scrapbook them a page and frame it of your fav. times together. Good luck and Merry Christmas

I think people have the right to privacy.  Also to chose if they want to be a closet gay or open as it is a personal choice.  Everybody has different standards of what they think is acceptable.  Who are we to force our standards on someone else.\nAlthough I would be very tempted to out someone who if they are living a hypocritical life.  If you are a closet gay, keep your mouth shut, otherwise you are asking for trouble.

Yes. To completely change my eating to healthy eating.\nIt took a couple of years to get it right. And I learned to fine-tune it as I go thru life. I now eat 5 small meals a day and my food budget was cut by 1/2. I no longer eat over 95% of what they sell in the grocery store. Even fast food restaurants; I eat very small meals are I no longer eat any burgers. My next goal is to get my waist line down to where it was when I was age 18. I figure it will take about 3 years ahead to achieve. My goals are all long-term, not 1 year only. And I wrote ALL OF THEM DOWN, describing what I want to do for the rest of my life.

It really depends on the person. Most teenage girls would enjoy makeup of some kind, or some relaxing candles or jewelry, as everyone knows. Adults(parents) enjoy it when you make something for them. It is easy to carve, glue, and paint a birdhouse. They sell birdhouses in most arts-and-crafts stores. With younger children, male teenagers, and younger teenagers, they appreciate it if you give them something that follows their interests. Or you can craft from clay. It is easy to buy the kind that drys, and then paint it. I don't suggest Crayola modeling clay, the kind in the plastic bag packaging. It tends to be very foamy, like springy Play Doe(How do you spell it?). Good luck on gift hunting!

I'm not sure what state you live in but you might want to contact your labor board to find out what the employer laws are.  In California, these have to be posted in a general employee space where every employee is likely to see it to refer to if need be.  Ours is in our convenience center and actually becomes good reading material while copying.  \n\nYou might also contact McDonald's corporate office.  If this is an independent franchise, city/state laws may  be in effect.  If anything, the manager will be cited (and perhaps fired) for not conforming to legal employment practices.  The second link is where to contact McDonald's - you could send an anonymous e-mail to ask about their employment practices.  Trust me, someone from their corporate office will investigate this.  But also try your city/state employment office to see what the law states about smoking in a food service establishment.  There may be a law that there should be a designated area for employees and if these people are disobeying this regulation, they could be fined or dismissed, as well as the manager.\n\nYou deserve a right to breathe clean air!
That's something I could never understand.  But I assume it has something to do with the fact that this world has made Christmas into a commercial holiday rather than a religious one.

"Of course not- It is blasphemous. It is false doctrine and taking light of our Lord and Savior- which is exactly what Satan wants the world to see. He wants people to be swept away by this ridiculous story so that they will believe anything but the truth. I know many say ""oh its fiction"" but you know many want to believe it- it is a deceitful movie and I will not support in any way- Nobody should take light of Jesus Christ- NOR add to His words!\n\nProverbs 30:6\nDo not add to his words, or he will rebuke you and prove you a liar.\n\nEphesians 5:11\nHave nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them."
"I really hate that crap.  And it infuriates me.  I once read that something that is common to every human being is that we want to be valued.  When someone totally ignores what I've said, and thinks it's so cool when they find out about it somewhere else later, or, when the bozos ""discover"" it themselves and have no recollection that I was the one that told them about it, it is such a de-valuing experience.  It makes me angry, it makes me want to do ANYTHING to get them to give me some credit.  And the sad thing is, it happens all through life, not just when you're young.  The only thing I can do is try to never dismiss people in my life, and to value what they say."

Jacksonville is not like the typical south. I have been there a couple times. It's a big city for Florida. It is also a Navy town so all kinds of people live there. Most of Florida is not southern, some places still are, but it's the smaller cities, mostly close to Georgia. You'll be fine. I live in a smaller community and we have interracial families.\nDon't expect southern kindness down here, because most of the people here are from up north, so they bring all kinds of personalities with them. You never know what your going to get. Most of the racist remarks I hear are from the Yankees, go figure.
"huh? assertive women have been around forever. we just have more of them now. i think that's a good thing. if you're also tactful then that just means you're polite and a nice person as well. who doesn't like a nice person? the real problem isn't that you had to ask, ""may i go infront of you. i have only one item."" it was that they didn't ask you to. the problem wasn't that you said i won't be your 24/7 driver. it was that he wasn't responsible enough to pay his fine and then not have to impose on another. the problem wasn't that you had to tell unexpected guest that you were busy. it was that they were so inconsiderate and assuming.\nb*tch is definitly not the right word for you. i think it should be..... hmmmm?

"Good question.\nReligions are only different ways to become closer to the creator. Some people need more commands and religious ceremonies to reach higher level of virtue and purification; others need only few commands to become purify and a good person.\nReligions should regarded as intermediary means , religions themselves are not the goal.\nreligions can educate people to live in  peace and harmony, to love people and control our ""natural vicious behavior""  and being virtuous.\nAll these can be  achieved only if we don't judge other people and don't try to convert them to any religion. If each one does all his efforts to educate himself and try to become a better person, then we all Will become better people."

I think its too early. If I look at history It was in 1861-1865 when the American civil war occurred and slavery was officialy abolished.

It's because a lot of people do not present actual facts when answering or asking a question about a certain race. They sometimes have an offensive opinion based on fiction not fact. I would label a person a racist if they look at a certain race as a whole in a negative way. My question is why do people have to be labeled and not look at as just  being human? There is good and bad in every race.  No one likes to feel like they are being put on the spot especially if it is with negative opinions or slurs. Also, I feel you have to walk in another person's shoes before you can comment about that person.

Also agree that everyone goes too far. Fighting the crowds, the traffic and worrying that you didnt get the right thing or spend enough. And the commercials for shopping give the kids the wrong impression of what the season is about.\n\nEven though they get gifts at Christmas, my children were taught from a young age that it is more important to give than receive. We bake cookies and make candy instead of spending big bucks. We donate to those less fortunate (even though we are struggling ourselves), we 'adopt' a family each year who has nothing and try to help them out. \n\nAnd we spend a special night with our extended family (instead of exchanging gifts). It can be a dinner where everyone gets together for a few hours and talks and laughs, go to see a musical or play, or even plan a game night with all the uncles, aunts, grandparents and cousins. Its always a highlight of the holidays!
In the quran teaches very different from the bible in translation to jinn. It states that jinn are NOT fallen angels. They were created from a smokeless flame of fire. The first recorded jinn to be disobedient is Iblis.  Disbelieving, disobedient jinn and humans are known as shayateen (satans). \n\nAccording to the Islamic faith every human has a partnered jinn. It teaches that you must distance yourself from them. Jinn can be delivered from evil and become Muslim.  It is possible to have relations with them, but don't to it. It also mentions fortune-teller soothsayer jinn that they can play mind games with you. The mission of jinn is to confuse, whisper false information, confusion discouragement etc....Know that jinn can be Muslim or shaitaan and are male or female. Islam teaches that shaitaan can come to you as human or jinn.

1) Stop doing whatever it is you're doing.  No, I'm not kidding!  If you feel yourself on the brink but want to continue going, then stop whatever stimulus is keeping you on edge and focus on your lover.  It's perfectly fine to let him/her know what you're doing- especially since they'll get all the pleasure as you wait for the urgency to drop a bit.  When you're back in control, get back in the game!  Partners who do the waiting trade-off (I'll do you, you do me while I rest, now switch) can have very long, pleasurable sessions, and, what's more, postponing climax can make it all the more intense when it happens.\n\n2) Devise some mental methods for yourself.  When the time comes, think about nonsexy things.  Think about them hard.  I've heard that some men picture aborted babies and massacres, but that's going a little too far, in my mind- all you need is an image that won't totally kill your libido, but does slow it down- maybe it's grandma, sitting on the toilet, or Rosie O'Donnell, naked . . . I don't know.  Try different things and see what happens.\n\n3) You can always grab tightly around the base of your shaft- and when I say tight, I mean tight- this has often been said to calm imminent warnings of ejaculation, although it's by no means foolproof, and might excite you more, or simply not be strong enough to stem the tide, so to speak.  This is the same idea behind c*ck rings, which you might want to try, as they also act somewhat as a preventative for ejaculation- but again, they won't stop it completely.  Give it a try and see if it helps.  You can also, if you're doing something where you can stop for a moment and slow down- try tugging your testicles down, which, if the handling doesn't set you off, will help rewind the clock on your erection's longevity, so to speak.\n\n4) This is a method you'd need to do beforehand, but you can always decrease the sensitivity of your penis.  The ways to do this, however, generally increase altering a condom in a way that isn't safe; it will reduce the effectiveness of the condoms, so only do it if you know you aren't at risk of pregnancy or disease.  If not, you can try buying numbing cremes for your penis, which you would put directly on your erection, with a condom over (you need the condom because otherwise, your lover will get numb, too- no fun for them).  This will help you last.  You can also try 'double wrapping' your erection in two condoms, or one very thick version, to keep sensitivity down so that you won't be so affected.\n\n5) And last but not least, just go ahead and do it.  Let loose, because sex shouldn't be an awful, grueling struggle to keep from having the best pleasure of your life.  Go ahead, ejaculate, but if it's too soon for you or your partner's liking, just know that your climax doesn't mean he/she doesn't get theirs!  Keep a spare dildo/strap-on (a lot of men wear strap-ons over their flaccid penises) in the bottom drawer for moments like this, or just use your fingers, hands, and mouth to finish off your lover, too.\n\nHope these help you!

Mormon doctrine states that in order to enter the highest heaven that those who enter must be living in polygamy. Mormon doctrine also states that we believe in being subject to the laws of the land, insofar as those laws protect individual rights. So for the time being, the largest Mormon sect, the LDS church, has decided it is more important to live the laws of the land than those of God. Other Mormon faiths have made a different choice in the matter, and practice polygamy in defiance of the unjust laws of the land. \n\nTRUE Mormons will do it whether it's legal or not!!\n\nAnd they do!!!

I don't think this statement of yours is not true. Let me tell you why: I've dated Blacks, White and Latinos. White men can be just as aggressive as a Black man or a Latino man. The only shy white men that I've encountered are white collar men (business suit wearing men). Blue collar white men such as construction workers, electricians, plumbers, mechanics, all handy men, there is nothing shy about these guys. I've dated them, I know! They are just as romantic and funny and sensitive as any other cultured man. I've dated only 2 business men and they are more reserved because they have so much swirling around in their heads. Such as the almighty dollar bill. So don't get it twisted sweetie. A man is a man the private parts are just a different color! Take it from someone that has dated a lot of different nationalities. Haven't dated an Asian yet! But some of them are quite cute as well. Things that make you go emmm!

"Mechanisms of mental disorders were analyzed predominately from the position of the ""physiology of superior nervous activity"". At the same time, the role of the social and psychological factors in psychiatric problems was not totally ignored. \n\nThere's more to this article if you want to click on the link below.

I think there's plenty of 'legal's to do these jobs.  We don't need to send all immigrants home, just the illegal ones.  As a country we should not tolerate those who break the laws; whatever the law is it should be followed not broken.  My parents are immigrants, but they did it LEGALLY.  It's the illegal immigrants that we all are having problems with.

"Total mix where I am, mostly black, white then Hispanic.  The young guys in their 20s are usually heroin addicts around here, especially the ones who are white.  There's a number of old Polish men who are drunks.  A lot are disabled but many suffered some sort of injury because of their homelessness (losing hands from frostbite, limbs from infection, etc..)  The ""crazies"" are also racially mixed but most seem to be in their 40s or so.  Not a lot of women, Native Americans or Asians on the street.  The Asians are usually elderly Chinese women who collect recyclables for cash.  I don't actually think the Chinese women I see are homeless, just poor."
Hi Rick, I get up early every morning. I've been up since before 4. Central time. I have a bad back and it wakes me up between 3 and 4 everyday. So your not the only one on early. The bad thing is I'm usually in bed by 9. No matter what night it is. My sister has been up and on the net since 4 or so this morning. She couldn't sleep either. LOL. Well I hope your day goes well.
O say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light,\nWhat so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming,\nWhose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight,\nO’er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?\nAnd the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air,\nGave proof through the night that our flag was still there;\nO say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave\nO’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?\n\nOn the shore, dimly seen thro’ the mist of the deep,\nWhere the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,\nWhat is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep.\nAs it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?\nNow it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam,\nIn full glory reflected, now shines on the stream\n’Tis the star-spangled banner. Oh! long may it wave\nO’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!\n\nAnd where is that band who so vauntingly swore\nThat the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion\nA home and a country should leave us no more?\nTheir blood has washed out their foul footstep’s pollution.\nNo refuge could save the hireling and slave\nFrom the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave,\nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave\nO’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.\n\nOh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand\nBetween their loved homes and the war’s desolation,\nBlest with vict’ry and peace, may the Heav’n-rescued land\nPraise the Pow’r that hath made and preserved us a nation!\nThen conquer we must, when our cause it is just,\nAnd this be our motto—“In God is our trust.”\nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave\nO’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

"a. I agree with you. The answer to this has to do with political correctness. \nb. A lot of people are going to say ""He made racist comments."" Now, I ask these people this question: How many blacks, black actors, black comedians, etc. refer to other blacks by using the word ""n!gga""? People say that calling a \nWhite person a cracker is nothing like calling a black person a n!gger, but last I checked we didn't take an ethnic slur and turn it into a synonym for ""friend.""  \nc. I want to know what the hecklers were saying to him that made him so..... angry. I read in one article that they were half-drunk, constantly talking loud, basically trying to take over the show with interruptions, etc. (And this fits those videos.) Heckling is considered making one or two witty comments, and if that article was correct, they were not heckling: They were just being rude. Also, were they calling him any ethnic slurs? All of those videos showed the Kramer exploding but did not show the other side. Also, was Kramer just out for shock value? He got it, and the noisy men got up and left..... \nd. The United States might seem bad, but it's the media and their brainwashed followers that are turning that incident into a huge issue. (This time, it is not necessarily the government, although our government sometimes handles issues dealing with race in unfair ways, too.) I feel bad for the various countries that have ""hate speech laws."" \ne. It's interesting that you bring up a civil war. In the prison systems and in the majority of high schools, there are what I guess you can call race wars. Currently, I've seen a lot of fights between blacks and Hispanics. I personally think that- especially during our current immigration crisis- protests similar to the ones that happened during the 60s and 70s have a chance of starting again. When King got shot, for example, a lot of the blacks started violently rioting here in Chicago. Many also started torching various buildings, etc. (My uncle was a firefighter when this was happening. Some rioters were even firing guns at him.) Will these start up again? Time will tell."

I have a series of tables in the back such as the planetary hours, herbal correspondences, different magical alphabets, ephemeral information( astrological charts) I also keep a seperate notebook for what i am currently studying... i suppose i could just add another divider to my binder, but the lessons i am working on now are very intensive & there is alot of paperwork.

The most important thing to remember is that your Book of Shadows is a catalouge of your journey along a magical path.  It is a record of your successes & failures,  it is just improtant to remember both so that you can learn form your mistakes.  It is akin to a journal or diary of your practice.

Yes, we wear our finest.  We put our lace table cloth and a Christmas center piece on the table.  Set the table with my fine china and crystal.  We read the story of the birth of Baby Jesus, have prayer and dive into our Christmas feast.  So fun.  We make memories never to be forgotten.

You describe the Eternal Starfish who resides in the Cosmic ocean of time and is the creator of all things in the deep blue sea.  The Big Fish is spiritually complete and self reliant and does not require worship from the little fish.
the message of Jesus still rings loud and clear today in every True christian church.  Jesus left a guide which is the HOLY SPIRIT so that we would know and remember his teachings.
"Jesus was the Son of God. He said himself that ""the Father is greater than I"" (John 14:28). And God himself spoke from heaven, announcing: ""This is my Beloved Son: hear him"" (Luke 9:35)\nThat Jesus was real can be seen when you consider the tremendous number of followers who were willing to die because of their belief in him and his teachings. These ones I am talking about would have been alive at the same time as Jesus, or shortly after. So they would have been able to talk with those who walked with Jesus, and saw his miracles. (The Bible says that over 500 people saw Jesus alive after he was killed.)"
Good question weng! Its very hard, but let it go over your head. The fact that he is your boss makes it difficult. Try to feel sorry for him that he is so insecure that he has to be arrogant. We cant like everyone all of the time. Dont make it a problem for yourself, its his problem let him get on with it. Just do your job and be polite, dont a*s e lick, just be yourself.... Your boss will probably appreciate that more.  Get to know what makes him tick and concentrate on that. If he does or says anything you dont like just be assertive without being rude. Its not what you say but how you say it that matters!  I hope that you are happy in your job. If your boss affects your happiness in your work, then it may be best that you look for another job.  I hope it does not come to that stage. Try not to let his arrogance get to you, alot of people are like this.
I asked God for strength that I might achieve. I was made weak that I might learn humbly to obey. I asked for health that I might do greater things. I was given infirmity that I might do better things. I asked for riches that I might be happy. I was given poverty that I might be wise. I asked for power that I might have the praise of men. I was given weakness that I might feel the need of God. I asked for all things that I might enjoy life. I was given life that I might enjoy all things. I got nothing that I asked for, but everything I hoped for. Almost despite myself, my unspoken prayers were answered. I am, among all men, most richly BLESSED.
Tell my husband that I love him and that we will meet again.  Look forward to going to the Otherworld to feast with my deities.  Rest peacefully.

I hesitate to answer you, because last time you added a detail that conveyed to me that you only want answers that agree with you. It seems to me that you are just baiting. \n\nBut, I'll give it a shot anyway...\n\nPerhaps he walked on water just like Criss Angel did.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBQLq2VmZcA\n\nThere's no evidence outside the Bible saying so that he did walk on water or that he healed anyone, though...\n\nThe Christian theological answer to how he did miracles was through the power of the Holy Spirit, which explains where it came from, but not how it worked.\n\nEdit...\n\nHis name is Christopher. My name is Christy. Does that mean I am evil, too, then? C'mon, hon, let's try to be open to the ideas of others at least and not just label them as evil. Other religions think that YOU are evil for believing what you do.\n\nA pentagram is a Pagan symbol, not a symbol of evil or Satan, no matter what your religion would have you think. Pagans do not worship or even believe in Satan.\n\nAnd no, I'm not saying he was an illusionist. Just showing you how it can be done as illusion and is not necessarily a supernatural event. \n\nThe rest of your response has nothing to do with this question. I know you haven't been here long, though, so I'll respond at length this time...  \n\nReligion does indeed slow progress. Can you give me one good reason why In vitro fertilization (where embryos are made and then destroyed) is Ok and accepted by this country where there are a lot of Christians, and yet stem cell research on those embryos (and we're talking VERY early stage embryos) is not accepted? \n\nChristianity does not make countries more advanced, more humane, etc... Countries that are predominantly Christian include - \n\nSouth Africa (apartheid), All of South and Central America, all of the Carribbean (with the exception of Cuba, which just barely falls short of being mostly Christian) and most of the Sub-Saharan African countries. That's over three dozen countries, in just those two regions of the world. There's also Eastern Europe to be considered, as well as countries that do not have Christianity (like Japan) and yet manage to be civilized and successful.\n\nSo, what's the real differences between a country that is developed, humane, and civilized and one that continues to be poor, unadvanced, or inhumane? \n\nGovernment and economy. The countries of the world that are richer, more advanced, and so on are so because they have governments and economical structures that have proven to be successful - democracies, capitalism, representative republics (like the US), and so on...  \n\nIncidentally, one thing that many of the more successful countries also have in common is that they have separation of church and state.
very simple, make the children up as the sugar plum fairy(pretty party dress), candy cane lane (have a child wear a red and white stripe shirt with a red hat and red pants),\ngum drops (use felt to make two big triangles that would fit over childrens shoulders, sew together sides with openings left for arms to come out.  Leave bottom and top open for head and legs)  Look at board for other ideas.  You will also need adults walking along side the float for safety reasons, have them dress as the gingerbread pieces that move around the board, (blue, green, red and yellow)  Should be really cute.

"your complete name - yes\nyour age - if you are still in HS, then yes.  Maybe not if you are in college\nyour place of birth - probably not... this is not a common question on enrollment applications\n\nWhen you are in college (which I'm going to assume you are not, by the question) your professors only really care about the following personal information: Name, student number, school email address.  Everything else is handled by the registrar, and the profs don't really need to see it.\n\nWhen you are a minor, your teachers will have access to your name, birth date, student number, and possibly your parents address (in the event that your parents have to be notified about your behavior or something), any medical or food allergies that you might have, and any learning disabilities that you might have.  The administration office will also have records that include an emergency phone number and contact persons (usually your parents).  All of this information about you is kept safe , and is only shared with those employees of the school district that are responsible for keeping you safe and your family informed. (So, your home address isn't floating around the student body unless you share the information.)\n\nBy looking at your other recent questions, however, I get the feeling that you are asking this in hopes of deceiving your ""hot"" teacher into believing that you are of consenting age to have a relationship with him.  Just don't.  Regardless of how fabulous you are, or how much you like him, a relationship between a teacher and a student is strictly illegal.  You are basically asking over and over again how you can ruin this man's future.  If you really do like him and care about him, please put all thoughts of a relationship with him out of your head.  It's okay to fantasize, but it's better to move on and seek a relationship with someone who is actually available."
I have a lot of friends that are adults 'cause i don't like kids my age either. Nah. I don't think you'll be boring.
Very little in practice, except that an essay usually develops some form of argument and therefore begins with an introduction, has a number of intermediary paragraphs in which the argument is developed and then arrives at a conclusion which is set out in the final paragraph.\n\nAn article does not necessary develop an argument or even display a point of view.  It is simply a succinct way of imparting information.  Because it is aimed at a readership which seeks to be informed rather than entertained, it has shorter paragraphs than an essay.  In other words, it is more punchy.  It is likely to contain links and references and while being neatly rounded off at the end, does not necessary present any conclusion.\n\nThat's the theory, anyway!

I believe that it is arrogant to think we know the ways of the Creator.  To say who will or will not be saved by God is simply up to God, surely better company is to be had from a peaceful Buddhist than a whining self rightious door knocker.   The Bible says not to judge others lest we be judged.  I think that tells me more about who will be saved.  \nAlso, even if it tells us that the only way is through Jesus, It's not my job to limit the names, means, and ways, that God opens his paths.
tell them it does. theyre gullable enough to believe it will. \n\never seen those exorcisms? where the people get singled out from the audience and begin to growl and make noises? same thing. if you convince them that your tiarra is special theyll come to the conclusion that when theyre around it, bad things will happen to them.\n\na knot in their tummy, a pain in their balls, their brain might implode (a possibility for them)....who knows.
"Because God wanted to spare him the sorrow of seeing his children killed or taken away into captivity.\n\n""The word of the LORD came to me: ""You shall not take a wife, nor shall you have sons or daughters in this place. For thus says the LORD concerning the sons and daughters who are born in this place, and concerning the mothers who bore them and the fathers who fathered them in this land: They shall die of deadly diseases. They shall not be lamented, nor shall they be buried. They shall be as dung on the surface of the ground. They shall perish by the sword and by famine, and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air and for the beasts of the earth.  Jeremiah 16:1-4"

christianity,since God does not lie,i believe it
1.  I think this is mostly true because you have to understand the way things are before discovering her things will be.  And I also believe that the universe is governed according to natural law. But I also think that man exalts himself from the animals by his ability to act against his nature, to trust his intellect instead of his base desires and use foresight to predict the future.  Without this ability, we could never create laws and governments which are the key to modern civilization.\n\n2.  I've read that Buddhists believe that nirvana, their concept closest to heaven, is an internal state of extreme peace, not a place that we go after we die.  If you believe that, then this should be true to you.  While I declare no faith, I do believe that the first key to happiness is understanding your own desires.\n\n3.  With the infinite multiplicity of religious and spiritual beliefs, both culturally and individually, I can only conclude that God(s) are the product of imagination.  Many believe, however fallaciously, in a personal God, so I guess the responsibility for determining what is spiritually real lies within the man.\n\nInteresting proverbs.  Great food for thought.
A long time ago, before people knew what the heart was really used for, it came to be associated with strong emotion.  Whenever you feel strong emotion, there's a sensation on the left side of the chest.  We now know that sensation is actually caused by chemicals in the brain.  Back then, people didn't know that.  They just assumed that the heart controlled emotion.  Even know we know better now, the old associations still stick with us, as they have become so ingrained in our culture.
"Letters: Paul, James, Peter, John, Jude all wrote 'letters' included in the New Testament. 23 Years reading it in Greek tells me that someone else wrote Hebrews, though it is traditionally attributed to Paul, the internal evidence STRONGLY points to another writer.\n\nStrange... With about 60 semester hours of Bible, I've never run into the ""book of the letters"" meaning Biblical texts. Origen, and a few other ""church fathers"" composed multiple letters which have been compiled into 1 or more ""book(s) of letters."" I would have to know in what context the question is asked to give any real attempt at an answer on that.\n\nYes, John most likely wrote the fourth Gospel which commonly bears his name."
I think you've snuck an extra question in there! :) First, yes, it is just as possible for a homosexual to be homophobic as it is for a hetrosexual to be homophobic... just sadder. Second, no, I don't think Ms. O'Donnell was justified in saying that Ms. Ripa's comment made her homophobic. I think it had nothing to do with his percieved orientation and everything to do with the fact that he is male and who knows where his hands had been and whether or not he had washed them recently? If someone put their hand over my open mouth and I hadn't personally seen them sanitize their hands within the past 30 seconds... I'd be upset too and I don't care what their orientation is!
Talk with God. Get on your knees. Say the sinners paryer. Ask God to show you the way. Do not be suprsied when he does. Follow his way. He will place the truth in your soul. Follow him and not mans direction.
Because when you take a sample that includes 7000 people in six countries, you'll get a more representative sample of the real world, and in the real world McDonald's is a far more widespread business than Christianity.  Assuming you are a Christian, how familiar are you with the symbols that are important to Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, Zoroastrians, and the countless other faiths that make up the majority of the world's countless religions? \n\nI'd be willing to bet you wouldn't even recognize many symbols that are important to various Christian sects outside your own.
You can love someone in a non-sexual relationship. Friendships usually last longer than relationships, and you should accept your friend for who he is. Your friend does love you, but he is just attracted sexually to guys. Even though you are close to your friend, it is time to start looking at the straight guys who could be interested in you.

"Good Question!!!\n\nI can only guess at the individual's replies to this as you and I have already ""joined hands"" at this site and hope that others will also adhere to your request.\n\nThe reason we have not done so up until now of course is that such a site was not available and we, the creationists and the evolutionists (I am BOTH, being a CYBORG), were kept in isolation from one another by the religious leaders on one side and the ""scoffs"" of the intellectuals from Academia on the other.\n\nThe debate has been mostly in the hands of the ""experts"" as in all other societal disciplines.  Health was in the hands of the Medical professionals, Politics in the hands of the professional (used car dealers and  lawyers) politicians, and the environment in the hands of Industry and government bureaucrats.  It is no wonder we feel ""disempowered"".  We gave away all our power to ""experts"", we thought.  And now we feel ""disillusionned"" because they were and are no more ""experts"" than we were and are.\n\nWell now, we will, starting with you and me, join hands and ""make decisions"" on these important issues and change our minds and realities, one at a time.  It's an education process, but it has now begun.  Your ideas on the issues are just as important as the ""experts"" ideas on the issues.  \n\nWe now have to take this process to the next stage and take (not ask for), legally and politically binding votes on the ""issues"" in a ""DIRECT DEMOCRACY""....We will soon have it.  Those debates have also begun.  \n\nI would like to see a ""parallel election"" taking place on-line and see how many participate.  The vote would not be for ""people"" as our ""representatives"" but on the ""issues"".  We would still need representatives to see that the job gets done but those are called ""public servants"" and ""bureaucrats"".  The ""elected"" representative would become a ""PR"" man and not a ""decision-maker"".  The people would then decide in a ""true democracy"".  That is the ""vacuum"" that will suck all other societies into the ""Age of UNCERTAINTY"" and ""PROBABILITY"" that is the Quantuum REALITY.  We don't know where it will lead, but we have no other choice.   This is already being done in some countries such as ""switzerland"" and some states as in Washington, Oregon, California, and many more...And those socieities have not fallen apart but are the most ""stable"" and ""progressive"" communities on our planet.  Switzerland is the place for everyone to ""place"" their money and the States that have ""binding ""initiatives and referenda"" can outperform other countries that still use the much slower and inefficient ""representative democracy""...\n\nWith the ""theological"" questions, the experts get their info from an ""authority"" that is ""not present"" and only communicates with some of ""HIS"" (MALE), favourites or 'CHOSEN'...Those who are not PRESENT cannot VOTE!!!  Those ""decrees"" from the Divine"" would have to be ""presented"" by the relgious ""receivers"" of such ""channelled"" messages but would be voted on by ""multi-denominal electorate"" that would include ""philosophers, atheists, agnostics, etc...to ascertain that the ""message from the Divine"" is at least not ""criminal"", hate mongering, and is loftier than the ""highest"" logic available to us by our ""experts"" who claim to be  ""at arms length"" from the ""so-called"" ""DIVINE""...In other words, the ""atheirsts"" and the ""agnostics"".  Numbers would still decide and would not immediately remedy the situation but education sites such as these"

"Well, in Islam women are told to cover their bodies with appropriate clothing wich is not revealing & appealing to men.\n\nWhere as women are free to do what they want in US.\n& that is the difference!.\n\n\nWomen wear anything they want...\nRevealing or what is sexy etc...\n\nlike bikinis, mini-skirts, tight jeans & short shirts,\nor low cut shirts, revealing their cleavage & bikini revealing nearly their entire body...\nWhich make then notthing more than a ""SEX OBJECT""\n\nHere in Islam, it is a saying, of Prophet MUHAMMAD(PBUH), that the woman who wears tight fitting clothes will not be able to even smell the heavenly odour of heaven.\nThat woman will not even b able to come even 500 yards away from the door of heaven....\n\n Note that the clothing is just tight fitting(which can show body cuts, highlight hipps,highlight breasts etc..)\nNothing is said about revealing skin....\n\nSo if just tightfitting clothes can make women suffer like this, how much can make them suffer if they wear skinrevealing cleavage revealing, panty revealing clothes etc..!\n\nStrict rules for all in Islam is just for their own good will...\n\nNeither the women will wear revealing clothes or tight fitting clothes nor they will be gazed by men as ""SEX OBJECTS""..\nNor there will be sexuall abuses.. etc...\n\nThat is why there is hell lot of sexuall abuse in US alone    than all over muslim countries....\n\nEven in college, where young boys & girls go for study, the girls are sexually harrassed by either their classmate boys or their teachers....\n\nSo wearing viel infact increases muslim womens' protection against sexuall abuse. \n& they are respected & are considered pure, NOT  a ""SEX OBJECT: \n\nWell this is how a women is respected & taken care off in Islam.\n\nThis is only one aspect of Islam for making people respect women...\n\n\nOne other is that \nProphet MUHAMMAD PBUH said, Heaven is under mothers' feet.\nMeaning that if u support & obey ur mother & take care when she is old, u r eligible for entering Heaven...\n\nWhere as mothers when they r old in US are kicked out of the sons/daughters house & are sent to OLD houses....\n\nSo Islam helps respect women in many ways, of which only 2 of them I have written here..\nIf I start writing 2 more aspects of Women in Islam, it will become very long to read & digest...\nSo I stop here...\n \nkeep it in mind that here are only 2 aspects , \nThere are Many more aspects which really make sense. like veil reducing chances of sexual abuse & help keeping  bad eyes off from women...\netc.etc...\nIslam is truely a great religion in every aspect.!"

"Check out a yahoo group called ""freecycle"" they have locations all over the country and the members give stuff that they no longer use away for free. many times I have seen children's items offered. You can even post ""wanted"" listings like ""Wanted: gently used or new clothes and toys for boys and girls ages 2-12"" you can even ask for Christmas decorations that people no longer want. \nHere is their listing \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/FreecycleDC/"

A lot of people who answered your question have obviously not seen the movie, as this 'paddling' is hazing and not punishment.  Fraternities and Soriorities make paddles with their greek letters on them, and if they get caught using them their will be stiff consequences.  The way they are using them in the movie is not seen any longer, as far as I know.  My sister went through stuff similar to what the girls experienced.  Sports teams in high school may still do the paddle thing.  It is definately not a common practice.  We are not barbarians(any more)!!  :D

Good question. One thing is for sure-no matter who or where you are. They can not all be right since they are in opposition to each other. \nHow do you think this can be solved? \nJudaism and Christianity are the two closest to each other. All the rest, including Islam,  are far different. \nEven the Christians accept Judaism as semi-valid. But the Jews despise Christianity. \nThis can be reasoned out. Unfortunately for billions of people there is not enough time for all to have a chance to compare. \nHow do you think it can be solved? Just think about it.
Kefer, what's up with you this morning? You are asking some very strange questions. As a nurse, I hope that no virus comes along and wipes us all out. As a mother I pray that it never happens. You generally aren't this morose, is something wrong this morning? Have a good day. \nScarlet

"aliens means extra terrestrial life\n\nExtraterrestrial life is life that may exist and originate outside the planet Earth, the only place in the universe currently known by humans to support life. Its existence is currently hypothetical; there is yet no evidence of extraterrestrial life that has been widely accepted by the scientific community.\n\nMost scientists hold that if extraterrestrial life exists, its evolution would have occurred independently in different places in the universe. An alternative hypothesis, held by a minority, is panspermia, which suggests that life in the universe could have stemmed from a smaller number of points of origin, and then spread across the universe, from habitable planet to habitable planet. These two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive.\n\nSpeculative forms of extraterrestrial life range from sapient beings seen in works of science fiction to life at the much smaller scale of bacteria.\n\nExtraterrestrial life forms, especially intelligent ones, are often referred to in popular culture as aliens or ETs. The putative study and theorisation of ET life is known as astrobiology or xenobiology.\n\n\nPossible basis of extraterrestrial life\n\n[edit] Biochemistry\n\n    Main articles: Biochemistry and Alternative biochemistry\n\nAll life on Earth is based on the building block element carbon with water as the solvent in which bio-chemical reactions take place.\n\n    * Water is useful because it has a neutral pH, and due to its continued dissociation between hydroxide and hydronium ions.\n\n        2H2O → H3O+ + OH-\n\n    As a result, it can dissolve both positive metallic ions and negative non metallic ions with equal ability. Furthermore, the fact that organic molecules can be either hydrophobic (repelled by water) or hydrophilic (soluble in water) creates the ability of organic compounds to orient themselves to form water enclosing membranes. The fact that solid water (ice) is less dense than liquid water also means that ice floats, thereby preventing the Earth's oceans from slowly freezing solid. Additionally, the Van der Waals forces between water molecules gives it an ability to store energy with evaporation, which upon condensation is released. This helps moderate climate, cooling the tropics and warming the poles, helping to maintain a thermodynamic stability needed for life.\n\n    * Carbon is fundamental to conventional terrestrial life for its immense flexibility in creating covalent chemical bonds with a variety of non-metallic elements, principally nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen. Carbon dioxide and water together enable the storage of solar energy in sugars, such as glucose. The oxidisation of glucose releases biochemical energy needed to fuel all other biochemical reactions\n\n        6CO2 + 6H2O + sun energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2\n        C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + biochemical energy\n\n    The ability to form organic acids (-COOH) and amine bases (NH2-) gives it the possibility of neutralisation dehydrating reactions to build long polymer peptides and catalytic proteins from monomer amino acids, and with phosphates to build not only DNA, the information storing molecule of inheritance, but also adenosine triphosphate (ATP) the principle energy ""currency"" of cellular life.\n\nGiven their relative abundance and usefulness in sustaining life it has long been assumed that life forms elsewhere in the universe will also utilize these basic components. However, other elements and solvents might be capable of providing a basis for life. Silicon is usually considered the most likely alternative to carbon, though this remains improbable. Silicon life forms are proposed to have a crystalline morphology, and are theorized to be able to exist in high temperatures, such as planets closer to the sun. Life forms based in ammonia rather than water are also considered, though this solution appears less optimal than water.[1]\n\nIndeed, technically life is little more than any s"

David,  Yes God is merciful even to those who don't believe and He is even willing to help those who do not honor Him.. I like how in the bible when someone ask Jesus if he would go here or there, He just would go wherever they wanted him to heal.  He didn't ask them what religion or anything, he just went.  Why should we be any different than He was.   Jesus loves to prove Himself faithful even to those who would deny Him.
Yes, but should not be restricted to pagans. Many others who respect our Earth and live by the land (farming and hunting and such) would take advantage of the seasonal changes to give thanks and pay homeage to the Gods or God for our survival that we could only be given by the Earth with God's help. \nWe (pagans) call the winter solstice Yule. \nBlessed be!

"Caspar?  <jk>\n\nThe Holy Ghost.  The typical sequence referred to is ""Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost"" -- the everlasting Spirit.  The word comes from the Greek New Testament word pneuma (Greek: πνεύμα), more recently translated Holy Spirit.  These are three manifestationsof God. \n\nE.g., in the New Testament book of John 14:26, Jesus is quoted as saying: ""But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.""

"I got thoroughly fed up with ""Colloquial Arabic"" .I find that all of Jane Wightwick's books are excellent. Her introductory book, ""Mastering Arabic"" is still in print. With the cassettes or CDs, it costs around £29. The book alone is around £15.\n\nIf you wish to delve into Islamic culture, there is also ""Quranic Arabic"" by Dr Murty, with 2 CDs, available from around £25 in any good, Islamic bookshop.\n\nAs a learner, I found it useful to set a target of memorising 10 new words and two rules of grammar a day. Copy examples of the grammar rules into a notebook to understand how the grammar works, then using previously learned vocabulary, compose new sentences similar to the examples . \n\nYou have to do something every day because you can soon forget words owing to the lack of any similarities with English. I test myself on the previous 7 days' 10 words before learning the ten new ones. (If you can learn 50 words a week, you will have mastered the basic vocabulary of 1,000 words in about 20 weeks and then you will have ""broken the neck"" of the language and can start making real progress. Tell yourself not to give up for six months because it is a hard language and it's very tempting to abandon it early on. To reach a stage of 98 percent understanding, you need a vocabulary of 3,000 words for ""A"" level and 5,000 words for a degree.\n\nThe lack of similarities makes learning words very hard. I have a system that works but people think I am daft. I find substitute English words and associate them with the meaning of the Arabic word, e.g., Arabic for Gospel is 'injeel so I picture a bible in jelly - daft? sure, but it works. Horseman in Arabic is faaris (written faarisun) so I picture a horse with faires on.\n\nI really wish you every success because even though English literature is vast , Arabic culture and literature is an ocean of enjoyable, different and often brilliant delights. Enjoy the rewards of the hard work you are about to start."
"No. Those who had passed away went to a place called Sheol, "" a place for the dead"" or ""grave.""  Hell is a generic term used to describe a place where souls would end up after a person passed away.  The hell that you are probably referring to was created for Satan and his demons.  The people who had put their hope into the messiah, and who died before Christ conquered death and hell, did not go to this place.  They went into ""Abraham's Bosom"" where they awaited the coming messiah.  Christ went and released these Old Testament Saints from this place and granted them entrance into the Kingdom of God.  \n\nTrust in God"

And he that thirsteth, let him come: and he that will, let him take the water of life, freely. 18 For I testify to every one that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book: If any man shall add to these things, God shall add unto him the plagues written in this book. 19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from these things that are written in this book. 20 He that giveth testimony of these things, saith, Surely I come quickly: Amen. Come, Lord Jesus. \n\n21 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

Isis is a goddess in Egyptian mythology. She was the wife and sister of Osiris and mother of Horus, and was worshipped as the archetypical wife and mother.\n\nHer name literally means (female) of throne, i.e. Queen of the throne, which was portrayed by the emblem worn on her head, that of a throne. However, the hieroglyph for her name originally meant (female) of flesh, i.e. mortal, and she may simply have represented deified, historical queens.
The Alchemy that I believe in is not the Alchemy that most people talk about. Not transformation of one metal to another so much as intensification of hidden qualities. Participation in a repeated derivation and recombination of the essential oils and the essential saltes of an herb intensifies the medicinal effect of the herb AND refines the participant's personal vibrations to a 'higher' tuning.\n\nI believe in Magick too, and that's a much more immediate source of transformation.

I agree with you 100%.  But dollhaus is correct about SUV's - I remember learning it that way in the 1980s.  Also for numbers - 80's and 90's, as well as 80s and 90s, have both been considered correct at one time or another.  But what really irritates me the most are the apostrophe's used for plural's.  That just looks incredibly ignorant!  It gets confusing, too, when people use them for their plurals but not their possessives.  The boy's played with the dogs toy's today.  This book is hers'.  I knew someone who did this a lot.  I just hate reading things like that, because I usually end up having to read it a couple of times to make sure I understood it correctly.  \n\nI had a manager one time who completely understood - he compared it to someone who was musically inclined hearing a note that was out of tune.  A grammatical error stands out to some people the way a sour note stands out to others.  I am definitely one of the former.  Not to say that I don't make errors myself, but I try to correct them as I go.  A lot of people just don't care to make the effort.\n\nAnother thing that really irritated me - on one of my son's computer games, it uses it's instead of its.  These games are supposed to be designed to teach children, not promote ignorance!
God is infinite, he has no specific age, he was there before he created the universe and he will always be there.

Fiji became independent in 1970, after nearly a century as a British colony. Democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987, caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the Indian community (descendants of contract laborers brought to the islands by the British in the 19th century). The coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native Melanesian control of Fiji, led to heavy Indian emigration; the population loss resulted in economic difficulties, but ensured that Melanesians became the majority. A new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable. Free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an Indo-Fijian, but a civilian-led coup in May 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil. Parliamentary elections held in August 2001 provided Fiji with a democratically elected government led by Prime Minister Laisenia QARASE.

People hate what they do not know or understand -- that is the root of all prejudice in our world.\n\nUnfortunately, when one is only exposed to the ill-informed prejudice of their surroundings, have been carefully 'taught' that this person is evil (because they are of this ethnicity or region/nation), and they NEVER go out to really LEARN about the person (from this other ethnicity or region/nation), then they, too, as adults, will perpetuate the same PREJUDICE and HATE in the next generation -- their children, and so forth -- ad infinitum UNTIL\n\nONE DAY -- in the blink of the eye -- ONE of their children or family members DECIDES to take a CHANCE -- to go out and MEET someone different (of another ethnicity, region, country/state/religious belief) -- and through that MEETING they find out that what they were 'carefully taught' by the prejudicial labels passed down through posterity were WRONG -- then CHANGE will happen -- and Lo and Behold -- the World View is changed --- and now, with the NEW experience of LEARNING ... Meeting ... Talking ... they find out ... \n\nHey, what I was so 'carefully taught' is NOT what is the TRUTH after all!

Same as the difference between a parent and a dictator.  The parent as not only the right but the obligation to set the limits, enforce the rules, and raise the child to be a good responsible adult.

Truth be told all Mormons are required to do a certain period of missionary work,whether it be at home or abroad.

THINKING ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES ,GOO OR BAD,\nABOUT THE CHOICES YOU CHOOSE TO MAKE IN ANY \nASPECT OF LIFE
Very picante!!
I am going to be very blunt with you. Like it or not, your post made the hair on my arm stand on ends!\nThis is Hypocrisy at it is best.  You were born into a Christian family, lived you whole life as one, and yet you have lived your life as you pleased without any consideration to what you might do, and what might happen to you, and then you won't to convert to Islam, implying that your free life was caused by you being Christian not by what you have done.  Don't blame Christianity for your past life, and now you are looking for a way out!\n\nIf you truely regret your sinns, then you should confuse your sins to God and never do them again.  Not leave God, not abandon God, and pretend you are looking for the right path! you seem had never been on the right path.  And you are worried if a Muslim man will marry you! you better believe it, many will be happy to marry a convert to their faith.  After all, you have forsaken your religion for theirs.\n\nCan you be a Muslim? Yes you can. and don't forget that Muslims also sin, they are not far from sinning nor are they Angels, if that what you think.\nA Muslim man is allowed to marry you.  Don't put yourself down so much.  You sinned, so what, everyone sinned one time or another, some sinn more than other, but we all sin, inculding the Muslims, and those whom you think are worth more than you.  You sound as if you are begging for a Muslim man to marry you.  Look for a Good man, not just a muslim man. \n\nNow I am going to get it for this.  Islam is not worthy of you.  Help you!! God help those who help themselves.  If you ever been a christian then this blessing for you.  If you think Islam is 100% for you, then you should learn a little more of what you may go into.  \n\nIN the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy SPirit may you have peace in your heart, soul and spirit.  \nDon't forsaken your Lord who put his life on the line for you, and never forget his teaching.  Amen.\n\nADD:\nI regret posting this message to you, not because I don't believe in what I say, but because you will not hear my words.  I wish you well.  Muslims claim to say they believe in Jesus Christ, and at the same time, they don't give him the proper respect.  I know the muslims so well.  If you are really a christian! Islam is not for you, believe me.  But it is up to you.  Think hard, long and wise.  Finding a man to marry you, not so hard to do.  I say this to you with all respect.\n\nI like to ask you a question, if I may!\n\nThey tell you by converting to Islam that all your past sins will be forgiven?! Don't believe it.  the question.  How do he Muslims get their past sins forgiven!! do they convert to Christianity?  \nIn the time of the judgment day, Jesus Christ will be the one who will be judging you. Christians and Muslims believe he will return for the judgment day, not Muhammad, But Jesus Christ.  Ever wonder why it is Jesus and not Muhammad!  think about it, and you will know why.

He wants us to keep our hearts guarded and our eyes focused on Him so that we can see our mission for these last days.  We are to win souls to Him.  Time is almost over.  There's no way I'm going to focus on saving animals when there are so many lost HUMAN souls.  How could one even compare the importance of the two?  The world is going to self-destruct.  The only thing we have a chance of saving is a human soul.  Nothing else will make it through to eternity.

"There are a lot of things that is not taught in ""christian education"" Most of the knowledge I have learned from personal study.  Many ministers unfortunately are not really educated in such matters.\nScriptures say\n\n2Ti 2:15  Study to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.\n\nHowever many people don't that.  With that said I feel that all my studying has not weakened my faith but strengthened things that are practiced in the Church that seemed to be not biblical based I have found out that it was changed by ""church leaders"" for often political not spiritual reasons. Things like the changing of the sabbath from Sat to Sun among other things.  \n\nIt has made me really realize that God and his Word does not change but we try to change his word to fit us.  More people need to study, return back to what scripture really says and give up their traditions of men."

I think that there are relatively few criticisms for buddhism because it is such a relaxed religion...Buddhism is much less strict than Christianity or Islam, for example.  The riles that believers must follow are less intense, and Buddhists really do not judge people of different faiths.

Nope.\n\nKeep asking the same question, keep getting the same answers. Don't do any searching for God on your own. Just continue looking down your nose at others whom you think are less fortunate, less intelligent, and less sage than you are. If you chronically need to feel superior to someone--which you do, since you chronically seek to allege your own intellectual superiority over people of faith--then you are petty, empty, blinded, and sad.\n\nGod can fix you, if you seek him.

There are some useful points here, but the overall approach can be faulted for supposing the existence of a deity, which it is not logically necessary to do.
It depends. If you want to make money in spite of the risks, go to Venezuela. The price of oil is bound to continue increasing in the next 10 or 20 years (before it runs out) and Venezuela and its inhabitants will profit from that. But if the socialist government of Chavez endures for several decades (a la Castro) you may not receive any of these gains. The antagonist forces at play in that country could explode in the near future.\nIf you want quality of life and peace of mind, go to Costa Rica. The people are friendly, the climate is good, there is a lively international community and although somewhat expensive when compared to other Central American countries, it is still affordable. It is hard to make money there since the market is so small and locals are very able competitors. The political climate is stable and unlikely to generate any revolution or anything like that.

Thanks for the thought-provoking question. It really made me think. Noah was not a Christian, he was not even a Jew. He lived long before Moses, even before Abraham. \n\nWhatever his religion was, it certainly was not Judaism or Christianity or Islam. This means that these religions are not the only ways to know God or to live a life of worth. \n\nHow about Enoch?  He walked with God. What was his religion? That means one can walk with God and not be in one of these religons!

Ohhh...I'm doing good. I'm located in a small town called Terra Alta, WV in the Appalachian mountains. Population under 1,500. As for were I live the poker runs and rallies were pretty much over with a month ago due to the cold up here. There will be a polar run in January over in Maryland...but that can be cold especially if temperatures reach the teens or low 20's. Many of the runs they have here goes towards families that have a high medical expense else their property burnt down. They had 2 runs maybe 3 for a little girl in town who was 12 yrs old for a medical condition, however she passed on about 2 months ago. They have had runs for Muscular Dystrophy and the Christian motorcycle ass will have Run for the Son to raise money for missionaries. Over all most runs go to the people around here with outstanding medical expense (if at all possible to help children).
You're right in many ways, except one. Be honest, if a woman knew she could do things better than a man, would she retain the same respect for him? It's not that men fear being weaker. it's they have to appear stronger or society treats them differently. Example: My wife and I both worked, she worked graveyard as a nurse, so she could be home during the day when the kids came home. She got put on days and we were having trouble with our oldest daughter. We had saved money and I was in the position to take time off from work.\n  I did the shopping, running errands etc. Even our friends began to question my motives. Joking I was living off of a woman, not pulling my weight and the jokes flew one after another. Even though we had to cut back a little we were far from starving, yet people made stupid jokes. We had decided together it was the right thing for us, but that didn't matter. Women have the choice of being a stay at home mother, men don't have the same choices. We are accused of being lazy, weak, stupid. So be careful when you say men are afraid of appearing weak, because maybe in your eyes they already are. And well all is said and done, will a 'weak' man be enough for you, or someone equal intellectually be better? Why oh why do women send out mixed signals?

My own opinion?  I think they should stick to the gospel and preach about Jesus.  This is what they are supposed to do and leave politics to the politicians.
Unfortunately many of them do believe just that. In the past they have as a group been extremely legalistic and devoid of anything about the spiritual side of worship.\n\nToday many members of the Church of Christ are trying hard to run from their legalistic past but it is never far below the surface although they are not as strident as they once were.  But in general yes they do think they are the only ones

all these people answering your question are the ones doing the stereotyping, i so agree with you
My opinion is if you are asked to do something that you really don't want to do but you do it anyway with a good attitude, then your self-confidence will blossom along with self-worth and others will see it and know that you care.  If you do something strictly out of duty and you're 'heart' is not really in it, then chances are, you'll do a crappy job which will aggravate the person who asked you to do it in the first place, and the end result will be dissatisfaction with yourself.

"Stan, The answer I give below is actually one that I gave to an earlier questioner who asked, ""What is the meaning of life.""\n\nI re-post it here, because I think the substance of it pertains to your very valid question. (In particular, the last two paragraphs).\n\nHope it helps.\n\n=============================================\n\nCertain questions are wrong -- like asking, ""do you still beat your wife?"" If you've never beaten your wife there's no correct way to answer it. If you answer ""yes"" it implies that you once DID beat your wife, and if you answer ""no"" it implies that you're still doing it.\nSuch is the case with this perennial question. It keeps coming up, and people think there's an objective answer -- like a solution to a mathematical equation, or a cure to a disease. People keep expecting someone, somewhere to come up with the magic answer, and suddenly we're all going to slap our foreheads and say, ""WOW! So THAT'S it!!! Thanks."" \n\nUnfortunately, life is not an objective enterprise. It is a subjective enterprise. We may do science objectively, but Nobody (I repeat -- NOBODY) lives life ""objectively."" We all live it subjectively. And if that is the case, the question ""what is the meaning of life"" is nonsensical. You're asking for an objective answer to a subjective problem.\n\nTherefore, you have to approach the problem subjectively. The proper question isn't ""what is the meaning of life"" (in objective terms), but ""What is the meaning of MY life"" -- asked in subjective terms.\n\nAnd what is the meaning of YOUR life? Only YOU can answer that. That is the existential choice. It's all on you -- and nobody but you. It's the question each one of us must ultimately confront. You can be reactive and let others choose for you; or you can be proactive, seize the day, and define your own existence. It's up to you."
"Set your alarm for 3:00 a.m. then call the office and leave him a voice mail.  No way your voice can sound anytihng but ""ill"" at 3 a.m. when you've just aroused from an obnoxious alarm clock.

Flush the toilet just at the end of your message, for effect.\n\nThat done, go back to bed and enjoy your day off."
Yes we are merely tools and commodities. Don't for one second think that capitalism empowers anyone.

You know what, that happens to so many of us.  \n\nThere isn't a sock fairy at all, that's why there's nothing left once your sock has disappeared.  Wanna know why...its the dryer monster.  You see, the dryer monster has to eat and he only eats socks.  This has been going on since the dryer was first made.  The manufacturers did this on purpose because women were so demanding of the new-found creation, that they no longer longed for the fresh smell of clothes drying in the breeze as it hung on the line (notice, no socks were ever missing when clothes are hung out to dry - well, Spot might drag the laundry down, but he never ate the socks).  So the nasty little men thought they would fix those housewives for wanting better technology and created the monster dryer that had to eat.  They never bothered to tell any of the women.  You see, that way, the people who created socks would never go out of business.  Because in the '60's, the days of hippies came to be and no one wanted to wear socks.  \n\nThe dryer monster was invented for a purpose. ;)

"The question ""Who created man?"" is a logical fallacy known as the Loaded Question. It presupposes the premise that someone created man.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_many_questions\n\nBut I bet that isn't the answer you're looking for."
Hear hear!! I think that is increduably shameful and makes me angry and that is generally not that easy.  I believe in free speech but that is just ....  words fail me!!!

No. It would be sexual harrassment if he had made comments about your butt. Keep in mind that just because he looked at your butt it doesn't mean that he finds your ass particularly attractive.If you are standing 10 feet away from someone and they are facing away from you, you can almost always see their butt.You really need to get over yourself.

"In 1799, the French armies under Napoleon were camped outside of Acre. Napoleon issued a letter offering Palestine as a homeland to the Jews under French protection. The project was stillborn because Napoleon was defeated and was forced to withdraw from the Near East. The letter is remarkable because it marks the coming of age of enlightenment philosophy, making it respectable at last to integrate Jews as equal citizens in Europe and because it marked the beginning of nineteenth century projects for Jewish autonomy in Palestine under a colonial protectorate. After the defeat of Napoleon, it was largely the British who carried forward these projects, which have in hindsight been given the somewhat misleading name of ""British Zionism."""
"I sure do, especially when they make excuses. I read an answer here on that neocon pastor and his male prostitute: ""The closer to God you are, the more the devil tries to get you"" or something like that. Anyone not a Christian who does the same is just evil to them, but when it's a Christian, they point at the devil."

It's more than about some couch trip you know.\n\nYou don't have to be lying down with your eyes closed asleep in some alternate dimension to have someone hypnotizing you.  Hypnotism is used in phrases, speech patterns...you name it.  Do some research, find out what works for you and then go for it.\n\nAnyone can learn it.  It's not some big, secret world.  Marketers want you to believe it because they want to sell you their merchandise.  Find what works for you and then just do it.

right. no one knows what happens after death, only what they read in the bible.
I agree with you to a degree.\n\nFirst of all it is disgusting to me that South Africa is so far ahead of the US in gay rights.\n\nI think the state needs to get out of the marriage business. State sanctioned unions should have always been called something other than marriage.\n\nTo me marriage is a religious ritual....it is between me, the person I love, our community of faith and our God. Why would the government need to be part of that?\n\nCivil unions grant the legal rights of a marriage and are appropriate for the state to perform. \n\nOf course, in reality the state is never going to stop doing straight marriages, so we deserve nothing short of equal treatment.
I asked that same question and while looking up other religions, wondering to myself if I was the only one who doubted those ideas and pretty sure, there are not very many other religions accepting Jesus as a real figure. However, other religions do believe that there is one god, but worship different forms of it. As like catholics do with Mary, god, the holy spirit, Jesus. SO as Christians, baptists, Pentecostals, catholics etc. all think that they are the right religion and only believe in one god, so do all the others. No one feels like having an open mind and exploring that all religions are the same, but just look at the mountain from a different side.
Azan's original purpose is to let Muslims know that it's pray time.\nLogic says that it can be replaced with any other means, but it has some spiritual value in the hearts of Muslims, so it is still heard till now. It became problem when voices became bad and it isnt an issue whether the Moazen (the man who says the Azan) has bad voice or not. also, too many megaphones ( i m talking about Islamic countries) are calling at the same time in a small area making a big noise because of interference.\ntemples or churches uses indoor loudspeakers, i think.
It depends on what they're into and how much you want to spend.

Its true, for the most part.\n\nProbably nothing, but people might think you were gay.\n\nKeep in mind, guys talk a lot less then girls in general, so we find it pretty easy not to talk for the 30 seconds we're holding our equipment.
I  dont think has anything to do with race pepole are shallow no matter what color they are even though I have no idea what you are talking about but I dont think many white guys are shallow just the rich ones that think they are better then anyone else.
Stick to tradition; when the kids beg you, talk about last year, talk about how and where you want to put the tree this year; let the anticipation build. Trust me, it'll make memories, and family traditions are great ways to build  a strong family.\n\nHappy Holidaze!\ncryllie

"Unlike Christians, who try to force the Bible down your throat, Atheists don't really care what you believe in, as long as you don't try to push your beliefs at others. \n\nIf you want my advice, your perfectly fine as it is. Humans don't need a ""God"" to make themselves feel better. Having God in your life only makes you more dependent and weaker. It's your life; it's up to you to live your life and be happy. You're the only one who can make a difference in your life."

Negril, Jamaica September 2000.  Clothing optional beach.  I found it to be very comfortable, and it seemed to disarm social barriers.  Then again, everyone there paid to be there and knew the status of the beach, nothing shocking there.  If you are looking to find some experienced advice on a streaking, I'm not all that helpful for you.  Unless it is otherwise stated, public nudity is illegal.\n\nJust remember, biblically, the Lord was quite puzzled by Adam's covering himself in shame.  Shame is a concocted idea that the Lord never wanted for mankind.  I'm not too sure what JP's hang up is, but the body is not a dirty thing, it is beautiful!

I have never heard of this saying.  A lot of sayings that has been going around over the years are just saying. \n One I know that is true is :  What go's around comes around.  What you put out, you will get back.  Treat people the way you want to be treated.  \nNow those sayings are true!
Hi,look some people are very narrow minded and like to limit God to their own little perceptions, of course there are Angels(messengers of God), and if God sends an Angel to assist one of His children on earth that Angel has the power to make himself visible if needs be.\nis it not strange that so many people believe in the realism of things like the Loch Ness monster or little green men etc and yet that reality pertaining to God and His creative order is spurned.\nand to answer your question I have seen an Angel, just once in my own life and I do mean that I saw not imagined, I was in terrible spiritual danger and was comforted and reassured by this Heavenly Messenger, and I thank God for sending him.\nthe Angels of God fight against the dominion of the evil one and his wicked hoards and come to our aid in this spiritual battle,don`t try to prove it as much as believe it.
I BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE ONE AND THE SAME. I BELIEVE THAT ALL THING CREATED BY GOD ARE GOD. I BELIEVE THAT I AM GOD, I BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE GOD, I BELIEVE THAT THE TREES ARE GOD. OUR PROBLEM IS THAT NO-ONE WANTS TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT GOES WITH BEING GODS. MAYBE THATS OUR EVOLUTIONARY PATH.
"""Who"" is nomnitive, ""Whom"" is objective. \n\nYou are speaking to whom""   or  ""Who said yes?""\n\nIn today's usage, the ""whom"" is a dying word, for most people do not use it when they should. It is easier to adjust the rules than teach everyone a word's use. No big deal either way."

I tend to argue on the side of Atheists but I completely understand how you feel. I try not to bring up Wicca because of the torrent of abuse it generally brings out from the Christian population. Though, oddly, the Atheists and the Muslims are much much nicer than the Christians.

"Certainly your underlying assumption is borne out in statistics.\n\nIn the U.S., polls show people self-identifying as atheistic less than half a percent of the time, though as much as 13% say they're non-religious (which I infer means they're IN a religion, but they don't really care about it).\n\nWorld-wide polls, however, have as much as 10% of the population identifying themselves as atheists and 16% in addition as non-religious.  In the U.K. there's even a segment of the population where 40% (!) identified themselves as atheists.  (Link to statistics below)\n\nAs to why that is... I think most would just chalk it up to the equally nebulous 'societal influence'.  And even Americans are hard-pressed to deny it's there, though sometimes you have to phrase the question correctly.  The one I like to use is, ""What do you think are the chances of an outspoken atheist being elected president?""  In a democracy of fair-minded people, you'd think the issue wouldn't be a non-starter.  Yet most Americans I speak to rate the likelihood as zero (or less!).\n\nFor the record, I can sympathize with how the atheists feel.  Polytheists like me don't do much better in America either!"
Don't receive anymore money from him.  Don't take any gifts from him.  Concentrate on your education.  Live life as a 15 year old and not as a 30 year old want-to-be.\nAs long as you accept money and gifts from him you are committing the worse sin. For you are using him as he uses girls to get money to give to you.\nThis all comes down to how much you respect yourself.  Do you think enough of yourself to not allow the immaturity of a person to control how you feel?  Are you confident enough about who you are to make decisions about what you do by what you think in your heart rather than by what someone else does or does not do?\nYou are 15 and life only gets more complicated the older you get.  Use this time in your life to prepare yourself for success in your adult years.  Education is so important.  Stay focused on what is productive and not on silly whims of silly boys.

You sound SPOILED ! Ask your 'friends'/ 'family' to go to a homeless shelter to volunteer their time serving others. \nHopefully you have more personality than other rich/ spoiled people I've met.

Anything is possible. It's arrogant to believe that we humans are the only life on this planet or in the universe.\n\nThat story sounds fascinating though. Although I have to say that if it was a real door made by elves, it wouldn't have been caught on camera and made its way to a newspaper. Elves and other beings only allow certain priviledged people to see them and their homes.\n\nI did a search for the article and was only able to find Christmas short stories and Lord of the Rings history.
My least favorite is at work. The rule is: no cell phones in patient care areas, but as soon as authority figures are out of sight the phones come out. We at work occasionally carry a cell, provided by the hospital, when there is a situation with a patient that requires us to be immediately available. The visitors automatically decide that it is my personal phone, and are mouthing off about it, when I am trying to hear how my patient is doing. \nSo here is an opportunity. People, more and more hospitals require patient care staff to carry a cell phone that is provided by the hospital, so that patients, doctors, other departments, and staff can be in immediate touch with the nurse. The hallways are long in a hospital, and often, the nurse is far away from the desk . It is for the patients safety that we do this. And you can tell when it is a hospital phone, they are usually clearly marked. Get used to it.\nBut, some people have set themselves up, out in the community, as the cell phone cops. If one rings, no matter where, they have something to say about it. I was outside, heading for an entrance into a shopping mall, I was on the sidewalk, and my cell phone rang. I never, ever, have it on, it is for emergencies, and for the convenience of a my friends, in certain situations. It was my friend, telling me she will be late, as I had already figured out, since she was not at our meeting place. Some people clear across the entrance, stopped, and had several things to say about it. They were louder, and caused more distraction then I did with my cell.People going in and out of the mall were ignoring them, or laughing at them.Thanks for asking this question.
"First boyfriend--found out he had cheated on me after I broke up with him for slapping me.  I met other girls he'd slept with or, as in my case, come close to it with and pressured.  Five of us spread an STD rumor about him in my middle school and his high school.  I was the youngest in the group, at 13, and I came up with the idea.  His dating career was over until he moved.\n\nThird boyfriend--cheated on me.  Flagrantly and often.  I was 17.  I ""borrowed"" some acid, leather gloves, and goggles from my chemistry class and poured the acid on the hood of his beautiful brand new car.  \n\nI wouldn't do that now, but that's because I learned and my taste is much improved!"

your wife lives in the US but you aren't allowed to enter the US?  you must have some kind of criminal record or be a suspected terrorist.  if you can't get her to join you in your country or both of you move to an entirely different country, then get a divorce and move on with your life.

"I personally do believe in the existence of a ""Supreme Spirit"" or God if you like, but have difficulty accepting that Jesus of Nazareth was the ""Son of God"".\nI do believe that he was a prophet and that his lifestyle was good enough to form the basis for ""Christianity"", and for me that is a reasonable creed with which I try to base my life on.\nIt may not suit everyone, as we are all brought up and taught differently, and as there are so many branches of Christianity, I would find it impossible to categorically say that any one was better than the other.\nI don't know if that answered your question but it may have given you something to think about.     Best wishes."

"Suicide is a great sin in Islam and ""suicide bombers"" are not in any way real muslims, they are only muslim by name. I don't know where they got the impression that killing themselves would take them to heaven because that is SO untrue. The word ""jihad"" has nothing to do with holy war. It basicaly means to fight for your rights as a muslim. Example, many muslim women are experiencing difficulty wearing the veil these days, so for a woman to go out wearing the veil anyways in like ""jihad."" She is strong in her beliefs and is doing something that in no way harms anyone else. I hope this helps."
"God is God, who sits in Heaven. ""god"" is considered the people doing the act of God, so they are called ""god""."
"Some comedian, George Carlin I think, once said ""there is only one 'The Church'.""  He meant the Catholic Church.  People consider the Catholic Church public in a manner they just don't consider, for instance, the Episcopalians or the Baptists.  \n\nYet even atheists are potential Catholics.  Perhaps their complaints are a sign they instinctively recognize that the Catholic Church is indeed the true Church of God.  The Catholic Church is theirs, too, even as they reject Her.\n\nConsider it a backhanded compliment."
Yes, every single individual living on Mother Earth has a partner in hiding... a soul mate that would practically match hundred percent with one! This has been a saying by people falling in love know and always. But this is also the truth. God made the destiny of mankind like that.\n\nSuppose I am a boy born at number 43.045230345 (on the scale of hundred) amongst the billions of people living on Mother Earth. Then in all eventualities there would be many girls born at number 43. Whether I get to love and marry the girl of my choice is purely dependent upon my destiny which is a controversial subject (one can always take control of ones destiny if we truly desire so)!\n\nNow, how do I find all girls at number 43...? This is where we falter... the numbering system of God being hidden from mankind... it becomes difficult to find the soul mate matching our choice and results in divorces, the divorce rate being abnormally high.\n\nIn the present materialistic trend one weighs the other from his finances, the bank balance, looks and alike. In the domain of God if we really want to search our soul mate... it may be hidden in the ugly frog for God may have cast a spell on it and unable to recognize one we marry the wrong girl! This is the irony of fate of most people the world over.\n\nThose who can hear the sweet small voice coming from their heart... the voice of our soul (atman in Hinduism) such truthful people sometimes are able to recognize their soul mate. And it is then we learn that a Mira Bai has been born. Mira Bai was a faithful follower and lover of Lord Krishna even though Lord Krishna was married and had a wife.\n\nThe love of Mira Bai for Lord Krishna had no parallel for it was much above the physical inhibitions expressed nowadays. For Mira Bai... sex had no role to play in the love she had for Lord Krishna. This is what pure love is all about! More here- http://www.godrealized.com/lordkrishna.html
You invite your teenagers friend to your house as often as possible and try to be a positive influence on the friend. By having them to your house, you can tell if you really should disapprove of the friend or not. If you say something negative about the friend, you will labeled as the old person who just doesn't know how things are today. By having the friend to your house and being kind towards the friend, you will look like the good guy in the eyes of your teenager and, if the friendship lasts more than a few weeks, you will be in a much stronger position to question certain aspects of the friend that you disapprove of.
"The Story of Lilith is this - that she was created just as Adam, directly of the breath of God - not from Adam's side as was Eve. In some accounts she rejects Adam because he does not respect her as an equal. The idea that she is banished is incorrect - she calls out Gods name to repel Adam as she struggles with him and he is stunned by the power of that name, then she leaves Eden because she is filled with fury and anger towards Adam. \n\nNote that Lilith and all her descendents are therefore free of the ""original sin"" of eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and are -not- banished from the garden.\n\nEventually Adam complains to God that he is lonely - in response to the prayer of Adam, God sends out angels to grant his prayers. The angels attempt ask Lilith to return but She refuses. Since God has given her free-will, the angels are forbidden to interfere with her decision but they must do as God has commanded them. As she rests in the waters of the sea, the angels cause her to give birth to 100 children each day, (perhaps this was an alternate solution? an attempt to alleviate Adam's loneliness?). She elects to kill her own children out of spite, and in frustration the angels place curses upon her saying she must kill all her children until she returns. If she was to return to Eden the curse would be broken. One angel attempted to break her resistance by hiding some of her children - transforming them into monsters so she does not recognize them, for this reason Lilith is called the mother of demons, djinn, witches, etc."
Everywhere in the word you'll find people who live for their social status and/or possessions yet they feel free, and there are people who have nothing, yet feel enslaved.  I believe that freedom is a feeling which comes from the heart, regardless the external factors.  For example, when you meditate or dream you are free--anywhere in the world.
"I can understand your pain and frustration. First off, it is VERY RUDE TO STARE. The whites that stare at you can stare at you for various reasons. They could be very racist (from my experience living in TX). Also sometimes people stare at those who look different. People have told me that I was ""exotic"" looking which is very insulting to me. \nIt could be jealousy. Sometimes if you look like someone who is smart, that holds a certain demeanor , they may stare at you in envy. Sometimes people will stare at you because they do not think you are pretty but they may stare at you because they are wondering about your facial features and how different they look. \n\nDon't even bother asking these idiots ""why are you staring at me?"" from my experience , I have asked people that stared at me ""why"" and they will either deny it or say you are paranoid. You are not, you are just noticing them stare at you but they flip it around and make it look like you are crazy. Also I have tried to smile and say hello to those people that stare at me. That doesn't work either. When you say hi to a racist person they are just going to continue staring at you back without reciprocating your greeting. The best bet is to not look at them and ignore them. In fact, I think the people that stare at you know it bothers you based on your reaction and that is why they do that some more. Sometimes people have to feel pretty shitty in their lives to take it out on someone they believe is passive and stare at them to make them feel better.\n\nI know you hate it when you get stared at, because I get stared at all the time by hispanic men and mexicans here in houston and they really creep me out! \n\nIf they are staring at you negatively, then they are racist.\nIf they are staring at you with a smile, then they are lusting after you. \nOther then that you really don't know why they do it and they will not answer you if you ask.\n\nPeople are VERY VERY RUDE for staring. Just tell yourself that you are a BETTER PERSON THAN THEY ARE because you know that it is rude and you know that you would not do that to someone else to make them feel uncomfortable.\n\nI hope this helps. There are a lot of racist people out there. Ignore them and excel in your studies. Living well is the best revenge!"
If a tattling troll turns you in, you will receive a notice of violation but just ignore it. They can't touch you in important ways and worrying or stressing or, worse yet, getting upset or angry will do your soul harm while a loss of points will not...

"A little searching would have given you the results too.  Sadly 45-55% of American believe that.  I also included a link to an article that helps outline four of the dominant viewpoints.\n\n""...In a Harris poll conducted in June, 55% of 1,000 adults surveyed said children should be taught creationism and intelligent design along with evolution in public schools. The same poll found that 54% did not believe humans had developed from an earlier species--up from 45% with that view in 1994--although other polls have not detected this rise."
"How many friends? If it is only a couple how about a ""Manicure Party"" call a local salon and find out how much it would be to get manicures for you and 3-5 friends.

"Oh please, a girl just has to look at a guys penis to be called a whore.  Regardless of color. Men can sleep with hundreds of girls and be praised and respected, regardless of color. And last I checked men still get paid far more than a woman with the same qualifications in the work force. You have an extremely limited world view and experience. Go live a little...your statements are BEGGING for some sort of evidence or even explanation to back up your claims.\n\n""Getting jobs is easy if their somewhat smart as well as beautiful.""\n\nHow does this translate into a an easy life?  You are foolish to think that all girls, white, black, whatever...are pleased to get a job  only because they are somewhat smart. You are foolish and frustrating, even if you are sincere in your question. Sorry to be rude.\n\n\n***WELL, asker, quite frankly I took offense to your question and your following details which seem to prove that you do believe this misperception to be true.  At least I apologized.\n\nAnd the point of my frustration toward your question is that you think it makes life easier to get a job based on beauty....how degrading. Most of us go to school to get a degree in hopes that our qualifications ONLY will be considered. If you want to be a pretty white girl who gets a job because she is beautiful, oh and can also spell her name,  just to be gawked at and not taken seriously...then by all means, be my guest.  \n\nI too have seen girls get jobs based on their beauty and then i have also seen how everyone talks behind their backs about how stupid and useless they are.  Doesn't really sound easy to me...\n\nFurthermore, I have also seen pretty Mexican, Black, and Asian girls get jobs b/c they were Mexican, Black, and Asian. Its called affirmative action.\n\nI find it incredibly odd that you dont believe that women are paid less across the board, yet you do think that women get jobs because they are pretty and white. First of all, hiring women because they are beautiful while their qualifications are obviously disregarded, immediately puts her in a position to be ignored and shoved to the side because she was hired to look good and keep her mouth shut.  Now do you honestly think that the man who hired her just to look at her is going to pay her the same amount as the men he hired with identical qualifications, if not less. \n\n\nYes there is a progressive drive to decrease the gap and improve equality but it is far from over. Im not arguing for women's rights, Im just saying that every single statement you made was jaded, because you have no idea about anyone's life but your own.\n\nAlthough I do not feel the need to prove anything to you, especially since you obviously have access to the largest provider of knowledge known to man, you can take a look at this website for a little bit of info about the salary gap which happened to be compiled THIS YEAR.\n\nhttp://www.womenandequalityunit.gov.uk/pay/pay_facts.htm"

The Mandan Indians hunted buffalo and other game. They used wolf, buffalo and deer hide for clothes. Their diet consisted of buffalo meat, and deer meat. They also farmed the land, growing corn and beans for food. They also grew tobbacco.\n\nSemi-nomadic plains tribes who spent most of the year following the buffalo herds came to the Mandan and Hidatsa villages for corn, beans and squash to supplement their diet. They traded furs, most notably buffalo hides, for the vegetables.\n\nAgriculture was the economic foundation of the Knife River people, who harvested much of their food from rich floodplain gardens. The land was controlled by women-the size of a family's plot was determined by the number of women who could work it-and passed through the female line. They raised squash, pumpkin, beans, sunflowers, and, most importantly, tough, quick-maturing varieties of corn that thrived in the meager rainfall and short growing season. Summer's first corn was celebrated in the Green Corn ceremony. Berries, roots, and fish supplemented their diet. Upland hunting provided buffalo meat, hides, bones, and sinew.

There is a heavier burden on society as a whole to make sure no woman has to resort to prostitution to feed her children.  I think members of that society should ask themselves if God will forgive them, rather than if God will forgive that woman.

According to the 10 commandments (Exodus 20) spoken by the LORD God (Yahweh Elohim), the iniquities (idolatries, adulteries, etc...) are passed on to the 3rd & 4th generation of those who hate God.  The blessings go onto the 1000s generations of those who love God.

Well, I think that it’s primitive, but you can pray that if you want.  It won’t matter.  I know that not all Christians think this way, but this is the reason so many people think that Christianity is a angry, hateful religion; it’s always about punishing the “sinners” and people who think differently and rewarding the good Christians.  Of course if you are talking about something really bad that the person did (like murder, rape, etc.), then I do think it is normal and healthy to be angry about that.  Instead of praying about it, actually do something that will make a difference.
It depends on your sign. You need balance in a business partnership.\n\nYou can't have two leos as partners - they will kill eachother fighting for the same portion. Take a look at your sign but more importantly - at your personaility. You want a partner that can balance you.\n\nIf you are the outgoing type, hyperactive, good with people then you need a number cruncher, good at deep thinking, focusing on details. Likewise the other way around. Both of you - as business owners - will always be able to see the large picture as well as the small one.\n\nEvery business has a sales sides and a day-to-day side. They are both important. A good example were the owners of Palm (before they left the company).\n\nJeff Hawkins was the creator, the visionary. Donna Dubinsky helped focus him with her management skills. They each understood eachother's strength and weaknesses. The sum of their parts were greater then the individuals.\n\nSame thing with Apple computers. Two Steves. One was a people person - the salesman, the other a focused engineer. Together - they were the dynamic duo - each feeding on the others strength.
no its not reasonable or even acceptable practice.\n\nbut control freaks can only be that if another person allows them to do that.

"To say ""please"" before a command, put a 請 (qing3, pronounced like ""ching"") in front of the command.  請坐 (qing3 zuo4, or roughly ""ching dzoa"") would mean ""please have a seat."""
You're asking WHY? Why indeed, but given a choice, I'll take the second alternative.
"The name ""Jehovah"" is an English translation of the Hebrew name pronounced as or similar to ""Yahweh"" or ""Yehowah""; the exact original pronunciation is unknown. The four Hebrew characters corresponding to the letters ""YHWH"" are well-recognized as the biblical personal name of Almighty God, and are universally designated as ""the Tetragrammaton"" or ""the Tetragram"".\n\nFor centuries, most Jews have superstitiously refrained from pronouncing aloud any form of the divine Name. They base that superstition on the third of the Ten Commandments given to Moses:\n(Exodus 20:7) You must not take up the name of Jehovah your God in a worthless way\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/bible/ex/chapter_020.htm?bk=Ex;chp=20;vs=7;citation#bk7\n\nOver the centuries, that Jewish superstition has expanded to also forbid writing or engraving any form of ""YHWH"", even when simply copying from one of the nearly 7000 occurences in the Hebrew Scriptures. In recent centuries, some superstitious Jews have even forbade unabbreviated EUPHEMISMS for ""YHWH""; capitalized terms such as ""Tetragrammaton"" and (amazingly) even ""the Name"" are forbidden by such superstitions.\n\nMore recently, the Jewish superstition has ballooned out of all reasonableness by also forbidding respectful impersonal TERMS referring to the Almighty; thus many Jews insist upon writing ""G-d"" or ""G~d"" rather than ""God"". They may even refrain from capitalizing impersonal terms such as ""Creator"" and ""Almighty"".\n\nNaturally, the religious and superstitious practices of a person are between him and his Creator. However, in recent decades these superstitious Jews have worked to impose their superstitious sensibilities beyond their religious communities, and onto the entire populace. Thus, although ""YHWH' is unanimously recognized as the personal name of God, few today use any form of it in their writings and conversation.\n\nInterestingly, Christendom has largely joined with superstitious Jews in suppressing the use of ""Yahweh"" and ""Jehovah"". However, it seems that Christiandom's anti-YHWH bias largely devolves from their hatred of Jehovah's Witnesses, the religion almost single-handedly responsible for the growing public recognition that the Almighty God of Judaism and Christianity actually does a personal name.\n\nIt seems that too many are more interested in coddling superstition than in allowing intellectual honesty and respect for the Almighty.\n\n(Psalms 83:18) That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, You alone are the Most High over all the earth\n\n(John 17:26) [Jesus said] I have made your name known to them and will make it known, in order that the love with which you loved me may be in them\n\nLearn more:\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/na/\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/20040122/"
She is right. I am a Mexican from Santa Fe NM\nP.r. 's hate Mexicans in NYC CZ they are they are other majority comin up in NYC of Spanish speaking people. Pr's and Domcans\nare pretty miserable people in NYC.  They socially are at the bottom along with poor blacks. They can hate Mexicans all day long for all i care. Mexicans are much superior in many ways. \nHarder working. better fam values, NOT into crime like crazy.\nPr and domcans have been in NYC for generations and still at the bottom. Africans who speak no English come here and work \nand raise themselves and their families up right. I dont get why Pr's and Dr's hate black people? The majority of their blood is black?? I think they are jealous of Mexicans..i dont know. They hate everyone. They are not friendly people for the most part.\nIi dont worry about them. Mexicans make up the majority of span speakers in this country. And are taking power full positions in the gov. i.e. Alberto Gonzales Attorney General of USA.  Pr's and Dr's have done what Washington post writer Stanley Crouch wrote what poor blacks have done. Intertwined their culture with street culture. And have institutionalized their stupidity, for the next generation. If your are a Mexican ins Nyc.. stay workin hard, let PRs and Doms laugh at you....Cuz their kids will be working for your kids someday.
the dutch gave the native american the gift of scalp...!!!!our ancestors NEVER EVER scalped anyone until the dutch came over and then indian scalps were worth munny....hence-women,and children were scalped and sold becos I guess the buyers wuddnt know the difference between the young and old...indian ways never scalped anyone..when this attrocity happened,our eastern ancestors thought it was the white way so they followed the WHITE traditions..only to be deeemed heathens and redskinned murderers....anywasy thats the story I got from a dutch friend of mine many years ago..because his father and grandfather from south dakota were proud to tell this...scarry huh?they were sure proud to tell it..

Assuming that there is some sort of church social planned for your congregation in the near future, you have two options open.  \n\nThe first (and somewhat more devious) is to surreptitiously place the child on the buffet table, wrapped up like a basket of brown and serve rolls (note, it is important to do this after the food in the surrounding area has been cooked, and not in the kitchen cue).  When the banquet  is finished, and people are busily trying to snag leftovers and steal each others cookware, the brat will likely end up in the back seat of some good christians car... Problem solved.\n\nThe second, and somewhat more straightforward approach involves that most holy of church ceremonies...\n\nI am referring of course to bingo.\n\nBy placing the child in the winnings vault at the next bingo get  together you can not only assure that the kid will be won by a good christian individual, but that the lucky winner (having claimed the rug-rat publicly, in front of the other members of the congregation) will not be able to return said infant at a later date.

It is a vicious circle. You declare some place as religiously important with some false or genuine historical data people start going there. As a large number of people congregate at one place with one intention and unity of purpose it assumes a spiritual property and strength. That benefits many who visit these places. It is true with all such places of worship in India, Jerusalem, Kaaba, and Buddhist monasteries where Buddhist relics were said to have been found.
"No, first he started off saying ""In my name I pray."" \n\nThen he thought...  ""You know - this is ridiculous... why do I have to pray?

Maybe you should stop crying and just go get a fricken ladder and some pliers!"""

"John Milton, in Paradise Lost said, ""The mind is its own place and in itself can make a Hell of Heaven, a Heaven of Hell.""  Thus, we create our own destiny anew in each and every moment.  Bitterness is a thorn deep below the skin of our consciousness that continues to fester as long as we harbor it.  To be free, one must let go of the past and take responsibility for their feelings and their actions.  It is irresponsible to blame one's feelings on another.  Where do the feelings emanate from?  Within ourselves, we create them.  Something outside may be the catalyst for such feelings, but we create them and react to our self-made feelings.  \n     I have a question for your question - why wait until you are dead to find out?  Why not try to be free from our self-created suffering and live in peace right this second?\n\n  As the maxim goes:  To err is human.  To forgive, divine."

Amazing how many people still proclaim that heaven is in an unknown, non physical place, even when the bible very clearly states that it is a solid structure in the sky, separating the 'high waters' from the 'low waters'  ie it holds back the rain until god opens the heavens.  Just another example of how man twists the bible in attempt to justify it.
I understand homosexuality is not illegal in S.A., but his situation is very difficult from what you say. In my opinion, what he could do –I know it can be difficult- is keep aside his sexual trends for the time being so that his father may regain confidence in him and at least, allow him to get a degree in some career or other. And when he has finally being able to start an independent life of his own then he will be able to openly show his sexuality in South Africa or wherever he chooses to live.\nAfter all, there are thousands of young men that do not start having any sexual activity until they get married, although you may find it hard to believe, and that means finishsing their studies first and finding a job afterwards.\nLife is not always easy, and you can tell this youn boy he will not die if he tries to disguise his true feelings for a few years and behave accordingly.\nCurious98

I hate to say it, really, but it sounds like he is either hedging his bets or letting you down easy. If you want to be back with him you need to be slightly aloof and let him know you have options. I'm normally not into playing games, but there is nothing that will drive him away faster than being needy or bring him around faster than seeing that you can live - well - without him. Be nice, but not too available. Also, I don't know why you split, but unless you work through those issues they will still be there even if you do reconcile. I strongly urge counseling - whether you go back with him or not. Even if you don't it will help you in your next relationship. Good luck!

Well unlike all above i do understand what you mean and sort of agree.\n\nThere is an element of complacency in relationships and the  grass does look greener on the other side making someone elses partner seem better than your own.\nAs an outsider you wouldn't know all the problems or annoying habits someone has, and maybe women are just a bit more blinkered than men to what they see.\n\nHusbands/boyfriends are an easy target, women talk to each other about relationships much more then men so i'm sure all her girlfriends will know of every chink in your armour.\n\nI'm not sure putting them forward is the right discription of what's happening, 'seeing other men in a more favourable light' is a bit closer to it.
"when the king james bible was translated in the 1700's ""fear"" meant ""awe""(sorta like gay meant happy,but the meaning has changed.)unfortunately,now fear means being scared.so the original meaning of feeling awe,has unfortunately been misconstruesd as to feel afraid .word meanings change over the years,for example suffer once meant permit-like,permit the little children to come unto me, u would not believe how many people nowadays believe christ was asking children to suffer for him,or something like that."

"Between the Eastern Orthodox and the Roman Catholics??\n\nIsn't one of the main differences that most Roman Catholic priests are not married and most Eastern Orthodox priests are permitted to marry?  -- I think that ""would affect family life"".\n\nAnother difference ... Roman Catholics acknowledge the supremacy of the Roman Pontiff; Eastern Orthodox do not.\n\nSimilarities include, I think, that they all believe in transubstantiation."

Well that's an interesting question.  I remember being young and feeling God's presence most of all out in the beauty of nature.  I am 55 now, and I still feel exactly the same way, especially if I'm alone in some lovely landscape, I very much feel His presence.\n\nI also feel Him when I read and contemplated His word (the bible), but the sweetest connection with Him, I think, is out in His creation.

If she is or isnt does it matter?   People should be able to be  or like who ever they want with out the world labeling them or acting like they are different. Some people like skinny parteners and some like super fat partners but no one calls them skinny lovers or super fat lovers.  Thats something I still cant figure out with people , why everyone gets so concerned with others sexual preferences. I am all woman and love men and all my friends are male since women get on my nerves and if someone is a lesbian  or or gay it really is no concern of mine. I dont have to live thier life they do and should be free to live it how they want or with  who they want with out a label put on them. I am not trying to scold you even tho after rereading this that what it sounds like.
"It does depend a little on how young we are talking about - a 5 year old is not going to understand some of the more sublte triggers and points that perhaps a 14 year old might\n\nIf you are a victim to racism, then unless you want the youngster to ""be a victim"" try and make them realise that there will ALWAYS be people who have a problem with someones colour , religion, gender, sexuality etc and race is no different. Try to make them realise it is nothing to do with them, more a hangup belongin to someone else.\n\nIf you hear them making slurs and are racist, then presumably you would be impressed. Sad but there ya go. If you are not overly impressed, then rather than jump down their throats, try to find out what made them make the comments, see if you can get them to explain their attitude. Do they have a reason - is it peer pressure ?\n\nIf you don't approve of racism, then above applies really, try and deal with it with them in a realistic and honest way - but do not add your own personal thoughts grudges and hang-ups to the pot if you can help it.\n\nIf you are racist, then I guess you will encourage your child to carry on the hate for another generation. Seems a bit of a cruel thing to do but there ya go.\n\n\nps:\n\nMizogen, your story about the Jewish father is powerful and I have heard it before. But although very quotable, I think there is a danger f being too cynical in life.\n\nI would far rather be taken for a mug once in a blue-moon  - and accept that some folks are decent human beings - than make sure I distrust everyone at all time no matter what.\n\nTelling a child he should epxect no good from any man is a pretty good way of crippling his/her social skills from day one. My guess is that if you follow your own advice, you are perhaps someone who ""enjoys their own company"" a great deal of the time. do you really wish such a friendless, loveless life for your kids too?"
I am qualified to answer this question.  Why did not your former Presidents Bush, Regan, Carter or Ford dispatch the Military to police the high crime inner American cities?  Terrorists and Gangs have nearly the same tactics but different goals in mind.  Terrorist groups have access to heavy weapons and high-explosives through rogue governments.  Gang factions have access to Small arms and are smart enough to manufacture explosives.  Their goal is monetary to make money through various criminal enterprises.  Terrorist groups are politically motivated.

Almost every body have answered you correctly, that this one of Islam pillars, and if fulfilled all your sins are “erased”.\nBut I would also like to tell you a little about Kabba and Makkah.\nMuslims believe that the Kaaba in Makkah is the first house of God built on earth, it was built by Abraham (PBUH) and his eldest son Ishmael (PBUH), it was built in the place where Abraham (PBUH) left his wife Hager with her son Ishmael (PBUH) and God promised Abraham to make this place “destination for people”.

"Painting all TV evangelist with the same broad brush is just as wrong as painting all (Fill in the blank) as being lazy, smelly, taking our jobs, etc.\n\nYes, unfortunately, there have been men who have been into it for the money and have fallen.  However, if the gospel, or the good news of Jesus Christ, is being preached, then there are those who are going to hear it, believe in Jesus as their saviour and lord, and follow him, so even if there are some snakes in the grass, I think that TV evangelism, by and large is more positive than negative.\n\nBTW, Pat Robertson has ""Operation Blessing"" where he DOES help out the needy!  That is just one example, there are others who are truly doing God's work.\n\nLet's not be intolerant of ANY group.  No one should be intolerant of a nationality group or a political group, but for some reason it is OK to be intolerant of Christians.  Let us stop painting all TV evangelists with the same brush just because Jimmy Swaggert et al have done wrong."

Islamic terrorism is inspired by Islamic teachings. We can never get rid of Islamic terrorism unless we defeat the ideology behind it and that is Islam itself. Islam induces hate backed by lies. Muhammad was a terrorist by his own admission. All Muslims, to the extent that they follow him, are terrorists. Those Muslims who are not terrorists are ignorant of Islam and are not good Muslims. Fortunately they are the majority. We need to rescue them. If you are a good human being, you are not a Muslim. Read this site and if you can't prove me wrong, which you certainly can't, leave this deceitful cult of hate and terror and join mankind. Don't be part of the Umma. Umma is fascism. It is divisive. It induces the hatred of others. Be part of humanity instead. Your ignorance is not an excuse. Pull your head out of the sand and face the truth, like we did.

MY SON COMING INTO MY LIFE.  BEFORE I MET MY HUSBAND NOW I HAD BEEN WITH ALOT OF DIFFERENT GUYS.  WELL FOR 10 YEARS OF SLEEPING AROUND I NEVER GOT PREGNANT.  I METT MY HUSBAND NOW AND THE FIRST COUPLE TIMES OF US HAVING SEX I GOT PREGNANT.  THE MOMENT I FOUND OUT I WAS PREGNANT I QUIT SMOKING AND QUIT DRINKING.  I QUIT PARTYING AND I STARTED GOING BACK TO CHURCH AND I BECAME VERY SPIRITUAL.  I BELIEVE THAT HAVING MY SON SAVED MY LIFE.  I DON'T KNOW WHERE I WOULD BE IF I NEVER HAD HIM.  I THINK THAT GOD WANTED ME TO GET PREGNANT BECAUSE I NEEDED TO CHANGE MY LIFE AROUND FAST OR SOMETHING WAS GONNA HAPPEN TO ME.  BECAUSE I LOOK AT IT THIS WAY,  WHY DID I NOT EVER GET PREGNANT ALL THOSE OTHER TIMES HAVING SEX?  BUT ONCE I METT THIS MAN IM SUPPOSE TO BE WITH FOREVER I GET PREGNANT?  IT WAS JUST A SIGN. IT WAS SUPPOSE TO HAPPEN FOR SURE. SO, THAT WAS MY GREATEST MIRACLE AND BLESSING IN MY LIFE.  MY LIFE IS SOOOOO MUCH BETTER NOW WITH MY SON AND MY HUSBAND MY LIFE.  GOOD QUESTION.
"Good question!  But if you watch this show as well as ""Most Haunted"" or any other ""haunting"" show, the evidence seems to suggest that it's THE PEOPLE who are haunted, not THE PLACE they're in.  But if you want to see something eerie on film, go to LEMUR.COM and watch the video of the EMF meter moving by itself on the chair.  Sure, anything can be faked, but this is the most compelling evidence of a haunting I've ever seen if it's for real...and I think it just might be."

In such cases, you must examine the facts carefully.  If you find it is true and can prove that such a detestable act has occurred among you, you must attack that town and completely destroy all its inhabitants, as well as all the livestock.

"Many of these answers are way off-base.  They Magyar people, who are the primary basis of modern Hungarians, are believed to have come from river basins of the Ural Mountains.  The Magyars have no links with the ""Middle East"" and in no way look Middle Eastern.  Part of Hungary was controlled for some time by the Ottomans, but there is little to no ""Turkish"" appearance in the Hungarians.  They don't look Slavic either, you don't see many round faces for example.  They look more Germanic, which makes sense historically and geographically.  Lots of blondes and brown-haired people.  More brown eyes than blue eyes, but lots of blue eyes still.  Not as tall as Scandinavians, but taller than most Slavic people or French or Italians.  You do not see ""pulled back"" eyes representative of Asian peoples there any more than you would in Germany or Austria - people like to read obscure history into everything!  Some people have a little Rom (Gypsy) blood in them which makes them darker than others.  But if you want to know what Hungarians look like, look at Zsa Zsa Gabor or Mariska Hargitay (from Law And Order) who are Hungarian and half-Hungarian respectively - they resemble a lot of women I see in Hungary.  The men are generally good-looking in a way that's not Slavic or too Germanic either.  Older men favor mustaches."

It is not just Christians that have burned books, it was very common during the reign of the Nazis in Germany. I guess some people think it is far better to buy and burn something that they object to than to try to ignore it and hope it goes away. Of course, I have to laugh when I hear that recently a group of people have bought books to burn them when this still gives the author the royalties to book sales and the negative publicity about the book usually give the book more interest by others, again raising sales of the book.
"G'day jadziakl,\n\nThank you for your question.\n\nIt depends on the family. However, they would receive an education either through a tutor or at a school like Eton.\n\nThey could train to join the army as officer positions were purchased. Depending on their rank, positions would be purchased in the cavalry (the more prestigious) or the infantry. This practice continued until reforms in 1856 due to problems exposed by the Crimean War.\n\nThey could train for a career in Government either in Parliament or in the civil service. Being related to a rich aristocratic person was a definite advantage. There were 56 parliamentary positions abolished in 1832 which were known as ""rotten boroughs"" often with a handful of electors and controlled by weathy men. The aristocracy had a dominant position in parliament until the late 19th century.\n\nThey could also be sent overseas to Britains rapidly expanding empire either as Governors or colonial officials. \nThey could train to be clergymen and become bishops in the Church of England. Alternatively, they could train to become professionals most notably lawyers.\n\nGenerally, aristocratic families looked down on people who made a living from industry or trade even if they were wealthy.\n\nI have attached some sources for your reference.\n\nRegards"

""And be not drunk with wine.""\n                            [Ephesians 5:18]"
"Because us Americans and the British are sick and tired of getting ""customer service"" from people we can't understand.  It's not discrimination.  If I go to Africa and my Boston accent is not understandable I don't expect Microsoft Africa to make me a phone support technician.\n\nI'm just so sick of people using discrimination as an excuse!"

Not only was I tempted to, but I fell into it. And hopefully you can learn from my passed sin  . IT'S NOT WORTH  IT !!!!   When we get tempted,we are blinded to all the consequences that follow. And believe me, there will be consequences .. but here is the good news.. Being tempted is not a sin .. resist the devil and he will flee from you . trust me, you will be greatly disappointed in the end,with unbelievable heartache . \nIt is the Christians duty to cast  down those imaginations that exault themselves above God and bring them into the obedience and captivity of Jesus .. Shut the thoughts down, and replace them with God's word .. Lord Bless you ....\n\nemotional closeness can very well lead to physical . The devil knows how to set that up like nobodies business .   he will do what ever he can to acomplish his goal .
I usually celebrate holidays with my group, and then again alone.  I find, sometimes, that the preparation for a solitary rite is sometimes just as meaningful as the celebration itself. I know how you feel. I used to feel that way many years ago. I put forth more effort for my family's holidays rather than my  own. That's when I started coming up with special preperation for my own holidays and it made each one more special for me. Now I have 10+ year traditions for myself and I get really excited about them.\n\nFor example - Before Summer Solstice, I put the summer wreath on the door (make seasonal wreaths - it's a blast!), and then re-decorate my living room altar to honor the Gods of the sun and fire. I leave each altar up for a month or so.   I'll change the altar depending on the meaning behind the celebration so it's always changing. I'll set aside time for long pre-ritual baths. I'll take the time to bake a cake. Take my time shopping for wine. Those sorts of things.
"I'm an atheist, and I celebrate Christmas.  It may interest you to know that Christmas was originally a pagan holiday, not a Christian one.  Pagans celebrated it as the solstice and as a tribute to the evergreen tree (which mysteriously stayed green throughout winter).    I believe that the Romans called it Saturnalia, and the pagans in Britain called it Yule.  I first learned about this from my high school English teacher, and I was much more comfortable celebrating Christmas after I learned it.  The link below has some interesting info.  (Naturally, pagans are usually not atheists, but I find paganism less offensive than I do Christianity, since pagans do not seek to force their religion on others.)\n\nChristmas today is part pagan (Christmas trees, mistletoe, etc.), part Christian (nativity scene), part German (Santa Claus), and part downright commercial.  I personally don't mind celebrating it, and of course, am free to choose whiat I include in my celebration.  I buy gifts and admire others' Christmas trees (though I don't put one up myself, mostly because I travel to visit relatives at Christmas), but I don't attend church or nativity plays.\n\nI don't think it would be very friendly of us to have a holiday that was ONLY for atheists.  I'd rather have a non-religious celebration that simply didn't make requirements regarding its guests/celebrants beliefs.  My friend's brother is having a Festivus party (based on George's Dad's invented holiday on ""Seinfeld""), and some people have solstice celebrations.  Some solstice celebrations may be pagan in nature, but they need not be;  the solstice is a legitimate astronomical occurance.  Then there's New Year's Eve, which is also non-religious."

Peter, as well as some of the other disciples, were crucified. No death could be more painful. Mark was tied between 4 horses and pulled in 4 pieces(or at least that's what some historians say). That's got to hurt a little. Polycarp was burned at the stake. Paul was beheaded not to mention that he was scourged 5 times, beaten with rods 4 times, stoned and many other persecutions while he was alive. The early disciples were persecuted their whole lives and then martyred in the most cruel way. That's why I believe the bible. These men were eyewitnesses of everything they wrote about in the bible and they lived a persecuted life and died horribly and went to their death saying that everything they had said was true when they could have lived a peaceful life and died peacefully if they would just have renounced everything they wrote about. But they didn't. They went to their death saying it was true.
"It's not exactly wrong to call the Almighty Jehovah by the impersonal term ""God"", just as it's not wrong to call one's offspring ""Child"". If we want a familiar and close relationship, however, it makes sense to use the personal name of someone we love. The Scriptures encourage us to use God's personal name.\n\nThe Hebrew name “Yahweh” (or “Yehowah”) does seem to accurately pronounce the divine name. Just as the Hebrew name “Yeshua” (or “Yehoshua”) is translated into “Jesus” in English, the Hebrew name “Yahweh” is translated into “Jehovah” in English.\n\nThe important thing is to use God’s personal name in whatever language you speak, rather than insisting upon the impersonal! The name “Yahweh” is certainly preferable to the non-name “God” or “Lord”, especially if you speak Hebrew. If you speak English, feel free to use the name ""Jehovah"".\n\n(Psalms 83:18) That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, You alone are the Most High over all the earth\n\n(John 17:26) [Jesus said] I have made your name known to them and will make it known, in order that the love with which you loved me may be in them\n\nLearn more:\nhttp://watchtower.org/library/na/index.htm"

"No, they are not stupid.  They are victims of ignorant white people, whom automatically associate hip hop style and music with inner city black crime.  They have embraced the negative aspects of the ""gangsta"" counterculture and turned them into something positive- art.  Are a bunch of snowboarders any cooler than a bunch of homies on a half court?  Like the young lady said, each to their own.  Attitudes like yours keep tensions too high between races; you need to free your mind."
I already know it, thanks anyway.
Wow. A lot of people on this thread haven't really read their Bible. \n\nYes, everybody has read Paul's letter to the Corinthians that states that women should not teach men. Yet, Paul is very inconsistent in his writings on the subject of whether women should hold positions of authority in the church. \n\nAfter all, in his letter to the Romans, why does Paul make Phoebe the deaconess to the Romans? In his letter to Timothy, Paul makes clear that there are only two church offices: Deacon and Bishop. Yet he tells the Romans that he is sending Phoebe as their Deacon (And, yes, he uses the word DEACONESS in Greek...there's no wiggle room on this) and to do what she requires of them. Now if women are not to teach and not to have authority, will somebody explain to me why he's sending a woman to preside over the Romans' church? And, in the same passage, he mentions several other women who have been named to high church office. \n\nFurther, as supporting text, all you have to do is read Paul's letter to the Galatians, where he clearly states that there are no men and women in Christ, no rich and poor, no slave and free. There are just Christians. So with Paul clearly subscribing to absolute egalitarianism in the church, why provide one gender with more priveleges than another?\n\nSo, no, women cannot be priests in the Catholic Church. But that doesn't mean that the scriptural teachings on the subject are consistent.

Hi there,\n\nI'm a historian and I focus on ancient history. I can tell you that the 10 lost tribes were taken out of the Northern Israelite Kingdom, known as Samria in the early 8th century BC. This is when the Assyrian Armies captured Samaria, not only is this documented in history but in the bible as well. I think it's in I Kings. \n\nAnyway, after the Assyrian conquest, the 10 tribes were scattered throughout the eastern portion of the Assyrian Empire by King Sargon. From this point on it appears that they took the name Scythians (or Kuthia in Persian). However, there's no real proof of the name-change. It is well known however, that historically speaking they ceased to be a people after the Assyrian conquest, and other peoples were relocated to Samaria from throughout the Empire to populate Samaria. These new people, not at all related to the Jews that still lived in Judea. \nI hope this helps you. God bless!

Remember the guy (jimmy the one) only heard the word, not saw it written down so how would he know how its spelt?

They base this on some obscure and very weak hadith that says that the Prophet pbuh did this once - which they took to mean this is the only way to pray. But as I said there is much dispute over whether its even true that he did that and no indication whatsoever that this is the only way to pray.\n\nRather we are told that we can pray anywhere on the Earth, that the Earth is a place of worship and we can pray indoors or outdoors, wherever - you don't even need a rug - its juts you and Allah swt nothing and no-one else - do I need a piece of stone before I can communicate to Him? Do we think Allah swt is dependent on a stone? How silly is that!\n\nNot only that the prayer to an onbject is as we know indicative of idol worship and this is what a lot of them now do - they direct their worship to this stone believing it to be a link with Allah swt and that those of us who pray without it are not praying properly and our prayers won't be heard - - this is shirk on their part and a grave sin.\n\nEnough said really!\n\npeace

Now notice carefully the end shown in: \n\nDaniyl 12:4-7—\n4 But you, O Daniyl, shut up the words, and seal the book to the time of the end; many will run to and fro, and knowledge will be increased.\n5 Then I, Daniyl, looked; and behold, there stood two others, one on this side of the bank of the river; and the other on that side of the bank of the river.\n6 And one said to the man clothed in linen, who on that future day is teaching: How long will it be to the end of these wonders?\n7 Then I heard the man clothed in linen, who on that future day is teaching, when he held up his right hand and his left hand toward heaven, and vowed by Him Who lives forever, that: It will be for a time, times, and a half, when Yahweh will have accomplished pouring out His power through His holy people, all these things will be finished. \n\n\nYahweh again shows us the end, in a time—three and one-half years, that is filled with destruction. The first time (3½ years) was the first half of the seven year peace plan that was stopped in its midst (Daniyl 9:27). Then Yahweh shows us times in Daniyl 12:7. One time is 3½ years; times is 3½ years plus 3½ years, which equals 7 years. \n\nThe seven year peace plan started October 13, 1993, shut down April 13, 1997 after three and one-half years of action. The seven year peace plan stayed shut down for a duration of two times, that's seven years and was signed back into action on April 13, 2004 on the very day prophesied. \n\nPresident Bush and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon restarted the seven year plan on the very day Yahweh showed it would go back into action. \n\n\n------------------------------...\n\n\nWe Are Now In The Last Three and One-half Years (Time) Of Man's Governments Of And By The People \n\nDaniyl says it will be the greatest time of trouble ever. \n\nDaniyl 12:1—\nAnd at that time will Micahyah stand up, the great ruler who stands for the children of Your people; and there will be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation to that time. And at that time your people will be delivered, everyone who will be found written in the Book of life.\nThe Savior says the same. \n\nMattithyah 24:21-22—\n21 For then will be great tribulation, such as has not come to pass since the beginning of the world to this time—no, nor ever will be.\n22 And unless those days were shortened, there would no flesh be saved; but for the elect's sake, those days will be shortened. \n\nIn this same time period there is extreme hatred among the nations. For proof of this, all you have to do is watch the world news. \n\nMattithyah 24:7—\nFor nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines, and pestilences; disease epidemics, and earthquakes in place after place. \n\nThen comes the nuclear wars that will darken the sun. \n\nMattithyah 24:29—\nImmediately, but after the tribulation of those days will the sun be darkened, and the moon will not give her light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. \n\nNow learn a parable so you will know when this time is at hand. \n\nMattithyah 24:32-33—\n32 Now learn a parable from the fig tree: When its branch becomes tender and puts out leaves, you know that summer is near.\n33 In the same way, when you see all these things, know that His coming and the end of the age is near, at the very door. \n\nPlease notice, these are things we can see taking place. Compare this with the following. The Apostle Shaul spoke of the same time in: \n\nI Thessalonians 4:16-17—\n16 For Yahshua Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the malak gadol, and with the trumpet of Yahweh. And the dead in Messiah will be raised first,\n17 Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet Yahshua in the air; and so will we ever be with Yahshua. \n\nThese two verses and the following go together in the same time perio

"Actually there are 613 Laws that we are commanded to keep in order to come into perfection and unity with Yahweh and Yahshua his son, remember ""the Laws are perfect converting the whole person.

revelations i think is filled with alot of metafors that leaves alot to debate.. the rapture is near i think because the bible talks about not attacking gods people and all the countries around iseral is coming toeghter and they might attack them soon the a great fire will come from above(gods fire,nuke,many other ideas nobody knows) so to me that is another sign that the rapture is near so keep in the faith because jesus will sneak in like a theif and take us(the saved) away..we will never know when..ps i like revelations
EXCELLENT question.  well basically ppl assume tht the so called 'extremist islamists' r those  who hate USA n its ppl . i live in Dubai n most of d ppl here are not 'extremist' but still ders soo much of hatred towards american (by muslims) , so i dun think its the extremists who spreads hatred , its actually the media n mosques which spreads hatred, to solve it or reduce this , the best thing is to limit the visas given to muslims, this may sound like 'anti-islamic' but wen islam is 'anti american' i think its fair for americans to be 'anti-islamic'. \nGOD BLESS AMERICA

"The world wide church is called the Anglican Church. Each country has its own branch, and in the U.S. that is called the Episcopalian, which means governed by Bishops. In the U.K. is it called the Church of England. They are all part of the same ""Anglican Communion"". The head of the Episcopal church is called the Presiding Bishop. The head of the whole Anglican Church is the Arch Bishop of Canterbury. He does not have the same position in the Anglican Church as the Pope does in the Roman Church because the Anglican Church is run as more of a democracy."

If it's for research that has to be approved by an Institutional Review Board, they will require that you get permission before they approve the proposal. And I think permission might be hard to get. Chain of command, all that jazz. Plus any parents that get wind of it might them boycott the store over feelings of an invasion of privacy.\n\nOther than that, I think it depends on your gender. I mean, it's a toy store. A man lurking in a toy store for three hours looks like a pedophile shopping for victims and might get arrested. A woman isn't nearly as suspicious-looking.\n\nIf you're not going to ask, don't let them catch you taking notes or you might get thrown out. Again, looks very criminal.

I think that the media affects most people negatively.  It depresses me to see the reality of this world.  But the reality of it isn't the media's fault.  It's how life on planet Earth is.

We see racial crimes and police violence.  Respected clergymen and politicians cheat and lie.\n\nOf course, the media does celebrity news, weddings, award shows, county fairs, etc.  But, it seems the negative is more publicized.  Would the media have jobs without it?  It sells.

The bad news for the unbelievers is that the battle has already been won through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.  So even if an Atheist deems he/she ""won"" a battle here in the forum what has it gained them?  They've already lost the war."

Depends on the ex.  When my children were smaller, I would send meals to my ex, because he could not cook and I wanted my children to eat well at their visitations.  Now...he is deceased, I am remarried.  Although I am a nice person, she is VERY VERY VERY nasty...I would be upset, highly upset, were he to spend holidays with her.  His AND mine have chosen to be with us, thank goodness, so I do NOT have to deal with her (she is constantly touching him and trying him).   Like I said, depends on the ex and the circumstances involved.  :(  Sorry I am not more help.  BUT....I would say that if they will not come here (as the step-children my hubby raised will not because their mama tells tales that are untrue)....I have to be honest and say that I would say NO... Stay here or go there and stay there, you cannot have it both ways, baby!   If the kids don't think enough of ME to visit just briefly, then NO.  Obviously the ex has done as this one has done....run off at the mouth and told lies that made you  a curse to the children.  'Course, you can take a quarter and my opinion and still can't make a phone call.    lol  P.S....if they are grown then, at this point, it is not even a FUNCTION of the ex's tales...it is the grown children who are being foolish and I would not stand for it, myself.  AND....I am a nice person, despite what I have said.  But I am in the same spot myself so I can feel for you...and put myself where you are.

Think about it. How do you get a block of liquid caramel into a chocolate bar. You freeze it so that it's solid and then it melts later. \n\nOr, you make the chocolate bar in two parts. The top first because that's little cups. Then you inject drops of caramel into the cups and put the bottom layer of chocolate on. When the bottom layer cools, it naturally becomes a solid chocolate bar.\n\nIt's not that hard to know.

Why do you want one. You can marry somebody old and rich and hope they leave it to you in their will. Thats the closest you will get to one unless you have rich parents. And its Mansion by the way. Good thing I knew what you meant.

"When I was a child, we did not have VCRs.  If we missed a movie in the theater or wanted to see it again later, we had to wait for it to come on TV.  Often, when it did, it was edited to fit a time slot.  I remember waiting once a year to see ""The Wizard of Oz.""  At Easter we waited for ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""Ben Hur.""\n\nWe didn't have video cameras, so if you wanted to record moments like piano recitals and swim lessons, you had to have a movie camera.  I was the only one I knew in my age group who had one.  My grandpa had one and would do these elaborately staged family gatherings to catch us all on film.  He had to set up bright lights, and we all looked artificial and like deer in headlights.\n\nWe didn't have video games.  The first one I remember was ""Pong.""  My cousin had the Atari game system.  We spent hours watching those little white lines move across a grey screen.  Hard to believe now.\n\nWe didn't have cell phones and computers.  I was a little bit of a hold out, but I didn't get my first computer until I was in graduate school.  I couldn't face typing my thesis over and over on my typewriter.  I had a dot matrix printer, which used paper that was perforated and had to be pulled apart.  Our phone was a plain black, rotary dial phone.  We had one.  I got a blue phone of my own when I was in high school.  \n\nI loved records and would buy 45's of the top hits often.  I also bought albums of Barbara Streisand, Jim Croce, and Broadway musicals.  I listened to them all so often that I hardly had an album that wouldn't hiss or skip.\n\nWe hardly ever ate out when I was growing up but we did get ""fast food"" from time to time. We'd have MacDonald's on Friday night while my parents went out and we watched ""The Brady Bunch.""  Sometimes we'd have Kentucky Fried Chicken (it wasn't called KFC) on Sundays after church.\n\nWe go out quite often compared to when I was growing up.  Sometimes with the price of groceries it even works out cheaper to go out.  I don't remember it ever being that way when I was a kid.\n\nWe had one family car when I was growing up.  There weren't any seatbelt laws, and we would all pile into that car.  When I was pretty small that was a VW Bug, and one of us always had to lie down in the little space behind the back seat.  It sat over the engine and was hot.  I remember that we went camping and put a mattress in the back seat and we all rode piled on top of it.\n\nWe didn't have to wear helmets when we went bike riding or roller skating, which we did every day in the summer.  We would stay outside playing in the neighborhood until the street lights came on, and my parents never worried that someone would snatch us or that we wouldn't come home that night.\n\nWe would walk to the movie theater by ourselves and stay all day since they would show the double feature over and over again and you could watch as many times as you like.  No one worried then about when the movie started.  You just showed up whenever, and if you missed the beginning, then you stayed to watch the movie over again.  ""Star Wars"" is the first movie I remember that showed only that one movie and you were told to arrive at the beginning and had to leave after that one showing.  It cost $3.50, which was a lot of money for one movie and one showing, but some of my friends saw it 14 times.\n\nWe were in church every time the doors were open, which were for us, Sunday morning, Sunday night, Wednesday night and various other rehearsals and events.  Now most people I know who go to church go on Sunday morning and then maybe to a small group during the week and an occasional event here and there.  There are many people I know today who have never been to church."

I lived there for 16 years, moved Back to TX last year.\n\nFirst, I cannot imagine what you are comparing rental prices to, but they are not low in Las Vegas.\nHouses to buy, whether new construction or existing  houses are also VERY expensive. We moved because we sold our 1953 (year built) house in a very nice but modest neighborhood, mostly hispanic, for three times what we paid for it. It was very close to downtown and close to the concentration of those elements you don't like. These houses are the lowest priced available  and for many are in an undesireable location. When we sold, our house at very near 200,000 dollars was as cheap as you could buy a decent house of 1200 sq ft any where in the city. Anything costing less would be a destroyed house with crack squatters living in it.\n\nAs far as living there, the culture is very different and employers have NO employee regard. The reason is because there are plenty of people anxious to take your job if you don't like something. \n\nIf you can let all this roll off you, and we could, living there is fun. You can have a real good time just people watching on the strip or downtown. You must use good judgement if you are g oing to gamble, set your limit and stick to it! Remember you are not going to get rich gambling. We called the sale  of our house our jackpot!\n\nThere are many fun things t o do around Las Vegas, Lake Meade, Mt Charleston, you are very near Zion National Park in Utah, very near California, 5hours to LA, \n\nOut in the suburbs life for your children would be fairly normal if you can afford to buy or rent there, check out Green Valley, for starters.\n\nIf you go there, the best to you, enjoy it and keep your good judgement!\n\n\nYou may e-mail me if you have more specific questions.

It sorta depends on how many get sold.  If they nearl sell out they won't go on sale, but if they don't sell so good the price will come down.  Keep an eye on the daily specials at newEgg, they have good prices and are good to deal with.

"Despite what you think, you can tell the difference between Chinese, Japanese and Korean people by hearing them speak.  The Chinese language sounds like the person is ""swishing"" liquid in their mouth. Japanese is very staccato and monotone; they do not stress the syllables in words, and like English the language is very open to ""loanwords"", words borrowed from other languages (eg. ""pan"" for ""bread"", and ""wanpisu"" for ""one piece dress"").  The Korean language is very nasal; it sounds like they speak through their noses (that's no more a criticism of Korean than it is to say Italians speak from their throat and sound vocal).  \n\nYou can also tell the difference between the three written languages, but that's an even longer paragraph.  Ask and I'll change this text to add it in.\n\nMany people will say that Asiatic people look the same; it's partly true and partly false.  Most Caucasians and most Africans look the same in many respects; it takes experience in recognizing facial shapes to know the difference.  I've lived in Asia for years and I can recognize which part of mainland China a Chinese person is from (never mind China or Korea) and I'm white; I couldn't do that in the past.\n\nPart of the problem with differentiating Chinese, Korean and Japanese people is that they are all descended from the same stock of people and there isn't as much variation as it is in Europe; we have mongol, romany, moorish, African and other stock mixed in with caucasian.  (Of course, if you're a young earth cretinist - oops, creationist - and reject human migration from 10000-40000 years ago, it's a different story.)  Koreans are descended from the Chinese, and the Japanese are descended from the Koreans (despite what any of them say; the entire Japanese royal family is descended from Korean, and not from a ""goddess sent from the heavens"").  \n\nKoreans tend to look halfway between Chinese and Japanese, and could be mistaken for either.  I lived there for 2+ years and I never saw anything distinctively ""Korean"" that set them apart.  The Japanese, on the other hand, moved into Japan and intermingled with the Ainu who were there thousands of years before (the Ainu came south from the same stock of people who went east into North America).  Japanese faces tend to be angular and sharply defined (almost like cats), and Chinese faces tend to be rounded and softer.  But given the amount of genetic diversity possible, those are only true at the most basic level.\n\nYou can also tell the Japanese apart (though not Koreans from most Chinese) by mannerisms.  Japanese people think of others first and self second; they are very courteous to strangers.  Confucianist cultures like Korea and China think that strangers don't need to be treated with the same respect as people they know.  A Korean could greet you like a friend when you walk into his or her shop one day and the next day \nbump through you on the street; to them, it's normal.\n\nAmong southeast Asians I really couldn't point out what sets apart each ethnicity (there are waaaayyyy too many, even within Vietnam or Thailand alone) but one characteristic seems true of many (though not all) people from the peninsula, south through Malaysia, Indonesia and out to the Philippines: many people have flatter noses with round tips and nostrils.\n\nThere are some similarities among the Northern Thais, Burmese and Laotians because of the northern mountains keeping the Chinese out.  The Vietnamese have similarities to the Chinese but have sharper chin and cheekbones.  Southern Thais, Malaysians, Indonesians, and Filipinos tend to have darker skin and similar facial shapes across the entire region with differences that reflect foreign interaction (the Chinese in Indonesia, Europeans in the Philippines, etc.)."
"""Hotness"" is very subjective. Every person's tastes differ. Personally, I've always had a bit of a thing for redheads and Asians, but I've been completely struck by a couple women who didn't fall into either category, so easily. Physically, every man can debate whatever physical trait they find aesthetically pleasing, but I think that there's one personality trait that's universal: CONFIDENCE.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing sexier than a truly confident, self-assured woman. One of my ex-girlfriends I dated for three years, and I loved her, but she was so cripplingly, self-deprecating, that it truly ruined our relationship. You can only compliment someone and assure them so many times before you let their negativity destroy you. Apparantly three years was pretty much my limit, and I'll never make that mistake again. If you've got a healthy dose of self-esteem and you exude that (but don't flaunt it to the point of narcissism), we come running."

You just need to look at countries where religious fundementalists have taken over to answer that one. Think about what the teleban were doing in afghanistan. So I think it is very plausible that the same might happen with christian fundies. What worries me more is that it seems to be happening in the country with the most stockpiles of WMDs. America!

I think the difficulty in answering your question is that the term 'gay' is more a form of personal identification than it is of social identification.  If you are physically a man who considers himself a woman, but is attracted to men, he may not consider him/herself gay, because on the inside, he is a female.  Whether or not you're gay or male or female is defined by you and not by society.  Anthropologically speaking, male and female is purely speculative.  If you are unsure who you are or how you view yourself, I would definitely put any sort of surgery on the backburner.  That's one of those mistakes that is not easily remedied.  Just determine what 'gay' means to you, what gender you are and then you'll have your answer.  Furthermore... Remember that if you do determine that you are gay, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.
You certainly don't have to.  I myself think it's better to meet people in real life, anyways.  However, we live in a time when everybody is much more demanding- we want our partners and our friends to be tailored to us- the same hobbies, same likes, perfect compatibility in personalities.  Gone are the days when you met someone different and built a friendship through various experiences and henceforth had a good, reliable buddy- now you find friends based on Myspace groups and so on.  Not that it's a bad thing . . . just different.  Same with online dating- people want someone who is guaranteed to be perfect for them.  I've always felt that if you love a person, and they love you, you will both make it work, because no relationship comes perfect.  They all take work.  Perhaps that's the reason there's so much divorce nowadays; I don't know.  But online dating makes it possible to hand-select a lover by eye color, hair color, weight, height, blood type . . . I joke.  But still.  Goodness gracious.\n\nWe already spend so much time on the computer, it just seems natural to try and find companionship while there- a nice instant messaging box comes up while working on something, and it feels nice and sweet.  It just grows from there.
Number of orphans in Russia has nearly doubled in recent years. In 1994 there were recorded 496,300 of these children as compared to 867,800 as of 1 January 2003. Along with this, only approximately 10% of this overall number of children without parental support became orphans as a result of the death or disablement of the parents; the rest are social orphans.

It's not necessary to categorize your belief unless you want to. All major organized religions are tainted with superstition and mythologies (and tales of suffering and damnation). Your ideology might be more Wiccan, which predates Christianity - maybe you should have a look there. Just a suggestion.
I hate those things too.  If I get one with an RSVP I'll return it declining the invitation.  If not, I just don't go.  If asked I'll simply say I'm not interested in the product or that I have other plans.  I don't get invited to many of these so-called parties anymore.\n\nFace it, if you lose friendships because you don't supplement their income then they weren't really friendships to start with.\n\nIf you feel bad about declining the invitations throw a dinner or cocktail party of your own where you don't expect people to spend money.  It works for me.

Several years ago I had an unusual experience concerning an uncle, a distant relative who lived over a thousand miles away. \n\nWhile driving my car I suddenly felt the unmistakable presence of this relative that I hardly even knew. He was more like someone I had heard about than someone I knew. It was very strange; it felt as though I was momentarily lifted right out of my physical body. I seemed to be suspended somehow beyond space and time, bathed in a love so intense It felt like I could have just disappear into it at any moment if It would have let me. It only lasted for a few seconds, but it seemed to last forever at the same time. I realize how crazy this must sound. The experience was so strong that at first I was afraid I was loosing my grip on reality. I finally managed to chalk it up to an over active imagination.\n\nThree days later I got a call from my aunt telling me that this uncle we are talking about had gone into a coma and died the day I had the experience. It felt like ice water had been poured down my back when she told me this. I had lost any real ideas of God or faith and had become somewhat of an atheist. Needless to say this experience caused me to rethink some of the conclusions I had come to. \n\nI feel blessed to now understand that even in our darkest confusion something loves us so much that it went out of its way to assist me and bring me back to a state of absolute certainty about Gods love for us.\nDuring the experience it seemed like there was a vast amount of information that I was somehow allowed access to. One thing that I came away from this experience understanding beyond any shadow of a doubt was that any Idea that God is unhappy with us or would judge or allow us to be punished for any reason is simply impossible. \n\nI can’t explain the love I felt with words. They simply don’t make words big enough or complete enough to do this. The only way I can begin to convey this love to you is to say that there was simply nothing else there. Nothing but love. No hint of judgment, no displeasure of any sort. It is as though God sees us as being as perfect as we were the day we were created. It is only in our confused idea of ourselves that we seem to have changed.\n\n I hope this is of some help to you. Good luck. Love and blessings. \n\nYour brother don

"If you don't believe in ghosts why are you asking this question? are you just trying to mock someone?\n\nWhen I was 14 I saw my cousin in the bus, he was standing when I noticed him, it was DAYTIME, and not scary at all, he was well dressed, casual. When he saw me, he ran from me, without an expresion on his face, just didn't wanna talk to me. I knew my uncle was looking for him, 'cause he wouldn't come home for almost a month, so I tryied to follow him to find out what was going on, I couldn't catch up. He had just turned 18 years old, jumped off the bus and dissapear. I couldn't see where he went.\nWhen I told my uncle, he called me away from anyone else and asked me if I was sure I saw his son, I answered a very confident ""Yes"". Then he told me it couldn't be possible, and after trying several more times to convince me that it could not be possible, and hear me insisting that I did saw him, when I told him the kind of clothing he was wearing, he finally said;\n""your cousin was found dead two weeks ago, I went to recognize the body and his belongings, he was killed in a fight, and the clothes you just described was what he was wearing the day he was killed"".\nMy uncle added he didn't wanna tell everybody, because he knew how much we loved and admire our cousin, so he kept that from us.\nAfter that he was only seen one more time by one of his brothers, we never knew what was going on on his after life. He never talked to anyone."

Or simply have one engraved...with a special message, etc.   Then I would wrap it up in a pair of boxer shorts that have a Florida-looking type of print (palm trees, sun and sand, ocean,...etc)\n\nHave a great holiday!  ...and congrats!  :o)
Do you have an RA you could talk to to try and mediate with your roomates? Worst comes to worst you can ask for a room transfer but how often do you have to see this guy? If you've talked with the parties involved about their disruptive behavior and got nowhere, or if they are not approchable you may have no choice. Dont ruin your college career over this. The dorm situation is never ideal, but it does not have to be hell.
I agree with you and I don't think the majority of Muslims would support them if they knew the whole story. They weren't arrested for praying. They were arrested for asking for seat belt extensions for no apparent reason and then not using them, as well as doing other suspicious things. Plus what you said about sitting in the 9/11 hijacker seat pattern, allowing them access to both entrances of the plane. They are hiding behind and using our civil rights laws against us. The imams were seeing how far they could push it before they got arrested so they could report back to whoever they're working for to plan for the future. At least this is what Michael Savage says. I don't agree with him on some issues but he seems to be right on about the threat from Muslim extremists.\n\nI haven't read all of it yet but here's an article about this if you're interested:\nhttp://washtimes.com/national/20061129-121812-1240r.htm
"You're right.  We need more discussions and less name-calling.  The best way to persuade is with rational arguments.  Ad hominems are not valid arguments.  Most Christians and atheists would agree and usually don't resort to petty attacks.\n\nAs for ""dissing"" you for your beliefs.  Most atheists don't care what you or anyone else believes.  They do care very much when people try to legislate their beliefs, forcing everyone to abide by irrational superstitions and ancient prejudices.  So long as Christians don't try to tell others what they must and must not believe, most atheists are content to let others be.\n\nYou're right, this is a free country, and we'd like to keep it that way."
Sometimes. But usually people will tell if anything's wrong and compliment if anything's right.
it depends!! i mean on civil matters like marriage, divorce and inheretance it applies for Muslims only. but for offenses (criminal) like Murder, rape, etc. it applies for all. because it's a part of the Law of the land (state law).

"I believe it's always best to be straight-forward (pardon the pun) and up-front with anyone when you decide to take the leap of faith!\n\nExplain that you want to tell them something because you value their love and/or friendship, and that you want no secrets to stand in the way.\n\nComing Out is an individual choice for each and every person that comes out and depends on why you want to come out, what that person means to you, and lots of other factors. And it also depends on who you want to come out to.\n\nDecide why you're telling tehm... for you or for them? Most of us decide to come out for ourselves... to be true to ourselves. But there are 100's of other reasons one might choose to come out.\n\nIf they are asking about your personal life... such as who you're dating or interested in, then that may be a reason to tell them. If someone is hitting on you, perhaps it's time to tell him/her.\n\nBut in the end, it's totally up to you. Some of us feel better not having any secrets in our lives, especially about who we love.\n\nCheck out some of the Coming Out resources listed below. And you may want to purchase ""Now That You Know,"" a great resource for parents and friends of GLBT folks that they can read afterwards and find that many of their feelings are shared by many other folks after a loved one has come out to them.\n\nNot to scare you, but some folks do not react well to being told their loved one is gay. Reassure them that you are the same person that they've always loved. Allow them time to adjust.\n\nComing out is never easy, but to me, it was well worth it!\n\nThe best of luck to you!"
This is a scam....you should never give anyone your bank account information.  If this woman really wants to leave you money, she can write a check or get a money order.  If you give this guy your bank information, he will clean out your checking account and be gone. Do not do it!!
Because we don't want to.  People think that mistakes are just that, mistakes.  Mistakes are bad, and if you make a mistake, you are not a good person.  Why should a person admit that they are a bad person?  That's our thinking.  Mistakes are not to be made if we were better, but what people don't realize is that the only way to get better is to learn from making the mistakes that we make.

I'm not a fan of Suicide Girls. The models are not paid and the site owners are profiting big time. Meanwhile, these women are left with their half-naked bodies plastered on the internet and nothing to show for it but Suicide Girls underwear and a membership. That, I think, is degrading to an extent. \n\nBesides that, I don't feel nude modeling is wrong. It's a woman's choice if she would like to remove her clothing for the camera. Why be ashamed of your body?

Worth it for what?\n\nIf your intention is to have a fantastic night of no-strings attached sex, then it can definitely be worth it.  It can also suck (when you're with a stranger, you can't guarantee they'll be a good lover), but you'll probably end up with a sexual release.\n\nIf your intention is anything else, well, then why are you seeking it in a one night stand?  I doubt it will fulfill it- not to mention that one night stands often leave people feeling empty, alone, and shameful.  Some people love them and feel no ill effects; most people want some type of intimacy and affection with their sex, or at least some connection and find one night stands lacking.\n\nIt depends on what you want out of it.  Be careful, use protection, and act wisely.

I don't think so. God didn't want people uniting to try to defeat Him. He knows the anti-christ will come, and he knows when. Until then, we, Christians, are to go unto all nations and share the Gospel. The point is people aren't supposed to be doing things that take their minds off God.

"I too started to learn Spanish as a second language and I was terrified of making a mistake. I actually lived in Venezuela for 8 months and hardly spoke any, mostly listened (I had a translator too). But then I came back to the States and started to just use the words that I had learned from listening. Yes, it can be embarrasing, but the Spanish culture is very different from American and they are very nice about helping you to learn. They are unlikely to laugh at you. They may laugh with you, but never at you. My grammar is still all messed up, but with practice, it is easy to learn more and more. And they are usually happy to help you learn more, or how to say it correctly.\n\n(Also watch it because a word in English can have many meanings and does not directly translate in Spanish the same. For example they have no differientiation between ""do"" and ""make"" - they use the same basic word. What I mean is they tell you what it means, use it in that way, and dont assume that it has other definitions, as it would in English)\n\nGood luck!!!"

"No.\n\nHumans war because humans are violent, competetive creatures. They fight each other DESPITE religion, not BECAUSE of it. If they DO fight ""because"" of their religion, this is just one of the many things people fight over, and in its absence they probably would've found something else to fight over.\n\nSome hard evidence for you is that there are and have been many societies that are NOT monotheistic, but war frequently. One example is feudal Japan, which was in a state of constant warfare for centuries before any monotheistic religion was introduced. We're talking serious, constant warfare between ""nobles"" in which great armies of men died, and this went on for centuries. Ancient Greece/Rome also warred without any monotheism in their culture. We also see tribal warfare among tribes who worship multiple spirits/gods. There are many other examples- these are only a few."

Charity is the opposite of justice.  Hold on... don't thumbs-down me yet!  Let me explain...\n\nBy definition, charity is 'selfless love'.  It manifests in a number of ways.  Most commonly, it is seen in the form of helping other people who need the help.  Why would someone do something like that?  Because they care about other people - even those they may not know.  It's not about the giver.  It's about the recipient.\n\nJustice is about doing exactly what is fair.  The unfortunate had a tough break, but then they ran the same chances that most of us do.  Is it fair to give help to someone JUST because they're unfortunate?  That's like distributing aid randomly.  It's not even vaguely fair.\n\nNow I'm not saying that justice is a bad thing nor that charity is a bad thing.  In this regard, I'm much more Aristotlean.  If we had a system of strict and unyielding justice, someone who broke into a house to save someone's life would be charged with a crime.  If we had a system of strict and unyielding charity, nobody would be charged with any crime whatsoever.  Obviously a balance is much more desirable.\n\nIf you love SOME people selflessly, they will abuse and destroy it.  On the other hand, the right kind of charity can provide returns a hundredfold.  They are BOTH good.  But not exclusively.

I think at least some conspiracy theories are just too incredible to be believed.  I have no source from which I can quote, except to say that there is a general and increasing disrespect for authority of all kinds.  This may in part be due to our believe that those authorities must be hiding something from us.  I think ever since the JFK assassination in particular, it has been open season on authority.  Government are, of course not going to give credence to any of these CTs, but their taciturnity only makes the CTists want to shout louder.  It's a vicious circle in which conspiracy theories will only get more bizarre and extreme.

"Black magic is casting negative emotions on someone. One can get rid of it. It is explained further in the explanation of spiritual meditation-\n\nAs one proceeds higher on the Spiritual plane ... one becomes more and more conscious of the living being inside ... our Atman the soul within ... hypnotism, hypnotic state are not the least related to the field of Spirituality. The practitioners of hypnotism fall under the category of ... Magic ... Black Magic ... medical treatment of patients where there is no choice left but to hypnotize the patient into a particular state of mind to get the actual facts of life. Sometimes, hypnotism is also used on culprits to get the truth out.\n\n\nIn Meditation ... there is nothing like a trance state ... one is all the more conscious when in deep Meditation ... it is only at the pinnacle of Meditation that one comes face-to-face with God ... how can then it be that one is in a trance and yet facing God. In deep Meditation one gets more concentrated in the thought pattern ... all thoughts related to the materialistic life get washed away and what is left is thoughts pertaining to Spiritual upliftment only.\n\n\nBefore we discuss more on the matter ... we need to understand the actual meaning of word Meditation ... Meditation is the English word for Yoga. and what is Yoga? Yoga in Hinduism means trying to create synthesis between Atman the soul within and the Parmatman (God, the Almighty Creator).\n\nEvery Atman the soul within ... on its cosmic journey tries to establish a contact with the Creator ... this is what we are doing while offering Prayers to God Almighty Creator ... in a way Prayers are also a form of Yoga. Why is it necessary for an Atman the soul within ... to try establishing a contact with the God, the Almighty Creator?\n\n\nRight from the first manifestation as an amoeba to the last ... the form of a human being ... the only goal for the Atman the soul within is attaining Liberation from the cycle of Birth and Death. This is just not possible without the grace of God. Every human being ... a true seeker of Spirituality meditates ... yet, we do not meditate on the center of a bulb but these instruments only act as a medium for us to concentrate our energies in trying to establish a contact with the Creator.\n\n\nThe dialogues of Plato are nothing else but a form of Meditation. He tried to logistically weave out all that he and his associates considered as false ... once we weed out all that is untrue ... what remains is only the absolute truth. This is nothing else but practicing Neti ... the method utilized by Maharishi Ramana to gain Self Realization ... in the process of Neti negate all that is not God ... saying not this, not this ... and what finally remains is a face-to-face dialogue with God.\n\n\nIn Hindi, Yoga is derived from the word ""yog"". As two plus two equals four ... in Hindi we call it two yog two equals four. The effort of the Atman soul to combine with Parmatman ... the effort of the soul ... to assimilate with God, the Almighty Creator is what we know as Yoga ... that is Meditation. Most of the people I have come across in life have indicated that they have been long practicing Meditation. When asked, how do they practice Meditation ... most replied that they sat in a dark room and concentrated on the center of a small lit bulb. Is that all to what Meditation is all about?\n\n\nPeople have been sitting in this posture not for months but have spent many years ... yet, they do not feel satisfied with the results. I am surprised to observe what kind of benefit they expected out of sitting in a dark black room doing nothing. Yoga (Meditation) means resolving all queries within us ... dissolving them forever ... and by the process of Neti ... not this, not this ... what ultimately remains is one to one dialogue with God.

Or even better- write your own!\n\nA few I've found and liked- on the site squidge.org, I found a great story about Ryan Stiles and Colin Mochrie having an intimate secret moment on Whose Line Is It Anyways?, and on colbertnation.com, there's a fantastic, funny (albeit short) tale of Stephen Colbert oil wrestling and heating things up with, of all people, Bill O'Reilly.  Just a couple I've found.\n\nGood luck!
My husband has to work the day after thanksgiving and it's a diesel truck repair shop.\nI myself do not have to work then or ever on weekends, i'm a substitute teacher..........there is no school on weekends or holidays...........that, my friend, is the ONLY benefit of being a substitute teacher.\nThe pay sucks.\nThe job can really suck, you know, how'd you treat your subs?\nBeing called to work at 5am sucks.\nNever knowing what comes next, that can suck.\nWalk a mile in my shoes...\nDon't get me wrong, I love the flexibility and the never having to work weekends or holidays.\nThanks for asking.
Jesus said render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's, and unto God that which is Gods,\nat that time a picture of Caesar was on the money, to day a picture of a president is on the money,\nis it really that important that in god we trust is on money? even if they took it off there would still be a lot of money in circulation with in god we trust on it.\ndoesn't it seem silly that the words in god we trust can upset so many people? are they afraid that if they see the phrase in god we trust, too many time that they will actually start to trust in god?

there's a really good lady called christine, she lives in the toxteth area - a good way of getting her contact details would be to maybe go to the spiritulist church near to Lark Lane.  Or even go to one of their special nights when they have visiting psychics - they're not spooky or anything lol!!  infact its a really good night out!! hehe!\n\nDerek Acorah used to have an office on Bold Street years ago - you had to book months in advance - i dont know if he still does that.\n\nAlso the central pub opposite central station used to have really good psychics every week - they used to use a room upstairs - give them a call to see if they still do it\n\nhopefully you should find one with the above info - my mother-in-law is a psychic but she doesn't practice or i'd give you my contact details!!\n\ngood luck
Well, reading over your question (and unable to read a line of it due to it having been censored out with stars), it seems to me that you are mixing up sexual feelings with outside life.\n\nYou say 'what causes one to have these feelings of hatred towards a certain gender?'.  You know better than me of how you feel, but is it really a hatred of men that you have?  Wanting to sexually torture or humiliate another person doesn't mean anything outside the bedroom!  Now, there are people who are sadists throughout their entire lives, and there are those who keep it only sexual.  Moreover, even those who are sadists in all aspects of their lives may absolutely respect and love those who are the recipients of their sadism.  The point I'm trying to make, I guess, is that it's doubtful you actually hate men- you say you love your boyfriend- it's something else going on with your sadism.\n\nThere's a lot that makes control enjoyable and sexual.  Torturing (and I use that as a relative term- a little whipping, etc.) is a demonstration of your ability to have control, to roleplay in that way, possibly to have some control if you feel you don't have any in the other parts of your life.  Or it can just get you hot.  There are a lot of connections between sex and pain- both are intense physical and emotional sensations.  Both show how much the body can take and how it reacts.  A lot of people dabble in it- from a sexy little pinch, to a slap on the tush during lovemaking.\n\nI'd also remind you that sadism doesn't equal inhumanity.  There are also masochists- people who love to get what sadists dish out.  And you might want to check out some BDSM literature to see if how you feel checks out with traditional definitions- a lot of being a sadist, at least the way it is defined today, is loving and taking wonderful care of your 'slave'- pain is a good part of an overall relationship.\n\nOf course, whether you want to let your boyfriend in on this or keep it as a fantasy is up to you, although a lot of men get turned on by a woman who takes control in the bedroom or even of being submissive.  But maybe tone it down a bit the first time.\n\nGood luck, and don't worry, you aren't alone!  This is very normal!
"Anton Szandor LaVey was born April 11, 1930 and was the founder and High Priest of Church Of Satan.\nOn April the 30 1966 LaVey proclaimed the opening of Church of Satan.\nLaVey pointed out that ""calling it a Church enabled me to follow the magic formula of one part outrage to nine parts social respectability that is needed for success. But the main purpose was to gather a group of like-minded individuals together for the use of their combined energies in calling up the dark force in nature that is called Satan. Of course LaVey pointed out to anyone who would listen that the Devil to him and his followers was not the stereotyped fellow cloaked in red garb, with horns and a tail, holding a pitchfork ready to nail sinful humans who are following their true instincts. \n\nOn 29 October 1997, Dr. Anton Szandor LaVey died of a heart attack. He was 67 years old.\nHis daughters Karla and Zeena, and his son Xerxes. Following his cremation, Karla LaVey was appointed as High Priestess of the Church of Satan."

If I was paying\n-------------------\nI'd feel pretty bad that I couldn't find a girl who you don't have to pay for. My confidence would be low. This is a guess but I'd never go to a prostitute.\n\nIf I was paid for sex\n-------------------------\nWell, I'd feel happy because obviously I'd say yes only to a pretty girl (whose uninfected with anything nasty) so on top of scoring with a pretty girl with no strings attached, I'd get money for it as well. Also it would mean that she is really wanting me so badly that she'd pay up for me.

Two stories:\n\nMy twins were born 12 weeks early, and spent 9 weeks in the neonatal unit. It had a corridor & lots of glass-sided, brightly-lit cubicles. I used to go in every day, and just sit with them. I dreaded going in in the morning, because I never knew what I'd be told; that one of them had a problem, or was having to have some new procedure. \n\nOne morning, as I arrived, I looked down the corridor and saw two big lights in one of the cubicles. They were in the shape of angels, kneeling, with wings, like you see in a churchyard, but blazing bright. I tried to keep my eyes on them, but all the panes of glass & lights distorted them, and by the time I got there they'd vanished. My twins' cots had been moved round, and the angels had been over them, I'm sure. I knew then that the babies would be alright. Yes, it was my imagination, my mind; I suppose.\n\nSecondly, and on a lighter note:\nI saw a tall cactus in someone's front garden. It was growing out of a rockery, and was so big - I love cacti, and was amazed it had done so well, outside, in the UK. I went home and told my husband, and when we were out the next day, he agreed to do a detour so he could see it. It was a folded-up rotary dryer, with a green cover over it.

The government can not control taxes on it. It can be homegrown just as moonshine use to be illegal in the old days but the gov't soon found a way to use that to there benefit and voila taxes appeared on it. The government can't keep an eye on all the farmers who grow a little for themselves so what else is there to do but consider it illegal....\nNotice how cocaine and heroin still seems to slip through the cracks of society that's because the big brother looks the other way sometimes...

"You will find ""peace"" at death. Don't be afraid of that, it's simply the graduation from the physical into the nonphysical. Completely natural and completely inevitable. It has been said by wise men from time immemorial that ""if you're happy you don't know what's going on"". That's as true now as it has always been, actually maybe more so given the violent state of mans affairs at this time. So don't be consumed with the search for peace. Be consumed instead with searching for the laws of God which are written in the hearts of every creature in creation. It is within you, (as Jesus and hundreds of others have said) hidden from the uncleaness of personal greed and mans cruelty to man. It can be discovered by any who will search, ANY, period! But you must begin by putting the darkness of the so-called ""churches"" away from you. And unfortunately that's the most difficult part of the journey toward godliness and the part that stops most seekers. We are so indoctrinated with the mistakes perpetuated by the church that for most of us it is all but impossible to accept the timeless wisdom. There are few who can even accept this basic truth so have no hope of going any farther. The quest for higher knowledge is timeless, it's universal, it has no name, and it is dormant within every person born into this dimension. It requires only wakening by searching for facts based upon facts, not dogma, and it surpasses organized ""religion"" as a skyscraper surpasses a birdhouse. It's message is even concealed in almost everything around us, learn what to look for, you'll never go back once you've set your foot on the path. Believe me!!!"

If you think about it, since we do all of our work with existing materials and spaces, we are not able to create anything without destroying something else. If we build a house, we have destroyed an open space in the place we built our house. If we use wood to build a house, we have destroyed a tree to get the wood.  It is impossible for us to make anything without un-making (or drastically altering) some other thing as part of the same process.  But since we are capable of thinking about our choices, we should always pause when we have an idea to build something, while we decide whether the accompanying destruction will be worthwhile.\nI don't mean for this to sound so lofty, idealistic and unreal.  It is a simple, often overlooked truth. Everything that a human can take as food is a thing that was once living, with very few exceptions, notably milk and honey. Destruction goes hand in hand with creation. Our mistake is in focusing on one, but not acknowledging the other.

"You're a REAL Christian.  It's foolish to say you believe in the ""Word of God"" when you disregard the Gnostic texts; these texts were deliberately removed in 325 AD.  It was the removal of these texts (which are now known as apocrypha) that helped secure the Church's authority over all spirituality, and therefore, over all life.\n\nThose who disrespect the apocrypha are to be pitied, for they've been brainwashed by church propaganda."
"The fact that people don't question what they are told.  They say they think about it, but they think about from the perspective that they have been taught is the ""true"" perspective.  As long as the idiot who makes a statement can even remotely back it up with a bible verse, it doesn't matter what he says."
Get of your self rightous high horse and stop to realize that in order to learn, one must ask questions. You were not born educated in the word of God. You I'm sure asked many questions when you were wanting to learn about God. Where did you misplace your humility.\n\nIt's an attitude like yours that runs off the lost soul who is seeking out God's truth, and their salvaion through His truth. If they percieve all Chrsitians to spout off like you just did, they would not want to become a Chrisitan for fear of becoming like someone like you. And who could blame them?\n\nYou not only must obtain knowledge through the word of God, but you must adopt those very words into your being and behave as an ambassador of God. What you said in your post was ugly and rude and not the way God wants us to teach others.\n\n Proverbs 15:33 The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour is humility \n\nDid it ever occur to you that other people may be getting spiritually fed from the answers that are given to those who ask questions that you feel are not worthy of yoru time to answer them?

"He's your little brother, so it is understandable that you should be concerned for him. The best way for you to handle it, as everyone here has said, it to let him be himself and love him no matter what. And be sure to let him know that you love him no matter what. If your brother IS gay, he might feel alone and the last thing you'll want is for him to think his family rejects him. If he is gay, he will tell you in his time; but in the mean time you can make some off-handed comments in front of him that drops little hints that you don't ""have a problem with gay people"". If he knows he can trust you and that you won't reject him, it will be easier for him to come out to you if he is gay and it will help him to have support while he is enduring rejection from society. I can't tell you how many tens of thousands of gay men have disastrously married women for fear that they would be rejected by their family if they found out they were gay. I receive MANY letters from married gay men who can no longer keep up the charade with their wives but fears hurting them by leaving them to be who they truly are. No one should be kept in a prison like that. It is so destructive. \n-Rev. Jim Cunningham\nwww.GayChristianSurvivors.com"

read a story about that?  During the war those tall mountains were a death trap to the oposition.  But to those people it was home.  They are great on ski's and went up and down with no problem.  They start out on ski's as infants.  Know how to camoflauge against the snow and would jump out of nowhere and kill the oposition and then escape back into obsurity.\nWho survived left and refused to go back and that kept them out of a major conflict.  It was real interesting.  They came to the conclusion those mountains were inpenatrateable.  Yet, the ones who grew up there for generations had no problems at all getting around.  Their eyes had grown accustomed to seeing there.

They're probably very conservative. Yes a man can suck his wife's breast whether she is pregnant, non-pregnant or breastfeeding. It's quite normal. Go ahead you are not behaving in a bad way at all. It is probably too private a question for some of their feeble brains mate.
Serve God by doing what Jesus would do. Is masterbation a sin, if it involves lust then yes. Jesus said whoever looks at a women to lust after her has commited adultery with her in his heart. Obviously every man struggles with it. But its better to mess up and confess you are wrong, then say nothing wrong with it. Of course you need to overcome it, because it is an addiction and the body will never become satisfied. Just remember we will face God one day. So its best you do what you conscience tells you.

As for India being more populated than China i don't know although they don have this ban on having more than one child in China, don't they! I don't know what this will mean in 50 years but one thing for sure .. It's going to take a lot of hard work to get everyone to agree!

79 years old... and some more info....\n\n\nJoseph Alois Ratzinger was born on 16 April, Holy Saturday, 1927 at Schulstraße 11, his parents' home in Marktl am Inn, an area of Germany. He was baptized the same day. He was the third and youngest child of Joseph Ratzinger, Sr., a police officer, and Maria Ratzinger (née Peintner). His mother's family was originally from South Tyrol. Pope Benedict XVI's brother, Georg Ratzinger, a priest and former director of the Regensburger Domspatzen choir, is still alive. His sister, Maria Ratzinger, who never married, managed Cardinal Ratzinger's household until her death in 1991. Their great-uncle was the German politician Georg Ratzinger.\n\n\n\nPope Benedict XVI (Latin: Benedictus PP. XVI; Italian: Benedetto XVI), born Joseph Alois Ratzinger on April 16, 1927 in Marktl am Inn, Bavaria, Germany) is the 265th and reigning Pope of the Roman Catholic Church, and as such, Sovereign of the Vatican City State.[1] He was elected on April 19, 2005 in a papal conclave, celebrated his Papal Inauguration Mass on April 24, 2005, and took possession of his cathedral, the Basilica of St. John Lateran, on May 7, 2005. Pope Benedict XVI has both German and Vatican citizenship. He succeeded Pope John Paul II, who died on April 2, 2005.

"The principals of Stage Magic are the same today as they were centuries ago. They have a text from the days of the Inquisition, written by a stage magician of then, explaining the tricks, and how they were entertainment, and not powers of the Devil. Being accused of Witchcraft, and consorting with the Devil, was a real danger for a stage magician at that time. The things it describes from then, are the same as they are today.\n\nMisdirection, and Optical illusions. All the same. Making you look Where the magician wants you to look, and not where he doesn't want you to look, and fooling the eye into thinking it sees, what it really isn't seeing...\n\nThese are the same tools used by all, and used fo hundreds of years...Chris Angel just puts it into a more ""Heavy Metal"" package, and gives it a really different spin, but it's still the same stuff.

well i would have to say that i'm not so sure, i know that i do and so does my brother and just about my whole family.

Although I am Jewish, I work for a Christian agency, so the rules are also Christian. We do have Jewish individuals, & I generally get called on to interact with them, as I understand the culture/customs. \nTo me, misusing G-d's name also involves having religious bumper stickers on your car while driving like you're late!

It's called freedom of speach. If you are affraid of how people may answer your questions, then don't ask any.
He has no body, nor shape, that is why He has no creator. Male and female concept has come because in English or any Western language due to teachings of the Bible there is a tendency to refer God as He which is wrong. The fact that it is a mistake is realized very recently when a letter has been circulated from the Pope that all the prayers are to be corrected and God should never be referred as a male or He. Hindus are very clear since the days of Vedanta and the Veda i.e. at least 30,000 years or before that God has no physical body and His manifestation is the Nature which is visible and the invisible part is much much bigger, the ever expanding Universe.
"Okay, here's the long answer:\n\nFirst, I think people's gender attraction falls somewhere along a scale, with the two extreme ends being people who cannot perform at all with someone of the same gender, or on the other end, the opposite gender. I think most people fall somewhere between the two... but often, how people *act* on their mingled attractions is very different than them just *having* said attractions.\n\nAlso, it *can* take a long time for someone who is bi to admit it to themselves, because it's not socially accepted much at this point. It's even harder for male bis than females, in this.\n\nYour friend may be bi, or she may be lesbian. Point is, does it matter? It's a friend, right? So be friends. And as for your worry that YOU are the 3rd person... well, why not try the novel approach of being straight up and honest with her? :D Look her in the eye and say something like ""Hey, I've been getting the feeling that maybe you're attracted to girls as well as guys, and since you won't tell me who the 3rd girl is, I suspect it might be me. So, I'm just gonna put this on the table: you're my friend, and you'll always be my friend---but for me, I can't be anything more than just a friend... I'm just not attracted to other girls. But if you are, that's fine.""\n\nIf she's a real friend, she'll respect your honesty---especially if you say all that in a friendly, caring, confident way, rather than acting all nervous.\n\nJust be yourself, be honest and caring, and see what happens. It's the best that any of us can do.\n\n(And yes, I'm bi, tho' most of my attraction is for males; and it took me a lot of years to get past cultural conditioning to admit that there were a few women out there I was physically attracted to enough to wish to do something with them.) :)"
The message of this book is basically to declare the impartiality of God. God plays no favorites. The word of Amos is that we are dealing with a God of righteousness who will not compromise in His ways, and yet, God is a God of patience and of love. Amos is called the prophet of social justice, the man who demanded that man treat their fellow-man rightly. In short he condemns people and nations who treat others like crap. The prophet's word is that because we are people of God, this does not mean that God's word does not sit in judgment on the wrong in our lives.
Me too i work in a news agents and im working all over xmas but luckily not xmas day. We were given the choice whether we wanted to open xmas day or not and we chose NO. If people haven't got what they want by then its tough luck. I have worked on xmas day a few times in previous years and i just found people un-grateful and still moaned about things. And when it came to lock up time they were banging on the door saying they only wanted a few bits and could we let them in (forgetting we had a family and a xmas to go and enjoy). Three most popular items xmas day are fags, booze and batteries.\nAny way merry xmas to every one (bit early i know)

He's an old grouchy German dude who just happens to be the Pope.  Not only does he still wear the hat, but he'll sooo whip your shiny white with it if you get any funny ideas about that overhand, Mister.\n\nKeep in mind, God prefers Cricket, so he may kind of doze off while the Pope is playing Tennis.  I doubt the Pope gets an unfair advantage because of this unless he was going to get sneaky and cheat. But I kind of think God would know anyways.\n\nUnless, of course, the wind is just right.  Then the hat could be an advantage to itself, much like a sailboater's sail!  Get a little Pontifical Patewear action going in there and he could really go, I bet!  Hmmmm.....\n\nI'll just have to say 'I don't know anything for sure, but the Pope does still wear the hat while playing tennis.'  Hope I cleared some stuff up for you there.\n\n~Morg~

The thing that is so great about america is that you can decide what you want to particapate in and do. If you don't want to celebrate thanksgiving don't then, the holiday police aren't going to come after you. but think about the idea of thanksgiving, people comming together and being thankful for what they have, without buying presents or anything like that. Give thanksgiving a try, it is a great holiday!
Sorry to hear that but you need to let her go if she is doing the exact same thing again. Second chances are deserved by everyone but for her to do it again just means she has no love for you and no respect for your feelings because if she did she would have been truthful instead of sneaking off to get something on the side..\nIt hurts to be let down...wasting time denying the inevitable is not fair to yourself. Move on and keep hope in the fact there is someone out there who will respect and love you it takes time but you will  find her.

I have wondered this same thing.  There is a lot of junk I would love to be able to return to sender!  I emailed Yahoo a while back asking this, but I never got an answer.  Hope someone can tell us.
No, it's not. If it's been in your freezer unwrapped and in it's original plastic coating, my suggestion is to throw it away and buy a new one. Even cooked and frozen turkey after a year will probably be freezer burned adn won't taste good. Buy a new one. Good luck.\n(after 26 years of marriage and many many thanksgiving turkeys...please don't cook that old bird)

Lot's of people here who ask questions are really not looking for honest answers. Rather, they are just looking for people who aggree with their point of view. If you don't agree with them, they turn nasty. It's a shame.

according to the bible .. yes it is\ni am not christian and do not believe it is bad at all \nbut my answer is not the one you need xx

The only ones I know of are Jainism, some forms of Buddhism, Satanism, and Humanists (for those who consider humanism a religion).  Animism might be considered atheistic, I'm not sure about it.
I dunno, about that. There is a lot of agreement amongst us, but there are also a great amount of differences too. There are even Republican atheists if you can believe that. Also don't forget about the Raelians and most Buddhists..they are technically atheists too, but have came to very different conclusions.
Most religious systems are controlled by men. So that is their reason for not liking this, power and control is threatened. The other women who voice the same thing have identified with their 'oppressor', the men, and parrot the same attitudes.\n\nWatch me get some thumbs down for this one.
Of course because our death time is destiny,\nAnd God made destiny,\nSo, he of course knows!!!\nI think if you were a good person he'll let you know.

"Wha? Biologically a girl becomes a woman when she starts menstrating.

"First, the fighting in Ireland is not between Catholics and Protestants.  It is between people who want to remain part of Britian, and those who want independence.  The majority of those who want to remain part of England are members of the English church.  While those who want indepence are mre often cathlic (non-Church of England).  But the fightings is not religion based.  It is entirely political.\n\nAs to why fighting happens between people who claim to worship the same God, it happens for the same reason that any war does.  The people involved have difference they can not settle any other way.  Sometimes they actually are about religion.  Most often they are about land (who gets Israel) or power (who rules Ireland) or money (who get the oil).  Religion is simply a good motivator to get people into a fight that they might not do otherwise (They will kill to get rid of ""insert religion"" fanatics before they will kill to get oil)\n\nWhy does God permit it?  If you mean permit as in support or encourage it, he doesn't.  War between his people is a sin, and those who deliberate stir up should fights will be punished for it in the end.\n\nIf you mean permit, as in why does he not stop it...I would ask you how?  If when Hitler and Nazis had first started their march on Europe, God had come through with a death angel and struck them all down, can you imagine that uproar there would have been against him?  Many would have been calling God evil and murderous for slaughtering thousands of innocents.  Look at all the charges leveled against God for his actions against Pharoah in the days of Moses, with the ten plagues.  All intended to stop the murder, enslavement and abuse of nearly 3 million people.  But seen by many as an evil act.\n\nGod has stopped wars in the past.  He has used plagues to take down armies.  He has used natural disasters to wipe out evil nations.  He has used revolts and riots to take out unjust rulers and governments.  He has used armies to stop evil and aggression.  He can and will use whatever force is needed.\n\nBut he most often uses the power of love, help, support, giving, and good to change lives rather then destroy them.  To bring peace, not war.  That is the only way that will work."
"""By faith he (Abraham) lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise; for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God"" (Hebrews 9:9-10) ""For I am a stranger with You, a sojourner like all my fathers"" (Psalm 39:12)"

Read Leviticus 11\n\nIf you don't have a bible at home use this website   http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2011%20;&version=31;\n\nGod told the Israelites what animals He approved of them eating. Science is just now learning the whys and wherefores. Most of the creatures listed as unclean have high levels of colesterol which leads to heart disease. Many have diseases that are only just now being controlled by vaccines and medicines. These dietary laws were given to prevent the people from eating food that might harm them.\nAnd it goes back long before the book of Leviticus.\nWhen the animals were going into the ark they were already listed as clean or unclean by God so this is not just something to be discarded because Jesus came to earth.\nSee  Genesis 7, a lot of people miss this point. There were seven of the clean animals and only two of unclean. So, God classified the animals long before Moses was born.  These are not superfluous words such as were written telling people they could only walk so far on the Sabbath, and they shouldn't light a fire. Those rules (I don't call them laws because they were written by sadducees) were not from God but from men who foolishly thought they could work their way into heaven.  There is a big difference between manmade law and Gods laws.\n\nMany people use the experience of Peters' vision to say it's okay to eat everything. But Peter explained that vision as meaning all people were clean and it was acceptable to socialise with them. He NEVER  interpreted that vision as actually cleansing all animals.\n\nWhat's more, people who say that vision means all animals are clean are two faced in that they don't normally eat oppossum, skunk, snakes, rats, mice.  SO, you see even they still make some of their own distinction between clean and unclean.\n\nREST MY CASE.........

"There are no other Gospels that weren't included in the Bible.  \n\nThere are numerous heretical, gnostic ""gospels,"" which as Paul says, ""...a different gospel, which is not really another one...""  (Galatians 1:6-7)\n\nThese pseudepigraphia have been completely discredited, and they add nothing of value to the Christian walk.  Most were written several generations, or even centuries, after the original Gospel writers died."
Yep, god is responsible for all suffering and evil. The Bible even says that god created evil. Nice snake/Satan analogy.
This is where I have said, you need to walk in someone elses shoes before judging that person. It's between her and GOD, not what we think. Yes, it's wrong and I could not do it, but I'm not going to hate that person or get on her case if she was raped and really wanted to go through with it.
Just tell her you enjoy her company but would rather not talk religion with her. It is something personal to you and you would be more then willing to discuss other things, like your kids.
"The actions and ablutions that accompany the obligatory prayers changes based on the prayer (there are three obligatory prayers - one of which needs to be said every day).  What is consistent across the board is that there is a need to do ablutions - washing one's hands and face - before saying the prayer.  Almost everything else is different.  Finally, we are told there is a wisdom to these actions that is not obvious.\n\nShort obligatory prayer:\n1.  Perform ablutions\n2.  Face toward Baha'u'llah's burial site in Akka Israel.\n\nMedium obligatory prayer:\n1.  ""Whoso wisheth to pray, let him wash his hands, and while he washeth, let him say""\n2.  ""And while washing his face, let him say""\n3.  ""Then let him stand up, and facing the Qiblih (Point of Adoration, i.e., Bahji, 'Akká), let him say""\n4.  ""Let him, then, bend down, with hands resting on the knees, and say""\n5.  ""Then, standing with open hands, palms upward toward the face, let him say""\n6.  ""Let him, then, be seated and say""\n\nLong Obligatory Prayer\nThe number of things to list for the long obligatory prayer is quite long.  This list of the action required in order is below:\n\nLet him then kneel, and bowing his forehead to the ground, let him say:\n\nLet him then stand and say:\n\nLet him again raise his hands in supplication, and say:\n\nLet him then raise his hands, and repeat three times the Greatest Name. Let him then bend down with hands resting on the knees before God -- blessed and exalted be He -- and say:\n\nLet him then stand and raise his hands twice in supplication, and say:\n\nLet him then raise his hands thrice, and say:\n\nLet him then kneel and, bowing his forehead to the ground, say:\n\nLet him then seat himself and say:\n\nLet him then stand erect and say:\n\nLet him then repeat the Greatest Name thrice, and bend down with hands resting on the knees, and say:\n\nLet him then rise and say:\n\nLet him then repeat the Greatest Name thrice, and kneel with his forehead to the ground, and say:\n\nLet him then raise his head, and seat himself, and say:\n\n- Baha'u'llah, Prayers and Meditations by Baha'u'llah, p. 322"

This problem you speak of just about wrecked me when I was a nurse. I turned to drugs for a while to deaden the pain I took on from these people I dealt with. That is NOT the answer of course!\n\nI find taking a lot of time to myself when I need it helps. But the separation of ourselves from the sufferer is so subtle, so delicate. We must be connected enough to help and yet protect ourselves. I practice the 'That's your pain, not mine' mantra but I still feel it somewhat. I just don't take it with me when we part. \n\nI will email you about this and expound when I have my thinking cap on and can gather my thoughts.

Dharma is the sustaining base for the creatures born out of the Nature. When knowledge is not developed living beings endowed with intelligence live by belief or faith. To that extent, Dharma is religious belief by which the society is sustained.  But otherwise its meaning is universal and expanse. It can not be separated from the Truth; but the Truth does not reveal once and for all. Hence, Hinduism is a Dharma which is Revelation of the Truth and by that manifested aspect of Dharma people have been living for last how many millenia has not been recorded in history. Hinduism is a way of experimented living with Truth as its basis. It is hence, is an eclectic culture besides a faith supported by science.\n\nI fully agree with what another learned answerer (rav 142857) has said that Dharma is derived from the root word 'Dhri' that upholds the 'Praja' those born of Prakriti or the Nature. Principles of Hinduism uphold the entire mankind by protecting the Nature who is worshipped as the Primordial Mother that has given birth to every thing in the infinite Universe.
I would go back to three days ago before my fiance's mother passed away, and thank her for the flowers she got me. we had a misunderstanding and she came to my home to apologize with flowers, i never said thank you, or I'm sorry and now she passed away and i will never get a chance to.

eh... for me all I have to do is picture sleeping with a man or picture sleeping with a woman (when you are not horny or in the act of sex) in a regular situation and the choice is obvious.  It just depends on whether you are only sexually/physically attracted to women and whether you would rather have a relationship with women than men.  For myself I could never be with a man sexually or relationship wise (and never have) and that is how I know.  I guess growing up I should have had a clue when all my friends had boyfriends and I never did.  I thought I was asexual at the time because I didn't know any different.  I didn't even know what a lesbian was until high school and now it feels as natural as ever.\n\nWhy do you think you are a lesbian?  Could you explain more?

The one about the guy who goes motorhoming with his wife. She goes to bed early one night and he sits beside the beautiful lake they are ptiched at, getting slowly drunk and comtemplating the beauty of his surroundings. \nHe staggers off to bed deciding he will get up at dawn and swin naked in the lake to cure his hangover. He strips off and passes out, he wakes with a jolt the next morning and dives out of the van naked and ready to swim, slowly it dawns on him he is in a busy high street with people all around. The motorhome has stopped at a red light and that is what the jolt was. His wife packed up early knowing he was p*ssed and began the drive home leaving him to sleep off the booze.

Step one: run away from those horrible online translators. It is for your own safety. (I am not kidding)\nStep two: download MSN in Spanish. It'll be annoying at the begining. I didn it for Norwegian. I never was able to find what I needed and had to look for the words. But after a while, you get used to it.\nStep three: search for Spanish podcasts. I know about three. Two of them are for advanced students. There must be tons out there.\nStep four: find friends online. Go to any language exchange communite and post your add. Offer to help them learn English. Just be aware with this. You see most of Yahoo answers members have little command of English (even if the ARE native speakers!!!). The same goes to Spanish. They an be university students and be as ignorant as you about Spanish... the only difference is that they are native. I insist: be careful with that.\nStep five: write a blog in spanish and let others monitor your writings. I know it is a pain in the ass to keep a blog, but for learning purposes it is a great tool.\nStep six: do all this regularly. And by that, I mean EVERY FREAKING DAY.

"After years of reading and asking similar questions, I have come to the conclusion that people can fairly easily compartmentalize their belief systems. They can rationally understand that Santa, the Bunny, and the Fairy are all myths, but they can continue to go on happily believing in their god.\n\nThese people can be intelligent (or not) in many other areas of their lives and rational (or not) on most subjects, but they cannot make the leap to realize that their god fits in the exact same category as the myths listed above.\n\nFamily and culture do a great bit of reinforcing the myths for these folks and in so many cases there are severe ""penalties"" for even doubting the truth of the myths. Many people never get past that.\n\nThe myth reinforcement stops at one age or another for Santa and the others, but the reinforcement continues for people who believe in one or another invisible sky fairies."

I was not scared and if you will truly let yourself worship God you will not be scared. :)  I was worshiping God and it started feeling like there was a fire deep in my stomach.

From your question,  it is sort of obvious that you are not sure what this fellow considers himself.

To communicate you have to atleast little bit of tamil.\nFirst thing you could do is you could learn to read basic tamil.... using the sites below (for non-tamil readers).\n\nSecondly, if you know a tamil friend that can give you quick crash course... Because Tamil is not the easiest language to learn.... if you don't know anyone tamil speaks... \n\nAnother approach is you could watch tamil movies, probabliy easiest and funnest way to learn tamil.... you can watch tamil movies online at http://www.loosu.com

Some people do it strictly for health reasons.\n\nThere are those who believe that a vegan diet (vegetarian with no dairy, eggts, or other animal products)where everything is fresh and raw is the most healthy diet of all for humans.  They might be right.

Well it all depends on the person. Yahoo answers can be addictive if you start to enjoy reading and answering questions. My Space is addictive once you learn how to use HTML. There is no turning back, but it serves a general purpose young kids are learning how to build web pages and code web logs. So both are productive in there own way but are they both trully addictive. My best answer would have to be yes. Once an individual figures them out and how to work it.

God proves his existance every day when I wake up. I literally should have died a couple of years ago and was almost there but God obviously decided to let me live.  I myself do not need anymore proof. Anyone who requires proof has only to look around them to see all that God does and gives.I personally believe that if you need proof of his existence in the form of some Miracle of sorts, then you must first ask yourself what kind of miracle would appease you. I am sure that everyone has a different litmus test they would require for proof. What one person would accept, another person would not. Therefore it is pointless for God to try to prove to you that he exists. That is why he left it up to you as an individual to believe or disbelieve.

Its why the Schools have passed laws against it!  How is some one to learn, if they are being bullied, pushed around, tormented, harrassed to the point where they cant learn?  You need to talk to the organizers and if its sanctioned by the School or Church, or anyone else, talk to the person in charge and explain the circumstances and get this 'nipped in the bud' as quickly as you can, so that you will get to enjoy more trips ...\n\nI wish you well..\n\nJesse"
Good question dude.
Rosetta stone
When I was a young woman, although it did matter to me that a potential be pleasant looking, the most important thing was that he be good company, be reliable, and be willing AND able to provide a nest for our future children.  Now that I am older, and my children nearly grown and gone, the good company factor is more important than it was, and knowing that I can count on my mate to care for me no matter what has become more important.  Kindness and good moral character is as important now as it ever was:  I want a man I can trust, who will keep his word.  And of course he has to know me well, and love me anyway!  lol
I can't remember what it's called, but I think it's a day with a big tree and presents.  I hope that helps.
If he is actively looking for men, there can be little doubt he would like to at least explore bisexuality.\n\nYou definitely need to talk to him about it; this is far too big an issue to let pass.\n\nHow you deal with it depends greatly on your attitude toward bisexuality.  Your marriage is your marriage and there must a resolution that will make you both happy.\n\nI would recommend you ask him to see a marriage counselor with you.  *NOT* because there is anything wrong with being bisexual, *nor* because there is anything wrong with your reaction.  A counselor can often help facilitate discussion that might get bogged down between the two of you on your own, and help you reach resolution.\n\nI wish you luck, and if you need someone to talk to, you may email me.  I would gladly discuss more with you in a private manner.  (I am married and bisexual.  My situation will certainly differ from yours, but I'm a good listener if you need one!)\n\n.
All I can do is give you my gut feeling. It may ring true with you, it may not. \n\nIt seems to me you have a fear of taking a risk, or making a commitment to something. This could be a general fear or something specific in your life at present. You are concerned about the downside, of what could go wrong. It's a big fear, as almost killing a small child would be a terrible consequence. \n\nHaving to make a choice is consistent with this theme. You cannot sit on the fence forever. Sooner or later you have to take a risk or make a commitment. Otherwise you go nowhere. Maybe even go backwards. \n\nI'm not sure of the significance of the girl disappearing and reappearing. Possibly it represents her transformation from a victim to your conscience. Anyway, it's you talking. The ghost is you telling yourself you have to make a choice. \n\nThe girl as victim might also be you as well. Are you the one who stands to get hurt the most? Could you lose something of your inner child? Anyway the girl is strong. She has determination. But she also wants to suffer out of sight. Sounds like she doesn't want to ask for help.  \n\nIt's very significant for you. Whatever it is, it's screaming at you! \n\nIf my interpretation rings true with you, you need to take more risks to get what you want, or commit to a specific course of action in something that is troubling you at present. And maybe you have to ask others for help. \n\nIf you take the action and the dream goes away, you have solved the problem. If not, you have to keep trying with other possible interpretations.
It's a tickle under your tongue.
Your only worry would be puking your guts out in a gutter somewhere, having constant stomach pain from the cirrhosis of your liver, and never having a job that will support a family or get you anything except cheap wine for nourishment. That leaves out a bunch of skinheads beating you with baseball bats just for laughs.\n\nOther than that it sounds like much funnier way to live.

We have to understand that us Christians who live for the Lord are going through a refining process because Jesus is coming soon and we need to be as ready as possible.\n\nThe Lord uses ALL things to the good of those who love Him.  The problem comes in with our faith.  We need to read His word and stand on it, so that when life throws us problems, we lean on Him and let His strentgh overtake our weakness.\n\nSometimes it is Satan who comes to destroy and then we need to get into God's presence so that He can lead us.\n\nWe are never ever alone if we love God and try to follow His commandments.  We just have to trust Him.\n\nThe Lord is so good and He is so very PERSONAL to each one of us.  He knows our needs, our desires.  Blessed be His holy, wonderful Name.

They mock our religion because they are afraid to believe in it.  Weird
I agree with you totally, and they do criticize the terrorists in the middle east's media strongly and all the time. But they should do so internationally as well. Maybe they feel that since they're under fire from the western media about it, and so they don't feel they have a voice to do so openly on the international arena...m not sure. But that issue is discussed and the terrorists are criticized in the muslim world and its media all the time.
It simply means in that land called fantasy you are really happy that you live. \nYou really enjoy being alive. \nYou love (=like very very much) your life (=being alive, being you, being here).\n\nWow, this is hard to explain because I don't know why you don't understand that part... I hope my answer helps you.\n\n...In contrast to our normal everyday lives, where we are not always happy, in that land called fantasy we are always happy. It is like a law (decree) there - everyone is happy and loves to be there and enjoys his/her life. Why? Because in fantasy, everything is possible. We can imagine anything we want. There are no limits, we are completely free. And so all our wishes come true, and we always have everything we need to be happy. Just by fantasizing about it. There are also no problems, no reasons not to love life. So everyone can be completely happy and love life in fantasy.
I came to the US seven years ago knowing only the basic English. How I learned was simply by talking to as many people as you can!\nNo matter what, where or with who. Actually, the more varied, the better.\n\nYour ESL class will help a lot in teaching you the basics in grammar, semantics, etc. But you have to do the rest by talking to people, reading and mostly believe it or not watching tv!\n*One of the best things to have is a small Korean-English dictionary always with you. Try to THINK in English, and whenever you come accross a word that you don't know, look it up. Then try to remember it.\n*Watch tv, you will learn a lot of English phrases. Keep the radio on. Repeat the words out loud!\n*Talk to people.\n*Learn 5 new words everyday and practice them.\n\nIt is not difficult to learn a language if you really want to learn it, and if you surround yourself with it.\n\nGood luck! :)
Pope Leo must have hated the Reformation and Martin Luther.  He was born a Medici and got the church way into debt.  As a result, he decided to sell 'indulgences' or forgiveness for sin.  Martin Luther called him and the church on this as well as many other things.  He was called out and had no where to hide.  That's enough reason, don't you think?
I was in the exact same boat..my mother's parents both passed away and she became extremely harsh and obviously didn't want to be a mother anymore, either.  If you feel that you would like to volunteer, why don't you try doing it one day  a week.  There is no limit to how many hours or days you volunteer, considering you are not getting paid.  You could even volunteer maybe Sunday's for 3 or 4 hours.  If you want to be a librarian, then volunteering at a library would look excellent on your resume.  Why don't you also try getting a job at a local bookstore?  Barnes and Noble are always hiring.  That also would look good on  a resume.  You should definitely try to get a paying job on top of volunteering as to become more independent and 'get out of your mother's hair' so to speak.  Becoming more independent will get you further on your own and you won't get in to fights as much...

"Yes.\n\nThe third ayat of Al-Maidah explains on what you can NOT eat.\n\n""\nForbidden to you is that which dies of itself, and blood, and flesh of swine, and that on which any other name than that of God has been invoked, and the strangled and that beaten to death, and that killed by a fall and that killed by being smitten with the horn, and that which wild beasts have eaten, except what you slaughter, and what is sacrificed on stones set up and that you divide by the arrows; that is a transgression. This day have those who disbelieve despaired of your religion, so fear them not, and fear Me. This day have I perfected for you your religion and completed My favor on you and chosen for you Islam as a religion; but whoever is compelled by hunger, not inclining willfully to sin, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.\n""\n\nThe fourth ayat of Al-Maidah explains on what you CAN eat.\n\n""\nThey ask you as to what is allowed to them. Say: The good things are allowed to you, and what you have taught the beasts and birds of prey, training them to hunt-- you teach them of what Allah has taught you-- so eat of that which they catch for you and mention the name of Allah over it; and be careful of (your duty to) Allah; surely Allah is swift in reckoning.\n""\n\n\n\nYou are allowed:\n\n- good things\n\n- anything caught by the animals that you teach to hunt\n\n- anything if you're hungry and don't want to defy God\n\n\n\nYou're not allowed:\n\n- anything that dies on its own\n\n- blood\n\n- flesh of swine\n\n- anything that was sworn not in under God's name\n\n\n- anything strangled and beaten to death\n\n- anything killed by a fall\n\n- anything killed by being struck with the horn\n\n- anything wild beasts have eaten, except what you slaughter\n\n- anything that is sacrificed on stones set up\n\n- anything that you divide by the arrows. (whether you want to translate this as lottery or dividing with real arrows is up to you)"
I have an answer to this question. \n\nThe Christian Gospels mention Mary Magdalene a few times, with some confusion as to whether she and Mary of Bethany are the same person. Mary Magdalene is the only woman mentioned by name in all four gospels besides Mother Mary. She sinned more deeply, so she had more demons to eject. The number seven gives the clue.\n \nJesus healed Mary Magdalene of seven demons (Mark 16:9, Luke 8:2); Mary Magdalene came to the dinner at Simeon's house with an alabaster jar from which she anointed the head and feet of Jesus Christ (Mark 14:3-9, John 11:2, 12:3-8); and Mary Magdalene was the first to see Jesus Christ resurrected from the tomb (John 20, Mark 16:9, Matthew 28).
All of them, surely ... if you go back early enough. We're born with certain instincts and reflexes and capabilities, but everything else has to be learned.
As of now, there is no gay marriage in New Jersey. On October 25, 2006 New Jersey's Supreme Court ruled that homosexuals are entitled to the same rights as heterosexuals, but gave the state legislature 180 days to decide if those same rights would be in the form of a civil union or a marriage. Due to this ruling, New Jersey can either be like Massachusetts and recognize gay marriage or like Vermont and Connecticut and recognize civil unions. It is important to note that, even though a few states recognize either civil unions or marriage that those laws only apply to those individual states; there is NO RECOGNITION of either gay marriage or civil unions by the US Federal Government. \n\nMassachusetts is the only US state to recognize gay marriage. Vermont and Connecticut recognize civil unions. California has a domestic partnership law that provides most (but not all) spousal benefits to unmarried couples. Hawaii, Maine, and the District of Columbia have laws that provide partial benefits to unmarried couples.
Not necessarily.  Many people don't know of or see the connection between various Scriptures.  Also, are you able to remember every verse of every book in the Scriptures at any instant?  Sometimes we all need reminding.\n\nIt is like a jigsaw puzzle.  Two adjacent pieces look similar - have similar coloration, etc.  Looking at either piece separately does little to understand what the picture looks like.  But put the two pieces together and a comprehensive picture starts to emerge.
I think there's some truth to that quote, but those who assume atheists have no morality simply because they don't believe in supernatural beings haven't educated themselves.\n\nI believe in fair play.  Probably the best phrasing of this moral precept is the Golden Rule.  Treat others with respect.  Each person has the right to pursue happiness and fulfillment in his own way, so long as it does not harm others or prevent them from pursuing the same in their own way.
Learn to be your own best friend.  Cultivate gratitude, always look for reasons to be grateful.  Let go of assumptions that we always have to be with other people, that we need a special romantic relationship in order to be happy, etc.
The War Scroll tells of the Eschatology of the end times, namely the final battle between Light and Dark.  I believe it was part of the Dead Sea Scrolls findings.  However, whether they were penned by the Essenes is debatable.

"Belief in miracles is a concept. But faith in god an absolute necessity.\n\n\nBefore we proceed discussion on miracles, we need to understand the meaning of miracles. What does it actually mean? What does actually happen when we hear someone say, ""a miracle has happened""?\n\nThe famous Ganesha episode drinking the milk was the biggest miracle of all the times.\n\n\nMiracles are not to be. No human being on earth can create a miracle. It can never happen. Yes, some people... some renowned Saints while pursuing their Spiritual career gain some Tantric powers which helps them healing the needy.\n\nIt so happened a poor man turned up in presence of Bhagwan Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism and asked him for help. In his hands was the dead body of his young son. He begged of Bhagwan Mahavira to put back life into his son. Mahavira point blank refused... he stated he does not have the power to put life into someone... neither it is possible for any other human being to do so. Neither he could perform even a single miracle.\n\n\nHe repeatedly emphasized that every human being has the power within to invoke the positive energy of the Cosmos. This only happens when we develop a positive attitude towards life. This is practically what is being done in Reiki. Summing up in Reiki, one is taught to invoke the positive energy source and use it for curing the defective area of the body. It is like chanelising all the power within the means of human being towards a particular area as happens in the case of a dam.\n\nIn any hydroelectric project the principal means of generating energy is... a huge quantity of water is stored in a lake and this raw water is made to stand for a while. After the sedimentation of the particles floating in the water has occurred... the clear water is passed through tunnels, the starting point of which is located on a much higher platform than the outer end of the tunnel. This makes the water gush out with great pressure. This water is made to pass through a turbine before it reaches the outer end. The rotation of the turbine generates electricity.\n\n\nMere channelising of water through a tunnel which has a very steep slope and keeping a turbine in the path of the water generates the requisite energy... similarly if we need to heal our body... we need to concentrate all the positive energies which either exist in the body or can be invoked from the mighty reservoir of Cosmos and directed towards a particular goal. This goal can be healing the ailing body or even pursuing a higher goal in life.\n\nIf we look at the matter deeply... the student who comes first in the class and the student who comes last... there is not much difference except in their thinking. The one who comes first sincerely concentrates his total energies towards the desired goal of life. The one coming last has yet to find a definite goal in life. One who comes last fritters away his energy to no avail.\n\n\nWhenever we expect of a saint to perform a miracle... what actually happens is that the words of the saint inspires us and makes us concentrate our energies towards a particular goal. Sometimes, he gives a Mantra to be chanted many times... or explains logically how the desired results can be achieved. Repetition of Mantras results in invoking positive energy from the Cosmos.\n\nYou and your brother have surrounded your mental self by negative energies... both of you have a habit of thinking negative. You have to change your attitude towards life... you need to think broad... you just cannot continue being narrow-minded. The more we think bad of someone... the negative flow of energy reflects back upon us. With passage of time this negative energy accumulates and there comes a time when hell breaks loose... the body unable to sustain the negative flow of energy falls ill.\n\n\nThe moment you understand this crux of life... you shall never need a miracle ever. You have within you the mightiest source of energy in the Cosmos."

"Got this from wikipedia. Its associated with the Christmas season but it has a long pagan tradition in Europe.  I always associate yule logs with chocolate cake rolls with cream inside.\n\n\n*from wikipedia\nA Yule log is a large log which is burned in the hearth as a part of traditional Yule or Christmas celebrations in some cultures.\n\nIn Northern Europe, winter festivities were once considered to be a Feast of the Dead, complete with ceremonies full of spirits, devils, and the haunting presence of the Norse god, Odin, and his night riders. One particularly durable Solstice festival was ""Jol"" (also known as ""Jule"" and pronounced ""Yule""), a feast celebrated throughout Northern Europe and particularly in Scandinavia to honor Jolnir, another name for Odin. Since Odin was the god of intoxicating drink and ecstasy, as well as the god of death, Yule customs varied greatly from region to region. Odin's sacrificial beer became the specially blessed Christmas ale mentioned in medieval lore, and fresh food and drink were left on tables after Christmas feasts to feed the roaming Yuletide ghosts. Even the bonfires of former ancient times survived in the tradition of the Yule Log, perhaps the most universal of all Christmas symbols.\n\nThe origins of the Yule Log can be traced back to the Midwinter festivals in which the Norsemen indulged...nights filled with feasting, ""drinking Yule"" and watching the fire leap around the log burning in the home hearth. The ceremonies and beliefs associated with the Yule Log's sacred origins are closely linked to representations of health, fruitfulness and productivity. In England, the Yule was cut and dragged home by oxen or horses as the people walked alongside and sang merry songs. It was often decorated with evergreens and sometimes sprinkled with grain or cider before it was finally set alight.\n\nIn Yugoslavia, the Yule Log was cut just before dawn on Christmas Eve and carried into the house at twilight. The wood itself was decorated with flowers, colored silks and gold, and then doused with wine and an offering of grain. In the area of France known as Provence, families would go together to cut the Yule Log, singing as they went along. These songs asked for blessings to be bestowed upon their crops and their flocks. The people of Provence called their Yule Log the tréfoire and, with great ceremony, carried the log around the house three times and christened it with wine before it was set ablaze.\n\nTo all Europeans, the Yule Log was believed to bring beneficial magic and was kept burning for at least twelve hours and sometimes as long as twelve days, warming both the house and those who resided within. When the fire of the Yule Log was finally quenched, a small fragment of the wood would be saved and used to light the next year's log. It was also believed that as long as the Yule Log burned, the house would be protected from witchcraft. The ashes that remained from the sacred Yule Log were scattered over fields to bring fertility, or cast into wells to purify and sweeten the water. Sometimes, the ashes were used in the creation of various charms...to free cattle from vermin, for example, or to ward off hailstorms.\n\nSome sources state that the origin of Yule is often associated with an ancient Scandinavian fertility god and that the large, single Log is representative of a phallic idol. Tradition states that this Log was required to burn for twelve days and a different sacrifice to the fertility god had to be offered in the fire on each of those twelve days.\n\nTelevising burning yule logs has become a Christmas tradition for some television stations in the United States, such as The Yule Log on New York City's WPIX-TV.\n\nThe expression ""Yule log"" has also come to refer to log-shaped Christmas cakes, also known as ""chocolate logs"" or ""Bûche de Noël""."

Religions can't be taken seriously. Their intangibility causes too much agony among the masses. \n\nOh, Bernard! I pray to thee!
Maybe they are trying to bring you down, to get you on their level. \n\nIf I were you, I would participate in school activities. People like people who get excited about the same things they are excited about. \n\nI know you want to be an introvert and curl into yourself, but you should peek out once in a while. People are sensitive and they may be resentful because you refuse to talk to them. They will think you are stuck up.* So, go to a football game, watch a TV show that they like. Show your peers that you care about their world, too.\n\n* Well, on the flip side, you can't do things just so people will like you. People can dislike people for no reason at all.
I don't know of anyone that likes a negative comment. Some are more vocal in their disapproval of a negative comment than others. As far as race is concerned I believe that would have to do with bad things that have been done in the past and unfortunately are still going on today. A negative comment that is derived from past or present wrongs would render a bad or hurt feeling in a person of a race or group of people that had suffered the wrongdoing. But this same feeling can also be rendered in someone that is not of that race or group due to their sensitivity of the feelings of the person offended. As far as a case study statistic I don't have one. But I deal with people of all walks of life on a daily basis, and I have yet to see one person respond happily to a negative comment.

"In a nutshell: Look at the young woman in Saudi Arabia who was sentenced recently to a punishment of 90 lashes for the ""crime"" of being a victim of gang-rape"
I've met with one who had allegedly solved crimes.She mentioned about two blond women who are always around me.She also mentioned about a blond woman I would meet in the future who would be of some importance in my life.It would seem that the woman I eventually met was a detective investigating an alleged homicide in the area and I was not a suspect uh, I think? I would see Sylvia Browne if she did it for free.It's not like she's gonna give me the winning lottery numbers .
she is nausicaa.  she was the one who found odysseus when he was ship wrecked.  her father alcinous was king of the Phawacians in Scheria.  she later married telemachus, odysseus' son.
If you travel in pagan circles, you'll get them all the time.  Other than that, all I can think about is the still-standing city of Athens, the Parthenon, and certain episodes of 'Hercules' and 'Xena'.  \n\nAlso a Disney movie,I think....
Actually, I never notice what other people are wearing.
Of course!! I know I am!! EVERYONE should be proud to be the race they're born in, and NO ONE should be ashamed of being in their race. You can't pick what you're born as but you can make the most of it and better your race by being the best person you can be Even if other races down your race and others from your race make it look bad, the whole race isn't bad and you know it, so show it.

"Just like doubting Thomas said when He saw the nail prints in Jesus hands, ""I believe, My LORD & my God!"".  Jesus replied, ""Blessed are you for you have seen and believed, but more blessed are those who believe who have not seen..."".\n\nIt is written that Jesus is the express image of God.  If we see Jesus we see the Father.\n\nNo one has ever seen God the Father (except for Jesus) in vision  etc. because He is too bright & strong.  Nothing can give Father God justice. Jesus only is the express image of God the Father.  Because the Father & the Son are One.  This is a Godly Spiritual unity.\n\nPeople have seen God only the Word part of the trinity in Old Testament (When Jacob fought God & his hip went out of joint & his name was exalted to Israel, when Yahweh & angels visited Abraham on the way to judge Sodom & Ghomora, when Haggar saw God & didn't die, when the pillar of cloud by day or pillar of fire by night,  when Moses saw God, etc...) and in New Testament as Jesus Christ.\n\nGod's love is in us and is the Holy Spirit seal on every born of God Christian.\n\n\nWhen Jesus said on the cross, ""My God... that was singular God El.  Not Elohim (plural of El).  Because when Jesus bore our sins on the cross there was a separation from God the Father.  God broke for us."
People are naturally protective of what they recognise as a safe environment for living, and they see anything that deviates from their perceived notion of the good as being a threat. The problem with this is that it is not conducive to social harmony and will ultimately culminate into violence. A primary cause of this 'stand- offishness' is that of the economic theory of capitalism, which is inherently dangerous, as it pools wealth into the hands of the few, and leaves the have-nots to fight amongst themselves for scraps. This leads to greed, selfishness, and the imperative to seek power over others through any means necessary.

"when i was seventeen i was a very strong and vocal ATHEIST. one day in the summer--i came face to face with a prediciment that required nothing less then a fast miracle! so i prayed ""God if you are there--I NEED you NOW""\ni turn 60 next week-i can tell you this--that was only the first miracle that i asked for and got--and i would not be here today to write this had i not gotten that instant miracle from God--and i wasnt the only one to witness this--there were others. when i went back to college that following fall--i went back a Christian--no one could belive it and no one could have ever imagined the change in me! sign me ""Rev.

"Someone already began ""talking""about the Superbowl happening...\nThe media blew the whole thing up and made a big deal about it...\nIt was only a breast... America does have the LARGEST P*RN indystry in the whole wide world... To come down on Janet Jackson on that is just lame...\nAlmost everyone ignores Ms. Jackson now... While she recently release her new album 20 Y.O.\nBut because the way American Media treated Ms. Jackson most Americans believe she isn't good enough for the world...\n(Who made the rules?)\nAnyway... 20 Y.O. isn't selling that well... In my opinion not only because off the way American Media treated Ms Jackson but also because VIRGIN doesn't support Janet Jackson to the fullest... She might be on their label but her contract ended after this last album... They asked Ms Jackson to resign at Virgin but she doesn't want to...\nAnd now Virgin is giving her a hard time by not doing much promotion for 20 Y.O.\nOn her official forum it was mentioned that Ms Jackson paid a lot from her own pocket... Meaning for the promotion to Japan, France and several in US Ms Jackson paid for everything herself. The plane tickets, Hotels not only fer herself but also for all the dancers and... Well the whole crew who went with her to do promotions...\nJD has done a great job for her... He has done as many as he could to get her name out everywhere...\nBut Janet Jackson fights for her rights and stand her ground!!!\nShe has JD on her side,her family, her dancers and her fans...\n\nNo matter what every one is saying about her ...all negative stuff... Janet Jackson doesn't have to prove her talent anymore... She already has proven to be a strong FENOMANAL WOMAN years ago...\nShe never was a great singer... She might never be the best singer... But she was... She is and always will be one of the best entertainer/dancer/performer...\n\nHope I helped... Good luck on your research...\nMay I suggest you to take a look at one of her sites...\nwww.janet-jackson.com\nwww.janet-online.com\nwww.janetxone.com"

"I searched for ""Mennonite Halloween"" on line, and came across a few individual congregations that were having youth parties, like other Christian denominations, on Halloween.  One group had this to say, and I thought it was a pretty good answer to your question:\n""Many families celebrate Halloween but they often do so by having parties in their homes for children, or church youth groups plan special parties for the evening.  There are also Mennonite groups who believe that it is wrong to celebrate Halloween because they believe that it has evil connotations … the celebration of evil spirits, etc. Most conservative groups would not celebrate Halloween because they would consider it foolish and a “worldly” activity.

"He may have given very clear points about ""helping others"", but failed to mention a required amount of ""time involvement""- so I personally don't feel that there's a certain number of hours you need to worry about - in fact, I think you're missing the whole point. The attitude you should think about having (when giving help to others) is giving because you WANT TO- and doing WHAT YOU CAN when you see someone in need. It's not about something that ""has an end"", it's about a way of living- an attitude towards life while you're here. It's not like a ""community service sentence"" you're trying to fulfill, it's about fulfilling your purpose for being here, and finding the desire to be a humanitarian in this world- to connect spiritually with all people and with a purpose outside of yourself and your life, that transcends materiality and the selfishness seen so readily in our world. To connect with others (and helping is a good way to do this)- is to connect with God as well. The wish I think God has of us all is to view helping others as our purpose- our ""higher purpose"", and something that we should want to do on a regular basis for all the time that we live. I don't think that ""counting the hours"" involved will get you into ""heaven""."

"I don't think he is an idiot. I don't think that he is telling the truth though. I think the idiots who believe him and buy his energy drink are the idiots. Anyone who believes that a 76 year old man could lift that much are the proverbial fools who will be parted from their money.\n\nFor comparative purposes, when Dan Kendra set the Florida State University record of 1,335 pounds, the leg press machine required extensive modifications to hold the proper amount of weight, and the capillaries in both of Kendra's eyes burst during his successful attempt. Thus, Robertson's claimed achievement would add 665 pounds to the best-ever total of Kendra, a top athlete in his physical prime, who would go on to play professional football in the National Football League and become a Navy SEAL.\n\nIn response to the skepticism of this claim, Robertson's website has claimed that his doctor is able to leg press 2,700 pounds, and that ""It is not nearly as hard as the authors of these reports make it out to be.""(What ""these reports"" are exactly was not specified).\n\nA video has also been provided supposedly demonstrating Robertson doing several reps with a weight of 1,000 pounds which can be seen here. In the video Pat Robertson is seen using a 45 degree sled type leg press machine. He keeps the safety locks in place at the second step which severely limits the range of possible motion. The seat is positioned to allow approximately six inches of travel after the lock. This setup gives Pat Robertson the maximum mechanical advantage at the last few inches of travel. This is generally regarded to be improper leg press technique. The proper technique is to load the weight, place hands on the release levers and then to press the weight from the stops and then to rotate the stops out. Then, the weight is allowed to slide down until the quads and glutes are at full extension. At this point, the person executing the leg press has minimal mechanical advantage and can press the least amount of weight. In the video, Robertson also appears to be using his arms to push on his thighs, which is also regarded as improper technique.\n\nIn June 2006, General Nutrition Center, a nutritional supplement retailer, announced without explanation that it would stop carrying Robertson's energy drink."

Cause people need someone to blame for their problems.  If people did what they were told my best friend who is a cop wouldn't need a tazar, nightstick, and pepperspray to go with his gun.  People always want to put down cops, but who do they call when some punk is stealing their car?

"I do agree that there is a lot of disturbing, vulgar, and not very ""family values"" oriented stuff in the Bible.

Might help if you ask something specific.
ask and you will know not ...the way that you are gay is not in question ...for the answer is not in the mind but in the heart...now go seek and your heart shall follow, into the  forests and meditate for 7days, then hence forth climb the mountains of rock only retreat if the answer fails you.\n\nDude its just because you are, there is no answer just go with what you feel in your heart and you will be happy and ignore all those that try to bring you down and that goes for all the people who are told they cant be who they are, gay or straight-be happy with you.
Honey, I have felt guilty about everything. Guilt is not a good thing. Admitting a mistake is one thing, but overcoming the guilt and finding redemption ... that is the divine message of grace. The good news is that your past does not have to haunt you for the rest of your life. A lesson learned is just a bridge that is burned. Read Romans 8 - God does not condemn you. It is satan who is codemning you - evil wants you to feel like you have been defeated by your mistakes. \n\nGreat stories abound of the most evil of all men finding redemption. It can happen. A great story on redemption is Les Miserables, by Victor Hugo. You can read the book. There is a movie with Liam Neeson that is a very good adaptation. The Broadway musical is stunning. I weep every time I see the musical ... the story reaches across the centuries to all ages. You are redeemed. Now your job is to find it.\n\nI tell my children that God always gives you another chance. I don't care what you have done, I tell them, you are always my child and you will always have another chance with me. Even if your mistake was predictable and you are just suffering the consequences of your own actions, you still have my love. I learned that from watching how God has treated me. \n\nIf you are going to make a mistake, make it a whopper. Learn from it. You will have a fuller measure of God's grace if you can learn to accept it.
"Pentecostal~ On the day of Pentecost it was the release of the Holy Spirit into the hearts of the masses who wished to accept. Now, Paul was quite the preacher. On that day, everyone understood each other for a change. It was God's efficient communication device for a day. Paul was trying to get the people in control so he practically did them the way you get done in the military. Utilatarian clothing and modesty. Deciphering who was male and female. In today's religious arena is has become a circus. Women can't cut their hair. They wear god-forsaken dresses no matter where they work (when I was in the oilfields, I had a lady secretary who asked me HOW I could wear jeans and boots. I just told the truth. I said well I can afford to go out onto the oil leases and bend over in front of the team in a dress!!!). They babble in a supposedly religious tongue that allows them ""secret"" communication with God, but then a congregate member tells the others what it means and so it's not ""secret"". Alot of women aren't allowed to work and they have their own schools and competions. They are not for marriage ""out of the fold"". \n\nBaptist~ Found upon the principals of John the Baptist, aide de camp of Jesus. John used water baptism in his ministries. I do believe God is okay with not doing that if your area is low on water. But his missions were founded upon large meetings and Baptism thereafter. It is based upon the ""living water"", which is Christ. Like I said, I think you can skate on that if you are in a drought. Also, Baptists have factions. The Free Will Baptists expect you to behave and stess the inherent traits of humans with options. If you misbehave, you repent. The First Baptist groups are just that. They prefer to think of their church is presented to mankind as the group that seeks their Lord just the way John the Baptist did. They were FIRST. Then the Southern Baptists. Everything is an unforgiveable sin unless there is repentance. \n\nMethodist~ An offshoot of the Lutheran Church. Luther got sick of the Catholic Church. He wanted to marry and drink. So, he founded his own group. The Lutheran Churches are founded upon the philosophy of giving and taking in marriage, wine allowed, but they do have altar boys and a Parson in a robe. They also have water baptism. Luther, however, did sin. He was a drunk and a womanizer. But, I am sure he said he was sorry for it and I have no problem with that. Anyway, the Methodists have altar boys, robes but it is more carefree. You can fall in love with anyone and get married. They bowl, shoot pool and drink if they want and all of this is allowed. The Lutherans have synods. The Missouri Synod is the worst. It's like Big Brother. They retain the full capability to run you out of town if  they so choose."

Well for starters, those are not your friends. Those are acquaintances. When they push you away, you learn that they will never become more than that.\n\nI am sorry that you continue to encounter such closed minded people. It isn't your fault.\n\nI think the only solution to this is to tell these people, upon first encounter, that you are not straight. Maybe these people get all paranoid and think back to past experiences, and wonder if you secretly have had a crush on them the entire time. Lame I know, but people are so egocentric these days.
"Yes.  I fell in love at first sight... 5 years after I met my DH...\n\nAs for ""how do I know for sure it will last?""  Well, love is a commitment.  It lasts if you DECIDE it will last.  Infatuation will come and go, but love last if you are committed to loving and being with someone the rest of you life."
"A lot of nonbelievers accuse Christians of making broad generalizations and having closed minds, but the more I read what they write, the more I see it the other way around. Christians are basically in agreement on ""Salvation through Christ"" but then I see they branch out in other directions. I think this should be proof to nonchristians that not ALL Christians think the same and most think for themselves."
No.
You know I feel your pain.  I really do.  However, I am going to make a few suggestions.  One: attitude.  If you have the attitude that you aren't going to find someone, then you probably won't.  Two: looking for things to be wrong.  Instead of thinking, what is wrong with this guy, try looking for what is right.  And those are my positivisms for today.\n\nNow that I got that out of the way, I have to say that dating sucks. I can't really blame it all on the men but a lot of it has to do with their shortcomings.  Can't really speak on all men in this area because I know a few women who are happily married.  But I have seen my share of heartbreak personally and through friends and family.  I hear a lot about men being intimidated.  I just don't understand that.  If you have an attractive woman who is fun to be with who just happens to be successful, why would that intimidate you.  That sounds like insecurity instead of intimidation.  \n\nI know you and you are not intimidating so I can't really see that as an answer.  However, I am not sure if moving is the right choice.  Not for that reason anyway.  My sister friends all over the country, black and white, seem to be having the same problem.

If  they repent their sins, and give it over to the Lord Jesus Christ, they will replace that anger, sin and hate with LOVE, JOY and FORGIVENESS. \n\nThey will be filled with the loving gift of the Holy spirit and they will be given the awsome gift of salvation. They will be free to spend an eternity in heaven by accepting Jesus Christ.

I don't believe forgiveness is necessarily REQUIRED or that it is even possible for all people to accomplish.  But it often can be beneficial in helping 'victims' cope and carry on with their lives.  While I say that, I myself have never (yet) been able to forgive my father for abusing my sister and I'm not sure I ever will.  But I have learned to accept it I suppose.  \n\nI don't know.  Tough question.  Very hard to forgive some transgressions, that's for darn sure.

"Yes, the whole situation in Boston was terrible. \n\nThe bottom line of it was:  Cardinal Law acted like a business manager, or a lawyer, or someone else whose primary goal was nothing but damage control.\n\nHe didn't act like an apostle.  \n\nThat's why he listened to psychotherapists who pronounced Geoghan and other abusive priests ""cured"" when they definitely were not ""cured"" and never would be.\n\nIt's why he listened to lawyers and insurance providers who advised him to make secret financial settlements while shuffling abusive priests from parish to parish.\n\nIt's why he capitulated to society's politically correct view of homosexuality -- and allowed known gay priests to continue to sexually prey NOT on young kids, but older boys past the age of puberty.\n\nPlenty of blame can be passed around here -- on the psychotherapists, lawyers, insurance guys, apathetic laity, and on a politically correct culture that sees nothing wrong with the homosexuality that was displayed by the vast majority of priests guilty in this scandal.\n\nBut at the end of the day, the archdiocese of Boston was run by Law.   He handled this situation very poorly.   \n\nI have no doubt that the Church has learned a very hard lesson, and will not let the errors of the past be repeated -- by returning to its orthodox roots."
Mostly Target but Kmart on occasion. I don't shop at Walmart because they're a nasty bunch. They force companies to sell their stuff at those prices so either the companies have to cut down on supplies and make a crappy product or they have to let people go from their companies and I feel for all the people in America losing jobs. They also cause companies to take their business overseas because they can't afford to sell their products at Walmart prices and still make a profit.

Dear God, why is it that wherever there is war, each side says they talk to you and receive your guidance?

"Love God, love others as you would yourself. Jesus replied that to the religious leaders when they asked what is the greatest command of all. Love does not hurt, mock, gossip, judge,kill, anger or anything that would harm others. God's true intention of the law is for us to learn what hurts each other and Jesus came to fulfill it and now therefore we are under grace. If love governs our hearts, we wouldn't do anything that harm others. The perspective we should try is the motivation of love and not having the pressure to ""obey the law."" Love fulfills those ""laws"" God loves us regardless of what we do because He looks at the heart."

Actually, no. Islam promotes equality, but men and women can not be dealt with at the same level, due to a difference in their make up. Their rights are even, b/c both play major roles as slaves of Allah, both have rights to inheritance, land, property, and both play major roles in their married lives, in social life, etc etc. \n\nThe only reason a man gets a bigger portion (twice) as the woman, is because a woman keeps her own portion and does not have to share it with anyone (unless, of course, she wants to.) A man must not only take care of himself, but provide for the women in his family with that money, so he gets more. :) \n\nWomen are very honored in Islam, and they are considered far from weak. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)'s own wife was a leader in society - as a teacher, a political leader, and a religious leader as well. :)
I think the Roman Catholic Church is making a mistake by insisting on celibacy for priests, but they don't answer to me.

"I'm not sure of who invented ""that rule"", but think of it like this:  When you burp, you shouldn't just belch out and act like nothing happened, you should say ""excuse me"".  It isn't really rude to ""fart"" because man or woman or whatever race you are, we are all humans and that isn't unusual, but if you do fart, you should say ""excuse me"" or ""sorry"", instead of laughing at it and doing it to aggrevate."

"Bull fighting is a huge part of Spanish society and culture.  Rightly or wrongly.  The astonishing thing about it is that the rest of the world consider it to be a sport.  This amazes the Spanish people. Bull fighting has never been considered a sport in Spain.  It is a form of theatre.  It is a display of man against beast and is one of the largest audience spectacles in the world.  It is classed as ""tragic theatre"" in much the same way as ""Macbeth"" by Shakespeare.  \n\nThe bulls that are used in the bullfights are specifically bred for that purpose and until their ""day of reckoning"" they are kept in the lap of luxury and are fed the best of food.....the training grounds are immaculate and the spend their days being pampered and very well looked after.  Of course they have their final day in the bullring and we all know the results of that.  It is however part of the theatre and part of the culture of Spain.\n\nBy the way, I am not a supporter of bull-fighting but I do know a lot about the history of it.....it is not as simple as killing for killing's sake.  The bull will always die, that is the tragedy of the theatre of the bullfight, but the unknown element and the excitement comes from the knowledge that the matador could also die in his efforts to kill the bull...that is what the crowd go for.....the challenge of man against beast...it is part of the old spanish culture."
"All  \nacross the United States, you'll encounter discarded shoes hanging from wires, poles, and trees. Theories as to what these shoes signify abound, but, contrary to what one hears, there's no one right answer. \n\nWho put the shoes there and why? The list of explanations goes on. Suggestions include: \n\n\nIt's the work of gangs marking the boundaries of their territory. \n\nBullies take them off defenceless kids, then sling them up out of reach as the ultimate taunt. \n\nGang members create an informal memorial at the spot where a friend lost his life. \n\nCrack dealers festoon wires to advertise their presence in the neighborhood. \n\nThe shoes increase wire visibility for low-flying aircraft. \n\nOverly puffed-up boys who have just lost their virginity or otherwise passed a sexual milestone look to signal the event to others. \n\nGraduating seniors mark this transition in their lives by leaving something of themselves behind; namely, their shoes. \n\nKids do it just because it's fun. And besides, what else are you going to do with a worn-out pair of sneakers other than tie the laces together and toss them high? \nIn the Southwest exists a similar practice, that of placing old, worn boots upside down on fence posts by the side of a road. Driving along, one passes upturned boot after upturned boot. Some people tell us these boots  are a way for a homeowner to indicate if he's gone to town for the day; on his way out, he stops where his driveway meets the road and adjusts the boot so its toe points outwards. When the toe is pointing towards the house, he's telling the world he's home. Others say it's just a boot-on-a-fencepost thing with no more rhyme or reason to it than there is to those sneakers hanging over telephone wires. \n\nMembers of the military have pointed to the practice of pitching an old pair of army boots over the wires when leaving a post as a possible origin for sneaker slinging. According to some, army boot pitching is a ritual performed upon completing basic training, according to others, the boots are tossed when a soldier leaves one post for another, and a final school of thought holds that boot pitching is properly done only when the service itself is being left. The boots are often painted yellow or orange prior to being festooned over a wire. \n\nThere's no one definitive answer as to why those shoes hang from telephone wires. Perhaps the answer lies within each of us, shoe-slinger and non-shoe-slinger alike. We are a determinedly decorative society. At Christmas and Halloween, on Easter and the 4th of July, many of us feel compelled to doll up houses, windows, and lawns with all manner of objects and lights. Some call this folk art. Others will tell you it has to do with the human need for self-expression. \n\nSlinging shoes over a power line could be no more than us letting that side of ourselves run riot. Then again, the whole thing could be merely an invented tradition, with people doing it because they see others doing it. \n\n\n\nSightings:   In the 1997 film Wag the Dog, Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman conspire to festoon tree after tree with shoes as a ""spontaneous"" show of homegrown support for their manufactured war hero Sgt. William Schumann (the ""old shoe"")."
If you are asking where you can find a lesbian only room.....there are some on all servers. Yahoo, msn, AOL,....my favorite chat server is PalTalk. Click on view rooms, then user rooms and select a catagory. On PalTalk, you click on search chat rooms. Then click on Adult, and choose a category.......Hope this helps. I don't use msn or AOL, so I don't know how to use their chat. Good luck, have fun and have a great day!

"It's an idea that's been around for while. \n\nThere is no unambiguous evidence.  She never married, she was reclusive, and wrote passionate letters to the woman who eventually became her sister-in-law, Susan Gilbert.  She wrote her letters even when she lived next door, lots of them -- three times as many as she wrote to any other person.\n\nThe language in the letters has been dismissed as typical of the 19th century, but it goes deeper.  Dickinson refers to her as an ""absent Lover"" whom she wanted to hold and kiss, and calls herself ""Susan's Idolator [who] keeps a Shrine for Susan.""  She not only expreseed desperate grief at being separated, but got ""hot and feverish"" (in her words) at the prospect of seeing her again.\n\nThese letters (nearly 300 of them) and the obvious role that Susan played as her muse have been added to such poems as:\n\nHer breast is fit for pearls,\nBut I was not a `Diver' -\nHer brow is fit for thrones\nBut I have not a crest.\nHer heart is fit for home -\nI - a Sparrow - build there\nSweet twigs and twine\nMy perennial nest.\n\nAnd this poem, believed to describe a sexual encounter:\n\nWild Nights--Wild Nights!\nWere I with thee\nWild Nights should be\nOur luxury!\n\nFutile--the Winds--\nTo a Heart in port--\nDone with the Compass--\nDone with the Chart!\nRowing in Eden\n\n\nAh, the Sea!\nMight I but moor--Tonight--\nIn Thee!\n\n\n...have led many scholars to admit the possibility that she had least had lesbian feelings, whether or not she ever acted on them.  Others, of course, feel that they have to ""protect"" her legacy and keep it free from even the suggestion that she might have been a lesbian."

"The Perversion of Qur’an and \n\nthe Loss of Many Parts of It\n\nOn page 131 of his book, ""El-Sheaa and Correction"", the contemporary Muslim scholar, Dr. Mosa-El-Mosawy, makes this frank confession,\n\n""Those who adopt the notion of the perversion of the Qur’an are present among all different Islamic groups, but the majority of them come from the El-Sheaa scholars.""  \n\nPerversion of Qur’an is an unimaginable notion to the lay Muslim because the Scholars of Islam are hiding this truth from being published or becoming known. \n\nOf course, we weren’t just satisfied with what Dr. El-Mosawy has already mentioned, but we went back to the most popular ancient scholars and to Muhammad’s relatives and companions to investigate this notion concerning the perversion and loss of several parts of the Qur’an because those are the trustworthy people regarding the history and development of Islam.\n\nUpon examining the testimonies of these great companions, the answer was positive. They clearly stated that perversion and loss of large fragments of the Qur’an did occur. Let us scrutinize their testimony in order to present to deluded Muslims the truth as it is proclaimed by their trusted spiritual leaders and scholars. The deceptive veil must be removed so people can see the true face of the Qur’an.\n\n’Ibn Umar al–Khattab explicitly admits,\n\n""Let no one of you say that he has acquired the entire Qur’an for how does he know that it is all? Much of the Qur’an has been lost, thus let him say, ‘I have acquired of it what is available""’ (Suyuti: Itqan, part 3, page 72). \n\nA’isha (also page 72) adds to the story of ibn Umar and says, \n\n""During the time of the prophet, the chapter of the Parties used to be two hundred verses when read. When Uthman edited the copies of the Qur’an, only the current (verses) were recorded"" (73 verses).\n\nThe same statement is made by Ubay ibn Ka’b, one of the great companions. On page 72, part 3, the Suyuti says, \n\n""This famous companion asked one of the Muslims, ‘How many verses in the chapter of the Parties?’ He said, ‘Seventy-two or seventy-three verses.’ He (Ubay) told him, ‘It used to be almost equal to the chapter of the Cow (about 286 verses) and included the verse of the stoning.’ The man asked, ‘What is the verse of the stoning?’ He said, ‘If an old man or woman committed adultery, stone them to death.""’\n\nThis same story and same dialogue which took place between the companion and one of the Muslims is recorded by Ibn Hazm (volume 8, part 11, pages 234 and 235). Then Ibn Hazm said, \n\n""’Ali Ibn Abi Talib said this has a reliable chain of authority (The Sweetest [Al Mohalla] vol. 8.).""\n\nThe Zamakh-shari also cited it in his book, ""al-Kash-Shaf’ (part 3, page 518).\n\nThese are unquestionable statements made by the pillars of the Islamic religion who transmitted Muhammad’s sayings and biography, ""The Tradition"", and who interpreted the Qur’an— among them Ibn ’Umar, A’isha, Ubay Ibn Ka’b and ’Ali Ibn Abi Talib. Ibn ’Umar states that a large part of the Qur’an was missed. A’isha and Ubay Ibn Ka’b assert that dozens of verses from the ""Chapter of the Parties"" have been lost. ’Ali confirms that, too. In regard to this particular verse, the following incident is recorded in ""The Itqan"" by Suyuti (part 1, page 168), \n\n""During the collection of the Qur’an, people used to come to Zayd Ibn Thabit (with the verses they memorized). He shunned recording any verse unless two witnesses attested to it. The last verse of chapter of Repentance was found only with Khuzayma Ibn Thabit. Zayd said, ‘Record it because the apostle of God made the testimony of Khuzayma equal to the testimony of two men.’ ’Umar came with the verse of the stoning but it was not recorded because he was the only witness to it.""\n\nOne can only wo"

"You ask big questions, and lots of em!\n\nI'd like to first say that the disagreement is about whether God exists or not.  There are different terms regarding peoples' views on the existence of God:\n\nTheist - a person who BELIEVES in a god or gods\nAtheist - a person who does not believe in a god or gods\n\nAgnostic - a person who does not KNOW if there is a god or gods\nGnostic - an old term for an ancient religion of people who claimed to have a special way of knowing god.\n\nWhen viewed objectively every person is agnostic.  That is, every person is the same - no person KNOWS whether there is a god or not.  Of course, many theists think that they KNOW god is real, but actually it is just a very strong belief that they have, not knowledge.\n\nThe entire argument here is really between theists and atheists - people who believe in god(s) and people who don't believe in god(s).  Since no one is able to know with certainty whether there is a god or not, all people are in fact agnostic (that is, they do not KNOW whether there is a god or not), although very few admit it.\n\nAll people are actually agnostic.  Some people are atheist.  Most people are theist.  It's an interesting question: why do most people believe in something that no one knows?  When you think about aliens (ETs or UFOs) most people don't believe in them, at least not fervently.  Maybe a few ""oddballs"" do, but they are generally dismissed for believing fervently in something that they just have no way of knowing.  Not so with religion, and god(s).\n\nSo the question is: what evidence is there to support a belief in god(s)?  And more to the point, why do people believe, and often believe fervently, in god(s) when the available ""evidence"" is:\nA) insufficient\nB) often contradicted by science\nC) often logically unsound\n\nHere are some answers to some of your questions:\n\nQUESTION ONE\n""My opinion on the subject is how can God exist if theres no physical proof he ever existed?""\nWell, perhaps we just don't have the technology to detect his existence, perhaps things do exist that we have yet to detect.  Atoms have always existed, but until we had sophisticated microscopes we did not know it, and could not prove it, but some people did theorize that they existed.\n\nQUESTION TWO\n""Secondly, why are there different religions if theres 1 god, supposedly.""\nWhy are there different countries?  Well, the answer is geography, people are separated from other people, people in certain areas become one country, people in another area become another country.  Likewise, if there is a god who ""reveals himself"" to people in one country, they may have different stories to tell than a god who reveals himself in some other far away country, but it could be the same god! \n\n\nQUESTION THREE\n""Third, why do people who are strong ""believers"" always try to force you and push you to convert to there religion?""\n\nThat is a good question, which is connected to why most people are theists and also connected to why a large number of people are fervent believers despite the lack of evidence.  This could take a long time to give a thorough answer.\n\nThe primary reason that believers push their beliefs on others is because they are insecure.  Another word for insecurity is fear.  They are afraid of the world around them, and wish to control it as much as they can, in order to make themselves feel more secure.  Actually the primary reason people believe in religions (or why they believe the beliefs they push on others) is their fear, too, and the same fear that causes them to believe what they do causes them to push their beliefs on others.  People are afraid of mortality - they don't like (and very much fear) the idea that they will cease to exist, so they create complicated stories (mythologies,religions) that if they believe in it, assures them that they won't actually cease to exist -"

To my mind, being born in a particular country determines your nationality, regardless of where your parents are from. Having been born in the Philippines, you're just as much a Fillipino as any other person born there. That you have been mistaken to be white indicates that your ancestors were either European (most likely Spanish) or American. Both Spain and the US have controlled the Philippines in the past, so that is most likely where your heritage comes from. In the end, your family's heritage does not determine your nationality. You're Fillipino by birth.

Christian Counsel on Fasting. \nWhen Jesus was on earth he gave instruction to his disciples: “When you are fasting, stop becoming sad-faced like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to be fasting. Truly I say to you, They are having their reward in full. But you, when fasting, grease your head and wash your face, that you may appear to be fasting, not to men, but to your Father who is in secrecy; then your Father who is looking on in secrecy will repay you.” (Mt 6:16-18) He alluded here to the insincere fasting of the Pharisees, which he mentioned in an illustration on another occasion. (Lu 18:9-14) It was customary for the Pharisees to fast twice a week, on the second and fifth days of the week.—Lu 18:12.\n\nA person’s merely abstaining from food in a formalistic manner is described by Paul as subjecting oneself to decrees, “Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch,” and he says that “those very things are, indeed, possessed of an appearance of wisdom in a self-imposed form of worship and mock humility, a severe treatment of the body; but they are of no value in combating the satisfying of the flesh.”—Col 2:20-23.\n\nFasting has been enjoined on their members by some religious sects of Christendom, but the Bible itself gives no command to Christians to fast. When Jesus was talking to his disciples about fasting, as above (Mt 6:16-18), he and his disciples were still under the Mosaic Law and observed the Day of Atonement and its fast.\n\nThe text about fasting at Matthew 17:21, appearing in the King James Version, is not contained in some of the most important ancient manuscripts. Likewise, although the King James Version mentions fasting at Mark 9:29, Acts 10:30, and 1 Corinthians 7:5, according to such manuscripts these texts do not contain any references to fasting.\n\nSome have taken Matthew 9:15 as a command for Christians to fast. In reality, Jesus was merely making a statement of what was going to happen when he died. While Jesus was with his disciples on earth, it was not appropriate for them to fast. When he died, they did mourn and fast. But they had no cause for mournful fasting after his resurrection and especially after the marvelous outpouring of holy spirit. (Mr 2:18-20; Lu 5:33-35) Certainly Christians were not under obligation to fast on the anniversary of the Lord’s death, for the apostle Paul, correcting abuses in connection with the eating of supper at the congregation’s meeting place before the observance of the Lord’s Evening Meal, said: “Certainly you do have houses for eating and drinking, do you not? . . . Consequently, my brothers, when you come together to eat it [the Lord’s Evening Meal], wait for one another. If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, that you may not come together for judgment.”—1Co 11:22, 33, 34.\n\nWhile not fasting as a religious requirement, the early Christians did fast on special occasions. When Barnabas and Paul were sent on a special missionary assignment into Asia Minor, there was fasting as well as praying. Also, there was the offering of prayer “with fastings” when elders were appointed in a new congregation. (Ac 13:2, 3; 14:23) Hence, Christians are neither under command to fast nor prohibited from doing so.—Ro 14:5, 6.

Freedom from the past, and a new life with God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit.\n\nGod bless....
NO, but I was visiting my Nana In hospital  a couple of nights ago she is very ill and we are not sure if she was going to survive the night so i called up her Pastor of her church to come up to the hospital to give her communion when he arrived he read on of nans favourite Psalms as he was doing the reading all her vitals came perfect he breathing was normal and she looked completely relaxed, the sister came over and listened to my Nans chest and her was no sign of the infection that was killing her. The pnomonia is still severe and we are still not sure if she will make it but for atleast an hour she was comfortable, relaxed and able to tell her family how much she loves us. The Sister was so dumbstruck she asked the pastor to go prey for the rest of the Intensive care unit.  I don`t know If It was God, Jesus or Angles but it was certinaly devine.  P.S shes still hanging in there
"i agree with the asker on this one.  if you want to talk about religion go to church.  and if you have an important question ask your minister.  leave the internet for more exciting questions like ""what should i have for dinner tonight"" \n\n  oh by the way have meatloaf and greebeans"
Are you refering to the massive amounts of money being poured into the foundation that Gates and his wife started up? And the Billions that Buffet is going to eventually be adding? \n\nI think it is up to what becomes of the money/recources that are avalible. I think that they are changinge the way that orgs like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation are able to go about their buisness. But I think that other lasting changes really depend on the actions that they choose to take and the results that come of them. Digg this story! Its interesting!
It means that we all have our own version of the one Universal Truth known as God.  It's interesting the similarities that have cropped up through the ages and across the miles.
I think that it would be lovely for heaven's shelves to be stocked with Mon Cheri candies (by ferrerro) and to be able to feel them absorb into your soul as they digest.  \n\nIt might be nice to have angel food cake that makes your aura glow as you eat it.  \n\nYeah, I'm a little immaginative.  Lol.
"Absolutely!!! Many people don't bother learning when night school is free. My dad learned it, he may not be a scholar in the English language, but he learned it.\n\nWe have Spanish in radio, television, newspapers, magazines, books, movies, public services (gov't), banks, attorneys, restaurants, grocery stores, bus terminals, and the list goes on and on. In Southern California, there is a Spanish speaking version of almost everything. Unfortunately, this doesn't create an environment where learning English is a necessity. So soooo many people live most of their lives here while not being able to speak English. This is frustrating, because everyone at some level should be able to communicate with one another. We can't do that in a multi-lingual society.\n\nIf people wanna speak Spanish in their private lives, that's fine, they can speak whatever language they want. However, in public, everyone should be able to communicate on a basic level so that there isn't confusion or frustration. Other immigrants learn English, why aren't ""my cousins"" out there doing the same? I live in an area with many Armenians, and most of them speak English. Many are not scholars, but that's not necessary, all that's asked is that people are fluent on a basic level.\n\nBasic fluency should be a prerequisite of citizenship. This country should keep English as its official language, and not adopt any other language. Let's keep it at just one please, any more will make chaos!\n\nI'm Hispanic, and I don't take offense to this question at all. I don't believe it's meant that way. Everyone should get with the program, bottom line.\n\nP.S. This is not a racist question, I wish people would stop seeing it that way. Look, if someone is in the States for let's say, 10 years, and s/he still doesn't speak a lick of English, what do you call that? How about 20 yrs? 50, and still no English? Let's call it what it is people, it's laziness, pure and simple. No, I'm not saying that Hispanics are all lazy, I'm one of them. But how can you justify going to a country <voluntarily> and not learning the language of the land, especially if it's for years and years? I'm sure they don't like being poor, I'm sure they don't like not being able to speak with everyone, I'm sure they don't like the inconveniences of not being able to speak English. And yes, I'm 100% dead sure they are very kind and hard-working people, taking jobs Americans would never consider. But when it comes to learning English, there's SOME REASON WHY they just don't do it, and I don't get it, and I'm an immigrant's daughter. My dad's entire family came here from Mexico, not just him. He learned English, and yes, when we talk about this, he strongly agrees that Hispanics SHOULD learn English. It just keeps them poor otherwise.\n\nAnother point, if an American moved to a foreign country to live, they would be expected to learn that country's language and culture. It's not hard to figure out, this is a no-brainer.\n\nI don't get it, I just don't get it. Why elect to remain at such a disadvantage?\n\nAnd btw, English <is> the official language of the States, Clinton declared it."
"You are correct.  Athiests believe that there are NO ABSOLUTES.  Ask one if they are ABSOLUTELY sure.  It has been said that if you push an athiest off a cliff he will cry out to the God he doesn't believe in.  God doesn't want people to live their lives without Him.  You don't want to have to face God on judgment day (and yes if you believe or not it is coming) and tell Him you don't think He exists.  He did something for us.\n\nWhat God did...\n\nThink of it this way... Imagine you're in a courtroom again, you're guilty of many serious crimes. The judge says, ""It's a fine of $500,000, or prison."" You don't have anywhere near that amount of money, so the bailiff begins to walk you out of the courtroom when someone you don't even know appears. He runs up to the judge with a check and says, ""I've paid the fine for you."" Now that the fine has been paid, the law no longer has any hold on you. You're free -- because of the gift you were given.\n\nThis is what God did for you by sending Jesus to die on the cross in your place. So that you wouldn't have to go to Hell, God sent his only Son, Jesus, to die on the cross -- suffering the punishment that justice demands. Then He rose from the grave, forever defeating death! The Bible tells us, ""For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on Him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life."" (John 3:16) If you will repent of your sins and put your trust in Jesus, God says he will forgive all your sins and grant you the gift of everlasting life. Just like the court case we just talked about, if you repent (that means to confess and forsake your sins) and put your trust in Jesus, then you will not have to suffer God's justice in Hell because the payment for your crimes was made by Jesus on the cross.\n\nIf you're not sure what to pray, read Psalm 51, and make it a model for your prayer. The words are not ""magical,"" what God cares about is the attitude of your heart. When you pray, it should sound something like this, ""Dear God, I repent of all my sins, such as (name them). I put my trust in Jesus Christ as Lord (to say Jesus is your Lord means you are now making Jesus the master over your life) and Savior. Forgive me and grant me your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.""\n\nNow read your Bible daily, and obey what you read. God will never let you down."
"I guess that people who hate God have never really known Him.\n\nI was a full blown son of satan, though I had been raised as a believer, I too wanted to Sex drugs Rock and Roll and rejected my parents and their teaching.  I didn't want to be like them.\n\nAnyhow, I was listening to Handel's Messiah and was interested in the words...\n\nIsa 53:1  Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed? \nIsa 53:2  For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. \nIsa 53:3  He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. \nIsa 53:4  Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. \nIsa 53:5  But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. \nIsa 53:6  All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. \nIsa 53:7  He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. \nIsa 53:8  He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken. \nIsa 53:9  And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. \nIsa 53:10  Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. \nIsa 53:11  He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. \nIsa 53:12  Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors. \n\nwell, it made my heart burn to even think of it.  I knew it was Him in me.  So I repented, believing the scriptures were from him, and He has rewarded me every step of the way.\n\nI was as good as buried in a federal prison (I did 30 years)and he picked me up, way up to ride upon his shoulders (like the Josh Groban song ""You raise me up""...http://www.goldinc.com/~lizzie/momscd/) from the bottom of a solitary cell behing locked doors and barbed wire fences and armed guards.  He taught me obedience to Him means obedience to the authorities.  I stopped dope because he showed me it as a terrible bondage.  It's been great; a little tough, growing up finally, but it's still great.\n\nWhat's people's problem with God?  I dunno.  I guess they're angry about some of their hurts and blame God...\n\nHappy you're whole now, keep on being thankful for it all.\n\nloved your question."

Belief is both rational and irrational.But this applies to all things not just religion
It originated from an actual medical procedure. A species of parasite, Dracunculus medinensis (also known as the “guinea worm” or “fiery serpent”), is known to have existed in ancient Mesopotamian, Greek, Roman, and Arabian civilizations. It causes a disease known as dracunculiasis, which still commonly exists today in Egypt, Sudan, the Near East, India, Yemen and southern Russia. Being a parasitic worm that grows up to 1 meter in length, 2 mm in width and lives just under a human’s skin, it is a species that is easily recognized in ancient writings. To remove the parasite, a physician would cut the skin just in front of the worm’s path. As the worm slowly exited the skin, the physician would carefully wrap the worm around a stick over a period of days, until the entire animal was removed. Any rushing would result in a failed procedure and further complications. Physicians would advertise this service by displaying a sign of a worm wrapped around a stick. The procedure required technical know-how, patience, close attention and a delicate touch, which made it a fitting symbol of a physician’s care.\n\nThe symbol of a worm wrapped around a stick most likely served as the precursor to the Greek medical symbol of a snake wrapped around a staff. To many ancient people including the Greeks, the way a snake sheds its old faded dry skin and emerges as a healthy glistening creature with vivid colors represented a sort of renewed youth. This caused the snake to be commonly associated with the powers of healing, and thus to Asclepius, the god of healing. In Greece there were around 300 temples dedicated to Aesclepius. Many harmless snakes lived within these temples, where people would go to heal themselves.  Today the staff of Asclepius with snake entwined is used as a symbol by many professional medical organizations all over the world.

"We know some intriguing details about Christ - that He once was man (or like man, though Only Begotten Son of God), that He was divine, that He died and resurrected and sits on His throne with the Father, with whom He is one. One can speculate on analogies between Christ and the Father, but we know essentially nothing about the ""history"" of God the Father except that He is eternal. Lorenzo Snow, a President of the Church, once said ""As man now is, God once was: as God now is, man may be."" This controversial passage is clearly applicable to Christ, a God who became mortal for a time and yet was still and is still God. His work made it possible for us to become as He is, in a limited sense, for we can receive glorious resurrected bodies (Phil. 3:21; 1 Cor. 15:40-45), we can become ""joint-heirs with Christ"" (Romans 8:14-18), we can ""put on the divine nature"" (2 Peter 1:4-10), and we can become ""like him"" (1 John 3:2). Indeed, Christ even went so far at to say, ""Ye are gods"" (John 10:34), in reference to the divine potential of human beings. While He and the Father are the one true God, whom we will always worship, He does want us to become more like the Father (Matt. 5:48) and that possibility is there because of Christ. Thus, thinking of Christ and our relationship to Him, what Lorenzo Snow said is accurate. However, it appears that Lorenzo Snow's quote also applies to the Father, indicating that He also experienced a period of mortality, but we know nothing specific. But before you let the idea of ""God once being like man"" offend you, remember that it is explicitly true about Christ Himself. If Christ were the same being as God the Father, then it would also be true of the Father as well, so non-LDS critics who accept the doctrine of the Trinity shouldn't get so upset. Of course, we believe that God and Christ are separate individuals, one in purpose, heart, and mind. But, in the spirit of pure speculation, let me ask if it is possible that Christ, during His mission on the earth, was doing that which He had seen the Father do? In John 5:19, Christ said ""The Son can do nothing, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise."" Some people have speculated on what is meant by John 5:19 and on what Lorenzo Snow meant, but we do not know and I get very nervous when people pretend they know. Certainly there are many difficult and foolish questions which can be asked in this arena. The important point is that God, Christ, and man are of the same ""species,"" and that man has divine potential to become more like Christ and the Father (e.g., see Romans 8:14-18; 2 Peter 1:4-10; 1 John 3:2). This concept was understood by the early Christians, as I show at ""http://www.jefflindsay.com/LDSFAQ/FQ_theosis.shtml"". \n\nKnowing who Christ is makes me very suspicious of anyone who says that we will become EXACTLY like Him. The Bible teaches that we can become ""joint heirs"" (Rom. 8:14-18) and can become ""like him"" (I John 3:2) and indeed, need to become like him (Matt. 5:48) and be one with him (John 17:21-23). Stronger still, Paul in Philippians 2: 5-7 seems to urge us to pursue that goal, not through puffery, but through humble service: \n\n""Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: \nWho, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: \nBut made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant...."" \nHowever, I sense a world of difference between the ""small g"" gods that Christ mentioned (John 10:34) in speaking of the potential of humans (my view) and God the Eternal Father, who is the one and only everlasting God (see also I Cor. 8:5,6). The reference to humans as potential ""gods"" is clearly meant in a limited sense, but the word God uses nevertheless is ""gods."" Obviously, "

"Strongly disagree.  Secular morals involve things like ""Do not kill people because it is wrong.""  Whereas religious morals follow the tune of, ""Do not do this or you will go to hell.""  It is like speed limits.  Most people follow them because they don't want a ticket, not because they know it is safer.  Secular people follow morals because it is right, not to avoid punishment.\n\nIt is so sad that people think morals and religion are interrelated."
Yes, I know this. I hate the concept of Santa Claus.
while i dont personally believe in god, i believe that the story is that god was always there. that is very similar to many theories about the universe. the universe did not begin with the big bang but was only expanded by it. so god, like the universe, was always there if this god should exist.
"congratulations for using your mind.. as very less people use their mind today.\n\nI am a Muslim, i will answer regariding Islamic belief.\n\n================\n\nThe most concise definition of God in Islam is given in the four verses of Chapter 112 of the Qur’an:\n""Say: He is God,  The One and Only. ""God, the Eternal, Absolute.\n""He begets not, nor is He begotten. And there is none like unto Him.""  \n[Quran 112:1-4]\n \nsee how this 4 line definition answers all of your questions, just in one brush. this is the beauty of Quran.\n\n1.Say, He is God, One and only. \n\nGod cannot be more than ONE because if there were many gods besides God, then there would not have been such order in the universe, and each god would have taken away what he had created, and some would have lorded it over others. If there would have been many gods then each god would try to defeat others to establish his rule. \n\n(Quran 17:42-43) Say: If there had been (other) gods with Him, as they say,- behold, they would certainly have sought out a way to the Lord of the Throne! Glory to Him! He is high above all that they say!- Exalted and Great (beyond measure)! \n\n\n2. God, the Eternal, Absolute\n \n\nGod has to be Eternal then otherwise He would have a beginning. Suppose, we say God had a beginning, then there was a time when God did not exist. It means that he needed somebody else to make him exist. So there is somebody else who is God, not him. but as we agreed that there is only one God, therefore, there is no one else who make Him exist. When we say that God cannot be born, we are also saying that a creator cannot becomes his creation, because creation means what is in need of a creator. To be a creature, mean there had to be someone to create you. So if God becomes his creation, it means now he is in need of a creator. And this is absudity! As we know, A creation is not eternal. An eternal being is uncreated. We can conclude that the one God who is uncreated, has to be Eternal.\n\n3. ""He begets not, nor is He begotten""\n\nIt follows by logical necessity that if God is one, and if He is eternal, Then obviously He does not beget , Nor is he begotten. Because if He beget, then He will have a child and the child will have to be God-like. So there will then be two Gods. Since we agreed that there is only one God, you cannot have two.  OR If he was begotten, that means he would have father. Then the father will be older than him and more eternal than him. and we cannot have one who is more eternal than ""ETERNAL""\n\nIn Short, It is IMPOSSIBLE that God can LITERALLY have a son. \n\n4. And there is none like unto Him\nmeans He is unique unlike that which He has created.\n\n============================="

"I believe ""imacatholic2"" answered your question very well and they were right to reference the Catechism of the Catholic Church because it covers all bases including biblical references in case you are one of those that say, ""If it isn't in the Bible it doesn't exist."". You have to understand that the Bible doesn't always refer to some things by name, but by reference. Just like there are many references to a place where souls go to be purified before entering Heaven, even though the actual word ""Purgatory"" is not mentioned. The Bible was not written originally in English, so we should not quibble over semantics to get to Truth. So it is with ""Guardian Angels"". That particular English phrase is not spelled out but the references are numerous, and ""Imacatholic2"" spelled them out clearly and beautifully. I am a Catholic, too. God bless you,"

My wife developed schizophrenia 14 years ago, and I had to have her commited as she became a threat to herself and our son.

"A Course In Miracles is an answer to one woman's willingness to see.  She was an atheist with a Baptist background, working in a big medical center in New York City.  She and her boss had a prickly working relationship, until they both decided at about the same time that there must be a better way.  Once this was stated, the woman heard a voice say: ""This is a course in miracles.  Please take notes.""  \n\nSeven years later, after taking all the material down as dictated to her by the voice, A Course In Miracles was finished.  Because of her baptist background, (my opinion), the Course, along with the text, and the Workbook For Students, and The Manual For Teachers, is in a rather Christian sounding style, that I at first was uncomfortable with...until I began to practice what it teaches.  It works.  My study of this magnificent material over the last fifteen or so years, has transformed my life, and the lives of millions of other people."

First of all, I believe a person is not possessed by the devil himself, but instead by demons he sends out.  Demons are all around waiting for their opportunity to pick on someone.  They can not read a persons mind, but they know a persons weaknesses.  That's why a person falls into the same sinful traps over and over again.  Once a person identifies the tactics the enemy they can overcome their weaknesses.  Of course, identifying your weaknesses is the most difficult part since you must die to your own selfish desires (which are really the idols in your life).  Repenting for your sins is also very important because God gave his only son Jesus Christ so we will be forgiven.  Sometimes a demon-possessed person is so possessed they can only be set free by a person that has been given a gift by God to drive out demons through the blood of Jesus Christ.  So yes, I do believe there is a God and there is the devil.

"Catholic means ""universal"" in Latin.\n\nConstantine merged all the different religions into one and called it the ""Universal Religion."" The stated purpose of the Council of Nicaea was to develop a single philosophy that would become the official religion of the Roman Empire.\n\nHow that became ""Christianity"" is a mystery.\n\nThe Universal Religion is based on Pauline doctrine and is far more pagan than Hebrew. The Universal Church should be called the ""Church of Paul"" or ""Church of Constantine"" since it has little or no resemblance to anything Jesus did or taught."

I believe in God because I choose to. Why should it matter to you? I completely understand my God.
"Wow.  You are really taking Lev 26:30 out of context!!!\n\nYou're making it seem like God wants people to eat their own children.   \n\nRead the entire passage.  It's talking about famine being the result of disobedience against God.  \n\nThousands of years ago, if a famine struck, it was not uncommon for people to begin eating the flesh of those who had already died -- even their own family members.  \n\nWow.  Rarely have I seen someone so desperate to discredit and disparage religion, that they have taken a Bible verse so badly out of context.   \n\nHow utterly desperate you must be to prove your point, that you would resort to such an argument ""tactic."""

The davinci code is made up of gnostic texts that John warned about in the Bible . Read 1 John and 2 John.
i'd say that u r a little confused god told us in the sixth commandment not to commit adultry. he did say luv ur neighbor as your self but there are different kinds of love. i have never heard anyone in my church talk about gay ppl not having long lasting relationships. all i know is that being gay is against gods commandments and a sin.
Thank you! He has done that to me too.  He obviously is too chicken to let others respond to his ridiculous things.  And why is it that he can send us emails we can't respond to?
I'm doin' great, how 'bout you?
eeehhhhhhh no.
"It always amazes me how bilical literalists are so quick to claim (falsely) that there is no evidence for evolution, yet conveniently neglect to mention that there is NO evidence for the literal creation account taken from Genesis.\n\nAll creationist arguments boil down to either...\nAppeal to Ignorance (You don't know, therefore my theory is correct), \nAppeal to Incredulity (I can't imagine how the Archer Fish could have evolved, therefore they must have just magically appeared out of nothing).  \nAppeal to Authority-This is often lead into by quote mining.  Usually these quotes are from evolutionists, but the text is handpicked by creationists to give the reader the impression that a leading academic is doubting his own work.  Sometimes, the quote is from a creation ""scientist"" whose seeming academic acheivement makes his or her judgment trustworthy.  In any case, it is still a fallacy because scientists do not accept evolution just because Darwin, or anybody else, says so.  They simply agree that the theory best explains the evidence.\n\nHalf truths-Scientists do have an explanation for how the archer fish developed its ""firing apparatus.""  Even if they didn't, it wouldn't be proof of literal creation.  Many fish have mouths, roofs of mouths, movable tongues, and binocular vision.  The oldest fossilized fish had no jaw.  When creationists discover the fossil of an archer fish, buried unintrusively in the same age of gelological strata, then maybe they'll have evidence.\n\nand OUTRIGHT LIES!  Darwin never recanted on his death bed.\n\nAnyway...\nJesus wouldn't need to have anything explained to Him.  He is God in the Flesh, and as such, He would know all that The Creator knows, including the evidence for evolution and whether or not it was correctly interpreted.\n\nHis response would be the same, whether it was a creationist, a theistic evolutionist (like myself), or an atheist...\n\n""As long as you all engage in these petty, unnecessary, immature squabbles about what the Bible SAYS, you will never get to understand what it MEANS!!  I CREATED you because I LOVE you!  I DIED for you because I want you to LIVE with me, eternally!!\nYou need to know WHY.  You need to understand WHY.

No it is important for a priest to read from the order of the mass. Every word was be said exactly as it is written. It ia a mortal sin to drop or add anything from the missal. It is dangerous to memorize the words because you can always forget.

Uhm, there are. Many forms of Creole are found in the Carribean and Louisiana, all evolved from French into something more or less distinct. While similar enough to French that a French-speaker could usually understand the gist of what is being said in Creole and that a Creole speaker could make himself better understood with effort, it's separate enough that someone actually has to study the other to speak it fluently. Louisiana Creole takes this evolution from French further and incorporates some expressions from English.\n\n\nAnother half-languages you might be interested in is Luxumburgian, which evolved from a Dutch dialect with influences from French. Something possibly on the way to becoming a half-language is the difference between Quebecois French, which is similar to medieval French, and the more modern French spoken in France, and the deriviations found in western Africa. Another possibility is the differences between the various Englishes of the US alone. Can a Californian understand the heavy drawl of a Southerner or New Englander? Not easily, if at all, and I'm not even mentioning all the dialects of the British Isles.\n\nWhenever you see languages in the same family, they came from half-languages and sometimes still are effectively half-languages. Latin evolved separately in France, Spain, Italy, and Romania, though for a short enough time each was still only a regional dialect or half-language and could be understood by each other, especially if they made the effort to enunciate clearly. We can see the slow shifting of German as it went from the west to east through Europe, eventually becoming English. A German can sometimes understand the gist of Dutch even today with a lot of work, and vice versa.

I call upon you; answer me, O God. Turn your ear to me; hear my prayer. (Psalm 17:6)\n\nWith love in Christ.
It is what it is, no man knows when Jesus is coming back, that is why it is best for everyone to be prepared at all times for his return.  Many false prophets will rise up, think of it this day, everyday is the last day b/c eventually it will all end.
I'm not intimidated by that or by you. Actually, I feel very sad for you and I pray that you will come to know Jesus as your personal LORD and Savior before it is too late.

"That story is the product of someone's imagination and a perversion of the Scriptures. Probably the person who made it up had a problem in that area himself and ""read into"" the Scriptures to give himself some sort of justification for his own sins. Compare these two passages. The first one is where this false teaching has it's shaky foundation.\n\nAnd lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.  2 Corinthians 12:7-9 \n\nMany scholars have wrestled with trying to determine exactly what the ""thorn"" in Paul's flesh was and no one has come up with a definitive answer but only a plethora of theories. That he might have been a womanizer doesn't even make it to the top 10 of that list of possibilities. Then look at what Paul said about himself and marriage and fornication.\n\n""Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman. Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband. Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband. The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife. Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency. But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment. For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that. "" 1 Corinthians 7:1-7 \n\nPaul had what is known as the gift of celibacy or staying single without being overcome by lust. Jesus talked about this to his disciples although He didn't use that term for it.\n\n""For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.""  Matthew 19:12 \n\nNotice that Jesus doesn't make this a command to give up having sex in order to serve God but says for those who are able to receive it, let them receive it."
It depends entirely on the character of the person answering the question. You forgot to mention the woefully misinformed.
"(m)\n\nHobo is a term that refers to certain wandering homeless people, particularly those who make a habit of freighthopping. The iconic image of a hobo is that of a downtrodden, shabbily-dressed and perhaps drunken male, one that was solidified in American culture during the Great Depression. Hobos are often depicted carrying a bindle.\n\nThe hobo imagery has been employed by entertainers to create wildly succesful characters in the past, most famously Emmett Kelly's ""Weary Willy"" and Red Skelton's ""Freddy the Freeloader""."

"If you insist, I will answer. I will give now a short answer , but later on I want to give a real long answer. I have final exams; therefore, I have hurry. Remind me , again!\nAnyway, first of all I wonna know the exact part of Quran from which this muslim has quoted these words. I didn't memorized the whole book . And I want to read this part , again because I want to read the whole paragraph. \nHere is my answer. You are right. God is omniscient and not only omniscient. Time has no meaning for him. He is not time dependent. There is no before or after for him. So, we cant talk about ""He made a mistake (past) but will(future) not do again."" . Quran speaks clearly about the perfection of Quran and its invulnurability. You know my answer about the bible's corruption . So, there is no god's mistake , ther is only choice, order and creation of the god, which is mistakeless. What happened to bible was not a mistake, but may be a sign of it completed its duty and an other one will come. The deaths of the prophets was the same thing, their duty was over. They completed it. So, there is no mistake about it. This person has given to you a wrong answer or couldn't explain his thought clearly and made a mistake. \nBesides that! These two sentences from Quran (but I want to see the whole paragraph, I hope they are really quotes.) means that: \nSecond one (you will never do it) is pretty clear. \nFirst one (you wouldn't be able to do it) is telling about the mistake of people. It is a sentece like : If you are really true believers, you wouldn't be able to do it"" because true believers respect the God and this respect contains also a fear! Fear of doing such a great mistakes which will corrupt the book of god. People who corrupted the bible and old tastament will pay for it! They were just liers , who seemed some times as good people or real priests or what ever. This is underlined with these words of Quran. I am not adding to these group every one. There were great christian saints even after corruption. God bless them! But esspecially in the times of old testament , man of religion changed it a lot for their own good and won more power over people! I think that is enough for now! Funny thing is this sentence doesn't mean your comment. Your answer is manipulating the meaning. OK, may be you really understand it  that way and that's why you asked it. I hope it was a misunderstanding  or questioning not a manipulation. \nBye for now!\n\nWhen you can find me the correct numbers of the quote, I will read the whole paragraph. I also will try to find it. It is my responsibility and I will keep it!"
"Many Catholics do not understand their own church doctrinal beliefs, and merely go with what the priest tells them.  I would highly suggest reading the books ""Babylon Mystery Religion"", ""A Woman Rides the Beast"", and ""The Two Babylons""...all 3 are very good at digging into the traditions that the RCC mixed into Christianity ....bringing Baal worship to Christ (with the various means you mentioned and more).\n\nKeep in mind, I'm neither Catholic nor Protestant (Old fashioned bible believing Baptists were never a part of the Catholic church so were never a part of the ""Reformation"" that led to Protestants).  I do know of women who have come from the RCC who saw that the very things you mentioned were wrong after having been taught them as necessary to salvation.  Keep in mind also, that the Catholic bible is worded differently than the ones noncatholics use...the 10 Commandments are not the same...take a look online and you will see the difference...the part on idol worship is not there."
there is not reason to not let them . the idea of not letting gays get married is sole based in really old people who cannot understand that everyone has rights and that the right to get married is included not matter who u are or which are your preferences .\n\nabout the bible i think it is respectable if a religion refuses to marry gays but the government is not part of any religious group so it shouldn't give preferences to anyone whether they are heterosexual or homosexuals . who u get married to only matters to the person who is getting married and it has nothing to do whit anybody else included the religious groups and the government .

The Yahoo! Gods have answered our prayers and seen fit to restore her...\n\nPractically speaking, I've often suspected that a lot of Yahoo!'s suspensions are automated. Probably whenever somebody reports abuse, it's added to a database, and after someone gets a certain number of reports, the computer automatically shuts down the account. This, of course, tilts the scales against long-term and well-known users, because sooner or later someone will report you. I think the system really prefers semi-anonymous figures who ask fact-based questions that don't require thought and give fact-based answers that don't show thought. Mediocrity wins out in the end.\n\nTwo suggestions I could make to Yahoo! would be to counterweigh abuse reports with the time someone's been on the site - someone who's amassed 20 abuse reports in 12 hours is clearly more of a threat than someone who's amassed 20 abuse reports over several months - and to offer some kind of counterbalance to abuse reports - something to accentuate the positive and not just the negative, like on eBay where feedback on a user can be positive or negative.\n\nBut Yahoo! is a private company and has the right to behave however they want... Our two choices are to accept it or walk away...\n\n----------\n\n(edit: A better question is why they haven't suspended someone like Sara F, who gives answers as ignorant as the one above...)

Alton, Illinois is said to be one of the most haunted cities in the world.  It was the site of a prison during the Civil War with particularly harsh treatment of prisoners.  After the war, the prison stood for a while, then people started taking the stones from the walls and distributed them throughout the town, using them for walls and all sorts of things.  It is believed the spirits of those who suffered followed the stones.  \n\nProbably the most haunted buildling in the world is the Tower of London, site of hundreds of executions.  Ghosts here include animals from a menagerie that was once kept on the grounds, two young princes who were killed there, Queen Anne Boleyn (said to lead a ghostly procession of lords and ladies to her grave), and the Countess of Salisbury -- 70 at the time of her execution, she refused to lay her head on the chopping block and ran, causing the executioner to chase her and hack at her neck until she died.  It is said that the countess can be seen re-enacting her death.

No, I pretty much just pop into existence whenever you think of me.\n.\n.\n.\nOk, so that was sort of a joke. But really it depends on your idea of “self.” I do not believe that, metaphysically, I am an independent existing self or soul. My physical body is distinct from your body, so my perspective is distinct from yours, but this manner of speaking in terms of “I” and “you” as distinct souls or isolated selves is misleading. Existence is ultimately a unity. Every experience is experienced as “mine.” When you have the visual experience of seeing a tree, you can think about this experience and say with confidence: “This is MY experience.” Similarly, if I look at a tree, I can say with confidence: “This is MY experience.” We can also say with high degree of confidence that we are talking about two experiences. Even if the experience are qualitatively identical (i.e., we are looking at identical trees with identical backgrounds and experiencing the exact same sorts of bodily sensations and we both happen to happen to experience the same sorts of emotions and memories when viewing the tree, etc.) we would still want to say that these experiences are numerically distinct because, upon further investigation, we will discover that we have two distinct physical bodies, and we are having these experiences at unique locations in spacetime. But when we consider “who” it is who, in each case, claims that the experience is “mine” we find something interesting. The “feeling of being mine” is (or at least seems like it could be) what philosophers call a “universal”. A universal is basically a property or attribute that exists whenever and/or wherever a particular thing instantiates it. Take a shape, for example, like “round.” The shape “round” exists wherever a round thing exists. There is one shape “round” that exist in many different places (round baseballs, soccer balls, soap bubbles…). My suggestion is that the experience of “mineness” is a universal, and furthermore, the deeper roots of universality (of any sort) are to be found in the Oneness of the SOURCE of all experience. There is, you might say, one Experiencer having many different experiences, and the differences in these experiences are based on the differences in the embodied perspectives associated with each instance of experience. I would say that the Experiencer is the universe itself. “I” am the universe experiencing existence from my perspective, and you are the one and same universe experiencing existence from your perspective. So, would “I” exist if “you” did not know of me? It depends one whether you are thinking in terms of the Universal Experiencer, or the individual embodied experiences. My body, and thus my own experience of “mineness” would exist whether your embodied consciousness knows of my individual existence or not. But in terms of the Universal Experiencer, obviously “I” can exist only so long as “you” (in your deepest metaphysical Identity as the Universal Experiencer) in some sense “know” about me (because at this metaphysical level of discussion, the “you” and “I” are one and the same Being).

"You and I both know the answer to this. It's not perverted. \n\nIt's that you're questioning them about their god in a way they've never been questioned about before, nor have questioned themselves.

"Yes, because you are sinning against God by failing to consider Him first in your actions (violating the 1st commandment, ""You shall have no other gods before Me.""), making a ""god"" to suit yourself (idolatry, a violation of the 2nd commandment, ""You shall not make any idols.""), dishonoring you parents name (regardless if they care, the 5th commandment says, ""Honor you father and mother."").\n\nIf money, sex, or the ""fame"" of being a stripper is more precious to you than Him, you are denying Him by your lust for sin.\n\nIf it was your daughter, would you care if she became a stripper?  (Keep in mind, the drugs, lusting men, the prostitution, and corrupt ""businessmen"" she'd be interacting with on a daily basis)  Do you really ""want"" to be a ""stripper"" with all of its consequences?  Men will disrespect you by lusting for your body, without any concern for you.  ""Businessmen"" will pretent to ""care"" for you, but only as a front for using you and your body for their own gain.  You will be exposed to a dark world of exotic drugs, deception, temptatiion, and evil on a regular basis.  Are you ready for all of this?  You are a woman.

God doesn't call us to live without sin.\n\nI will sin again tomorrow, several times before the day is over.\n\nGod calls us to make the World a better place.

We do this by caring and loving each other.\n\nEveryday we are called to bring Heaven to Earth.\n\nGod knows your intentions. He's more interested in saving you than condemning you.\n\nDon't give up on fighting sin, but take it one day at a time. Maybe you beat a particular sin today, but you won't tomorrow. He understands we're not perfect.\n\nIf this particular sin is especially threatening to yourself, your relationships, or to others, then do everything to fight it, but don't be dismayed by occasional loss.\n\nGod Bless.

You've answered your own question the best.  The answer is simply pride.  Pride makes a person not want to admit when they are wrong or when they sin. That is why pride is one of (if not the) most dangerous sins.  I can't explain it any better than you just did. I can only agree with you and say Amen.

"I think a few of the more serious answers, that were obviously written by people who believe the bible, were very good. I just wanted to add that you can get a good book from a notable Christian author titled The Kingdom of the Cults, by Walter Martin. It has a short synopsis on all major cults. This book actuallys lays them out side-by-side with Christianity so that you can see the difference in what you believe, vs. what they believe. It keeps you prepared  to ""give a reason for the faith you have"", without you having to actually dive in and read the whole Book of Mormon etc. \nShalom - Maranatha . :)"

It makes no difference whatsoever, if homosexuality is inborn or chosen.  Whatever the reason for the desire may be, it doesn't matter.  The desire has never been the issue.  The issue is what any given homosexual chooses to do about that desire.  Does he choose to follow it, and have sex with members of the same gender, or does he not?  The desire can't be helped, but the actions certainly can.  He (or she) has no less of an obligation to live a Christian lifestyle than anyone else does, and that includes all aspects of sex as much as it does anything else.  It might be harder for them in that way, but it's no less necessary.  That can't be watered down.

I think we're all racist to some degree. I think it's genetically inherent as a means of self-defense. It's natural to have some fear of things that are unfamiliar. That doesn't make it wrong. What makes is wrong is being discriminatory.\n\nThe key is to rise above the animal instinct and the only way to do that is to put yourself in a position where you are surrounded by people who are not like you. Only then can you become comfortable with people of different colors and cultures other than your own. It is a major disservice to yourself to remain isolated in this increasingly multi-cultural world where borders basically mean nothing anymore.\n\nThe most racist people are the ones that don't even try. You cannot grow as a person if you don't try, and thus, you are not really contributing to the world.

Without the fruits', you can't see if you living the word, because the fruits play a big part in walking, talking and living this word, that's how people see the word in you. So. I am a big fan of God, which make  me a true bible believer..
Jesus and God the Father are seperate individuals, and Jesus was made a little less than God the Father. No one can fully understand the Trinity until the Kingdom of Heaven is setup, then Jesus will explain. Remember no one knows the Father except the Son.
"OK, Seester, you asked for it!\n\nThe custom of applauding is doubtless as old and as widespread as humanity, and the variety of its forms is limited only by the capacity for devising means of making a noise. Among civilized nations, however, it has at various times been subject to certain conventions. Thus the Romans had a set ritual of applause for public performances, expressing degrees of approval: snapping the finger and thumb, clapping with the flat or hollow palm, waving the flap of the toga, for which last the emperor Aurelian substituted a handkerchief (orarium), distributed to all Roman citizens (see Stole). In the theatre, at the close of the play, the chief actor called out ""Valete et plaudite!"", and the audience, guided by an unofficial choregus, chaunted their applause antiphonally. This was often organized and paid for (Böttiger, Über das Applaudieren im Theater bei den Alten, Leipz., 1822).\n\nWhen Christianity became fashionable the customs of the theatre were transferred to the churches. Eusebius (Hist. Eccl. vii. 30) says that Paul of Samosata encouraged the congregation to applaud his preaching by waving linen cloths (οθοναις), and in the 4th and 5th centuries applause of the rhetoric of popular preachers had become an established custom.\n\nThough, however, applause may provide a healthy stimulus, its abuse has led to attempts at abolishing or restricting it even in theatres. The institution of the claque, people hired by performers to applaud them, has largely discredited the custom, and indiscriminate applause has been felt as an intolerable interruption to serious performances. The reverential spirit which abolished applause in church has tended to spread to the theatre and the concert-room, largely under the influence of the quasi-religious atmosphere of the Wagner performances at Baireuth. In Germany (e.g. the court theatres at Berlin) applause during the performance and ""calling before the curtain"" have been officially forbidden, but even in Germany this is felt to be in advance of public opinion.\n\nIn most western countries, audience members clap their hands at random to produce a constant noise; however, it tends to synchronize naturally to a weak degree. As a form of mass nonverbal communication, it is a simple indicator of the average relative opinion of the entire group; the louder and longer the noise, the stronger the sign of approval. In other cultures, audiences clap rhythmically in unison, about two claps per second, to indicate approval. Clapping in unison might also, however, be understood as disapproval, and an insult to the performer. During musical events, it is common for an audience to clap in the rythm of the song, to cheer the artists present on stage.\n\nFamous performers, as well as celebrities in other fields such as politics, may also receive applause when they first appear on stage, before they deliver a speech or their first speaking part. This accolade given in response to his or her past achievements and is not a reflection of the performance the audience is attending.\n\nOn some occasions, applause can also occur in the middle of an event. The President of the United States, in his State of the Union address, is often interrupted by applause; in fact, tracking the number of such interruptions has become a trend for various television news channels. It is often customary for jazz performers to receive applause in the middle of a tune, after completing an improvisational solo section.\n\nThe phrase ""slow clap"" usually refers to the tentative beginning of applause, especially in American movies from the 1980s (as parodied in Not Another Teen Movie). It derived its dramatic usefulness as an indicator of a shift between public scorn and public praise. But at other times the slow clap could be considered insulting or ironic.\n\n(PS Thanks Dr. Dan!)"

Judas didn't want to do it. I always believed that Judas was chosen by Jesus to be the one who turned him in. Jesus knew he had to die and chose his friend to make it happen. He didn't betray Jesus. He was following orders. Jesus told Judas he would betray him. A lot of people see this as Jesus telling the future. I say he didn't tell him that he would betray him. He told him he had to.

What should you do if you sense that you have offended a fellow worshiper? Jesus said: “If, then, you are bringing your gift to the altar and you there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar, and go away; first make your peace with your brother, and then, when you have come back, offer up your gift.” (Matthew 5:23, 24) You can apply that counsel by taking the initiative to go to your brother. With what objective? To “make your peace” with him. To that end, you may need to acknowledge, not deny, his hurt feelings. If you approach him with the goal of restoring peace and maintain that attitude, likely any misunderstanding can be cleared up, appropriate apologies made, and forgiveness extended. When you go out of your way to make peace, you show that you are guided by godly wisdom.
"ancient times barbers?\nhmm, which ancient times and what locations of these ancient sites?\n\nScissors have been found dated back pretty far.  All scissors are are two knives put together in a fulcrum.  That would suggesst someone with engineering knowledge developed it.  Which sounds amazingly like the Romans, and we all know the Romans were famous for adopting a cultures benefits and calling it their own.\n\nBefore that, marvelous idea of fulcrummed scissors, I would think knives of all sorts were used.  Sharped ""things"" that alowed one to cut hair like rope. or even early razors in the form of shells and other fine instruments that would not cut the skin.\n\nBefore the idea of groomly dress and appearance to impress I don't think many people worried about it."

If you have to be afraid of something in your faith, there is something seriously wrong.  Using fear to sway a person is actually quite sick."
"I am a Christian.  And my answer is no.  I have studied God's Word and continue to do so and the most important teachings of Yeshua/Jesus are to love your enemy, do good to those who persecute you, return evil with kindness.  Love God with all your heart, soul, strength and mind and love your neighbor as yourself. \nAs a Christian we are warned that in the last days there will be many ""false prophets"" and we will know them ""by their fruit"" (the results of their actions).  And as Christians, we hope for a Christian leader.  But we must not be blind to the possibility that a politician would dishonestly ""court"" the Christian vote when it is their only way to get elected."

Yes neo. If there is no spoon, you can bend it by realizing it is your mind that is bending. You can realize that god is just a way to control, and by realizing there is no god, you can do what you want. God is not real, it is in your head, and you are the thing making (miracles, etc.) It is your life, so wake up, and take the red pill. I saw the movie. Yes, it tells you to free your mind. It applies to many things, religion is 1.
The first beast rises out of the sea, that is peoples of the world.\nIt has 7 heads and ten horns.\nThe 7 heads are dominions or continents.\nThe ten horns are power or rulers (crowns).\nThis beast is a political system or one world system.\nThe deadly wound is to the one world political system.\n\nNote: This rising is not abrupt but gradual. Also if you visit the United Nations web page. There is a global map on there with the regions of the world color coded. Yep 7 regions.\n\nNote: The reign of Satan has been shortened. The 7 years and the 3 1/2 years of prophesy have been shortened.\n\nMat 24:22  And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened. \n\nThey have been shortened to a 5 month period or 150 days. The time of the locust which is May through September. The end thereof shall be with a flood (flood of lies).\n\nDan 9:26  And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined. \n\nJust like Noah's deluge but only spiritual.\n\nGen 7:24  And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days. \n\n5 months or 150 days or May through September.\n\n\nThe second beast is Satan as Christ.

Mankind was made in the image of God.\n1) God is Spirit, but He made mankind flesh and blood by creating something out of nothing.\n2) The physical man has an end, but the soul of man is immortal meaning it will never die.\n3) Man has the gift of thinking, of which animals do not. Man also has a free-will to choose right or wrong. Animals do not. Animals have instinct, mankind has reason.\n4) Man did not have to use his conscience until after the fall in the Garden of Eden. After they sinned against God, their consciences were used to guide them.\n5) Man is limited to the laws of the physical universe while he is still alive in the flesh. Once a man dies he will live in the realm of the spiritual and will have no limitations like he does now.\n6) Man has freedom to make choices but he cannot change his chief end. The chief end of all mankind is to praise and glorify Jesus Christ for all eternity.
It depends from what angle you are looking at. Let's go through a few:\n\nGrammar.\nPortuguese and Spanish grammar share pretty similar grammar in terms of syntax (word order etc), and the idea of nouns, verbs, adjectives etc. However, portuguese is slightly more complex in that they have pronoun contractions (for example 'give that to me' uses a contraction of 'to' and 'me' to form 'mo' (me+o=mo). Spanish uses the two pronouns seperately. \n\nVerb-wise, the portuguese has the same tenses as spanish, however where the spanish might use a compounded form only (eg the pluperfect tense being comprised of the imperfect form of 'haber' plus the past participle), Portuguese interchanges between a compound form ('ter' + past participle), it also has an inflected form (eg 'comprar' becomes either 'tenhia comprado' or 'comprava').\n\nThe Portuguese also likes to make work for itself in that it has two forms of the past participle. The 'proper' form as it were for grammatical use, and the 'irregular' form for expression as an adjective eg 'impresso' and not 'imprimido' for 'printed'.\n\n\nVocabulary\nYes, portuguese does share a LOT of vocabulary with spanish. HOWEVER, in a lot of cases they have completely different words for things eg 'crianca' (excuse the lack of accent) for girl, where it is 'chica' in spanish. As previously mentioned, sometimes the word exists in both languages, but means another thing altogether (eg 'polvo' meaning 'octopus' in portuguese, but 'dust' in spanish).\n\nACCENT\nThe portuguese accent is VERY VERY different to spanish. It sounds like a Russian trying to speak Spanish while trying to eat. Lots of nasalised vowels and clipped endings. This is especially moreso in Brazilian portuguese, where they are even more nazally.\n\nIn conclusion, Portuguese is harder to learn than spanish, but if you've already got knowledge of spanish it should be fairly easy to pick up.

"The correct term is The Netherlands or Koninkrijk der Nederlanden in dutch,...it refers to (as you will see below in greater detail) low lands.  I lived in Belgium and it was called Pays Bas which means flat land.  We call it Holland in the U.S. but that is actually incorrect as it only refers to a small portion of the nation.  It is known by flat or low lands because it is primarily a flat country which is why flooding is such a major issue for them.\n\nBelow is some info from wikipedia:\n\nHolland is commonly used as a synonym for the Netherlands as a whole, while actually it just refers to the central-western part of the country. This part consists of two of the twelve provinces of the country, namely North Holland and South Holland.\n\nHistorically Holland was the most powerful district of the Netherlands: the counts of Holland were also counts of Hainaut, Flanders and Zeeland for several periods in the 13th-15th century; during the period of the Dutch Republic the stadholder of the Holland was the most powerful politician in the Netherlands, and he often also was stadholder in other provinces; the cities in Holland were important trading cities, for instance six cities in Holland made up the Dutch East India Company. Still the two provinces, making up Holland, are very strong: they house 37.1 percent of the Dutch population.\n\nThe name 'Holland' is used in the Netherlands as well, especially in relation to soccer, where ""Holland!"" is shouted out loud by Dutch soccer fans. Furthermore do Dutch tour operators and tourist information centres use the term, because the name 'Holland' is better known worldwide.\n\nThe name Holland ultimately stems from ""holt land"" (""wooded land""). A popular, but incorrect, fake etymology holds that it is derived from hol land (""hollow land""), inspired by the low-lying geography of both the region."

"Your boyfriend is on the cusp of these two signs. \n\nIndividuals born on the cusp of Aries (the first Sign of the Zodiac) and Taurus (the second Sign of the Zodiac) are ruled by both Mars and Venus. Intrinsic in this combination is the aesthetic romantic love typified by the Planet Venus and the passionate, action-orientation afforded by the Planet Mars. Such natives must feel deeply the focal point of their life and pursue it boldly. This cusp complements actors, actresses, fashion designers and dancers, who feel that the beauty and drama of life springs forth from the deepest urges of creation.\n\nThe Aries/Taurus cusp combination, also known as the Cusp of Power, corresponds symbolically to the period of human life at around the age of seven years. Here, the fire element of Aries and the earth element of Taurus can be both constructive and destructive. The constructive side of this blend displays a harnessing of energy to support and promote domestic existence. The Taurus aspect of this cusp has the expectation of creating something for posterity...the creation of children, the establishment of relationships and business are all equally important in the life of this particular mixture...and chivalry reigns supreme. The ""down"" side of this cusp demonstrates itself in burnout. The practical aspects of creating life here on Earth can stifle or even obliterate the inspiration inherent in this combination. Frustration occurs when the desire to propel the dream is thwarted by those of lesser motivation or real world restrictions. The typical ""bull in a china shop"" syndrome can manifest itself under difficult auspices and the desire to tear down structures that do not support the tender side of this personality become evident. Competition for a mate can take over the mentality of this cuspian until victory or failure is achieved. Children born of this combination need to be encouraged to pursue activities and studies that they love. The carry-over from Mars, the governing Planet of Aries, gives this cusp an impetuous touch that can become both powerful and dangerous through the self-willed and often stubborn nature of Taurus, which is controlled by the emotional and pleasure-loving Venus. When these cuspians act impulsively, then their plans suffer. However, they seldom ""give up the ship."" Having begun as go-getters, they become bullheaded and determined see it through. Often, they will take up enterprises just to prove that they can put them across...and they usually do. Because of this, these natives should exert their powers along honest and worthwhile lines. The self-esteem found in this cusp combination is exceeded only by the urge for self-gratification, which will invariably make its subjects unreasonable and overbearing unless self-control is developed."
"Freemasonry is a large and diverse group of human beings. I cannot not speak for all or even most of them. I will speak only for what I have experienced.\n\nFreemasonry is not a religion. In our Order, we say it is a kind of morality, veiled in allegory, and illustrated by symbols. \n\nWe stress the Golden Rule (do unto others as you would have them do unto you). There are many other rules of conduct that we find work in the betterment of oneself and the world. Some of those expressions have come into wide use in English: someone who ""levels"" with you, treats you ""square,"" etc.\n\nWe speak about moral lessons in story form. I am sure you know things like ""the little boy who cried wolf"" (that is an example of allegory, a story with a moral). \n\nWe use the tools of operative masons (those who build real buildings) as symbols, as objects for contemplation and study. When we teach by symbols, we learn much about the inside of the person asking about them as well as those hearing the response. \n\nFor some Freemasons, the organization is strictly fraternal and devoted to good works. That in itself is a wonderful thing. The Shriners (an offshoot of the Freemasons) have hospitals that treat children with burns and disabilities free of charge.\n\nFor some Freemasons, Freemasonry is the heir to the Ancient Mystery schools. It is a way of achieving what some have termed enlightenment. As far as I know, Freemasonry works to make good people better. \n\nWe do, at least in my Order of Freemasonry (American Co-Masonry) insist that the candidate for admission must believe in a Supreme Being. We do not press them further about that belief. We thus admit Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, etc. We insist also that the person is of good character already, not an anarchist, and is of age (usually 21).   \n\nWhere American Co-Masonry differs from those others calling themselves Freemasons (or ""real"" Freemasons) is that we admit women to full membership, rights, and privileges. We admit all races, also.\n\nIf you wish more information, feel free to write to me and click on the link below to read more on our history."

God created them plan and simple.  The earth before the flood (which very major civilizations has a flood story and there is ecological evidence for a flood.)  had a much different atmosphere then we do now and this allowed animals to grow much larger then they do now.  so this can accommodate some fossils but still dinosaurs and humans coexisted.  and there is proof.  there is identifiable dinosaur footprints that were made with man's footprints next to and crossing the dinosaurs foot prints.  the same evidence scientist use to disprove God proves Dinosaurs and man thought to be separated by 65 million years lived side by side.  and yes i have seen these fossils they are real but evolutionist doesn't  want the public to know about these footprints because it destroys  everything they believe in.  creation sings the wonderful Glory of God

There can be nothing worse than the complete opposite of the Truth.\n\n(The worst heresy to come from the U.S. would have to be the ""Building Fund."") \n\nRaleigh, North Carolina, USA"

the closest thing that i can think of is leather pride. It is either that or: The black-medium blue-black flag is actually a police mourning band. It is typically worn as a band across the badge when an officer is killed in the line of duty. I have seen it in use more frequently now as a bumper sticker, I believe this is probably a show of respect for the police officers killed on September 11th.
I'm seriously trying to figure out how to do that....God bless u
O' foolish man,  it is not what GOD would do,  it IS what man does.  If you believe in Jesus Christ and confess him then you will be saved [Romans 10:9-10]\nSalvation is not earned by works, it is a gift of God through faith, [Eph 2:8-9]\nIf you belive on him who GOD sent you are doing the work of GOD.  That is the end of man to glory GOD [1Cor. 10:30]\nHave faIth and love your brother and leave useless speculations alone.  In love I write this.
Weird kind of fun, since the points aren't really worth anything.  Of course, goombahs like this pretty much ensure the points never will be worth anything.
depends on what religion you believe in.  a lot believe that its like a ladder; you have to learn certain lessons before you can progress to the next rung.  some also follow the philosophy of what goes around comes around: for example someone who murdered or molested others during there life would in turn have it done to them in the next life.
odd odd question but ok....when i was 11 i was in the swimming pool and my step mom was tanning, i was playen with an inflatibale boat and thought it would be fun to flip it over and play underneath it in the 3 end. Well  next think you know my feet did not touch i must of travled over to the 8 end and so i paniced and tried swimming underneath the boat to reach the service..but everytime i did the boat was to so heavy it keep on following me and i keep coming up underneath it. I tried grabing on the sides but it was to big for my hands and really slippery so i keep on sliding off. I keep on kicken and kicken to stay aflout cuz i got tired then right when i was so exsosted from swimming i went under and swollowed water. Then i felt my feet touch the ground, i guess i swam so far around the pool i ended up back to square 1 and i pushed the boat up and started coughen and throwing up.
"Yea.  This is my favorite friggin' drinking game.\n\nThe entire deck is dealt to however many people are playing (you need at least 3 and more than 7 or 8 gets tough).  The person with the three of clubs goes first on the first hand.\n\nOrganize your cards by number.  Seperate pairs or triples.\nYou need to play either the same number or higher than the person before you.  You can't play doubles unless the first person who started the round puts down doubles.\n\nIf you can't play a card, you drink.  The round clears if it's your turn again and nobody played on the card you threw.  When it clears, you can throw down any card you want.  \n\nHere are some important rules once you get the idea:\n1.) a two clears the board.  play these when the numbers get too high (ex. Aces) or when there's a pair and you can't go.\n2.) fours are social.  If you have a four, you can lay it down on anything (even doubles).  Everyone at the table hits glasses and has a drink.\n3.) When you only have one card left, you have to say ""last card.""  If you don't, you are automatic @$$hole for the next game.  If somebody else messes this up after you, they are @$$hold instead.\n4.) You can't go out on a two or four (ie: clear or social).  If you do, you're automatic @$$hole.\n5.) If you play the same number card as the person before you, the person who plays after you is skipped and they have to drink.\n\nThe first person to get rid of all their cards is the president.  The last is the @$$hole.  The @$$hole gets people drinks, shuffles the cards, deals, gives their best card to the president and gets the presidents worst card in return, and drinks whenever somebody tells them to.  But be careful, it might be you next hand.\n\nYou will keep track of the order in which people get rid of their cards.  You can tell people to drink if you are above them.\n\nThere are some other rules too, but this should get you a good start."
well that does kind of present a problem... but if you believe in God than you would already be following Jesus... therefore, problem solved... you would have to believe in both and not just one or the other.  So yes- all things are possible - if you believe and follow the teachings...
Just wrap a towel around your head, everyone will think that you are Muslim! Even God himself will not know the difference!
I assume your question refers to... if the ice in the north pole were to melt why would it destroy the ozone, and why would there be more fossil fuel released... and how did the fossil fuel get their?\n\nWell the 7 continents use to be a single continent called Pangea, at the end of the Triassic period the land mass began to split apart.  Millions of years later there was an ice age.  Animals use the ice as passageways to other lands.  Many died during the crossings.  This supplies us fossil fuel.\n\nAs far as the effects of the ice melting im afraid I could find no information on that.... sorry.
"Jesus is alive according to the Quran, for the Qur'an relates: \n\nThey [unbelievers] planned and God planned. But God is the best of planners. (Surah Al 'Imran, 3:54)\n\nAs the verses reveal, they plotted and moved to kill Jesus. However, their plot failed and they ended up killing a look-alike. During this event, God raised Jesus up to His presence: \n\nAnd [on account of] their saying: ""We killed the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, Messenger of God."" They did not kill him and they did not crucify him, but it was made to seem so to them. Those who argue about him are in doubt about it. They have no real knowledge of it, just conjecture. But they certainly did not kill him. God raised him to Himself. God is Almighty, All-Wise. (Surat An-Nisa', 4:157-158)\n\nThe reality revealed in the verses is clear. The Romans, abetted by some Jews' agitation, attempted to kill Jesus but did not succeed. The expression ""but it was made to seem so to them"" reveals this fact. God showed them a look-alike and raised Jesus up to His presence. Our Lord also reveals that those who made that claim had no knowledge of the truth. \n\nExamining the words used in the narratives relating how the Prophets died and the verses dealing with Jesus' ascent to God's presence reveals an important fact: Jesus did not die like the other prophets did, nor was he murdered by the unbelievers. Rather, our Lord took him up to His presence.\n\nYou can find more information in here :\n\nhttp://www.jesuswillreturn.com/s1_4.html"

"I get what you're saying, I've read tons of questions on yahoo answers asking how come black people can say the ""n"" word and how come white people can't. That is a stupid question with an obvious answer. When the term is used by a black person it's a term of endearment. When a white person uses it, it's just pure racism. Personally, I think no one should use the word."
That should come from the parents....I agree with you that kids should learn/know all of their culture.  That is a part of who they are, and they should be proud of it!  My husband is Mexican, we LIVE in MEXICO...on a boarder town so I can work in the US.  My husband speaks Spanish only to our baby, when I am not at home.  I speak English only to the baby.  She will grow up knowing both of her cultures....what a shame for your family to not teach them about their culture.

Who knows?  I guess people like that just use whatever influence they can get, whether it's religious, political, commercial, etc, to stop people from doing things they think they shouldn't do for one reason or another.  But maybe they should think on stuff like what you said, because goodness knows nothing else is getting through to them, like common sense.
It is great and the angels rejoiced as well.   Praise God.   What Church did this happen at.    Just Curious =)

Most problems in this world are created by people who want to prove that their religion or their country or their economic ideology is better than others.\nReligion is not about 'my dad can beat up your dad!' it is quite opposite. Those who want to prove that their religion is superior don't know the first thing about religion.\nOrganized religions should try to be servants of humanity, not masters.\nChristians say their massiah was God's only son; Jews say they are God's chosen people; Muslims say that their prophet was God's last prophet and all in thier Holy book is the final deal...I am sure Hindus and Buddhists also have some way or other to claim superiority....its all bovine excreta...\nJust refuse to accept superiority of any organized religion over rest of humaniry...

Biblical Name Vault:\n\nMeaning, origin and etymology of the name Miriam (Mary)\n\n• Miriam  (Ex 15:20) Mariam  (Mat 1:16) Maria (Mary) \n1) Prophetess and older sister of Moses and Aaron 2) Mother of Jesus 3) Some others.\n\nA few possibilities: \n(1) From  Mara meaning rebellious, disobedient. Derivation  Meri means rebellion. Transliterated to Greek yields the name of Mary, the mother of Jesus. \n\nJones initially reads Their Rebellion. NOBSE reads Obstinacy, Stubbornness.\n\n(2) From  Mar and  Yam meaning sea. \n Mar means bitter;  Mar means myrrh. Both come from the root  Marar meaning be bitter, strengthen, strong.\n Mar probably means drop but is used only once, in Isa 40:15). \nJones (additionally) and Jerome read Stella Maris (star of the sea), but that strikes as a very free interpretation. \nThe name Miriam (Mary) means Bitternesses but also Strong Waters/ Waters Of Strength. \n\nClick here for more info:\nhttp://www.abarim-publications.com/Arie/Names/Miriam.html
I would really listen to individuals and NOT open my mouth. We have so much to learn from each other. \n\nSilence is golden. :-)
I personally despise religion.  I feel it is justification for people to not take responsibility for their actions and behaviors.  I think it inspires fanaticism that is dangerous to the world.  I'm all for people believing in their beliefs, but the idea of an organized system to need to do that has always troubled me.
It can be if the right precautions are taken. It has been suggested that the receiver(s) douch anally before the games ebgin. Always use a dental dam to cover the hole for oral play. It prevents unsafe bacteria from your mouth getting onto the recievers anus and unsafe bacteria from the recievers anus to get to your mouth. Make sure that you brush your teeth and that your partner washes really well. Other than that, have fun.

"Stephen\n\nThe account of Stephen is very well documented in the Bible (Acts chapters 6 and 7). He is generally regarded as the first Christian martyr.\n\nIt has been estimated that about 2,000 Christians, along with Nicanor, one of the seven deacons (Acts 6:5), also suffered martyrdom during the great persecution that arose after Stephen (Acts 8:1).\n\nJames, the brother of John\n\nJames was ""put to death with the sword"" by King Herod (Acts 12:2)\n\nPhilip\n\nReportedly suffered martyrdom at Heliopolis, in Phrygia. He was severely flogged, imprisoned, and later crucified.\n\nMatthew\n\nThe former tax collector, he was killed with a halberd (a pike fitted with an ax head) in Nadabah. \n\nJames\n\nStoned and clubbed to death in Jerusalem.\n\nMatthias\n\nHe was stoned, then beheaded at Jerusalem.\n\nAndrew, the brother of Peter\n\nHe was crucified on an X-shaped cross, two ends of which were in the ground. Hence the origin of the term, ""St. Andrew's Cross"".\n\nMark\n\nMark was reportedly torn to pieces by a mob in Alexandria after he told them that their god, a statue carved from stone, was worthless (see Images and Idols).\n\nPeter\n\nPeter was reportedly crucified, upside down, during the reign of Emperor Nero.\n\nPaul\n\nBeheaded, or torn to pieces by wild animals in the arena, during the time of Nero. See On The Road To Damascus, Paul In Athens, Paul In Rome, Paul's First Missionary Journey, Paul's Journey To Rome, Paul's Second Missionary Journey and Paul's Third Missionary Journey.\n\nJude\n\nThe brother of James, often called Thaddeus. He was crucified at Edessa.\n\nBartholomew\n\nTortured and crucified in India.\n\nThomas\n\nThomas was reportedly killed with a spear in India.\n\nLuke\n\nLuke was the author of the Gospel which is called by his name, and also probably the Book Of Acts. One account states that he died of old age, while another says that he was hanged in an olive tree in Greece.\n\nSimon the Zealot\n\nHe traveled widely, and is believed to have been crucified in what is today Britain.\n\nJohn\n\nJohn took care of Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ (not the mother of God), after the Crucifixion (John 19:26-27). He went on to write the Book of Revelation while a prisoner on Patmos. He may be the only apostle who escaped a violent death.\n\nBarnabas\n\nBarnabas is believed to have been killed about 10 years after Paul.\n\nIscariot\nBoy Name\nA man of murder; a hireling\nBiblical Name"

No - for the same reason I wouldn't convert to Christianity.  I don't believe in formalized religion.  Dogma leads to blindly following corrupt people and believing in evil teachings.  It's more important to be able to tell what's right and wrong (rather than listen to dictations of what someone else thinks is right and wrong).\n\nHowever, I wouldn't mind studying it, maybe even joining a prayer session as a guest (under circumstances where it is appropriate to do so).  But learning about Islam isn't particularly high on my list of priorities at the moment.

Easy he came down here and was beat, punch and killed. even after knowing the Father's well he stayed and did it. If you know you would be killed to save lets say Osama Bin Laden would you let yourself be killed to say him? Jesus had no pause he just did it cause he loves all people and all can be saved. \n\nAs long as we lift Jesus up all men will be drawn to him.
"No, I never had the feeling that I was being brainwashed; I KNEW I was being brainwashed so I left. Why do you think people repeat ""praise be to God"" in a catholic mass?

It's really a matter of quality, isn't it? When there is little to distinguish between two items, aside from brand name recognition and status, I'm comfortable with the less well-known brand. But if the quality of the merchandise suffers when choosing the generic or no-name brand, I'm compelled to go with the known brand.\n\nDoes this make me brand conscious? I guess it does in part but not entirely. I am certainly not going to feel embarrassed, let alone demeaned, by selecting a product that is just as good as the name brand one. Honestly, who cares? I don't.\n\nThe single most expensive branded item I have? Isn't that just asking what is the single most expensive item I have, period? I mean, everything has a brand name of some kind. Certainly big ticket items like cars have brand names, right? So, by that standard, assuming my car to be the most expensive purchase I've made that has a brand name, wouldn't said car be the most expensive item I own even if it were not a prestige brand? Are you following my logic? \n\nI'm afraid I've no half-baked stories for you but I do think I've otherwise addressed all your questions -- and asked a few of my own, in the bargain. Cheers! ;-)

God explains in Quran that He LOVES people to ask things from him and to pray for him. He likes it when you resorts to him askin him to make you succeed in your finals for instance.

I think more companies are dropping or decreasing coverage, rather than expanding it.  No one gets penalized for anything in the employment sector.  Medical coverage is a part of one's salary package.  Either you get paid in wages or wages and benefits.  Medical coverage premiums are based on actuarial statistics.  There is data available for married couples;  i.e. ages, length of marriage, kinds and costs of illness.  For unmarried people living together, there is no similar data, such as no start date, no end date of a relationship.\nSome employers do extend medical coverage to unmarried partners, both homosexual and heterosexual.  Some employers do not furnish medical insurance to any employees, under any circumstances.\nIf you can show the President of your company that there is a benefit, to the company, that coverage be afforded to unmarried partners, I am sure he will listen.
Do you mean those who make the pilgrimage to Mecca?
"Christians think that words in the Bible don't really mean what they say, they mean whatever a Christian wants them to mean. Thus, ""everlasting"" doesn't mean ""forever,"" it means ""for a really long time."" And of course, Jesus never meant what he said or said what he meant--his words are always open to a wide variety of interpretations. So, when he said that he did NOT come to destroy the law, Christians say that he really meant that he DID come to destroy the law.  They can never take the Bible at face value."
"From Matthew 24.\n1Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings. 2""Do you see all these things?"" he asked. ""I tell you the truth, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."" \n 3As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. ""Tell us,"" they said, ""when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"" \n\n 4Jesus answered: ""Watch out that no one deceives you. 5For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Christ, and will deceive many. 6You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 7Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8All these are the beginning of birth pains. \n\n 9""Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. 10At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, 11and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. 12Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, 13but he who stands firm to the end will be saved. 14And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. \n\n 15""So when you see standing in the holy place 'the abomination that causes desolation,' spoken of through the prophet Daniel—let the reader understand— 16then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. 17Let no one on the roof of his house go down to take anything out of the house. 18Let no one in the field go back to get his cloak. 19How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! 20Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath. 21For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now—and never to be equaled again. 22If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened. 23At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'There he is!' do not believe it. 24For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect—if that were possible. 25See, I have told you ahead of time. \n\n 26""So if anyone tells you, 'There he is, out in the desert,' do not go out; or, 'Here he is, in the inner rooms,' do not believe it. 27For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. 28Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather. \n\n 29""Immediately after the distress of those days \n   "" 'the sun will be darkened, \n      and the moon will not give its light; \n   the stars will fall from the sky, \n      and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.' \n\n 30""At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory. 31And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other. \n\n 32""Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. 33Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door. 34I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. 35Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.\n\nThe Day and Hour Unknown \n 36""No one knows about that day or hour, not even the ange"

He does have a crush on you to the level that he can have a crush on a girl. You should be flattered but realize that it is not the same as a crush form a hetero boy.\n\nI don't think your friend is confused - he clearly knows that he prefers the company of men for that type of thing. and he clearly knows that what he feels for you, a crush, is not the same as the crushes or love he feels for a man.\n\nIt's as if a girlfriend of yours said she loved you. You would know what that means and the boundry of that - right?\n\nThis friend of yours will make a great friend if you choose to keep him around - he's honest. He didn't lie, he told you he was gay. He didn't have to. Flirting is not lying. \n\nYou need to move on with your feelings; become better for this experience not bitter.

I think because when you Google you only get weblinks, when you ask a question here you get other peoples opinions and points of view.
"Interesting observation. \nI would quibble that these folks who constantly cite some Biblical or Koranic verse as ""proof"" of their positions or opinions are poor, literal-minded saps who think their fairy tale is the bestest of fairy tales. \nFrankly, while the Internet is a great media for community-building, it is not, and probably never can be, very good for obtaining ""facts"", since any search (Yahoo, Google or other) is likely to provide both genuine information and apocryphal doodoo masquerading as the straight dope.\nThus, while I too find those quotatious responders curious and perhaps pathetic, the very presence of the\n ""Know your source? List it here:"" \nbox on the response page is an invitation to the practice.\nI do hope we won't start believing that the Internet is our new Holy Book, but we probably will (sigh). \n\nAfter all, it's already capitalized."

Ah yes, very true laddie.
Not exactly sure what ur point is here but if u r having a go at disabled people having easy access to parking and jobs put yourself in their shoes. Disabled people do not choose to be the way they are and the public generally have a 'do not want to know', attitude, yes, even in this day and age. Being disabled is not a right or a privilege but disabled people do have rights and are as much entitled to privelages as u and I are.

"i am 50/50 \n dd(dumbledore) is dead-""From this point forth, we shall be leaving the firm foundation of fact and [journey] together through the murky marshes of memory into thickets of wildest guesswork.""\n- Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore\n\nI know you're thinking, ""that's what we've been doing all along."" But now we have a problem: our time together is growing quite short. We have only one book left, and being that it is the last, there will be nothing to predict that hasn't already happened. The reason for my long absence was my excruciatingly precise reread of Book Six. I analyzed in brutal detail all the various nooks and crannies, making sure all of my facts were straight before committing myself to theories that I will have to change. We, therefore, must cling to this new mission. Cling to it and hope that as true Potterphiles we may unravel the deepest mysteries, unlock the most hidden doors.\n\nHALF-BLOOD, FULL HERO\n\nThe opening of Season Two, as I mentioned in my sneak peek is a five-part series called 'HALF-BLOOD, FULL HERO.' This series is designed to take all of the new nuggets obtained from Book Six and completely revamp our old theories and forge them into new, logical conclusions about Book Seven, all relating back, of course, to our hero: Harry. Our first installment concerns that of our dearly departed friend and headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. I submit for your entertainment and consideration (God, I've missed saying that): THE DEATH OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE!\n\nDUMBLEDORE IS IRREVERSIBLY DEAD\n\nIs that harsh? Yes. Is it true? HECK YES! Dumbledore is dead, folks. I refuse to go through another two years of Sirius-esque ""he's still alive"" droning. I realize all the phoenix symbolism is there, but like Sirius, Dumbledore is dead and he's not coming back. I don't hate to say, 'I told you so' because when I did, certain people who shall remain nameless, cursed me (and not in a Voldemort fashion) and called me delusional (not Emerson - he's cool, and he's right shippers - you were quite delusional). I have no remorse whatsoever for throwing it in your face that I said pretty much from the beginning that Dumbledore was going to die. I know we didn't want it to happen, but it did and, like Harry, we must move on.\n\nI categorically acknowledge his death not to chastise my readers but to prepare a point I have been stewing over. As you may recall from Season One, I said that I believe Sirius died for a reason and that reason was to show Harry the way to kill Voldemort (though I don't think he was thinking about that when he was battling Bellatrix). I feel that Dumbledore's death was no accident (well, obviously, as he was killed, but I mean in the larger sense).\n\nYou all have been thinking it, but I'm going to say it: I trust TFPWWNBN now more than I ever have because he killed Dumbledore. Do I hate him? Yes. Is he a slimy contemptible sewer rat? Of course. Was he acting under orders to kill Dumbledore? Yes. But whose orders? TFPWWNBN was told to kill Dumbledore by Dumbledore. Let us revisit the argument in the forest that Hagrid overheard. As usual, JKR loves to torture us with unnecessary vagueness. Have you noticed how, in all of the books, when the big baddies are talking to each other, they use a lot of unnecessary vagueness and euphemism? I realize they are afraid of being overheard, but still. But I digress. The forest:\n\n- TFPWWNBN tells Dumbledore that Dumbledore ""takes too much for granted.""\n- TFPWWNBN tells Dumbledore that maybe he, TFPWWNBN, doesn't want to do ""it"" anymore.\n\n- Dumbledore tells TFPWWNBN that he agreed to do ""it"" so he has to do ""it.""\n\n- Dumbledore questions TFPWWNBN about making investigations in his house.\n\nIf you'll notice, I have ignored all references to Hagrid's assumptions and merely reported what he HEARD and not wha"
i am bi so is my girlfriend so we swap for same sex often. it has made us close also and makes the sex more meaningful. hope this helps
is it true about the magic underwear?
errmm................ can you make it clearer?????\n\ni can't make out what you are trying to say actually..\n\nthank you.
Life moves way too fast and you have to move with it or you'll just get left behind.
No, he's not. He's just another saviour for another religion, nothing more, nothing less.
there is no such thing as a better life and as soon as you get that through your head, you will understand how to live a better life...\n\ni don't want a baby with a 3 billion other dads out there, that's stupid...\n\nmake babies the good ol' fashion way, while married and have fun while doing it...\n\nyou're and we're not a god or God Himself to be making that kind of choice... \n\nit's wrong to war and kill and it's wrong to geneticly manipulate something natural and beautiful\n\nperiod...get off the utopia state of mind... be realistic and move on...
Most people don't and you're really not suppose to, but sometimes a token shows a Person they are APPRECIATED.\nThat $1 may sometimes feed someone or even make that person feel they are cared about.
Depends on the person personally I grew up in a convent very quiet and surreal. \n\nYears later I was in prison and I spent 30 days in solitary very surreal but not so quiet. I had to keep talking to make sure I didn't lose my mind..Ironic isn't it?
I love my husband because we have been married for 17 years. In this day, 17 days is good and 17 months is a miracle. 17 years is unheard of. We have great respect for each other and sometimes when I don't want his advice and it makes me mad, I still listen and vice versa. We have learned we may both think differently, but we respect the others thoughts.
I would make sure that all of my Godly affairs are in order first.   I would ensure that above all else.\n\nIf I knew of the catastrophe, I would do whatever I could to stop it if possible.   If it was something out of my ability to stop (such as a meteor hitting the Earth), then I would try to determine the best places to survive the impact or source of catastrophe (up to, and including building an ark.)    \n\nAt that point, I would relocate to that area and begin stockpiling anything/everything I could.   I would have my immediate family with me and any others that would choose to come with me.   At that point, whether I survived or not would be in God's hands...even if I chose the most survivable place....it still might be my time.   \n\nIf I survived the catastrophy, hopefully I would have stockpiled enough to give me a good start at rebuilding and living and surviving (hopefully with my family and friends).
I've had number 3.  It's a roller coaster but it was fun.\nNumber 4 will never happen because if the police come then he goes for good.\nNumber 2 is acceptable.\nNumber 1 bores me to the arms of another partner.\n\nBesides if I am involved then the sex is ALWAYS great.
No, I'm sure it's quite common.\n\nThe first time I learned about sex was from a reference book too. I already knew that a man and woman had to get together but I had no idea about copulation. Still, that was the extent of all the book described - the male organ is inserted into the female - and the rest was about conception and pregnancy. \n\nIt wasn't much, but I thought it was brilliant. It wasn't until later that I learned how people really have sex.
I would be let down, and hope that the world does not turn into a more chaotic bomb, but I will still continue to live by the golden rule, which existed before the bible was ever a consideration in any man's mind.
He does. He can forgive you sin just by his mere will. He don't need any BLOODY SACRIFICE. He is not blood-thirsty. He is just. Forgiving anybody's sin doesn't make him injust if his decision to save SOME people is justice--why not forgiving anybody by his will?\nYou have to understand that Justice is something which is defined by God not us. Jesus was not God's son or God. He was a person who\nwas sent by God to teach humanbeings God's will and his ways\nfor their maximum benefit in this life and hereafter. And actually according to the Christians more than 1/2 of the humanbeings will\ngo to hell(by God's justified CHOICE--he's soooo just). I guess\nmore than half people who are statistically Christians (in the West)\n will call them Atheists,Wiccans,Neo-Scientists etc. So, exactly how much Christians are there?\nWell, there is no my God or your God. God is the creator, sustainer and destroyer of everything and everybody. He was and is not only the God of Abraham or God of the Jews. He is and was  and will\nbe the God of everything in the past, present and future. Another wrong concept--Jews were not the forefathers of Muslims.God send his message and messengers beginning from Adam to\nall races including the Jews. They distorted the scriptures and wrote their own whims--like Paul\nwrote Romans etc. God defined sin. He can forgive it by his mere will according to his justification\nand nature of the sin. He forgave the sin of Adam.\nBecause Adam repented. He is the best forgiver\nand most merciful. He don't need BLOODY SACRIFICES but he require our submission to his will, follow his law and ask forgiveness for the sins which we will do because our limited human nature.He knows that and is gracious  and willing\nto forgive us if we accept his message. He requires\nour mental purity and repentence not any BLOODY SACRIFICE. Again, you cannot find any so called saved Christians who don't commit any sin after they become so-called saved. No proof.Absurd.\nRomans etc. are Paul the decievers own inventory.\nI don't consider BIBLE as authoritative.
the question is what would he do if he found her with the pool boy?
you know im very patriotic but my patronism belongs to the country that our forefathers invisioned not this milarky going on today. like it or not muslims, athiest, pagans, or basically all non believers the you take God out of the constitution and you have no constitution just look at those so call inalienalby right we have life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness when they wrote that they claimed those rights were givin to us by a higher power a creator (God). so believe what you want far as im concerned they can have this country some people might not like my attitude about it but this country and everything it stood for was based on God. we are just riding on the coat tails of our forefathers the blessings we have belong to them not us we just get ot be the recipients of them and look what weve done with it. a country that says its ok to kill unborn children, a place someone could be fined for speaking the word of God, gays and lesbians marrying, every religion under the sun is practiced here now, sundays the churches are empty but on friday and saturday night you go to the local watering hole and the place will be packed drinkin, smokin, fornacating, cursing, fighting and sometimes killing, if our forefathers could do it theyed probalby bend us over thier knee and give us a good striping for what we did to the country they formed and fought for. but im lookin for a country whos builder and maker is God im just a pilgram only passin thru one day by the grace of God ill reach that place the bible says there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither wahtsoever workety abomination, or maketh a lie but they which are written in the lambs book of life. Praise God my name is written there ill see those walls of jasper and streets of gold this place here will just be an afterthought if i remeber it at all hey i love my country (usa) but i love God more.

"Sorry to copy paste, but I'm lazy today..\nThe following is from the website below (this would also apply to small claims court). (I would say wear close-toed dress shoes and avoid spike heels)\n_______________________________________\nHOW TO DRESS FOR COURT\n\nGENERAL\n Dress like a professional.\n Dress conservatively and, when appropriate, wear good quality clothing.\n If you have a choice, always dress as well as the other people who may appear in court.\n Avoid wearing loud colors.\n Remember that the ""good guys"" never wear black.\n Always be neat and clean.\n Avoid putting anything on your hair that makes it shine or appear greasy.\n Avoid wearing tinted or dark colored glasses in the courtroom.\n People will not believe you if they cannot see your eyes.\n Wear only functional jewelry (e.g., wedding ring and wrist watch).\n Large bracelets, rings, cufflinks, tie tacks and earrings are distracting to the jury.\n Avoid wearing items that may identify a personal association or belief. Political buttons, club pins, college rings, religious jewelry may trigger some prejudices against you in the mind of a juror.\n Dress to fit the expectations of your audience; jurors expect you to look like a professional.\n Remember that even a small flaw in your appearance will be noticed by someone on the jury and it may hurt your credibility."
First of all, the poor christians have so many rules, it's hard for them to remember them all. OK, next they think it's their job to SAVE all us poor lost souls. The only thing I need saved from is them burning my people at the stake, & raging war on us innocent pagans. See they won't let us just worship Mother Earth and live in peace & harmony. SINS...HA!!! And it harms none, do as you will.\nBlessed be...

Mr. Mister had it almost right!\n\nHe said\n>No. She is not a virgin anymore.\n\n>She was single and gave birth to Jesus. after >the birth, her and Joseph got married and had >kids.\n\n>Jesus does have 1/2 brothers. 1/2 sisters as >we know them. Thats right.\n\nActually, Joseph did marry Mary and they went to pay taxes in another town called Bethlehem.  That is where Jesus was born.  After Jesus was born the Bible clearly tells us that Mary had other children.  People do not realize it is there, because it is not a religious point that ministers preach on, and most people do not read their own Bibles!  However, it stated that she had other children.  \n\nShe was not a virgin after Jesus, but she was a virgin when Jesus was born.  However, to give her that title is not really wrong, but an acknowledgment and declaration of her being a virgin at the time of Jesus birth.
"The purpose and result of baptism varies from denomination to denomination. For some, it is a guarantee of an afterlife; for others it is a symbolic cleansing of past sins, and a symbol of being born again.  Or it can be thought of as a combination of these ideas.\n\nThe idea of baptism in the Christian tradition comes out of the Jewish system of ritual bathing in a mikveh for ceremonial impurity.  Individuals who violated the laws of purity by touching a  corpse, blood or anything designated unclean, were to bath in a souce of ""living water"" --fresh running water in order to remove the impurity.  Here is a website that talks about this Jewish ritual:"

I think most animist religions tend to believe that 'good' spirits walk among us here on earht, so there's no real sense of 'up' there. But I like your question. It's an interesting one. A lot of religious concepts and practices pass from one religion to another, so there should be nothing surprising about general 'trends' like that.

Consider whether or not your feelings are just a crush..or are deeper. If they are deeper, than you should find other employment. It is really never good to become involved with one's boss. Only then I would recommend asking her if she is interested in more with you.

I just thought to add this,there is a misconception that Atlantis was a Continent,Atlantis in particular was a city,situated on a continent called Appalachia,it started from Iceland to Ireland to some portion of Atlantic ocean along side of canary Island,to eastern shore of central America,Atlantis civilization consist of 5 main cities,on Appalachia,the picture that shows in the web site you referred,actually is some part of Appalachia,it is very informative,thanks for sharing,i had done some serious reading about continents of Appalachia,durangia and  hyperboria,your refered site really helped me to put a big missing piece of puzzle,together,thanks again,

Get in touch with your local service clubs, such as Rotary Club,  Shriner's, Jay-C's and if your town has one a Veterans Club.  All of these service clubs have a program and application process to follow so you will have to fill out some forms but it is worth the effort.  You should also put together a proposal along with a cover letter and a few pics of your team and take them to local businesses. your local fire dept. police dept, news paper, radio TV stations etc.  \nMay you be blessed in this!

"Simple answer: The Catholic Church is the true church of Jesus. It is the only church that can trace its roots directly back to Jesus and the apostles. \n\nI highly recommend Catholic Answers (www.Catholic.com) as an online source of information about the Catholic Church and Catholic doctrine. Start with the booklet ""Pillar of Fire"" (linked below) and browse as your curiosity leads you. \n\nI also recommend examining the doctrine of ""sola scriptura"" (""the Bible alone""). There is sufficient evidence, both in the Bible itself and in the history of the Church, to demonstrate that Jesus gave the authority of doctrine to the Church, as opposed to the Bible."

"1969, california, USMC, i was going to Viet Nam in a couple of weeks.  we went to LA to party.  Hollywood.  there was a girl.  i'd never seen such a beautiful and exotic girl, and so was very open to her.  she wore an orange robe, gave me incense and a pamphlet.  i was impressed greatly. i studied the pamphlet and immediately wrote to the man about whom the pamphlet was written.  within a few days i received a reply.  i had written to him about my situation (see above).  his repy was simple, ""This will explain everything.""  he had enclosed a book he had just published: Bhagavad-Gita As It Is.\n\nI will never forget His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.  The book had a bookmark where Arjuna asks Krishna how he can go to war against friends and family, more or less the same questions i had been asking myself.  that book is here on my desk these 37 years later.  my life was changed forever.\n\nNamaste"

um... when i was growing up, the black guy in my private school did pretty well. Not only was he popular, and smart, he was also a jock. \n\nIn my son's private school, the black kid is the genius of his class. They even skipped him ahead two grades (I didn't agree with that, because he was one of my son's good friends and now he doesn't see him anymore). \n\nNot all black boys do particularly badly in school, I guess it just depends on who their parents are.\n\n-----------\nAfter reading more of the responses, I began to wonder how many people who answered here ACTUALLY know black people or have them as friends or peers? It seems like many people are responding only to what they hear on the media or with their limited experience with Black people. \n\nI've known many black people who are upper middle class, well educated and have BOTH parents. Unfortunately I went to an all girls high school, so i did not include that information since the question specifically asked about black BOYS.  \n\n<sigh> I don't know how the rest of the world works, but in my experience the black people I've come across have been as intelligent as anyone else, and sometimes more so. \n\nThe only time, I've come across ignorant black kids was when I tutored reading in poor school districts, but many of the kids were ignorant regardless of race. Yes, those kids had tough lives and had bad role models. Many wanted to work in Mc Donalds when they grew up so they wouldn't be hungry. But the ignorance WASN'T race dependent. And I found that the ignorance could be rectified. All the kids needed was someone to believe in them,  to work with them and someone to look up to.\n \nBTW, I'm Asian American. <sigh>
people dont want to admit theyre sinful and that they are doing wrong\nto admit that Jesus is your savior means that you are admitting that you are living your life in sin, and that you need to be saved.  it is natural for people to sin, and to leave your sinful ways is very difficult.  many people would rather choose to ignore it and pass it off as fiction so they will not feel grievance

I am not trying to put anyone down and do not want to be preached at, for Ive been there and done that. \n It's just that some people don't want to admit that there could be some other explanation other than their god.

Why the haters are here: Fortunately, the LGBIT community is big enough to get their own Q&A section here. Unfortunately, that makes it easy for the narrow-minded people to find you and preach from a safe distance.\n\nWhy the narrow-minded straight people are here: To get 2 points for being idiots.\n\nWhy the non-narrow-minded straight people are here: To be around, and help answer the questions of, LGBIT friends.\n\nWhy I (straight) am here: Because I would like to offer my opinion if I think it can help and I like hanging out with the LGBIT people, especially since there aren't a lot where I am now and I miss my friends.

Bill Gates is not rich enough.   Here's why. \n\n1.  He could dontate more money to good charities.\n2.  If he got richer, then Microsoft would have more money to innovate.\n3.  If he got richer, then more jobs would open up.\n4.  If he got richer, his Microsoft would grow, and so would the any pension plans that are invested in the company.  That helps retireees. \n\nThe pope is an awesome person.  Bill Gates just might get rich enough someday.

It's gandhi if you're talking about Mahatma Gandhi.He's not a wife beater or a terrorist.\nIndian economy is booming ,one of emerging nations.\nMany people are so serious here & students are very ambitious just like all the other countries & our(Indian teens) main interest is EDUCATION.So we're no different from other countries.\nYeah,Freedomhammer maybe right in someway,but as an Indian I can't accept it, as if I'll leave India for anything.Indian population is so huge that you have to adopt to the surronding. It's the SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.You just have to accept it because we people grow that way.We are not carefree.But it sure does benefit in long run.

Well, I believe in every country there will always be rude and discourteous people. On the flip side, there will also be polite and well-mannered people. Let's not compare why certain people are nicer than others. Let's face it, the human race ain't perfect at all. And each and everyone of us has our own set of perceptions and thinking with regards to other peoples. \n\nAnd remember, the survey is just a figure which can always change with time. \n\nBut on personal account, perhaps the reason why Singaporeans emerged 30th probably stems from the individualistic personality and due to lack of social cohesion. The 'culture' that puts one before the society perhaps may cause the lack of graciousness among some members of the society. It all boils down to the individual's family upbringing and environment, to a large extent. Hence, there are differing factors that might lead to the lack of courteousy among some Singaporeans.

because were human. every body has a little hate in them, some more than others, some it grows over time. but the people who drive it to the bone are the ones who have issues with themselves, that is what hate is, its because u think someone is better than you so u resent them for it, resent turns into hate.\nthats just how it is.

From the way you spoke about him in your first question, he doesn't act like he loves you.  Guys will say they love you, but what matters is not what they say, but how they treat you.  If he really loved you, he wouldn't treat you the way he does.  (And it isn't always about sex).

"Its also common to have a first name MARIA which is Mary mother of Jesus. Even for guys in Spain they are called Maria Jose which is for both man and woman (In Spain again).\nIn Mexico its a reverence to Jesus. Mexico is mainly all Catholic and people are very faithful (well the majority inMexico). It is an honor to have the name of Jesus.\n\nJoseph or Peter are apostles not Jesus, the son of God and the Christ.\n\nIts a very good question.\nI think the answer lays in the upbringing as Catholics.\nThe Popes in the Vatican which is Catholics  main leader for the Church and the one that is directly inspired and chosen by God all the way to lead all of God's children, their original names are not used but choose a name after an apostle. Thus JOHN PAUL II.\nWhose name from his native Poland is not that, it is Karol Woytila. And he was a great human being who not only brought down the Berlin wall down and united millions around the world. He did much good for humanity and set an excellent example of forgiveness and compassion for our fellow humankind.\nHe forgave and actually went to see in jail his Turkish would be assasin, the one who almost killed him. The turkish guy was so moved by His HOllyness that he converted to Christianity and asked John Paul II for his forgivness. When John Paul II died, the turkish man that almost killed him asked to be given permission to go to his burial and did go to his burial.\n\nWhat a way to forgive someone who almost kill you. Dont you think? \nthe power of forgivness and love that Karol Woytila had ws not a coincidence he got to be a Pope and spread the Gospel as he did, from countyr to country, the one and only Pope who hs visited more than 30 countries in the world to tell humans LOVE, FORGIVE, BELEIVE IN GOD THAT IS THE GOD OF ALL HUMANITY. NOT JUST THE GOD OF ISRAEL , OR MY  GOD HE SAID, BUTYOUR GOD.\n\nNames in cultures deep in faith to God choose a name not for fun, but for this reason. Reverence to God and Christ.\n\nhey zeus is not qauiet the actual pronunciation in Spanish. But i cant spell it here the way it s said. more like Hezoos (he as in the word ""hermit"" getting rid of the rmit just ""he"") if you say Hey its pronounced with an american accent.\n\ntO BE NAMED JESUS MEANS A LOT TO LATINOS AND SPANIARDS. \nANTOHER misconception, latinos are from latin america that means from Mexico and south all the way to Patagonia.\nSpaniards are people from Spain. And we are not latinos. But spanish speakers yes, though the language is very different even if commonly people think ITS SPANISH. Spanish in all different countries is all not the same language. Words change meanings cchange and waht may have some meaning in Mexico, in Spain it has a complete different meaning. \n\nIt may also be that in Spanish we have closer link to latin based language. Where the word Jesus is pronounced not as in the USA that stands apart form the pronunciation of its orignal language of the old . Aramaic. (I dont knwo if i spelled Aramaic right). ARAMAIC IS THE LANGUAGE JESUS CHRIST SPOKE."

"Religion develops as a means to provide a grand explanation for *everything* (ie. weather, sources of food, death, interpersonal relationships, social systems, etc.).   It gives people a sense of security and predictability.  Sometimes the use of religion goes beyond predictability to the point of being used for control.  \n\nWhen one questions someone else's religious beliefs sometimes that triggers an insecurity that gets expressed as hostility.  If the questioning reduces control and individual has become dependent upon to maintain social or economic status the response can be extremely hostile.  \n\nThis is not to dismiss ""religion"" as a merely useful (for some) fiction.  Institutionalized atheism (China, and Stalin's Russia) has killed many people as well.  I guess you could just lump religion in with any ideology that attempts to assert itself on others through political or social means."
"Why do so many people insist that DaVinci Code is ""fiction""? Actually it contains both fiction and fact. This is the typical Christian propaganda machine in action which sweepingly makes the whole book fiction when in fact there are many true things in it. So it's fact & fiction just like the bible (though the bible contains far more fiction than DVC)."
yes i do look down on them and i dont really care what atheist think about me. i have no respect for someone who can deny that there is a Creator.
"It looks like you put a lot of work into it. It's functional, but you need to improve on the aesthetic appeal it seems a bit ""canned, or cookie cutter, or like one in a million others"". It needs more personality at a glance and less dry text. If I had to grade it on a scale of 1-100 I would give you about a 47 because of the ""spread sheet look"". Overall, good work though. I say all this not to be negative, but just give you feed back."

Thank you for all you have done...I am an Atheist, but that does not mean I do not appreciate what you and every other soldier has done for this country.  I am glad you have something to believe in that makes you happy.  Just because it is not what I believe in does not mean I am against it.  Not all Atheist think that way.
Good question. It shows the humor of this type of religious dogma. Mankind is the soul himself. God breathed life into Adam and he became a living soul.  He was not given a soul. The bible never says that a soul (or life) is immortal.  It talks about souls dying, hungering etc, but never says a soul is immortal.

If a person can trace their family history back far enough they will usually come across one or more cousin marriages in their tree.  First, until almost 1870-1880 is was socially acceptable.  Second the further you go back in history the less likely someone was going to marry outside of their community because people just couldn't meet people from other communities very easily and third it was sometimes even encouraged especially when a family was in a certain social group.\n\nThe reason cousin marriages are discouraged is because if there is defective gene the chances of inbreeding that one gene is higher when you marry within a certain degree of family;  if the genes are clean then there is nothing biologically wrong but in today's society most marriages below that of third cousins are considered unacceptable.
"The word Bible actually means ""little books.""  It took over 1600 years to write.  The Bible is not an unrelated assortment or collection of man made fragments from Jewish and Christian literature. Rather, it is an organizational book, highly unified and interconnected in its various segments, which indeed reflect the systematic orderliness of the Creator-Author himself. God’s dealings with Israel in giving them a comprehensive law code as well as regulations governing matters even down to small details of camp life—things that were later mirrored in the Davidic kingdom as well as in the congregational arrangement among first-century Christians—reflect and magnify this organizational aspect of the Bible.\n\nThe Bible has a theme that is carried out from Genesis to Revelation which is basically, 'from paradise lost to paradise regained'  It talks about how God is going to use his Kingdom to bring back the paradise conditions that Adam and Eve lost and vindicate his name in the process.  The Hebrew scriptures (OT) talk about the history of the Jews as they watched and waited for the Messiah.  The Christian Greek scriptures (NT) tell about the Messiah and what the future holds as he, the King of God's Kingdom works to bring back paradise to the Earth."

Doen't matter what a woman wears. Rape is violence and has nothing to do with sex. Rape is a weapon used in war and our homes by men who are violent.
People tend to categorize and stereotype. Not all native americans are alike. Any smart person could tell you that. Thats like saying all Puerto Ricans have big butts. NOT all Puerto Ricans have big butts. I'm half Puerto Rican and I have a big butt. But my half sisters butt is FLAT! She's full blooded Puerto Rican. But there is way too much ignorance in this world. People are always going to believe stereotypes.
For a beggar the money giver is the great one.\nFor a homeless the shelter provider is the great one.\nFor a person dying of hunger, food giver is the great one.\nFor a orphan, foster home is the great one.\nAnyone one of us can be considered the great one as long as one does great things! Great things doesn't meant giving money, for me all of the above is consider a great one!

Muslims say that they believe the Bible, but they do not. In fact, they deny that Christ was actually crucified. They refer to him as a prophet because to recognize him as the Son of God would completely invalidate their religion, certainly the Quran.\n\nI have friends who are Muslim and I can tell you they do not study the Bible. They only study the Quran, so they only know and believe its teachings.
It was very sad that many innocent victims died in the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki but it prevented the U.S from having to invade the Japanese mainland at the cost of millions of Americans lives.  A survey was taken but the U.S government and they estimated that over a million U.S servicemen would be killed in the attacks on japans mainland.  Plus the countless number of Japanese civilian and Japanese military casualties that would be in result of an attack.  The attacks at Hiroshima and Nagasaki together only resulted in around 214,000 casualties.  In terms of life lost the invasion of the Japanese mainland would have been much worse than the attacks of Nagasaki and Hiroshima.  Also there is strong evidence that the Japanese had worked on atomic bombs themselves and they could have eventually used them on us.  Some of the people who have responded to this question are absolute idiots and are clearly misinformed of the events that took place in WW2.

"A bomb goes off in a marketplace in Jerusalem. A suicide bomber launches himself into a bus full of women and children in Tel Aviv. Foreign tourists get massacred at a holiday resort in Luxor, Egypt. Villages upon villages get annihilated in Algeria. The list of events worldwide which have come to symbolise the 'Islamic terror' are endless. From the times in the 70's and 80's when Pan Am and TWA aeroplanes would be highjacked, to the mid 80's in war torn Lebanon where Americans and Europeans would be held as hostages for years; all such incidents have come to be identified with the religion of Islam. Such incidents from past and present have undoubtedly affected Muslims worldwide and more so in the West. Any Muslim, who wants to practice his/her religion and expresses the pious desire to live under the banner of Islam, is labelled a fundamentalist or extremist. Any Muslim man who walks down a busy street in London or Paris (and Paris moreso) with a beard and a scarf on his head, is looked upon as being a terrorist who's probably got an AK47 stashed somewhere on his person. Muslim women who are veiled can't go anywhere in the Western world without being taunted as being oppressed or being mad (for covering up). However, are such beliefs and opinions about Islam really justified? \n\nExploding the myth \n\nOne of the many short comings which has arisen in the West, is judging Islam by the conduct of a minority of its people. By doing this, segments of Western society have deliberately played off the desperate actions of many Muslims, and have given it the name of Islam. Such behaviour is clearly not objective and seeks to distort the reality of Islam. For if such a thing was done - judge a religion by the conduct of its people - then we too could say that all Christianity is about is child molesting and homosexuality [1] whilst Hinduism was all about looting and breaking up mosques [2]. Generalising in such a manner is not seen as being objective, yet we find that the Western world is foremost in propagating this outlook on Islam. So what is the reality of Islam? How does one dispel the myths which have been created and spread so viciously? The only way to examine Islam is to simply examine its belief system. Look at its sources, the Qur'an and Sunna, and see what they have to say. This is the way to find the truth about what Islam says about terror, terrorism and terrorists. One who is sincerely searching for the truth, will do it no other way. The very name Islam comes from the Arabic root word 'salama' which means peace. Islam is a religion which is based upon achieving peace through the submission to the will of Allah. Thus, by this very simple linguistic definition, one can ascertain as to what the nature of this religion is. If such a religion is based on the notion of peace, then how is it that so many acts done by its adherents are contrary to peace? The answer is simple. Such actions, if not sanctioned by the religion, have no place with it. They are not Islamic and should not be thought of as Islamic. \n\nJihad \n\nThe word jihad sends shivers down the spines of many Westerners. They readily equate this term with violence and oppression. However, it must be said that the meaning of jihad, as a 'holy war', is something which is totally foreign and not from Islam. If anything, such a description belongs more so to Christianity and its adherents. It was terms like this which were used to justify the slaughter and pillage of towns and cities during the crusades by the Christians. By simply looking into the sources of Islam, one is able to know that the true meaning of jihad is to strive/make effort in the way of Allah. Thus striving in the way of Allah can be both peaceful and physical. The Prophet Muhammed (saws) said: \n\n""The best jihad is (by) the one who strives against his own self for Allah, The Mighty and Majestic"" [3]\n\nIn the Qur'an, Allah also says: "
1) believe in Allah\n2) believe in Angels\n3) believe in Prophet\n4) believe in Al-Quran\n5) believe in Qada & Qadar(fate/destiny)\n6) believe in Judgement day
"This is a saying that has actually been misquoted from the original, rendering meaningless. \n\nIt was originally ""You cannot eat your cake & have it too."" meaning that once the cake was eaten it was gone, which made a lot more sense. \nThe accepted version of it that ""You cannot have your cake & eat it too"" does not make any sense at all to me either since if you have cake, why shouldn't you eat it?."
He's sad and lonely that there are so many happy, contented people and he's an unemployed, unloved, ignored wackjob creep with no friends.\n\nThe negative response from people is better to him than no human interaction at all.\n\nKinda pathetic, really.
You absolutly right us black people need to stop conplaining and need to take charge. Were the only ethcic group that has yet to rise up.

"trustautostop is not correct, the Salem Witch Trials started in February and lasted till October 29th. A lot loner then two weeks. \n\nAlso Christians will never accept any responsibility, there are incidents all throughout their history, but they cannot see the link and simple accuse the people of not being ""True"" Christians. The problem is many of these not ""True"" Christians are saints in the Catholic Church and leaders of the Protestant movements."

Your writing communication is very good. I encourage you to keep practicing English.\n\nI had a roommate who was Korean. All of her friends were Korean, she only used English when she had to. As a result, even after being in the States for 6 yrs, her English speaking skills were still poor. She needed to practice more, pure and simple.\n\nSomeone suggested reading aloud. That seems like a great idea! Read aloud to someone who speaks both English and your language so that they can help you with this. And remember, speak English with them, it will be tempting to speak your native language with them.\n\nYou will do better, with practice it will happen. My friend came here from Egypt and when he arrived, he could only read English but couldn't speak it. Three years later, his English was excellent. He watched tv, listened to the radio, read the paper, anything he could to improve. Be patient with yourself, it will happen for you too. Practice practice practice.

In a group, you need everyone working toward the same goal.  So if you introduce an element that hinders the effectiveness of the group to function ... that element is to the detriment of the whole.  That's what hippies were and are.\n\nAt least in the 60s the hippies wanted to start their own communal societies.  We could handle that, they were not such a hindrance to the mainstream society.  But today's hippies are far worse.  Now they want to stay within our mainstream society, enjoy the benefits of the group, but refuse to do anything productive themselves.

Either way you have several ways ahead:\n1. become a 17years old parent (alone or not)\n2. stop the pregnancy\n3.give the child for adoption\n\nConsidering that you are just 17, and the entire life ahead of you and i seriously doubt that the guy will be responsible(i hope that i am wrong), i will stop the pregnancy, do some counseling and go on with my life.\n\nEither way, is a big responsibility, and should be taken only after consulting the father...\n\nKeep me posted please with your decision. Maybe i can help. No matter what you decide.\n\nHazzard
On a serious, analytical level, religion is a want. You will not die without it. You can live equally well with or without it, but it is innate in human nature. The desire to understand everything is a need in the human mind. Religion satisfies that need, but is not the need itself.\n\nFood is a need. Lobster is a want. Understanding is food, religion is lobster. For some, science is the lobster. Get it?

They've got it above, we didn't come directly from apes, apes and humans came from the same source. But even if we did it wouldn't matter. If even we did come directly form apes, evolution doesn't mean that every member of a species all change at the same rate at the same time. A lot of creationists seem to have this idea about evolution. Like they all go to sleep and mutate into something else all around the world one night. That's not how it works.\n\nEdit: jayceeinspect.

It's a question of maturity.  If your are spiritually mature enough to take responsibility for your actions you don't need hell and damnation to have a good outlook to life wher you see others as partners in life.  Some people are not as mature and need (in fact they need it so much they feel everyone should need it too) the carrot and stick approach to be productive human beings.

If I had a penny everytime...I had sex with my wife of forty years, I'd be a centnaire.
speaking personally, i'd love to be able to say that no - marijuana isn't bad for you (because that would make my life easier), but sadly it is.\n\nif you smoke it, it affects your lungs the same way tobacco does - by damaging the small sacs of your lungs that convert the air you breathe to oxygen carriable in your blood.  some doctors think it's worse because when you smoke pot, you tend to hold it in for longer, prolonging the effect of the drug but also causing more damage to your lungs.\n\nwhile you're stoned, your blood pressure drops.  i've fainted a couple of times from this.\n\nalso while you're stoned, your reaction time is slower because your brain takes longer to process information.  this is a direct result of the THC in your system.\n\nand if you smoke pot for a long time? like, years? there are cases of people who are already prone to mental illness having their problems caused/exacerbated by using marijuana.  schizophrenia, paranoid delusions, general paranoia, loss of motivation - these are all potential side effects of long term use.  i've known quite a few people who've been kind of destroyed just from pot.  \n\nand then of course, there's the old argument that using pot leads to using other drugs.  i'm not sure about this, but most people i know who smoke pot also try other stuff.  i mean, a lot of us probably tried it cause we were bored with alcohol, right??\n\nat the end of the day, most things in life are bad for you when you do them to excess.  moderation is the name of the game.  remember that and enjoy a toke or two in peace : )
While I do not have a spouse, I have been around very close friends when cheating was taking place or when it was discussed in a very frank manner.\n\nAfter seeing some of the after effects of cheating on marriages and relationships, I can't imagine ever even considering it, no matter what.\n\nEven if you were never caught, you would be living with that lie, that event that you took a part in, for the rest of your life.\n\nKnowing that you could keep such a secret, would you also not believe your spouse capable of doing the same?\n\nI am a firm believer in 100 percent honesty, in the little things in life and in the big things.  Whether it's with a stranger at a store (ok, granted, I'm not typically in a position where I would need to worry about honesty with a stranger in a store) to my loving family and friends.\n\nI hope that this helps.\n\nBuddhadan
Of course.  Body language betrays your secret.  Plus, being a gay women, I have gaydar.  LOL  I can always tell, regardless of gender.
Id like a better answer please.
Sometimes people want to answer more questions, so they wanna type faster, and they use abbreviations to answer questions faster.  Take me, for example, usually I abbreviate things, but this past year I won the Spelling UIL contest.  People just want to make things go quicker by abbreviating. And about you being the only one not to understand them, sometimes it's just because most people that use/understand abbreviations are people that use the computer more or people that instant message.  Pretty soon, you'll start to understand abbreviations as well.  No big, don't worry about it.
when people question my skills as a parent....\n\ni am a single mum and am trying my best and love my child inconditionally so it really makes me mad and defensive when i get told i'm rubbish at it and when i am questioned on my methods, especially when it is members of my family.... no one is perfect i'm doing the best i can!
He had dinner reservations with God, and he didn't wanna be late.
Yes, God is watching us, actually knows what we will be doing in the next seconds to come, And knows everything about us, every detail, KNOWS everything about everything, as He is the All-knowing.. \n\nWhat should we do? Well, live for Him, and remember Him being watching us, so, we must never lie, we must love to be pious and good, and also we must try our best not to go against His will by breaking His commandments.. and in case we made a mistake and commited a sin, we must immediatly repent and have hope in Him, as He is the Most Merciful, most Gracious..
No, not really but some people just deserve it and it comes out of your mouth before you can stop it!

"The simple answer: no. I know this because am one (SDA and vegetarian) and I work in a vegetarian restaurant and health-food store. I would say a large number do not consume meats that are ""unclean"" according to the Biblical guidelines (see Leviticus 11:1-30), while they will eat those considered clean meats, such as chicken and beef. From my experience though, the greater majority do claim to be total vegetarian.\n\nNo, all SDA's aren't vegetarian. But they are known for it partly because, yes, a large number of them really are!\n\nCheck out www.sdada.org/position.htm for more info."
Oo, the Bermuda Triangle!\n\nIt is possible... we could be nothing but computer simulations. Wouldn't that put a dampener on those stupid 'religious' conflicts?! \n\nSightings of ghosts and aliens can be explained by psychological phenomena, though... but the idea that they could be programming quirks/errors is intriguing nonetheless. \n\nIf this computer simulation analogy proves to be true, then it would seem that the programmer is getting better as humans are now generally living longer, somewhat. \n\nIt would explain why we can't make much headway into Space yet! The programmer is still working on his/her/its program! lol\n\nOur society could be the sewer of another greater society above us!, to paraphrase Futurama's sewer mutants.

I am a Christian too and i understand where you are coming from.\n\nThe fact is that there can be no true love is there is no free will. How can you claim to love your wife if she cannot decide on her own what to do. She has to ask for permission before she can do anything, that won't be true love.\nThe kind of relationship God has with us as his children is different from the kind we have with our own, remember the bible says if we who are evil know how to give good gift to our children, how much more will God give good things to those who ask him.\n\nIf you had the power God has and his wisdom, i am sure you will have done the same. By the time you have stopped about 1 million people from doing what they want to do, even though you know its the best for them, they would label you a bully and a wicked god. If you think well about it, it is wiser to allow people decide what they want to do. They won't have the luxury of blaming you. Look at the case of Adam for example, he blamed God for giving him eve, that's why God now allows us to choose. I would like to talk to you more because it would not be possible on this forum, if you are interested, send me a message. My ID is tolumur@yahoo.com

What they probably don't know is that the style came from prison.\nthe men who were recipients of homosexuality would wear their pants in that fashion to show they were available.\n(THIS IS THE GOD'S HONEST TRUTH)\nAnd the designers made it a way of fashion....so our young men could walk around with their butts hanging out of their pants.\nIt's unbelievable that a man would ever want to go around with his butt out.
God did create the perfect place ...The Garden of Eden. God did not want us to suffer. We can thank all of that on Eve, that b****, every month I curse her. Just grab a bible and start with Genesis1:1 and read on........

"The PC.....   with its camera and mic capabilities is far better than any type of ""calling"".....  Why would anyone waste the extra money like that???  Understandable that one may not have a pc with them when they wish to talk with someone but isn't that what laptops were designed for????  \n\nSo far as price/cost is concerned, forget the phones/cell phones!  Actually, I believe many cell phones already have internet available as well.  (If its not part of them yet, cams for them should become a part of them too pretty soon)."

Very barbaric logic.  Do the children of criminals put to death also get put to death or are thrown in jail?\n\n...\n\nNo.\n\nWhy's that?  Because it wouldn't be just.\n\nWhy should we have to suffer because of our great-to-the-hundredth-degree grandparents wrongs?

Which day is the Sabbath? Is it Saturday? On which day should a Christian worship? I believe it is Sunday. The Saturday Sabbath was given to Israel. Ezekiel 20:12,20 states: I gave them [Israel] my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD and also hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you [Israel]. This was the first covenant to Israel.\n\nChristians have a new covenant. Jesus made a surety of a better testament (Hebrews 7:22). He [Christ] is the mediator of a better covenant (Hebrews 8:6). He [Christ] is the mediator of the new testament [or new agreement] (Hebrews 9:15).\n\nBecause of His death and this new agreement, we are no longer under ceremonial laws involving days. Moral laws are in effect in believer's hearts, but not the ceremonial laws. Proof? God says in Colossians 2:14,16 that Christ [blotted] out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross.... Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy- day, or of the new moon, or [Get it!] of the sabbath days.\n\nWe are not under the law, but under grace (Romans 6:14). God's moral law is written within and upon the hearts of believers, but ceremonial laws involving days have been nailed to the cross. We honor the Saviour of the new covenant on a new day -- the day of His resurrection, which is Sunday, the first day of the week. This we do out of love, not servitude, not through law, but through grace.

Nefer is the Egyptian word for beauty.\n\nNefer-Neferu-Aten, Beautiful is the beauty of Aten: the chief (and in this case) ONLY wife to Pharaoh Akenaten; her nickname was Nefertiti, which means the beautiful One comes. 18th dynasty.\n\nAlso Nefertiri, the Beautiful Lady. Daughter of Pharaoh Seti I. Chief wife to Rameses the Great. 19th dynasty.\n\nHope this helps.

I know, I've noticed it too.  I think it's like a complete stranger asking you to be part of their fun that does not involve anything nasty.  And they're telling you that they trust that you are not going to damage their stuff and that they trust that you'll take an awesome pic.  They're happy to be there and want you to be part of it.  And it's like two happy bubbles touching for just a second.  Then, you're both off on your separate ways.  \n\nI don't know why that's so pleasurable.  Kinda weird I guess.  People in other countries are just as super happy?  I'm not sure.
I was young and ignorant, it was miserable.  I am older now, more experienced, I have a better idea of what to expect from a situation and feel much better able to be prepared for the unforeseen.  \n\nWith enlightenment has come some pain, as preconceptions were destroyed, but the satisfaction I have derived from being able to help others is priceless, and on a day to day basis I am quite happy regardless of how adverse the circumstances become.\n\nI agree with you, there is bliss that I would have never known had I chosen to remain ignorant.
.Our society seems to focus on those who may cause pain to others and therefore judge all that are in that race, culture or now the gay rights issue.  I can only say that I agreed with you.  There are people who are social deviance in every aspect of life.  But, like the old saying goods all it takes is a few bad apples to ruin the whole barrel.  We are supposedly to be an intelligent society and should gain insight from past mistakes and not label everyone who is in that genre as equally deviant.
YOU don't say...\n\nwhat exactly is extreme religion vs religion?\n\nwould extreme non-religion also be borderline insanity?\n\nwould you coming to yahoo answers just to ask a crazy question like this be any sort of insanity...borderline or full fledged?
I totally agree!!!\n\nWe are all brothers and sisters on this planet.  We should love each other.
False, some people can really have an equal attraction to both males and females, I know since both my friend and I are bi-sexual.The reason why many believe that theres no such thing as bi-sexual is because then theres no way to explain it scientifically.  Now a days people are realizing that there are bi's out in the world.

Removing the paper is unnecessary in terms of the process of recycling.  Metal gets melted down and any paper gets burned off in the process.  The reality is that you don't have to clean the containers out either, it's more of a hygiene issue.  If you go several days or weeks between material pickups/dropoffs you'll run the risk of critters getting into your recycling or developing swarms of mosquitoes every time you open your container.  Hope this helps!

i dont understand, do you mean that we could have 4 of them, or is it 4 differnt ways to get married, either way i believe that if we were to all change our ways, if marriage laws changed, i dont really think it would make that huge of a differnt on society, becuase well its just marriage, yes its important, but i dont see it as such a big thing, to be like ooooo which of the 4 ways can i do it, or if its 4 marriages, i believe in 1 person, only, i would never hurt anyone like that, and if you meant with the same person, thats why renewing your vows is, i hope i'v answer your question

So you were teased as a kid.  I hate it for you.  Heck, most of us were teased as kids.  Sooner or later, it is time to grow up.  You know, get a life.\nYou don't like Christians.  Yeah, you've made that fairly obvious.  After the last half hour or so, my guess is that most of the Christians who have been exposed to you aren't too crazy about you, either.  But then, they aren't attacking you, are they? \nThere is no law that says you have to talk to Christians.  The worst they can do is to pray for you.\nSorry about the weenie thing.  Maybe you ought to keep it in your pants.  Then, nobody will know, and nobody will tease you.  Just a thought.\nThanks for the two points, man!  And....have a nice day.  Jesus loves you!!
????\n\nWhat is exactly the question?\nIt is not explicit at all...\n\nRevelate Eons?\n\nI could throw a light on that - if the question was clear enough :(
"It is Ethnocentrism, as the Christian God isn't really a European God. He killed off the European Gods. (Sorry WASPS it's true)\n\nAnd no, this is not what the Greeks and Romans did. When the Greeks went into Egypt (There are writings still surviving) they said things like ""There they call Demeter Isis"" (Which was inaccurate, but that's not terribly relevent) and so they went ahead and worshipped her, and some called her Isis, and some called her Demeter. Likewise with the Romans, they said, ""They also worship Jupiter, but they call him Zeus."" They didn't run around saying ""You have to call him Jupiter now, because Zeus is false."" The folks who wanted to call him Zeus called him Zeus, and the folks who wanted to call him Jupiter called him Jupiter, but he was recognized as being the same guy.\n\nAnd for the record Mr. The-Bible-is-real-because-it's-got-real-places-in-it, there are lots of people, places and things that are verifiable by Archaeological and written historical evidence of the mythology of the ancient Greeks, Romans, Babylonians, etc. So find yerself another argument."
There was a big anti-marijuana crusade back in the 1930s when millionaires such as Hearst & Dupont considered hemp to be an economic threat to their pulp mills (hemp is cheaper, more durable & saves more trees).\n\nToday, I suspect that it may be the big pharmaceutical companies that are so against marijuana. Because it can be used for such a wide range of ailments & can be grown so cheaply, it's considered a threat to drug manufacturers because they would lose money.
"Yes, Kulkulkan, there is intelligent life.  Quetzalcoatl is the Aztec version of the feathered serpent, I believe.  Viracocha is the Incan version of the feathered serpent.  You, Kukulkan, are the Mayan version of the feathered serpent.  And these names refer to a single being, a ""white man with golden hair"" who brought culture and knowledge to the Americas.  The same figure in the ancient middle east was known as Hermes, Mercury, Thoth, and Lucifer.  We also see this same motif in the medical symbol, the caduceus.  Now, I may or may not be that one person who knows what you're looking for here, but I hope I provided an intelligent answer to your question.  Thanks for asking it.  ---sincerely, UCSteve."
I do not think so.
if your willing to buy fireworks, the best for the money are artillery shells, i know around where i live they are 9.99 for 9 shells, really beautiful, and one called a show stopper, i shoots off 50-100 artillery shells and can cost anywhere between 50.00-200.00 depends on what you want really my favs are aerial, but then you also have ground effects which can be fun, i say stick with artillery shells, also aka festival balls

In my belief, there is only one Deity.  But you can compare Deity to a diamond in that there are many different facets.  The gods and goddesses of every pantheon, the Christian God, the Jewish G-d, Islam's Allah are all facets of the Universal Deity.  The names we use are only there to help us identify with Deity.  I use the names God, Goddess and a few names that I identify with depending on the reason I am praying to or speaking of Deity.
The system is a larger concept that we cannot at this point fully understand.  Think of the universe as a body, we are a small part that makes the whole function.  Just as cells in a body mature, some are created new, some are defective, all eventually die, just like we do.  Viruses evolve just like we do, they adapt because they are alive, just like us.  All things in nature adapt and change as time goes on, just as life does.  It's just one of those things we just need to accept and go on.
First of all why is it always assumed Muslims are Arabs? I am from Turkey, and I am Muslim. Second covering our head doing all the things we do is by choice. I am a very open person. I do not cover my head. I don't wear those baggy clothes. I have a very good career (Application Programmer). And I am not depressed. I make my own choices.\n\nFor those people who don't know anything about Islam:\n- Lesson number one: not all muslims are Arabs.\n- Lesson number two: islam is an open minded religion. Freewill is the number one rule.\n- Lesson number three: Islam value woman the best out of all the religions.\n-Lesson number four: Just beacause we are muslim does not mean we are not modern.\n- Lesson number five: Don't talk about something you don't know. Pick up a book and read. \n\nThank you cheymain for bringing up this issue.
Make a video telling him how you really feel about him or find a creative way to spend time with him. Go for a walk or treat him to an ice cream - just you and him. Kids and Dads don't have much time to spend alone with each other so that alone will be a treasure.

"You can study yoga independently (as I do) or go to classes.  There is probably something local, so look around in newspapers or online.  If you want to practice by yourself, you can buy books and videos or look up excercises online.  There's a show called ""Inhale"" that comes on Oxygen around 6 am, perfect if you have a job or school and don't have time later in the day.  Meditation is often used as a ""de-stressor"" and you may find that the more you meditiate, you start to feel closer to yourself, and your mind may become more ""quiet.""  To meditate you have to find a very quiet place, a place where not even white noise can interefer with the process.  Sit up straight in a comfortable position, which can be in a chair or on the floor in lotus* position (also used in yoga).  Closing your eyes is optional, but you may freak some people out with that.  Focus on breathing- in through the nose, out through mouth.  Imagine your breath fanning out of your mouth, ridding your body of toxins.  If you find that thoughts enter your head, don't fight them- it's part of the process.  Stay focused on your breath and don't judge your thoughts.  Stay sitting and focused for about 10-15 minutes and repeat daily.\n\n\n\n*Lotus position- Sitting on the floor cross-legged, slowly pull your left foot onto right thigh, sole up.  Then, pull right foot onto left tight, sole up.  Make sure to sit up straight."

I've never told my man: I love you! It doesn't mean I don't but it's just... Well I don't know!\nOne day, we were at the restaurant with two friends and our song just aired as the background music and I started looking at him as if nothing else existed. I took his hand as if we were alone at the table and I just fell into his eyes.\nI mean that might seem cheesy, but it's very true. He told me he understood that day!!\n;)

You were born into a certain caste.  You might have been a tailor.  Your parents would therefore have been tailors and from a family of tailors.  You stayed in your caste and only did work that your caste did.  There was no official movement between them, though people being people, there was.
Pirates lived pretty harsh lives while at sea. Many sailors (not just pirates) kept pets. Birds (which were intelligent, at vermin like weevils and could be rendered flightless pretty easily by trimming a wing) made good ship-board pets. Dogs required too much food (almost as much as a hand's ration), and cats are too solitary to be considered any individual's pet ... although many a pirate vessel did have a ship's cat to help keep the rats down. Monkeys were pretty popular, as well, since they could take pretty good care of themselves in heavy seas.\nShort answer, though, is that sailors kept pets because they needed pets. And they let them ride on their shoulder because parrots really like that.\nArrr.

Extremely ridiculous. Nature does not endow individuals or races with the same capacities/gifts. There's no way anyone could deny it. You are right, but I never say it, because it seems to get people all worked up for some reason.\n\nI think the expression you're quoting is more often used in reference to the entitlement to individual guarantees (or human rights ,if you will) of human beings in general. With the exceptions you mention (the mentally challenged, for example) I DO believe it holds true in this sense. \n\nHey, what happened to your other pick?

I think intolerance is based on jealousy.\nSome people can't cope with the fact that I don't need them to be happy. Yet, there they are wanting me to be there with them.\n\nI don't see how tolerance can be charity if it's unwanted, but to make tolerance mandatory is.\n\nYou can't have it all, you have to do it with what you've got, because what you've got, some other person hasn't...Be grateful for what you have, don't take it for granted.

"Only people who are educated and are able to handle the stresses of being a president should be presidents.\n\nDo you want someone with education and with at least some insight as to how to run a country?? Or do you want some high school dropout or drug addict to run your country.

Frankly, I like the US's way of election, even if it is not  fullproof (or even ""foolproof""). \n\nYes I know that our way is not perfect, and it may not be the best, but we have an opportunity to vote every 4 years and change the course of direction when we must.

You should learn about all cultures and lifestyles because these are your fellow human beings.  Staying closed minded does not help you to understand anyone.

Don't make the mistake of thinking that Jews are members of a particular country. Being a Jew is being a member of a religion not a nation. There are Jews in every country in the world, members of all nations and nationalities. They are also every colour that the human race can be. White, black, brown, yellow or red so there's obviously white ones. there are many famous Jews who are white so mention this to the person who thinks otherwise and set him/her a test. Ask them to identify some white Jews so they'll change their misguided opinions.

There's a difference between showing children different lifestyles and religions and forcing one to practice one.  There's nothing wrong with that picture.  What if your child were forced to perform Muslim prayers everyday as a practicing Christian?  If a parent can't handle their child being taught tolerance, which leads to acceptance and peace, then the parent should remove their child from school and home school them.

Many Christians look for forms of evil to confirm their own beliefs.  Wicca is gaining popularity and Christianity is in decline.  They blame Wicca for what they see as a decline in morals of the youth of the nation.  Because they define any stray from christianity as a betrayal of God and all that is good.  \n\nThey don't understand, nor do they care to understand, the concepts or purpose of our beliefs.  They just look at it as a threat to the world they have created.\n\nA world where sex is evil.\nA world where magik is an abomination.\nA world where they can make laws that follow the rules of their religion and not the will of the people.  \n\nThey are blind to everything else and so filled with ignorant hate that they lash out at us and try so hard to suppress it.  \n\nSee you in 2042.
Practice by reading an english book out loud to yourself.  Try to find one with alot of conversation in it to show you how the speach patterns of people change as they are talking.  I'm sure that nothing is wrong with you, except maybe a little bit of insecurity, which we all have so you're great.  Best wishes
I have, and I'm an American.  You know what?  Take a look at South Africa today, (Where the majority of slaves where kid napped from).  I'd have to say that the Africans have had it way better here, despite the few years they where in slaved.  I guess the Africans who are still bitter should be given a one way ticket home. To absolute poverty, famine, disease and destruction.
Yes, I missed it very much. I think at one point I started to have withdrawals.
"The New Testament teaches of Christ's coming and His instruction to establish His church - I believe there is actually a verse that states ""the Churches of Christ salute you"" but I can't seem to locate it just now - In answer to your question the bible only refers to Christ's church which was established by the apostles - read the book of Acts - after the Holy Spirit came on the day of Pentecost - and the apostles began the work of preaching the gospel and establishing Christ's church -"

Its time to go to work. To the batmobile!!! I don't think anyone is catching on. I am though, can you tell???

No, their a very few that can lay hand on people and heal them, I haven't see it done yet. \n\nAlso if the person that need to be healed don't have enough faith, it want happen...

"well even though my parents took me to church every sunday and sunday school and all that, i still found God on my own. When I was 16 I became Pagan and was actively doing that for a few years until one day i got very sick, I had a rare form of strep throat where 1 in 3 people die and i remeber my family praying over me for a week while i was in and out of consciousness until i came out of it and recovered almost immediatly! That next day I was lying in bed and a warm glow surrounded me and I heard God say that He never left my side even though I left Him. I went to church the next sunday and told my pastor and He said ""The Lord is my shepard, what more do we need? We are all sheep in his flock and if he has 100 sheep and 1 strays away, He will leave the 99 to bring that 1 back because He never loses one."" and after that I knew that He really was my Lord and Savior :)"
Forgiveness is LETTING GO of the hurt and anger which someone inflicted on you, and getting on with your life. It means you are not going to let this eat you up like cancer.It does not have to mean that you are going to be buddies with the ones who hurt you.
Yawn!  Get a life.\n\nH
Maybe you have a good Lutheran congregation in your neighborhood.
No. Slut is someone who sleeps around a lot with lots of different men. But most people that have pre marital sex have it inside a relationship with someone. Like they might be in a relationship and have sex with that person but only with person there with, which isn't being slutty. Also remember there are plenty of men that have pre marital sex,so what do u call a man that commits pre marital sex? Why are u just picking on women?
Islam only requires 5 basic things:\n\n1. Declare that there is no god but Allah\n2. Pray 5 times a day\n3. Fast during Ramadan\n4. Make the pilgrimage to Mecca once in your lifetime\n5. Give to charity

"Define ""out in public"" and qualify what kind of stranger and what sort of talk?\n\nFor example, if I'm sitting at the bar and a nice woman next to me tries to strike up a chat, I not only like it, I encourage it.\n\nOn the other hand, if I'm walking down the sidewalk and some crazy dude comes up and starts asking me, ""what's the frequency, Kenneth"" ...well...that didn't turn out too well for Dan Rather, did it?  \n\nIt's a shame that in this modern world, we tend to stay in self-protective mode (and often rightly so). There is much that may be said about the schizophrenia that living in modern society has become, but that's a large subject far beyond the range of this post.\n\nI'll leave you with this notion from the reknowned psychiatrist R.D. Laing, who proposed that schizophrenia is a response to living in modern society."

in  general what i have learned is that most bullies are actually cowards... they are miserable people who sometimes being bullied at home or elsewhere..so they attack who they think is weak. some are spoiled brats... with little training.  low self esteem that has to be stroked by tearing down others.

People have this erroneous idea that God is some old white haired bearded man sitting in a rocking chair with nothing better to do than watch us like a hawk.\n\n#1. God is not a man and therefore does not think, act or do like humans do - and he never ages. He is not 10, 20 or 30 - he is Spirit and is ageless.\n#2. Angels are assigned to us and they keep a record of everything that goes on around us - who we deliberately offend and who offends us - if we sinned or didn't sin - and so on.\n#3. God sees to it the universe is kept in working order as well as all life (even if life exists elsewhere - he would have created it and watches over it).\n\nIf we are not fitting for the new world to come - he doesn't want us there. The New Heavens and New Earth already created and prepared awaits those who rise above his and her sinful desires, and shows themselves trustworthy and responsible.\n\nHe gave man another chance - and through Jesus is the only way to God and to salvation from the death and eternal punishment sin brings.

"Wow people are really jerks about religions they don't agree with. I believe for a hindu, heaven is not so much a state of mind as it is the melding of your self/spirit/soul with the ""Ultimate Reality"" aka God/heaven/eternity whatever you want to call it. There is no designated time or place for this ultimate reality, it just is, much like with the Christian idea of heaven or hell, there really is no place for it, we assume heaven is up, hell is down, but there is no way for us to see it. As for Hindu ""hell"", being reincarnated at all can be considered hell. If you do especially badly in life, you can get reincarnated down a few rungs."

Psalm 133:1 \nSinging is to be an outward manifestation of ones faith and joy. It is in response to God's saving work and finds expression not in unhindered self-expression, but in humble, disciplined participation in the Body of Christ. \nBy singing, we are reminded (and remind others) of the reality of the Church's unity in Christ, her presence on heaven and earth, of our individual contribution as a member of the Body, and, preeminently, of our great God who is the subject of our praise."

"No.  Humans want more, note that in the American ideology of ""Size Matters"" and ""Bigger is Better"" (no jokes, please).  Adam and Eve wanted more, and Adam's fall hath doomed us all.

I would say as soon as possible. If you want a REAL head start buy them a doll of a different race. For instance, if you have a little girl (lets say caucasion) buy her an african american barbie. and for a boy a black GI Joe. Not sure if it would work but its worth a try. (and vice versa if your african american, hispanic etc.)
If someone is responsible enough to have sex - then they should be responsible enough to handle the consequences. Abortion is the easy way out not to mention murder.
"Huh.  Interesting query.

An honest answer:  if you are white, it is never ok to say anything at all to do with color.  But it is perfectly ok for any other color to say things about whites.  This is our society.  At least in America, anyway.

Not really. It depends on the way you will say it and how close you are to the person. I agree with you, most people doesnt want to admit mistakes but mature ones are open to it because they know it what makes them strong.
since the beginning of time, people have been molding religious objects and figures into what best suits their beliefs.  religions continuously 'borrow' from others.\n\nbesides, why do you seem so angry about this, after all, isn't imitation the highest form of flattery?

I think you can't be spiritual without a sense of humour.  After all, I think it's quite clear God has a sense of humour.\n\nI'm a Christian, and I find many jokes about Christians to be quite funny.\n\nFor instance, how many Christians does it take to change a lightbulb?\nTwelve:  ten to pray about it, one to take up an offering, and a pastor to tell us how to live without the lightbulb.

"Sexualy speaking, the term you want is ""Open"".  A person who is ""Open"" is open to all new experiences but is still discriminate about the people with whom they enjoy these passtimes.  \n\nThough to try and put a label on someone who doens't like labels is a bit of a misnomer, wouldn't you say?  \n\nBiSexual means that they are attracted to sexual experiences with both sexes.  It does in no way mean that you MUST choose one or the other, nor that you MUST have both when you partake.  It merely means that you have both as a stimuli, nothing more.  In this light, BiSexual would fit you more than just the vague term ""Open"", too.  \n\nBut in all things, it's your choice to be labeled or unlabeld, Bisexual, Hetero, Gay or Open."
Of course God did. Emotions were automatically apart of our being.

Yes, I studied Buddhism for a while. However, I found the idea of trying to rise above suffering through enlightenment impractical and detrimental to growth.\n\nI have bounced many philosophies and religions through my mind and heart. Catholicism is my home. There I see the utter joy that suffering brings because it causes growth and redemption. Furthermore, the middle path as Buddha described it leaves one struggling to fight the river when really one should embrace the current and follow its flow. God asks us for extraordinary things from our life. To do great deeds and love big. Middle of the road is pleasure for one's self only.

No way, I would be way too hurt. Plus if they do that then they don't really appreciate you. So why should you stay with them. I might forgive them if they cheated once when they were drunk or something, and I could tell that it was absolutely something that they regret and I am the only one they want. However, making a separate whole new side life from you, that is just saying that you are not enough for them for one. And damn it....why would anybody forgive anybody who would do that s***. They don't even deserve a new girlfreind or wife ever again in their entire lives!!! If that happened to be I would tell any new person that he attempted to date what happened, so they would leave him!! He doesn't deserve s***!!
I am your friend, and always will be babe!

Simply accept people for who they are. Look at the person. Treat others a little nicer than they sometimes treat you. That way we are doing what we can to make our world a better place.\n\nWe never judge, period.  Listen more than talk.  Only when we listen do we have the opportunity to learn.  When we are talking, we are not really learning anything.\n\nA smile is universal to all cultures and very important.

Personally I think her filing for divorce is an outward sign of her guilt...she can't face what she has done and thinks by divorcing (running away) she can cleanse herself (ignore the situation) and everything will be alright. I think <my opinion> you should still continue to fight divorce and let her know w/out doubt that you forgive her
I do! Because the Bible says 'God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.' (John 3:16) and I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that He died for my sins and rose again from the dead, and because of His blood that was shed, my sins are forgiven and I am a new creation and saved! But you need to remember to live right and holy, pleasing God in all your ways.
Every single non-rainy day for awhile now, after work, I walk around the city neighborhood and evangelize.  I leave meaningful tracts everywhere.  I understand this is expected of me, but I do it because I love Him; also, I truly believe it glorifies God, so it qualifies as something I do for Him.
aH MAN that is gross.  I ate some last night.  \n\nI keep mine secured in a ball of toe cheese between the 2nd and 3rd toe.
It is the moral fabric and value system that people need.  Faith gives life a purpose and meaning.  The church itself provides a supportive community for individuals in many phases of life.  The church can be a loving, supportive, but also disciplining part of the person's life.  The people of the faith community provide a lot of benevolent care to the needy of the community and do it out of their own time and pocketbook.    Faith in God continually points away from a self centered view of life to caring about others and giving to the needs of our immediate community.
No.  Say someone you love needs medicine or they will die.  If you take the medicine because you can't afford it is good for the person but not right by law.\n\nThis is one of the questions they used to ask in ethics class.

A-Lister you pose the best question I have read here. My opinion is that people who are racist just hate. When tragedy hits and it comes down to me or thee, WE are in this together and hate goes out the window, at least for a moment. I wish in times where there is no disaster we could all remember we share the same DNA. Truth is that most of us aren't WHITE at all. I am of American Indian decent and look like a funeral lilly, where is the fair in that? My brother is dark as caramel so go figure. The most racist are the ones with the most to fear of being mixed! LOL. The solution is to just go ahead and pray for those who wrongfully persecute you and let karma do the rest. They will one day see the error of the racist way. Kind of like Hitler did. Live well and know not all crackers are racist. LOVES :} nana
Some of them are forced to resort back to Filipino language when they don't have the necessary command of further English to complete their sentence...similar to Spanglish. Should you personally go to a foreign country, you'll likely have studied up on the language but no doubt you'll get into a situation where you start a sentence in the foreign language but don't have the knowledge to complete it with resorting to English.
I'm a girl and a gamer and my husband is too, and obviously I cannot complain.\n\nMaybe....... unlike all the other men that are spending their time in bars and sleeping around, they ARE waiting for when they are ready to meet someone that actually meets their interests?\n\nObviously there's more than enough men for you, you are such a winner, with how you want men to spend their money on girls instead of interests.\n\nBesides, 17-23 is an age where most boys are still maturing, women mature faster and men kind of take a while to catch up, I have a 7 year age difference, my husband is much older than me and I think that it's the only way I would ever be on the same wavelength, and he's still immature about a lot of things. \n\nI think most guys are not playing games, actually, but instead smoking pot, out having 'fun', getting into deadly car wrecks, dealing, dancing in clubs and popping E, knocking girls up and then stiffing them, and wasting time in other ways.\n\nI think you have some gamer you might be going for and they're just not interested. Maybe these guys are just not interested enough in petty things and hanging out and would rather play games.\n\nTo note: my husband also plays Dungeons and Dragons and he got me involved in it; and no we are not nerds in any typical way, he's ex-military and I'm an ex-model (after baby your body kind of fades...)

The answer to your question is yes.\n\nHe has tortured, tormented and killed people throughout the OT.  He once killed some people when he was gambling with Satan.  He has joined in wars, killed animals and plants, and he allows innocent people to go to Hell and be tortured by his buddy Satan.\n\nAs loving as He is supposed to be, he has committed more atrocities than Hitler.  But then most people don't trouble themselves to actually read the Bible, they just say they are Christian.
Maybe...
There is no difference between the practice if witchcraft and the practice of priestcraft. They both involve the use of superstitious rituals and incantations. Magic holy water and incense and symbolic cannibalism (the Eucharist) As well as the worshiping of pagan idolatrous images and icons.
Human beings are inately selfish.  We are born selfish, and unless we are educated to be otherwise, we live and die selfish.  Occasionally, the selfishness shows through in spite of education and our best efforts to contain it.\n\nThose who follow Jesus try not to be selfish, but they are only human and fall sometimes.  Those who TRULY study and obey Jesus' teachings are the ones who TRULY try not to be selfish and rude.  They know that this life is not the final destination, it is only a journey, albeit a very important one.  \n\nHumans are unique.  God made us unique.  We were made in His image, but with our own personalities and physical traits.  That is part of the beauty of God's Earth.  We behave in different ways because God gave us free will.  Wasn't that nice of Him?
Because bearing children is an instinct that every species has to do in order to procreate.

I would just drop all contact with her.  If you have caller I.D. and you see her # don't pick up the phone.  Eventually even slower people will get the picture on that one!
I always figured that the women (or girls) that do that, do it because they don't think they can do anything else. Maybe they start out thinking they'll just do it till they get enough money to do something else, but get stuck in the rut of doing it, especially if they're 'pushed' to do it, for drugs or for a pimp. I find it hard to believe that any woman would 'want' to do it, like choosing a career.
a classic case of sleep paralysis.\n\ngoogle it\n\nI am a heavy sufferer, spirit like entities apply pressure to the chest most often.\n\nThis phenomenon is quite common, if I was not a scientist and skeptic I would believe that I have been visited by spirits on many occasions, but then I saw a documentary about sleep paralysis.\n\nplease look it up, you will feel much better for reading about others who suffer this infliction
I don't know but an asian friend of mine said that because of her asian eyes it was hard for her to put the contacts in.
"There is scientific proof that there was a large flood in Noah's part of the world. What I find interesting is that in an ancient manuscript, called ""The Epic of Gilgamesh"", the main character, aforementioned, spoke of a great flood, just like Noah's, and fleeing with his family and many animals in a boat.  What's even more interesting was that this manuscript was written 1500 years before Noah's account was written. \nThis just shows how a catastrophic event passed down, by word of mouth, to many generations. It's probably unlikely that a flood covered the entire earth, because when the Bible mentions the world, the actual known world at that time was a tiny spot in the Mesopotamia region.  That could have been flooded entirely, who knows?\nI am also Catholic..."
"We think, therefore we dream. Not everyone is brought from the exact same way or culture, or environment. I think dreams are just compositions of various fractions of your mind. \n\nThings that are bottled up in your mind, things that bothered you, things that made you happy, anticipation of events etc, are the stuff that made up your dreams. \n\nThey are not premonitions of future events. They are like little sticky notes that remind you of things that you may have forgotten. Thus, drive you to do things that you may not realise that they are necessary...\n\nthe mind controls our action. But we can control our mind by not letting our ""destiny"" be dictated by the contents of dreams."
Faith is more than just believing. It is allowing Jesus to save you. He offers us a gift and all we have to do is have Faith that it is sufficient to save us and accept it, and it will save us. Just out of curiosity, what do Catholics believe? (email me please)
well it time to have a little fun,\ni dont have a clue but i think NGO stands for No Goes Overboard.
The secret to life is that there are no secrets.  Shhhh, dont tell anybody.
I was 20 when my mother died.  I wasn't at her side at the time, but this doesn't bother me much, because the last thing I did say to her was that I loved her.  And, too, I've come to realize that we all really are on our own when we pass away---that's one journey we all must make alone.  It's some consolation to me to realize that, and I hope it consoles you, too.\n\nThat said, I've often wanted to tell her again how much I love her.  I do talk to her and tell her so.  But I think the best way to tell her is to live my life as productively and respectably and happily as possible.  I pursued an education, which I know she wanted.  I practice as a physician, and I believe she is proud of me for that.  I've married a wonderful man, and had beautiful kids.  I think she approves.  And I believe that by fulfilling her wishes for me (a full, happy, productive life), I'm telling her again and again how much I love her and appreciate all she did for me.\n\nI hope you can gradually feel better about this.  I know it took me a long time.  And sometimes it still hurts twentyone years later.
I have a deep love for the people of the former Soviet Union.\n\n Older ones survived many wars and lost many Friends and family members. They survived Communism, loss of privileges, loss of freedom, loss of religion... Many endured years of near starvation, over crowding, lack of heat/electricity/water. And then there is the jails and work camps that many endured especially if they spoke out against anything aforementioned...\n\nThe younger ones have come thru the fall of Communism, then it trying to be reinstated and again fall. Western influences and new freedoms have confused many especially since Christian based morals have become depleted in their society. Lack of material things and necessities have pushed many into the sex trade, drug trade, and the Red Mafia. Lack of adequate education means many will be destined for hard work and low (actually next to nothing) pay...\n\nWhat will happen for the next generation... those yet born? Likely not much better if not worse than the parents. The economy is in dismal condition. Many will be born with diseases because of their parents' lifestyle. Lack of health-care exasperates the problems. And most of the aforementioned problems is ongoing so the children don't get any better a home, a life then their parents...

He is my Eternal Heavenly Father and the father of my Spirit.  \nI believe that I grew in a greater understanding of his love and my relationship with Him when I lost my daughter.\n\nWhen I gave birth to may daughter, it was the most awe inspiring experience. Nothing can even compare with the feelings that are instantaneous when you set eyes on the perfect little baby that you where a part of helping to make. (MIRACLE)\nLoosing her has been to date the most difficult trial, but upon reflection and deep pondering this is how I explain it.  I yearn for her and miss her. I want to see and be with her again.  Well Heavenly Father is I feel is not so very different, I know that our families are central to Heavenly Fathers Plan so that we can better understand his great love for us. Nothing compares to parenthood.  I imagine that each time he sends one of us down here his heart is broken and sad why, because many of us won't find him again, or choose not to.  When we leave his presence to come here to this earth we are given our agency out of his great love for us.  How sad it must be for him to wait and watch as we struggle through this existence.  The same ache that is in my heart over not having my daughter anymore I can imagine Heavenly Father having. Except, for my love even though it was great was and is not even close to GODs great love for us that is perfect.
yes, but it is not a nice way to live for either side.
*snort* No.  because my name is Kero Bearus.  And I am myself and always myself all the time.  Posers suck.  Im such a creative person and never get my ideas from anywhere else.  Everyone keeps copying me.  Stop it! I'm not the center of your universe.  Stop stealing my ideas! \n\nGrow up

And it makes sense!

"No, because it lost that years ago. It started with multiple divorces, then graduated to ""living together"", and there is not much left in the way of status.\nEven gays want to use it as a status symbol when living together, so what does the institution really represent nowadays?"
Whether or not you go to church has nothing to do with your salvation, nor does it make you any less of a Christian.  It's good for believers to fellowship with other believers, but that exchange can happen anywhere (work, school, etc).  The church itself refers to people--people make up a church; the building is just a place for the church to gather.  God doesn't love people worshiping at Bedside Baptist any less than people meeting at an actual building.

"You're going to get a lot of different answers from a lot of different people (most of them will probably contain either the words ""Jesus"" or Bible"" in them).\n\nAll I can say to you is this: read a lot, do some research, learn, and ask lots of questions.  If it's a faith that you're seeking, I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for.\n\nBeliefnet has some great quizzes along the lines of ""What religion am I?"" and some other good stuff too.  Give them a shot!  I hope you find what you're looking for :)"

"A ""creation"" day can last an indefinite time span. There are several examples in the Bible about how ""day"" can have the connotation of a period of time that is not necessarily 24 hrs. For example, Genesis says that on the seventh day of creation God came to rest and in relation to this the Apostle Paul mentions in one of his letters that ""we are still living in the resting day of God"". So that last ""day"" of creation, the seventh day, streches up to our days."

"Well, for basics, WWJD is more a ""marketing tool"" or buzzphrase than something to be applied in this context. \n\nThe goal was to have people examine how they treat others or how devoted they are to God, by comparing it to how Jesus treated others or how he related to God.\n\nObviously one can ""emulate"" Jesus in terms of the sort of moral behavior they exhibit, without having to be a Jewish man (kinda hard for the women), or being single, or being a wandering prophet, or having to be crucified by Romans -- just as you might personally have a role model for yourself, yet you only emulate his ATTITUDE and ways of relating to others and outlook on life, not necessarily all the details of that mentor's circumstances in life.\n\nAs far as having kids, secular thought (generally) is that you have to be careful with your resources, you have to remain in control of your life, you don't want to take on more responsibility than you can handle, and so forth. Kids are often ""fit into one's life"" rather than allowed to intrude randomly.\n\nThe conventional wisdom of general Christianity is that kids are a blessing and a gift from God (often quoted is the verse that ""Children are like arrows; blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them), and that one is denying the providence of God by removing any possibility of ever having kids. This is the reason that the Catholic church has that policy about ""no birth control,"" although it's often not followed by the US church. In any case, kids are considered gifts rather than inconveniences to one's career or happiness, more of the time. \n\n(Personally, I think there's a line to walk between giving God room to work and being reproductively responsible with one's given resources.)"

Y'know... MonNoggin works at home... You form your own opinion.
I beg to differ -\n\nReligons are largely focused on an afterlife, and working towards an unsure future.\n\nBut for one who doesn't believe in God (and still has their own ethics by which to govern themselves) they see the fruits of their actions immediately - learning to live in the moment, appreciate the now, treat people well so you have positive consequences now. \n\nI don't believe God, but I feel quite fulfilled - I have better relationships with people because I think about how things are now, in this moment - not worrying about an afterlife. I feel content because I can experience life now, not for an unknowable afterlife. \n\nFor me, it actually makes my life more meaningful, because I see the fruits of activity rather immediately.
Yes.  Life's too short for anger.  Get over it and move on.
God never wrote the first edition of the Bible, it was written by man which is why it is full of inaccuracies.
Any type of person or group that advocates hurting living beings (ie: animal sacrifice) are vile and horrific and inhuman.\n\nI don't believe in satan or demons or such, but I believe that evil exists within people who can hurt others without conscience  (or squeamishness, as you put it).\n\nGet a life.
"Something else. It's a prank circulating around the internet.\n\nNote that the verse is fake.\n\nHere is the verse:\n\n""But (even so), if they repent, establish regular prayers, and practise regular charity,- they are your brethren in Faith: (thus) do We explain the Signs in detail, for those who understand.""(the Koran  , 9:11)"

Jehovah God does not have a mother. he was always there. Jesus has a mother, Mary and Joseph was his stepfather
There is no code. God does not keep secrets. The Bible is very Black and white. It is straight forward. Do not fall into trying to decode. That is the work of Satan.\nAs far as the war, you speak of ...YES! Watch Pastor Hagee he will explain the Bible Prophecy. He does not assume or use his own interpretation of what he imagines. He uses the Bible and explains what the Bible means. He interprets the written word in accordance to Biblical knowledge. He is very well educated. The Bible does teach us that man will destroy himself and the earth. Yes, this will occur when Iran, the Imam, uses nuclear weapons to attack Israel. The Imam believes his mission is to kill the Jews in Israel and then to kill Americans. Today, Iran has been acquiring the Nuclear weapons to complete it's believed to be mission.  China has been helping Iran for the past 2 years, to do so. The explained theory is that Imam and Iranians will first attack the Jews in Israel and then infiltrate bombs into America. God tells us to keep our eye on Israel, when the things come to pass there, as foretold, we are headed for the Holy War. The Jews are God's protected people. We are to treat them with love and respect and honor. The Bible is true. I urge people to read it. To pray and build a personal relationship with the Lord. Live to better the world. The most important thing is not that the world will end or how it ends. The most important thing is how we all live our life both now and eternally. Go forth and teach the saving message of Christ to all nations.\nAs the Bible predicts: There are wars, famine, disease, storms, earthquakes and so on throughout the world. There are social problems and people looking for peace and can not find it. There has come the time that brother against brother and so on. The US is at War in Iraq & Saudi. The US has enemies in many countires. This is a time of turbulenece. When China backs Iran and in turn Iran attcks Israel and the US this will result in a major world war.
"Part of the prophecy of Jesus Christ was that He must be of the lineage of David, ""the root of Jesse"" (Jesse being the Father of King David.)  Although not a single drop of blood from Joseph flows in the Body of Jesus.  (it's from the Males that the ""sinful nature"" is passed down) and The mother's blood never mixes with the unborn child. (that's why they have PATERNITY Tests)\n\nThe Lineage of Jesus is prophisied to be from the lineage of Kings.  If you read the Lineage in the Gospel of Matthew It is traditionally known to be that of Joseph, but the Lineage of Jesus in the Gospel of Luke traces the ancestroy of Mary (not Joseph).  So either way you go, the lineage goes back to King David.  Thereby fulfilling the prophecy of His Lineage from both parents.\nThe prophecy of descending from King David and the prophecy of the blood lineage.   \n\nTwo prophecies out of 435 fulfilled with one set of Parents!!!"
Who said that?  They're lying.  Americans are lazy.

First of all Christians aren't mindless. God doesn't want us to be mindless nor does he want us to have blind faith. He wants us to use our brain and think and question things and make decisions for ourselves. That is why he gave us brains and free will. God wants us to know what we believe and why and as such we must have our eyes wide open in our faith in Him. I have never forced my beliefs on anyone. Jesus has never done that either. He would give His opinion and have His say. Anyone forcing their religion or beliefs on someone is in the wrong. Even a Christian who tries to force their opinion on someone is sinning and needs to stop. Yes I will give my opinion on lots of things, especially when I see someone such as you making the comments or posing a question such as you have, but you are free to believe and think what you want. Yet it seems that most of those who are Anti-Christ and Anti-God want to have their say or make rude comments, but not let the Christians have their say. So now you had your say and I had mine and you can take it or leave it. The choice is now yours. John 3:3-6 and Ephesians 2:8-9

"Yes, I call them deja-dreams.  I'll have a dream where I'll wake up thinking ""weird, I don't even know those people"" and the circumstance of the dream will be sort of mundane, yet it sticks with me, sometimes for years.  Years later, it happens, and it is sort of a deja-vue (sp?) to me, only I remember the dream.\n\nYou'd have to email me if you want my full opinion on why that happens, it is sort of complicated.  Just don't forget to mention this answer or question, or I'll forget lol"
"Well, since you haven't provided the instructions and questions to which these are apparently the answers, it's hard to tell what you were trying to do, but here are a few notes:\n\n""Epouvantable"" as a response to ""ça va?"" seems abrupt. I might go with ""Comment ça va?"" and ""Pas terrible"" or ""ça va?"" and ""Bof! pas tellement"" instead.\n\n""Qu'est-ce que tu as?"" means ""What's wrong?"" so your response doesn't make sense. You might try replying, ""Je m'ennuie. J'ai un tas de choses à faire ce soir avant de sortir, et j'ai peur de ne pas les finir."" Or something like that.\n\nTo be honest, I've never seen the word ""raplapla"" before. If you're sure of your slang source, then fine.\n\n""Weekend"" is singular, so you need a singular form of the verb to go with it: ""Comment s'est passé ton week-end?""\n\nOther than that, there are a few spelling errors, conjugation errors, accents missing etc, including:\namusé(e)\nà huit heures\nde quel quai\ncoûte\nneuf euros\nfaire de l'aérobic\nje pars (partir is an irregular verb)"
I saw that sign some supposed Christian had too.  I could hardly believe it.  Most Christians totally miss the point about what being a Christian is all about.  \n\nI don't think Jesus ever intended for people to form a religion around himself anyway. He was only trying to point out what was wrong with the Jewish practices at the time.
"My Sunday School class is going through the video series ""The Way of the Master"" and they said on there that the past 1000 years, that's what the church has been teaching to make people feel better about it.  I totally agree with you.  Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't Christ say that if a good human father would punish his children, then why wouldn't the Father in Heaven do the same?  He is love but He is also just."
I have several friends in Melbourne, Perth, Sydney and Brisbane, and they have no trouble at all distinguishing Americans from the British. The American accents (even regional ones like Southern, New Yorker, Bostonian, and California) are very distinct, and with the widespread viewing of American films, no one from other countries seems to have any trouble picking an American accent out from the crowd.\n\nThey may have American accents down, but could a typical Australian tell the difference between a South Afrikaan, a Kiwi (aka New Zealander), an Irish, a British, a Scottish and a Welsh accent? ;-) Come on, Aussies! Show us what you got!

"1. Under the leadership of your Pastor or group leader, each\n   participating person writes his own name on a piece of paper which is\n   then put into a box, to be drawn. Participation should be voluntary,\n   but all Christians should be encouraged to participate.\n   \n   2. Then, each participant draws one name randomly from the box. This\n   is the name of his ""footwash partner"" for this ceremony. As each\n   person draws a name, he reads the name out loud and pairs off with his\n   footwash partner. People whose names have already been drawn will\n   already have a footwash partner, the person who drew their name, so\n   they will not draw a name from the box. If you draw your own name or\n   the name of someone who has already been paired off, discard that name\n   and draw another. Thus, all participants will be grouped into pairs.\n   Try to get an even number of participants in each ceremony, so no one\n   is left without a partner.\n   \n   Make no distinction by age, sex, or marital status. It should be a\n   pure random drawing, which represents the fact that all Christians are\n   entitled to give and receive foot washing to and from all other\n   Christians.\n   \n   3. Each participant should provide his own water, basin, and towel to\n   wash the feet of his footwash partner. (Optionally, the church or\n   worship group can provide these supplies.) Jesus makes no mention of\n   using soap or oil, so soap or oil are not needed.\n   \n   4. All the footwashing should be done at the same time, with the\n   person who did the drawing washing his partner's feet first, then\n   getting his own feet washed afterwards, by his partner. Once the\n   pairing-off is accomplished, the procedure should only take a few\n   minutes to do.\n   \n   5. A new drawing should be conducted for each footwashing ceremony, so\n   that the footwash partners are constantly being changed. It is\n   understood that this level of physical intimacy, conducted randomly\n   with fellow Christians, is not usual in modern life. Too bad. It\n   should be. It was clearly the Lord's intention that we should care\n   directly for each other's physical needs, as if they were our own.\n   \n   6. Before the footwashing begins, the Leader of the ceremony should\n   read the authorizing Scriptures, John 13:13-15, Then he\n   should pray a prayer similar to the following:\n\n     O Lord, we try to follow your commands, including Your command for\n     us to wash each other's feet. Please be with now as we demonstrate\n     our love for one another, as You have loved us. In Jesus' holy name\n     we pray, Amen.\n\n\n   6. The footwashing ceremony should be conducted with the same\n   frequency as Holy Communion, recommended at least once a month,\n   preferably each week or more frequently.\n   \n   May the Lord richly bless you as you try each day to live by His\n   commands.\n\n    Yours in Christ,\n\n     Bill McGinnis  <><\n     bmcgin@patriot.net\n     http://www.patriot.net/users/bmcgin/chapel.html\n          http://www.LoveAllPeople.org\n          http://www.InternetDailyChapel.org\n\n\n   Contact: bmcgin@patriot.net."

I completely agree.  I once said (in an English class) that people are going to look back at this day and age and laugh because we believed in Jesus.  People got mad at me, but eh.  As a child I was told that there was an Easter Bunny, a Santa Claus, a Tooth Fairy, and a God.  I believed because that's what children do, but as I got older I learned to question these beliefs.  I am so tired of Christians telling me they believe in God because that's what they're taught and that's what's in the bible.  Learn to think for yourself.
I am an active LDS person who is also very skeptical of most aspects of the religion. \n\nThe one thing I will tell you is that South Park is usually VERY accurate when it portrays Mormons. Trey Parker and Matt Stone grew up in the suburbs of Denver where there are a lot of Mormons. The south park episode featuring this clip ( http://www.vsocial.com/PlatAdPlayer.swf?v=26069 ) is actually almost dead-on. The only big mistake they made is that there are supposed to be 4 sets of gold plates all bound together instead of just 4 separate gold tablets. I'm not saying that South park is always good or correct, I'm just saying that they're fairly accurate when it comes to Mormons. And most Mormons would probably not like to hear that.\n\nI could go on about everything else for several pages, but I won't today. Let me know if you have any other questions for someone with the rare perspective of being immersed in the religion, but not blinded by the propaganda.

"Many educated people once thought that the earth was flat as in the days of Columbus. The Bible writer Isaiah knew the the earth was round. How did he know that? Because he was informed of that fact by God himself. \nIsaiah 40:22 __""It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in.""\n\nThere are way too many Scriptures to prove the accuracy of the Bible. --too many to list here. Many scientists do not believe in God so how reliable are they?"
Jesus was initially a personification of the logos (the cosmic christ). Later the Romans made him a historical god-man. Mainstream Christianity is based on mythology. Original christianity is also based on mythology, but unlike the ignorant and naive, they knew it.

"There is great dispute over the true origins of Boxing Day. The more common stories include:\n\nCenturies ago, merchants would present their servants food and fruits as a form of Yuletide tip. Naturally, the gifts of food and fruit were packed in boxes, hence the term ""Boxing Day"". \nIn feudal times, Christmas was a reason for a gathering of extended families. All the serfs would gather their families in the manor of their lord, which made it easier for the lord of the estate to hand out annual stipends to the serfs. After all the Christmas parties on December 26, the lord of the estate would give practical goods such as cloth, grains, and tools to the serfs who lived on his land. Each family would get a box full of such goods the day after Christmas. Under this explanation, there was nothing voluntary about this transaction; the lord of the manor was obliged to supply these goods. Because of the boxes being given out, the day was called Boxing Day. \nIn Britain many years ago, it was common practice for the servants to carry boxes to their employers when they arrived for their day's work on the day after Christmas (December 25). Their employers would then put coins in the boxes as special end-of-year gifts. This can be compared with the modern day concept of Christmas bonuses. The servants carried boxes for the coins, hence the name Boxing Day. \nIn churches, it was traditional to open the church's donation box on Christmas day, and the money in the donation box was to be distributed to the poorer or lower class citizens on the next day. In this case, the ""box"" in ""Boxing Day"" comes from that one gigantic lockbox in which the donations were left. \nIn Britain because many servants had to work for their employers on Christmas day they would instead open their presents (i.e., boxes) the next day, which therefore became known as Boxing Day."
Have a lot of sex??!!
Unfortunately most people, especially guys are shallow. Lately all guys care about is a pretty face and a sexy body. Not too many people care about the person underneath the make-up, or behind the crooked teeth. A lot f guys present girls like trophies, and wear them like a fancy scarf - for show. Whoever has the prettiest girl, wins.

It is also a significant and decisive culture in the world and has a very long history.\n\nOn the other hand, Hungarian culture has many things come from Turkish peoples (words, food, lifestyle) because of the often shared history, so if you learn first about Hungary, it can be a starting point for your Turkish studies.\n\nFor Hungary: If you’re fed up with the Islamic stuff, Hungarian culture would mean a bit refreshment because of the differences. Hungarian language is also something very unique if you’ve been familiar only to Indo-European languages so far. Another great advantage is that I’ll be there for you to teach you! :)\n\nBasically, it’s your choice. There is no better or worse option. Any culture can be interesting.\n\nYou can find many books about Hungary at the website of the national library (see the ones in English at the link below).\nThe second and third links are little appetizers, a glimpse of Hungarian culture.
i think that coz of1-  the media which made muslims to seems to look terrorist which is not true\nsome ppl do it in purpose while others dont \n2-the second reason is the misinterpretation of quran, picking verses from the text and neflecting others\n3-arabic language is so different from english,as in arabic is very rich language and can be easily misunderstood if u dont know it well\n4-ppl usually scared from what different as they didnt get used to it\nso like to blaming pp is much more easier than trying to understand and find common graunf to meet in
Look up words in the website given - and buy some CDs with German lessons (available via Amazon or in a good bookstore, probably), listen DVDs in German...
nah, don't ground him. i think it isn't even the case that he lacks doing his homework, or that he studies too less.\n\ni had the same problem in school, intelligent student, on every course i had high grades. only biology i could never get into my head. i doesn't interest me at all how flowers reproduce, my brain simply refused to keep that information.\n\nand i saw it a lot around me, intelligent people who are very good at a lot of things, always have a few things that they can't get their mind to do, no matter how much they even want to.\n\nin my country holland, we grade from 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest. on almost all my classes i scored 8 or 9 or 10. Biology was always a 3 or even lower. No matter how hard i tried. \n\nAt the age of 16, i actually think it's a very good thing that your son chooses the things that obviously interest him the most. He's also old enough to realise that he won't really need geometry in the rest of his life. If he even increased his grades to a C, i think that's probably the maximum for something that obviously doesn't interest him at all. The smartest people are only lazy at things that they really have no affiliation with. \n\n(i'm sorry, i am aware of the fact that ur son will probably read this as well, and he will use it as an arguement against you trying to push him to study harder...but hey, then you shouldn't have asked me:P )\n Love and Sprite, Mark.
100% agree!\nThe tighter you hang on to someone the more they will feel like running. A relationship is a mutual choice, not a sentence. If someone feels trapped they will often build resentment and sabotage the relationship to get out. It has to be a mutual choice.
Depends on if they are the type that enjoy being licked or not! Thanks for the laugh :-)
Well, I know kids love to make crafts and play different games. How about letting them make a picture book with the different stories from the bible? Its a good review on what the stories meant and its pretty cheap. All you need are colored construction papers, crayons, a stapler, and other nice things they can add to their book (glitter, ribbons, etc). I remember doing this in church and loving it. Good Luck! :)

Salvador Dali was a great, but cookie ARTIST.\n\nI love his works, but HE WAS A FAR OUT CHARACTER!
"Yes, I was a missionary in India for six months and the Philippines for over a year.  I'm currently serving in Singapore (which is not a poor country).\nI think the most stunning effect of mission work is how it opens our eyes.  If you have grown up in America, you truly have no idea what real poverty is.  Even our ""poor"" people are much, much better off than those in povery in 3rd world nations-there's no comparison.  \nSo I think the way it changed me was it gave me new compassion for those in need, and also affirmed my conviction that the only way our world can ever be changed is through the Gospel of Jesus Christ."
Logic has very little to do with rights or beliefs.  It is a mathematical process that conforms to natural laws.  Asking if logic has the right to negate belief is like asking if gravity has the right to hold the moon in orbit.
maybe cause the people that think about us that way are white and trying to get back at us blacks.
lol, i read the case for christ too. \ni stopped at about 45 inaccurate conclusions. \ni try to get my kids (i'm a teacher) to understand exactly how to draw conclusions from evidence. how you can only tell what MUST be true as opposed to what MAY be true. this guy simply jumps too far in his conclusions. its not logical in the least. \ni had a really hard time believing that the guy was a journalist. \n\nbut it was an easy read. won't change an atheist's mind though since there's nothing particularly convincing in it.
"The way that I understand the story of Mary and Joseph goes (and it's been awhile since I've read it) is that she was raised in the church basically and had come of age to be married, which if I remember correctly was 15.  Joseph was an older man, with other children, I don't know if he had other wives, but I know he was married at least once before.\n\nJoseph didn't want to marry Mary, is the jist of it.  There was some sort of religious thing where all the men stuck their sticks into the ground and one of them would suddenly grow flowers.  Joseph's staff was the one that ""won"" the maiden, and he was pretty much forced into marrying her.\n\nSo anyway, when they married, there was some reason why he couldn't have relations with her, something about how long the ceremony was, like 21 days or something.  He left the city, and didn't return until well AFTER the 21 days was up.  And she was already pregnant.\n\nA lot of what I just told you was taken from the Apocrypha, and like I said, it's been a long time since I've even thought about it."
I would say that there is no such thing as a program to teach you any language.  If you want to learn to speak spanish, the best thing to do is to take serious courses where they combine the use of books, conversation and a teacher to guide you thru all that it entails.  Spanish is not an easy language to learn but Buena suerte!
i don't really know about any of the other things u asked but i can tell u about angels and demons. Angels are God's messangers and the people that inhabit heaven. like us they have free will also. God created angels when he decided to create heaven. Demons and Hell didn't exist until one of the angels decided to sin. he decided that he wuz better than God and that he wuz more fit to be king than God wuz. i don't know if i explained that rite, but bascially he wuz jealous. then God cast him out of heaven and everyone that decided to go with him. thats when hell wuz created. the angel became Satan and his fellowers became demons.
Aristotle ;)
An all powerful God could indeed stop wars from happening, so if God does not, it means obviously that God has no desire to do so. Since the beginning, God has not interfered with the free will each human has - they have the ability to follow God or not, to follow God's commandments or not, to make war or not.
True.  No one can look at your boobs if you don't show them.  You can't complain about people looking at things that you are showing off.  The only reason women complain about it is because they want to be tramps but they don't others to think they are tramps.  See how that works?
"What is your ""evidence""? Some book a scientist wrote detailing his findings and experiences? Christians have a similar book called the Bible. The difference is you are basing your beliefs off of someone elses research. I base my beliefs on what goes on in my life every day.\n\nWhy ask why the sky is blue, just enjoy the day!"
how old are you anyway? like maybe 7 or possible 8?\nmy religion is catholic but i know that my parents are santa (oops, sorry hope i didn't pop your bubble)
"when i was in 9th grade i went on a blind date with my friend and her bf. her bf had this friend and wanted to hook us up together cz he thought that we ""matched"". anyways, everything went like crap and the guy turned out to be the cousin of the most disgusting girl in our class. i didn't even sit next to him cz i thought he was ewwie,lol. after the ""everlasting"" hour ended the guys told us that they didn't have enough money and wanted us to pay for them and we didn't have enough money to pay for the four of us either."
YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES!\nHe saved us and we can at least give him our love as our sign of appreciation
YEA!!! You tell 'em sexy!
I need to shave first.
Well, for the universe to exist, there had to always have been someTHING or someONE. The big bang theory says there was always someTHING (two particles crashing into each other and beginning this statistically impossible chain reaction resulting in life).  Creation says there was always an intelligent being who actually designed the universe and its contents, including humans.  This is more logical actually. after all, the odds of 2 particles crashing and creating life is about as logical as putting a lot of watch parts into a box, shaking it and getting an intact watch out of it.  The Bible does not contradict science, it is actually supported by science.  The problem is that many misunderstand it.
PRAY, PRAY, PRAY!!!
People used pages from an old telephone book or catalog, but before that, I would imagine they simply used the softest leaves they could find.
"Sure Noah got 2 giraffes in the boat.  They were little ones so they'd fit easier.  Duh.\n\nAlso, Noah didn't need to get 2 of every ""species"" on the boat, he needed to get 2 of every ""kind"" on the boat--which meant he didn't need to get hyenas, coyotes, wolves, spaniels, etc... Noah just needed to get to dogs on the boat.\n\nThere would have been plenty of room to fit 2 of every kind on Noah's Ark, and still leave room for food storage and ability to move around and be comfortable.\n\nBy the way, the boat wasn't ""rickety"" either, it was made of sturdy wood and was manufactured recently before the flood so it was in good shape.\n\nPlease consider your words before asking harsh questions."
"I think so.  The one golden rule that would encompass everything would be to ""Do onto others as you would have them do onto you""  If everyone followed that one rule.  People would express more with love than war.  Imagine ....no more hurt feelings because of spity comments or evil doings.  Beautiful."
"Supernatural is defined by wikipedia as:\nThe supernatural (Latin:super- ""exceeding""+nature) comprises forces and phenomena that cannot be perceived by natural or empirical senses, and whose understanding may be said to lie with religious, magical, or otherwise mysterious explanation —yet remains firmly outside of the realm of science. ...\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural\n\nBy it's very nature the supernatural cannot now or ever be proven. Every story you hear has just enough loop holes that it could be true, or it might not. There is a reason no photographic evidence of ghosts, nessie, bigfoot, etc. exist, because they don't. I am a trained scientist. I have been tought to question everything that cannot be analytically proven, and for good reason.\n \nBy the same token, there are hundreds of cases in which creatures that were thought to be only myths have been proven to be living, breathing creatures. It was only this year that the first  image of a live giant squid was captured. There are numerous other cases, but one of the best is that of the ceolocanth, afish thought extinct to the western world, but known well to indigenous peoples of the pacific rim and southeast coast of africa. Other cases, like the Loch Ness monster are pure, unadultarated bulls***. The idea of a sea creature holing up in a large lake for 365 million years is just ludicrous, and ecologically impossible. Were that the case, something, head, flipper, whole body would have washed up by now, and in this day of genetic testing, we would be able to verify its novel species status in a matter of minutes. But, nothing has, and nothing ever will. If you want to discover something new, look to the sea or an isolated island chain, not your local woods. It is entirely possible you could discover something new, and then you can name it after yourself or someone you care about, which is always fun. \n\nThe bottom line is, it you can give proof of something that the scientific community will not hold true, they will accept it. You prove no one wrong, only add to humanity's ever increasing store of knowledge."
Absolutely, if the person who is bi, has decided to be with the person who is lesbian, it should work out fine. Bisexuals are not promiscuous and if they have committed to a monogamous relationship, there is no reason it should not work out.
"You CAN be excommunictated from the church for being a Mason, but that almost never happens.  I am a Catholic and a Mason.  It is true that Catholicism would prefer its members to join the Knights of Columbus, and frown on the joining of Freemasonry.  The truth is that the Catholic Knights of Columbus are very strongly based on Freemasonry!  Still, while Catholicism has Papal denouncements of Freemasonry, Masons do not care what religious affiliation our members have.  Being a Catholic, I struggle with this, but I also know that if Freemasonry ever acted contrary to my beliefs, I would not be inolved with it, and here I am, still a member and I love the Fraternity.\n\nPlease don't let brother Dan Y's grammar, punctuation, and  spelling of the word ""clue"" above lead you to believe that we are not intelligent people.  We come from all walks of life.  Some brothers are rural farmers, some are waiters, some are bankers, and some are computer programmers.  Not all of us have mastered the art of communication and spelling :)"

It's cultural.  They are taught to be passive.
"Cain went off to the ""Land of Nod"" and found a wife among the people that weren't otherwise mentioned.\n\nIf you aren't going to accept it on faith, you'll have to reject it.\n\nBut, that's ok because it is a fairy tale, so it really doesn't matter."
"Try the ""original bible.""  I mean before anyone come out with their version, you have to have the original, right?"

Jews have no right to the land of the palestianins and are invaders and oppressors. peace in the middle east will arise when they learn how to work together in the spirit of truth. If someone took over your house because they claim that their ancestors owned it along time ago, what would you do?

why do u wanna know? inorder to start another Hindu-Muslim riot? Arent there enough problems in the word already
If a religion can ever feed the hungriest the demand for hunger would have died a thousand deaths already.\n\nWhen humans forget the aim of the religion ,such ignorant questions come up to belittle the messages of the saints and the son of God. If the rich people start feeding the poor ,the queues will grow  longer and longer and people will forget to work and always demand their pie of the doles.\n\nKarma the duty to do some positive work to feed the pangs of hunger is in built.The Indians have out of ignorance put millions of such people on free doles thus killed the very foundation for doing some work.The Indian Govt. has tackled the sunami relief without any help from the the rich countries,this is well known,and have also helped the other countries in this regard.\n\nLittle knowledge is more confusing ,when it is made known that THE VEHICLE OF RAT is enjoyed by Hanuman it is LORD GANESHA my dear.

I am originally from Trinidad. I moved to NY a few years ago. Trinidad is a pretty great place to live. It’s not one of those totally boring islands with nothing to do. There are lots of malls, restaurants and theaters. Everyone there speaks English; in selected areas you find people who also speak French, Hindi, Spanish and Creole. The job market there is pretty competitive though as the number of college graduates are on the rise. You can check out the links below for more information about the people and the economy.
I am a Caucasian born in the USA now living in another country.  I think there are major differences in blacks within the different regions of the USA. It is not possible to truly understand minority issues unless you are a minority, and if you are not from an oppressed race it is even harder to understand. Comparing European blacks or Asian blacks with an American black is not possible, in my opinion. I could come up with some demographic information, but I cannot ever describe the FEELINGS of an American ethnic minority, and I certainly cannot compare southern USA blacks to Egyptian blacks. \nI find Americans to be more verbal about the intolerance they display in their society. That does not necessarily mean other countries are more tolerant of minorities ; it means Americans are very opinionated and unafraid to express how they feel. \nI think there is worldwide racial/ethnic profiling. It has always existed. Good luck on your study !

I answered the definition question before I found this one. I accept everyone but might not accept their beliefs. I tolerate everyone but I might not like them. I'm lost. I had some lady tell me I am stupid today and that I live in a bubble of non-existing sunshine. Not word for word but nicer than what was actually said. I don't accept her opinion of me as truth but I will tolerate her right to have that opinion. When I am done here I am going to go look up both of those words to see how I misuse them. \nLove & Light\nSharon\nOne Planet = One People
I would be thankful if someone came and told me that I have something on my pants.....yes it would be quite embarrassing though ...but it will be more satisfying to be reminded of before I get more embarrassed by moving with it more places.

Dear Sista_girl06,\n\nYou're right that music influences us whether we like it or not. \n\nIt is indeed wise for Christians to stop listening to secular (non-Christian) music, or at least to be very careful to not listen to any secular music with questionable lyrics.\n\nIf you like particular styles of music, you can find Christian bands/ music from that style.\n\nE.g., check out the music at \n\nhttp://www.air1.com/\nhttp://klove.com/\n\nThe links are to the websites of two different Christian Radio stations, with different styles of Christian music. There are many other Christian radio stations and many many Christian bands with a variety of styles. The odds are that you should be able to find a Christian band or bands with music of the style you like.\n\nCordially,\nJohn
yes i have its really freaky
"While it is true that biological and early childhood experiences can do much to shape one's future, the best way to known one's future to take a good look at one's past and one's present. Those things you take forgranted, habits in your behavior and your thinking, openess or lack of openess to new ways of thinking and doing things....these are the things that shape your ""fate"" and/or ""destiny"". \n\nSo, I would have to say no, if you mean by these terms fate as something predetermined by some supernatural agency beyond my control. On the other hand, I would say yes, if you mean those things that I am unwilling to examine and change for the better within myself.  This argument, however, fails to acknowledge the things beyond one's control: for example, if you're born into an impoverished family with poor nutrition, no access to education or to financial gain, and in a country that is torn by war... then the field of choices available to you may be greatly limited. A choice that is impossible or greatly limited in your environment is not really a choice then.  Nonetheless, even within a limited field of choice, there are some choices that are better than others, if you can just see them and make them and make the best of whatever life you have.

"Actually it's just something else the Christians stole from the Pagans. ""Immaculate Conception"" is found in many religions predating Christianity."
After pondering my decision for a moment I've decide to answer with the following:\n\nMonkeys like to eat bananas every day and if they didnt they would probably lose all their potassium which could possibly make them lose their hopping abilities and if they lost their hopping abilities they wouldn't be able to hop into trees and eat all the leaves off of the trees which then cause the sun to produce more heat which of course would melt the ice caps and we would all die a slow, painful death from heat exhaustion and those who didnt die would be drowned in the flood caused by the massive melting of the polar icecaps.\n\nSo that's pretty much it so just pray that monkeys keep eating all their bananas!
I think that they are some lucky people in the world who are just in the right places at the right time. There are unlucky people though that just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I am an atheist. \n\nFirst, fear of punishment keeps people from breaking the law, whether secular or temporal. I don't rob a bank because I don't want to go to jail. I have actually heard that religion came about because of evolution as a way to keep people from killing each other. Laws can have their source from religion, but they should be secular in nature(like letting gays marry). I personally have found that atheist are more likely to be christian in their actions with others and christians. I think it is because atheist have taken more possession of their lives, and therefore the responsibility.

"Kabbalah is Jewish mysticism. It's a radically different interpretation of the Hebrew bible.\n\nFor instance ""God said, 'let there be light"" ... Kabbalah => ""And man was given a consciousness to perceive god.""\n\nAnother example is god made a flood because Noah did not argue, he just listened and made an ark to save himself.\n\nKabbalah is completely spiritual, and does not interpret scripture literally.\n\nKabbalah = Jewish mysticism\nGnosticism = Christian mysticism\nSufism = Islamic mysticism"
Jesus is coming back!  I feel that it is very soon.  Things in Revelations has been happening for 100 years, but things are becoming more and more evident last year and this year already that the time is pretty near.
Jim,I'm convinced by your logic...I wish to subscribe to your newsletter
Wow! Well it sounds more complicated than what it probably is. \n\nMy friend, a regular pioneer, met a guy who she really liked. However, he was only studying and she knew the rules and kept her distance. As time went by, this guy of hers got baptized and about 3 weeks ago they got married. She too is 19 and they are very very happy.\n\nI wouldn't steryotype internet encounters. Several of my friends, who are also witnesses have only met through internet, but we talk about spiritual and uplifting things. Two of those friends I might not meet in this system of things as they are missionares and are off on the other side of the world. But had it not been for internet, then we would have never had an exchange of encouragement.\n\nAn elder, a long time ago, liked a girl. She wasnt a witness so he proposed himself to study with her family. He did and as the years went by and the family learned the truth and got baptised, he married the sister. Tghe sister is now a regular pioneer and unfortunately, he passed away to cancer. But they had kids and lived a happy marriage. She is now awaiting her resurrection.\n\nEither way, notice how these people met their future mate before one of them was baptised. \n\nMy advise is wait until you get baptised but make sure that he is spiritual. You can do this by contacting the elders in his congregation and asking them. Perhaps after you are done taking that first step.\n\nWelcome aboard and if things work out, I wish you a happy marriage.

"(Well you have three questions I think so I'll answer them all)\n\n(For your title). If you do something bad but it isn't a law, then I think people would count it as ""breaking a law"" probably because I guess all the laws should ban you from doing bad stuff. Of course, you really aren't breaking a law since they didn't say you can't do that thing but people would probably say you did.\n\n(First detail question). If God didn't give any commandments, then we wouldn't really know how much we sin probably because God made the commandments so we would see how much we sin. We can't really follow them so then we would know.\nIf there weren't any rules in society, then I think this world would be way worse. There's laws about not murdering and stealing but people are already stealing and murdering and breaking the laws. Think of it when there AREN'T any rules or laws.\n\n(Second detail question). I think the world would be worse but then if you think of it the other way, we would probably think, ""Maybe some people break the laws to show how much they hate them."" Maybe that could happen but some laws HAVE to be laws. I'm not really sure how the world would be better but maybe people just think that they're being ""controlled"" although as I have said before, we need those laws.\n--\n\nI'm not sure if those answer your questions but it's worth a try. (That was fun =) )"

You are right about that!  No one feels that they do anything wrong given their frame of reference of the world.  Anyone can seem to justify their actions, even if it's only to themselves.

Sometimes the archaeologist is preserving the contents of the sacred burials by first identifying them as such, and then removing them. Many construction companies and builders will call for the services of an archaeologist if they come across artifacts in the course of their digging. The US Armed Forces routinely sends in archaeological survey teams to areas that they own, prior to using those areas for training or testing explosives and artillery. In very rare cases, if sacred burials are found will the site be preserved intact. Oftentimes, all that can be done is to save as much as the site as possible and transplanting them intact elsewhere.\n\nMeanwhile, there is considerable attention paid to returning disputed artifacts and objects from sacred burials to the people who demonstrate kinship, as seen in the publicised prosecution of the curators and dealers associated with the Getty.

"There are no strictly set rules. The Word of Wisdom says ""hot drinks are not for the belly or the body"" and we have been told that this means coffee and tea. However, we don't know whether this is indeed because of the caffeine, we just know that we are not supposed to drink coffee and tea. So no, we wouldn't drink de-caff either. And I do drink coke and eat chocolate, even though those contain caffeine.\n\nThe Word of Wisdom isn't just about what we can't do. It is an entire health plan which says that we shouldn't drink tea or coffee, shouldn't smoke or chew tobbaco, shouldn't drink alcohol or take harmful drugs, and should eat meat sparingly and eat lots of whole grains and vegetables. What is amazing is that this revelation was given in 1833, in an age where people still thought that vegetables were an inferior food to meat and smoking was good for the heart. And no one knew anything about caffeine or mouth and lung cancer.\n\nMormons who live the Word of Wisdom live an average of ten years longer than the general population. (OK, who said ""It just feels like longer""??!?)"

You cannot fully understand the Quran without having knowledge of the Bible.  And since the Bible is (or as you think, was) God's Word, wouldn't it stand to reason that God can protect His Message?  He is, after all, the Almighty.
From what I understand, the teachings of Jesus and his sacrifice supercede and override the old laws of the Old Testament.  The Old Testament was supposed to be a follow up to the true Gospel which arrived when Jesus walked the world and died to save humanity from its sins.  From that point on, following the old law was no longer necessary for salvation - only the accepting of Jesus Christ as the true lord and saviour would lead to redemption.

the little understanding i have is that the devil wants to see our downfall and he's using any possible means to destroy us, therefore we must not rest on our ores, but must be prayerful, doing the will of God and staying in Christ and living according to his purpose for our lives.\n\nthe devil knows our weaknesses and he will not resist the opportunity to use them against us. \n\nchristians must be more prayerful and not joke with their walk in Christ because the devil is always attacking and trying to find means to destroy us.\n\nit is those who will be forceful in prayers and their walk in Christ that will inherit the kingdom of God.

I am very serious about my religion. I actively participate in worship every day and I try to live my life according to Pagan family values and morality and I teach my children to do so as well. I am an active part of the Pagan community and I volunteer and donate as often as I am able. I make purchases and develop habits that allow me to walk softly on the Earth, minimizing pollution, etc. I only eat natural food and I stay away from all addictive substances, because my body is a sacred vessel. Every morning I get up and greet the Goddess of Dawn and thank Her for a new day. Every time I sit down to eat, I thank the Earth for providing for me, and I thank my ancestors for setting into motion the processes that brought my food to the grocery store so I don't have to bust my hump to get it lilke they did. Every night before I go to bed, I look up at the moon (assuming there is one) and tell Her all of the things that happened that day that I am grateful for. Every full moon, I gather with my friends to worship, and every new moon we gather to journey. Every solstice and equinox and on the cross-quarter days we gather for a BIG feast and bring offerings for our Gods and have special rituals. Very serious.\n\nPaganism can't be destroyed. Paganism is just a name for something that didn't have a name before Christianity came and became it's opposite, thus requiring us to name it. There are Pagans all over the world and have been since the dawn of humankind. Some of them, though unfortunately fewer all the time, have never heard of Christianity.\n\nPaganism is Natural, this is why it can't be destroyed. It's inherent. Left to our own devices, we'd all be Pagan. When you look around at Nature, really look at it, you are awed and know it is holy. You know that there can't be just what you see, because it's just so wonderful, and you know that there can't be just one type of deity, or spirit because there are so many different types of humans and living things. Paganism also doesn't require that you reject other Gods, either. That's why Christianity was easily accepted, but it didn't mean that Paganism disappeared. It just meant that Christianity was incorporated into it. All we're doing now is purifying our faith, as the Christians have done, purging the Pagan elements, we are purging the Christian elements. And we claimed for ourselves a name.

"If you have ever seen something called the ""Kinsey Scale,"" it describes people who are mostly attracted to one sex and somewhat attracted to the other. Judging by everything you say here, it really can't be said what, of those two labels, you are. You seem to find women more sexually attractive, but men more romantically interesting. Frankly, I think you are putting too much stock in the label. While I know it can be hard not having a set identity, you should just be with someone who you find BOTH sexually and romantically interesting and who treats you right, whether they are a man or a woman. If you really need a label for your peace of mind, I would say you are bisexual, but you are also rather young, give yourself time to figure yourself out. You already understand one point better than most. You know it is not all about sex and sexual attraction, otherwise you would have settled this question a while ago. Just give yourself time, you don't need to know every last little thing about yourself by the time you finish high school, trust me."

I personally raise my children to understand that no matter how we feel about a person or any of  their beliefs it is not ok to hurt them physically, or emotionally. We are all God's children. I believe that this must be taught by the parents. However I would NOT permit my sons to attend any class that treated homosexuality as normal. Sorry but I do not believe that!

"Consider this, everyone thinks they are right.  That's why people argue.  Some folks not only think they are right but won't even consider the idea that they could be wrong.  Now add to that the idea that God is always right and they feel that God is on their side.  Well that makes them not only ""always right"" but better than you (in their eyes).  Even though they will say they are not better than you, they have the ""I'm a winner"" attitude cause the bible told them so.  And we all know that the winner is the better player.  So they have won before the game has ended.  Or so they believe."

A monarchy is a form of government- with a king or emperor- some kind of inherit-able leadership.\n\nA dynasty can happen in a monarchy. It is a period of time. It's when one family rules a nation for a long period of time. Usually, a dyansty (a long period of one family's holding the throne)has a definite influence on the nation's culture, art, etc.

Ancient Chinese thought influenced a lot of cultures in Asia- but Buddhism is originally from China- anyhow, to get a rough grip, I'd advise you to think of Ancient China's role in Asia  to being similar to that of the Ancient Roman Empire was for most of Europe. That's particularly true for Korea and Japan, but less so for other parts of the regions. \n\nTibet I think was a sort of cultural bridge between India and China. In some ages it was part of China, in others it was independent. Now China has it again, and the indigenous culture is suffering, even if the people may be beginning to like the money Chinese relations bring in as the Chinese themselves will tell you. Tibetan writing is different from Chinese writing. Korean and Japanese use parts of Chinese writing, and also Chinese thought in their culture. Confucian thought, basically a kind of codified patriarchy, is really important in gender role divisions in a lot of Asian countries now. \n\nAnyhow, you were talking about symbols. Of course, there's a real mish-mash of stuff out there, the area you're talking about is as large as Europe. A classic example that we've taken into the West of course is the twelve animal Chinese Zodiac. So rich! \n\nYou said about the dragon? That's lucky and magical, but it has correspondences- the direction ESE, the element wood, the season of late Spring, the hours 7-9 am... and lots more stuff. For example, the dog has the opposite position in the Zodiac. If your horoscope contained a dog element, then you'd watch out between 7 and 9am, and you certainly wouldn't take a journey East South East in that time, you'd go by a more scenic route. Dragons in turn would be weakest at 7-9pm, and wouldn't want to be travelling West South West. Say you'd a picture of a building somewhere in China, and it was painted from the WSW perspective, the artist may put a dog in the picture as well for luck.\n\nI'll just give you a few more examples I know from Japanese- the crane and the turtle are symbols of long life, the wild goose is a symbol of transcience. Foxes are spiritual tricksters, the koi carp is a boys emblem. I mean, the list goes on... if you can give any more solid examples of stuff you'd like to know, I'll do my best...

"""Idle"" words, not ""ideal"" words. I think it refers to careless things we say that hurt people far more than we expect or intend to. \n\nI am sure God will take into account our intentions, since He knows our hearts, but we are certainly responsible for some of the results, since it is like firing a gun when we cannot see what we are aiming at. I seem to recall there is a Proverb (26:18) where it says that a man who says hurtful lies and then tries to weasel out of it by saying he was only joking is like someone who goes around shooting flaming arrows at random-- in other words, a danger to the entire community."

Gian Giacomo Caprotti da Oreno, nicknamed Salai or il Salaino and Count Francesco Melzi~both of these relationships follow the pattern of eroticized apprenticeships which were frequent in the Florence of Leonardo's day, relationships which were often loving and not infrequently sexual. \nBesides them, Leonardo had many other friends who are figures now renowned in their fields, or for their influence on history. These included Cesare Borgia, in whose service he spent the years of 1502 and 1503. During that time he also met Niccolò Machiavelli, with whom later he was to develop a close friendship. Also among his friends are counted Franchinus Gaffurius and Isabella d'Este, whose portrait he drew while on a journey which took him through Mantua.

i agree thats a pretty dumb question.

"I think there are a lot of people who don't actually ""believe in"" astrology, in the sense of actually planning their life around it...\n\nBut instead, they just find it interesting to see whether something about them was correct or not.  Personally, I have seen many things said of me (about past and future) that turned out to be correct.  I don't mean fortune-telling... but simple astrology.\n\nI don't claim to understand it, and I certainly don't hold it as my religion or spirituality.  However, I do think there may be something to it that we don't quite understand.  I think there are a LOT of things going on in the world/universe spiritually that we have not even begun to grasp.\n\nThat said, there are MANY people out there who claim to tell futures, etc etc who prophet (and profit) from this market... and are completely full of BS.  But from my understanding, astrology is not related to future-telling in a mystical way.  Instead, characteristics of a person and their future are shown through a system that has to do with the placement of heavenly bodies (planets, stars, etc).  It's more like reading a very complex grid than anything else.\n\nAnd who's to say that God doesn't have some order to the universe that we just take a while to catch onto?  We tend to be a little slow sometimes, you know...."

Some one is always out to hassle you for your style, it doesn't matter if it's in your own community or some one else's.\nI braid hair, and find more white people offended by white people doing that than the other way around. \n\nI think the main thing with any hair style is to make sure it looks right, on you. Braids can be done in many hundreds and thousands of styles. If you had it done and it didn't look exactly right, then pick a different style, or go to a different braider. As far as music choice goes, it is useless these days to limit your self to any one flavor, or exclude any flavor or style of music. If you listen long enough there is bound to be  something from every genera that will grab your attention. (that's why we have so many cross over artists coming out, they are trying to make a point)
"My nickname is ""Ciach"" because I married my high school sweetheart about 20 years ago who's last name was Ciaciuch(Cha-Choo) and we've been divorced for about 12 years now. I kept my married name because of my daughter, my maiden name was Smith(how common). But now I've been going with a Smith for 7 years and theres always talk of marriage, but I've gotten so accustomed to the name ""Ciach"" I don't ever want to go back to Smith. My friends say the same,they also like my last name."
I dont like my name, is think it is soooo bland, Hence the reason i have called myself colly on here, probablys worse actually!!!  Ive always liked the name charlie or something more exciting or less common. xx
"My personal opinion is that it is okay for you to attend your friend's church.  I was raised Catholic and I think you are asking what is the Catholic Church's stance on attending other churches.  I will try to find a link to this to help you.\n\nOKAY - HERE IS A LINK ON THIS TOPIC WITH THE CHURCH'S ANSWER.  It is from the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston.  He says the answer is Yes, Catholics may attend Protestant Services.   And gives some guidelines you should read.  \n\nhttp://www.dwc.org/questions/services.shtml\n\nHe says the ""The bottom line, one can attend other Christian services and there certainly are times when this is appropriate. However, the regular celebration of one's faith in a Catholic Church ought not to be interrupted, especially on Sundays and Holy Days. And Catholics should not partake in communion in other Churches, because we do not share a common faith in the Eucharist as the Real Presence of Jesus Christ."".\n\n******************************\n\nNOTE:  I have attended funerials held in protestant churches where Catholic Priest and Nuns were in attendance because they were paying their respects.  I have also been to inter-faith services that were led by Priests and Ministers of various faiths.\n\nSee above link for ""official"" stance on this question.

Dear Max:   Why would Christians who practice Idolatry be concerned with other idolaters?   The Torah and Tanakh plainly declare the Command of GOD, which is that the worship of any created thing is idolatry, including worship of a man because man is created.   The prophets Job, Hosea  both go to great length to declare that God is NOT a man, nor the son of man, that He should tell a lie.    Yup,  its man that tells lies about GOD, and one of those very cunning lies, is that Jesus,  a really cool, but nevertheless Fictitious character of the Gospel narratives is supposed to be a man,  which borrowed from all the pagan savior deity man god cult religions,  especially Mithrism and gave Jesus all the superlative characteristics.  Not withstanding, it took the CHurch nearly 325 years to finally Vote Jesus into the god union.    SO, do Christians have a double standard about idolatry, and the answer is of course they do.   \n     As far as rewriting the Bible,  what should be done, is that the NT should be labeled with a  Note...that This is a Work of Fiction, written by unknown authors and tagged with the names of equally Fictitious authors by the Church and is still undergoing periodic corrections.     Further, it should be seperated from the Hebrew Original Text, as the two   narratives are not only contradictory, but also counter productive.   The Hebrew Bible, as published by Art Scroll Publishers,  is a very adequate and very accurate translation of the Hebrew Original.  It comes highly recommended by able Hebrew Scholar translators.   Sincerely
I would check out what they have on the GLSEN website, they have a whole student section with stuff about how to start a GSA\n\nhttp://www.glsen.org/cgi-bin/iowa/student/student/index.html\n\nMight be helpful. \n\nAs for asking teachers, I would try to find the most liberal one you can think of.  I would look for a teacher who is 1) under 35 2) teachers something not math, computers, or science, look at music, psych, social studies, librarians, or sex ed teaches  3) if you cant think of someone, talk to your principal (or vice principal, whomever is in charge of student activities and ask for suggstions 4) and just scew up your courage and ask.  Pitch it as you want to form this club to combat bullying and anti-gay harassment and give support to fellow gay students, as well as build bridges between gay and straight people.  Yes, someone might turn you down.  Yes they might get all uncomfortable and weird and turn you down.  But you know what, thats life kiddo.  People are going to turn you down, people are going to treat you like a freak because you are gay, some people are going to be down right bitchy about it.  But that is exactly why you need a GSA - because it is rough to be gay.  If you cave now, you'll spend the rest of your life feeling like a dumbshit for not just going through with it.  Some rejection from a teacher who you will never see again after graduation is not going to ruin your life.  And you shouldn't be embarassed becuase some people are phobes.  If some teacher turns you down, they are the ones who should be embarassed - and you should make them feel as such.\n\nIf they turn you down, just lay on the old guilt.  Say that you're sorry that they are not more willing to be accepting and supporting of diversity in the student body, and say that you are really disapointed that you will not be getting their support because it is so necessary for teachers to take a stand and lend authority to anti-bullying efforts.  You've got nothing to feel bad about because some people are cowards, freaks, and phobes.
I'm glad they're gone.  Can you imagine driving around town today with a dinosaur roaming around?  I hate dodging SUV's like Hummers just imagine dodging a Brontosaurus!

Physically, I can say we're, on average, medium build, not very tall, and a good portion of the men and women in my country are brunettes with brown eyes.\n\nPortuguese people can be described as helpful;\ngood with foreing laguages (well, at last we try and make an effort to understand them) ;\n a bit melancholic and sad (our typical music is called ""fado"", meaning ""Fate"", and it's usually a sad and depressing type of song) ;\n we hate soccer referees and our politics ; \nsadly, our economy is one of the worst in Europe right now;\nwe love the beach, we're addicted to soccer, and we love to go out to malls, have something to drink (usually coffee) in a coffee shop or in a tavern...\nWe have a great nightlife (one of the best in Europe, expect us to get out of our houses by 11 pm, be in a bar by 1 am starting to drink, and ending in a club dancing until the sun rises).\n\nI think that's pretty much it. Oh, I forgot to tell you one thing...I believe it is a universal truth in Portugal. We love our country, but we are always badmouthing it, we always believe that  we are the worst. But if a foreign person badmouths our country, we'll hate him for eternity. NO ONE  can badmouth Portugal if they're not portuguese.\n\nI hope that I could help =) good luck with your english test!"

"Phonetic symbols are a set of universally accepted symbols used by linguists so that we know exactly how words are pronounced without knowing the spelling system of each language.  Each phonetic symbol represents only one sound and each sound has only one symbol.  They are written between brackets [  ].  Thus the English word ""read"" is written [rid] and ""meet"" is written [mit].  Anyone in the world who knows the phonetic alphabet would know how to pronounce these two words whether they know English or not.\n\nThe person who wrote ""phonemic"" is incorrect.  There is no ""phonemic"" alphabet.  Phonemes are based on an analysis of the phonetics of a language and are abstract symbols used to represent a class of sounds (allophones) that are related to each other by rule.  Phonemic transcription uses phonetic symbols (usually) written between vergules /  /, thus the phonemic representations of English ""read"" and ""meet"" are /rid/ and /mit/."
I would say no.  There is nothing wrong with asking for help when you need it, as far as I'm concerned.  However, if God is putting a different conviction on YOUR heart, that is a different story.  Darling, I will pray for you to receive wisdom in your decision.  My best suggestion is for you and hubby to pray together and seperately about it.  Search the Word, ask God to give you an answer to your problem.  Don't forget, as a Christian, anything that is on your heart is also on His.  Only He can tell you what He wants you to do.

He was pi$$ed and went to bathroom and tried to finish himself off but he was so mad he could not do it..heehee.....i was all horned up at this point also so i laid there in bed and took care of business solo"

"The Rite of Baptism (Baptism of Water) comes from the Flood (Genesis), it is the passage from one state to another. Water is used in various quantities. John the Baptist baptized in a river; however, the exact technique is not documented in the Gospels. There are other sources, but I would like to stay focus on the New Testament.\n\nBaptism of the Holy Spirit comes in Pentecost, when the apostles received the Holy Spirit. This is documented in Acts and the Epistles.\n\nFrankly, it does not matter what baptism is like outside of your church. I am sure that your ministers have the correct, biblical sound, ritual. What is important is that  you understand what your passage is, from one state to another. Baptism is admission to the Christian Church (the elected).\n\nI have tried to show you from the Christian bible what the Rite of Baptism is. If you have questions, you need to be talking with your ministers. They should be able to explain the ritual as well as the religious signification.\n\nIf you are interested in biblical description, you can go to www.gateway.com and search for the word ""Baptism"".\n\nI am happy that you have found Jesus Christ. You can always find what he says in the Christian bible."

If you don't get an answer within 24 hours, it is best to delete your query and ask again.\nSurendra, I would like to take this opportunity to express my personal opinion. You have been foolish, Surendra. Very, very foolish. Anyone can see that the purpose of Yahoo! Answers is to serve as a modern chatroom. More and more, Java programming is becoming less and less supported, there is no other method of bringing people together in a social environment than to create PHP scripts where the ""thinking"" can be done on the server rather than on your machine. With that in mind, Surendra, you should interrogate the shallow-minded participants of Yahoo! Answers with matters that appeal to their common denominator. Questions such as, ""How long is the normal tally whacker?"" or, ""My boyfriend says I should dump my hubby, what you think?""..., would get you a substantial number of replies.\nGive up your pursuit of truth and petty wonders, Surendra. Quit asking bland, colorless questions. Are you naive? No person who is capable of giving you the answer you hoped for can last while reading though a heap of puddings, pies and pastry. I'm only doing you a favor, Surendra, by giving you a proper admonishment you can now begin to formulate an apology. When you are ready, send your atonement to http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my;_ylt=Aq_EtUR9D0EBSZBgHXjWjQ3py6IX \nAnd Surendra, if you insist upon asking serious questions, remember that a few good jolts from a peace officer's tazor should bring you around to your senses.

"As a result of mankind's fall into sin, all creation unwillingly submitted to ""the slavery of decay, and groans and suffers till now"" (Rom. 8:22). The time will come in which mankind and the entire material world will be purified and renewed. This will occur on the last day, following the Universal Judgment, and it will happen by means of fire. As the world that existed before the deluge was purified from sin by means of the flood, likewise ""the present heaven and earth,"" St. Peter teaches, ""are reserved for fire until the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men … [On that] day … the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up … Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells"" (2 Pet. 3:7-13).\n\nThe fact that the present temporary world will be transformed was predicted many centuries before Christ by the Psalmist who said: ""Of old You laid the foundation of the earth, And the heavens are the work of Your hands. They will perish, but You will endure; Yes, all of them will grow old like a garment; Like a cloak You will change them, And they will be changed. But You are the same, And Your years will have no end"" (Ps. 102:25-27). In other words, the end of the world will not be its destruction but its total renewal."
"i swear to God , its cuz of all the lesbian porn that are around....!\nthey watch it and they ACTUALLY think that its the same in real life.....\ntry putting a stone butch making love to a lipstick femme , i think they'd head for the nearest exit (no offence butches, love you guys but i need to make a point)  because they are soo used to what the adult film industry or rather their own male ego and chauvanism tell them....women are created to pleasure my d!ck and the world revolves around it! so the idea of ""lesbians"" having sex with them is stroking (pardon the pun) their egos. ie: they are so good in bed that even lesbians will make an exeption for it\n\nanything that threathens their male supremacy is a turn-of. so this explains them not wanting to watch two guys make out.... hence explaning the stone butch situation too. butches are a threat to their ego, so it will not be tolerated...\nas for why do they like to watch it, i think if you cant get the real thing..... stimulation would do just fine.... lol\n\nhope this makes sense"

"Yes, there's a possibility that you could go to Hell if you don't turn away from your sins. Because you feel that you have been feeling this way since you was born then you will have to seek God's face. God can help you to change if that is what you want.  First realize that you are not in your natural state that God perfer you to be in then know that it is not normal, repent to God and don't miss a day asking for forgiveness and praying. God has got to know that this is what you really want. How about making a promise to God that if he would restore your natural state back that you will serve him forever. Just trust him and be patient with God. It may look like he will never answer but he will if you do your part. But don't worry because worry brings on doubt and doubting God is only saying ""I don't trust you Lord!"" And while you are trusting God, separate yourself from any negativity in your life. Get away from any porn movies, magazines etc. Get away from any of your friends that may be homosexuals. You have to make that first serious step and then God will gladly trust you enough to help you to change. Please follow up and be strong."

"It is an ancient Sicilian proverb, Lu sangu lava lu sangu, ""Blood washes blood"". so you can say it is latin but not very accuratly.\n\nI found books and some other sites using this phrase so I guess they still use it in Italy. what the phrase means is that if you do me harm I will take revenge in the same way. I think now the Italians they call in vendetta and I also know that in Greece they use the same word.\n\nI will give you an example. There is one man that has a dispute with some other man and on the dispute he goes and kills him. The the son of the dead man has to go and kill the killer. Then the son of the dead killer has to go and kill the son of the first dead person and so on and so on and so on."

Well, I'd say that I didn't learn allot directly from the book.  Most of the stuff that I learned about him were from the countless documentaries that saturated the education channels during the controversy of the Da Vinci Code.  I learned that he was an outcast due to the fact that his parents were from two classes of society and therefore forbidden to marry.  I learned that although the church contracted him to paint many paintings he never quite gave them exactly what they wanted, and he was asked to repaint at least one of his paintings.  He was brilliant.  Much more intelligent than I ever thought.  He was truly a Renascence man.
You were most likely attending a Catholic Mass, in an Eastern Rite Byzantine Catholic Church, which is probably fully in union with the Holy See at the Vatican, but using a different liturgy than western (Roman) Catholics are used to.  You should have just stayed around after Mass and asked these questions to the priest. You likely received both the body and the blood of Christ at the same time, rather than separately.

What happens then, if the senses which we 'scientifically' use in this 'proof test' are in turn illusions of our mind and don't really exist?\n\nWhat is touch, sight, sound, taste and smell other than signals from our 'sense organs' going to the nerves and ultimately the brain - which is something man is yet to fully decipher?

You know, most people are not confused about their role or identity - usually if there is confusion it is on the part of society with the role or identity an individual assumes.  It's a wide and wonderful world and it is great that each of us can be and try anything we like - and every experience comes with a great lesson or bit of wisdom.  \n\nAnd personally, I think the Enemy is our own self doubt and fears - we drag our own selves down enough, just look around.  We don't need a horned little imp to make our lives hell, very often we do a fine job all on our own.
yes i use too
no, as long as the fundamentalist christians agreed not to try to vote to ban same-sex marriage, abortion, etc.\n\nand jaime and sissysmess, that's neither an original nor intelligent argument.  america's founders were also mostly racist, male slave-owners [could there be a connection there, perhaps?], but we've progressed as a society, trying to fight the racism, sexism, homophobia, and general religious bigotry so firmly entrenched in our society.\n\nwhat other disgusting traditions would you like to exhume?\n\ni, for one, am glad our society has changed.
Wow, I went through something similar. I would mail the card and continue to be a good friend. So when you reach the point of confrontation you could say that you upheld your end of the bargain by being a loyal friend. Any chane in attitude will lead to both sides being bitter. Remember, be who you were and do what you normally do until you can find out why things are the way they are. Relax, and think it through.
Definitely.  Deader than dead.  The arguments wouldn't be as varied, nor as challenging. IMO
I think your last statement says it all, you've been so hurt that you no longer want anyone to see you how you really are, unless you are sure they will not hurt you.\n\nThis is not the way to love people, and it's not the way Jesus would want you to live.  Yes, people will hurt you, in mental and physical ways sometimes.  But you will survive.  That's part of why Jesus says we should turn the other cheek.  Because loving someone means letting them hurt you on occasion ... because they are hurting too.\n\nPeople hurt me all the time, they say mean and vicious things to me and I let them, because it's just a hurt, it's not my soul.

"People tend to fear that which they do not understand, or which challenges their preconcieved notions about their world. This is particularly true for those who are insecure in their avowed ""beliefs,"" which are actually nothing more than ""inherited"" beliefs from their parents. The unexamined faith is actually no faith at all. It's almost axiomatic that the more insecure people are in their own faith, the more hostile they are to the faiths of others.\n\nThat's why they seem to be afraid of you, and why they seem antagonistic: you call into question beliefs about which they themselves are insecure."

It depends on the circumstances. If you make your complaint orally or informally, it is quite acceptable to say you made a complaint. On the other hand, if you complain by completing a formal complaint in writing, like a form for example, then you can say you lodged or registered it.

"like other people have stated, i don't think that the whole gay community thinks badly of bisexuals. those who do probably think in black or white, male or female, gay or straight. they probably feel that bisexuals are gays who use bisexuality as a way to still be socially acceptible because they can be out with members of the opposite sex, and yet in the privacy of their bedrooms, are sleeping with members of the same sex-the whole having your cake and eating it too. they also want to believe that these people are lying to themselves, of course it doesn't help when there are a large amounts of married people who are looking for a same sex lover when their husband or wife is away. and the rise of bi-chic girls-the type of girls who make out with each other when at clubs/parties/ on videos such as girls gone wild, or the  ""i'm 100% straight male, until i'm drunk and horny, then whatever is available"" guys, they don't quite paint bisexuals in the best light. \nthere is nothing wrong with bisexuality, love is love no matter who is it with. the things that make you sexually attracted to a woman is completely different than those that make you attracted to a man. i think as long as you and your partner/partners have no problem with your bisexuality, then you have no problem at all, and never mind those people who don't understand about you, straight or gay!"
"The Christian image could be improved by Christian families by displaying ""family values"" in public such as praying at the table before eating their food in restaurants.  You can tell a Christian by their acts of kindness, their acts of non rudeness.  They do not boast about their religion, but set a good example of being Christ like....not like Christ around other people.  They are just ""darn nice people""!   When you are looking at a person who is really making you mad, picture them as though it were Christ's face and then see how you would answer them instead of what you were gonna do or say.  It's dramatically different than what you were thinking at first.  Jesus loves OUR ememies as much as He loves us.  That's all I can say about it right now."
"ya,  just casualy look down at the ""problem"" and say ""hey man"" and maybe just gesture to the issue with out saying a word so to save them embarassment.  i would appreciate it if it was me."
ICK! NO!
What...the...hell...? Dude, don't take acid and then try to work your computer. It's just a bad idea.
Greetings,\n\nIf they left it would have meant the death of the guard. So they stayed to save his life. They were willing to sacrifice their own lives for the life of the guard. God ordered the doors opened and also put it in their hearts to stay. In doing this his justice was revealed and the guard came to realize through repentance that his name was written in the Lambs book of life from the foundation of the world.\n\nGreat question,\n\nPeace to you and your home,\n\nBondservant
What you are wanting to do is a binding spell.
Apostle Peter\nWhat was it like to walk on the water?\nWhy did he talk when he was with Jesus, James, and John on the mount of Transfiguration?\nWhat was it like to preach the first sermon on the day of Pentecost?
Revelations 21\n\n\n10  He carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, \n11  having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, as if it was a jasper stone, clear as crystal; \n12  having a great and high wall; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel. \n13  On the east were three gates; and on the north three gates; and on the south three gates; and on the west three gates. \n14  The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb. \n15  He who spoke with me had for a measure, a golden reed, to measure the city, its gates, and its walls. \n16  The city lies foursquare, and its length is as great as its breadth. He measured the city with the reed, Twelve thousand twelve stadia. Its length, breadth, and height are equal. \n17  Its wall is one hundred forty-four cubits, by the measure of a man, that is, of an angel. \n18  The construction of its wall was jasper. The city was pure gold, like pure glass. \n19  The foundations of the city's wall were adorned with all kinds of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; \n20  the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, jacinth; and the twelfth, amethyst. 21  The twelve gates were twelve pearls. Each one of the gates was made of one pearl. The street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass. \n22  I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God, the Almighty, and the Lamb, are its temple. \n23  The city has no need for the sun, neither of the moon, to shine, for the very glory of God illuminated it, and its lamp is the Lamb.
"There is no way that you will ever be able to satisfy 100% of the people 100% of the time. You have to look at your beliefs and your ethics and values. Usually listening to the inner voice is a huge key. One thing that I have learned is to breathe - I know that this sounds silly, but it does work. The fact that you are able to stop your ""emotional"" flow to take a minute to focus on inhaling and exhaling allows your ""logical"" side to have control, even if it's just long enough for a breath. Physically, the inhalation of air will feed your brain cells. You will be less likely to overreact. \n\nYou will be happier with yourself if you do take a moment. You will be able to react in a way more in tune with your beliefs, and the difficult person may not be as bothersome.\n\nAnother thing I have always lived by is LEAPS\n  L      Listen\n  E      Empathize\n  A      Apologize\n  P      Positive Phrasing\n  S      Solution\n\nListen - to what the person is saying - sometimes all they need is to say what their issue is.\n\nEmpathize - No one has a situation that is so far removed from the norm that someone else can not relate to it. \n\nApologize - Chicago was right - sometimes it really is hard to say I'm sorry, but it is totally worth it.  And look at it this way, even if you are not sorry for what happened, you are sorry that it has caused a negative reaction.\n\nPositive Phrasing - Quote the Beatles (can ya'll tell I was a music major yet???  LOL)  We can work it out!  Every problem has a solution. It may be that the difficult person and you have no more interaction, but it is solved.\n\nSolution - Look at the root and discuss an option for solution. \n\nMost problems are not really issues, they are lacks of communications. People don't listen anymore and we as a society have learned to that it's not worth the time to communicate; because our heart felt emotions fall on deaf ears when we try.  Be committed to listening.\n\nI hope this helps - e-mail me and let me know!\n\nLeigh-lee"

Would you do anything for your gf that she ask of you or would you tell her to shove it. You don't have to go out in public with them on, Love works in ever strange ways for everyone and I would show her I had guts enough to put them on for the three days. ( I am sure you can think of something to stay indoors for three day fake the flu in summer.)L .O. L.
"Nobody likes to be persecuted, do they?  Of course, Christians don't like people persecuting their religion.  That's not too hard to understand, I think.\n\nChristians believe that they are sent with a message that will save people from death, and from hell.  Many of them feel as if there isn't much time left, and that un-saved people are in serious danger.  If you thought a child were in the way of a speeding train, wouldn't you try to save it?  Maybe you would shove people out of the way to do it?  Would you really care if their feelings got hurt, as long as you could rescue the child?\n \nYes, many Christians come off as being arrogant and over-bearing, and that is sad.  Their ""marching orders"" (as given by their LEADER, Jesus Christ), don't include arrogance, indeed, Jesus commanded them to be humble.  Go figure.\n\nI am a Christian.  I am very sad about the state of the world I see around me.  I would like to rescue as many people as I can.  Could you tell me how to do this without being an ***hole?"
I take care of sick old people 11-7 every night. I take care of and love my husband and cat and sick elderly dog.  I help with my autistic grandson.  In doing for others, I do for myself.  Is that enought?
yeah but unless all them steroids they take have made them grow a penis i doubt they would be interested
"This is a question that will come up more and more often when the new generation of younguns come of age.  I have a grandaughter with 2 middle names and a nephew with 3 middle names.  I could get on a soap box about the indicisive nature of young people these days, but I will hold my tongue.  \n\nI think the traditional monogram is here to stay for now, and it only allows for 3 letters.  Some folks will say choose the ""first"" middle name, but it is my opinion that the person should be  able to choose his/her on monogram.  First name, last name, middle name of choice.  \n\nOf course, there are a number of people who do not go by their first name at all.  That opens up a whole nuther can of worms!  \n\nIt is just a monogram.  Do what makes you happy.  No worries!"
"Mixing of the faiths? Fire and brimstone! *rolls eyes*\n\nOf course she should be allowed to date the non-Christian boy. Love transcends doctrine, and it does not come in limited supply: one's love for God should not prevent one from loving another human being.\n\nThe boy sounds like he is of good virtue anyway (""Christian"" virtue, if you prefer), even if he is not of Christian faith, so I personally do not see any reason to forbid the two from dating each other."
"If someone asks why do you accept this text as the word of God is it a religious question.?\n\n  * I think it is a question of faith or belief, not religion, since it is something I/you accept as true.\n\nOr is the religious question, Why should I accept this text as the word of God.\n\n  * Perhaps the religious question is actually \n      ""Is this text the word of God?"" \nand the response to that question is either belief, doubt, or a combination of both.  (Remember the man who said to Jesus, ""I believe.  Help my unbelief.""?)\n\nIs there a difference between why do YOU and why SHOULD I? \n\n  * Isn't it a difference of position?  If you already know something is true by means of your own training, tests, and thinking, but I don't know it yet, whether I SHOULD know it already depends upon my experience and age and training and education, etc."
dunno
Deal at another store............. You have every right to walk out of a store any time-- before you hand over the money-- even if they wrapped or bagged your item.\n\n\nH|Just turn around and walk out-no explanation necessary.
"Aaah, ""tailor-made god"". Which one am I willing to live with? Which one is the nicest and gives me the most benefits?\n\nTell me, is this like picking your own 401k or IRA plan???"
Warmongers.  I think to a certain extend it's okay- for example I find that studying past wars is fascinating.  But people who seek to keep war alive are crazy.  I believe there is a line.  It is always okay to defend ourselves, our families, and our countries if we are attacked.  I'm not so sure about going after people.

When you start fooling around in a woman's anal area, you must work your way in slowly at first..  You don't just try to push up in her, it hurts too much.  You must first loosen it up (using dildo or whatnot), make sure you have lots of lube and make sure that she is incredibly turned on beforehand (and while you're loosening it up, it helps to continue to stimulate her nether region).  And wait until she is REALLY excited before sticking things back there.  Done right, it can be a mutually satisfying experience.  And then filling up the other hole at the same time...unbelievable!!\n\nAs for double penetration, OUCH.  Good luck with that.
OMG my x did the same exact thing to me.  My x broke up with me, but she will still hug and kiss me.  Like she keeps reeling me back in.  Confusing i know.  When we were first going out she made it quite clear that she could never come out to her parents.  Then a few days ago she says that she is really only 20% gay.  What a slam in the face to me.  She won't accept anything of who she is.  Maybe she believes that denying the truth will make her life easier. I really don't know if dating someone like this is a great idea, but it depends on how much you care for them.  I still love my x a lot and if she wanted to get back together i would be all for it, but at the same time i don't get the full benefits of a healthy relationship.  The only quetion you need to ask is if the good out weighs the bad.  Do you still enjoy being around her?  If her denial is upsetting you that much then maybe it is better to break it off, but if you still seriously care for her, then it makes it a little more difficult to just let go.
Its not a sin to be gay!   just some people read the bible and interperted the meaning of the words to say being an A$$ pirate is a Sin! How ever women are free to go both ways!
The Scriptural account that Jehovah’s Witnesses draw on for their name is in the 43rd chapter of Isaiah. There the world scene is viewed as a courtroom drama: The gods of the nations are invited to bring forth their witnesses to prove their claimed cases of righteousness or to hear the witnesses for Jehovah’s side and acknowledge the truth. Jehovah there declares to his people: “Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am Jehovah; and besides me there is no saviour.”—Isaiah 43:10, 11, American Standard Version.\n\nJehovah God had witnesses on earth during the thousands of years before Jesus was born. After Hebrews chapter 11 lists some of those men of faith, Hebrews 12:1 says: “So, then, because we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also put off every weight and the sin that easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.” Jesus said before Pontius Pilate: “For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth.” He is called “the faithful and true witness.” (John 18:37; Revelation 3:14) Jesus told his disciples: “You will receive power when the holy spirit arrives upon you, and you will be witnesses of me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the most distant part of the earth.”—Acts 1:8.
Its not that I'm afraid of death, but I just don't want to be there when it happens.

STUPID peolpe ask the best Qustions!
I just had this conversation with somebody on another board.  Let me cross post it.  BTW- I believe you are correct.\n\nI care about people, not color, and I hear what you are saying.  So anyway, this is a reply to a person that was playing that race card...\n\n\nThe angry black thing doesn’t work for me Belinda. \n\nMy mother’s boss, Head of personel for NIH was a black woman. She died a couple of years ago of breast cancer. My parents (who are in their late 70's still keep track, and visit her husband). My boss is black. I think the world of the guy. The manager of the help desk where I work, and I work for a mult-billion dollar a year company, is a black woman. She has 25 employees. \n\nSo you want to talk entertainment? And no “Superfly” crap. The father on “Fresh prince of Belaire”, a judge. Aldus Huxley. James Earl Jones. Oprah, remember her? \n\nBlack Americans are moving into positions of power. Mayors, Congress, Supreme Court, Generals, Admirals. \n\nAnd no, I am not discounting the drug problem, crime rate, and prison population. I hear you on those. \n\nBut, Belinda, you don’t want me, whitebread boy, to solve those for you. That makes me either the liberal or conservative solution you were talking about. \n\nThe best I can personally do, is come up and greet you, look you in the eye, and shake your hand, or hug you, and not really care about the color of your skin. All I can do is accept you as an equal, and I do. \n\nThe rest, well, up to you folks to figure out the answers it would seem. You sure do not want whitebread doing it. We have screwed up enough already.
I am Wiccan too but Im still learning.  Blessed be.
It all depends on where you live. I am gay and live in Provo, Utah, but for the most part I have been treated very well. I often notice that most of the time, people who find out that I am gay tend to be a lot more careful what they say around me so as not to offend me. A lot of people are also very nice once they find out because they also don't want to offend me or hurt my feelings. The only negative situations I have ever encountered were not directed at me personally, but people sometimes have said that they don't agree with homosexuality as a lifestyle but they're always usually pretty quick to add that it doesn't affect how they view me as an individual, which is okay with me. I don't expect everyone to accept my sexuality. My personal motto is that if I expect people to be open-minded toward me, then I should pay them the same respect whether I agree with them or not. Ce'st la vie!
i am 325298 years old....seriously. but my pic looks like i'm hot.....which i am...sike.
Something keeps the brimstone boiling.  Maybe they have an in-sin-erator, HA!

didnt know him but sounds like he will be missed-hugs and kisses-treasure the memory of him-old hippie here
There is an Alliance Française in Chicago itself which sponsors programs and langauge lessons.  Contact them.  Many teachers and francophiles belong.
they're for the REALLY lonely people
"Good question.....the other answers all have a point.....our economy ROCKS, we are FREE(ish), and, despite what the liberals will say, you can make it here if you work hard and have a little luck.....not too many other places like that.  \n\nIt is paradoxical, of course, that people in other countries rarely have anything nice to say but they flock here like starving seagulls.....sometimes I think we should just lock down the borders, end immigration, bite the bullet and say ""seeya"" to the rest of the world.....of course, as soon as we said we were doing that, France, German, Russia, China, and the rest of the US-hating world would say ""no no no please don't go, we're sorry we were such jerks!!!"""
I often wonder the same thing. Then again with ignorant people like bubbles or whatever her screen name is... I don't really care. It's a free country, but I say what I want to say, when I want to say it and I don't care who thinks I am racist.
As a believer I stay open to different views.I don't go around saying that I won't watch this program or listen to that song because it says something against my faith.I know the truth of what I believe and so I have no problem listening to or watching something that may go against my faith.It's not going to change my faith and anyone who thinks it will change their faith or hurt their faith doesn't, in my view, have a very strong faith to begin with...\n\nI like Nine Inch Nails  :)
Basic Mendelian genetics.  Mexico was invaded by Spaniards, many of whom had familial ties to the north, England, France, etc.  These Spaniards raped many native Mexican women, some actually had the respect to marry natives, and some American cowboys since then have added to the gene pool.  Therefore, there are recessive genes for blue eyes and blond hair in both of your parents.  Ask your parents or grandparents if they know of any Caucasians in your family tree.  I bet you'll be surprised.
It gives peace to the person living the spiritual life. Whether it gives peace to the world depends on whether or not the spirituality teaches them to respect other people's spirituality.
gives people hope (no hope = chaos) and helps people understand things in which they cannot explain YET (not until science evolves enough).
Are they different?
<Just thinking out loud here>  It's funny how some people have the answers to their questions, because these questions have been asked before a million times by the same asker. It seems to me that the asker just doesn't want to hear what a certain group of people have to say. It's fine, but why ask if it's been answered before, is it because the answer wasn't unto their liking? I think people should ask themselves, do they want an answer or are they spending their life trying to trip others that have a mustard seed of faith up? Does it really matter was Creationist think if you are not truly interested in what they think? <Again, just thinking out loud here and grabbing two points along the way>
Because it fits in with their plan.
First Adam may not even be a real name but a representation.  The word really means dirt or dust (adama).\n\nTaking him as a person, all of us are like Adam.  Sometimes we are selfish.  Sometimes we help one another.  We strive to move toward doing things for one another that make the world better.\n\nThe words heaven, hell and original and sin are church words that try to explain things we really know nothing about in the first place.  What is important is to live our lives to the full.
