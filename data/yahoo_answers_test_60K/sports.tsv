Bike gears or speeds allow you to pedal more efficienttly. \n\nThe number of speeds your new bike has is the result of your front gears multiplied by the rear one. Newer MTB bikes will range from 21 to 27 (3 on front and 7,8 or 9 on the rear cog) while road bikes will range from 14 - 18 (2 on front 7,8 or 9 on the rear cog)\n\nThe front gears are controled by your left hand shifter (dial/knob) the smaller ring is easier for the hills, while the big ring is better for building speed or going downhill.\n\nThe rear gears are controlled by your right hand and they work the opposite as the ones on front, the bigger cog will be easier going uphill and the smaller cog will be harder.\n\nMost of the time you can ride on the middle ring, while shifting only the rear cogs. As you get the hang of it, start shifting the front rings.\n\nI leave some links that are more technical and will help you enjoy your new bike
The manager defines the tactics of the team, decides which players to play in every game, and decides which player the team should buy (Generally). However, in Italy, it is the director of football of the team that has the authority to decide which player the team should buy (after listening to the manager's opinion). \nThe Coach(es) is a subordinate of the manager. They are assigned to train the players on their physical ability and skills.\nThe manager doesn't deal with business matter such as merchandising, ticket price, etc. That is the job of the board of director or General Manager.

Although this year's Illini aren't as deep as last year's Big 10 conference championship team, I think they have a good chance against other conference teams like Indiana this year. Don't count on a near-perfect season though; chances for a NCAA Championship aren't very likely.
In 2004, the State of Hawaii had signed an agreement with the NFL to keep the Pro Bowl in Hawaii until 2009 (at least). The NFL will control concessions, parking, souviners, and advertising at Aloha Stadium for the game. The game being in Hawaii is a win-win situation for the State of Hawaii and the NFL. Coming to Hawaii is an incentive for the players to make the all-star team, unlike the years before the game was moved to Aloha Stadium in Honolulu. Where would you rather play football in February, Hawaii or Wisconsin?

NBL Years:\n \n1946/47: Owned by Italian Immigrant Danny Biasone the Syracuse Nationals begin play in the National Basketball League, in the same year professional basketball was finally gaining some legitimacy with the rival Basketball Association of America that was based in large cities like New York and Philadelphia. While in the NBL with teams largely consisting of small Midwestern towns the Nationals put together a 21-23 record finishing in 4th place. In the playoffs the Nats, would be beaten by the fellow upstate neighbor Rochester Royals in 4 years.\n\n1947/48: In their second season the Nationals would struggle finishing in 5th place with a 24-36 record. Despite their struggles the Nats would make the playoffs getting swept by the Anderson Duffey Packers in 3 straight games.\n\n1948/49: Several teams begin to leave the NBL for the BAA as the foundation for a merger is laid. Staying in the NBL the Nationals sign AL Cervi to be player coach as Dolph Schayes makes his professional debut leading the Nats to a winning record for the first time with a record of 40-23. In the playoffs the Nationals would make quick work of the Hammond Calumet Buccaneers winning the series in 2 straight games. However, in the semifinals the Nats would fall to the Anderson Duffey Packers for the second straight season in 4 games. Following the season the remaining NBL teams would join the BAA as the two leagues merged and became the NBA.\n\nNBA Years:\n \n1949/50: The Nationals were an instant success in the NBA winning the Eastern Division with a league best record of 51-13. In the playoffs the Nationals would continue to play solid basketball beating the Philadelphia Warriors in 2 straight. Moving on to the Eastern Finals the Nationals would battle the New York Knickerbockers beating their big city rivals in a 3-game series. Moving on to the NBA Finals the Nationals would face fellow NBL alum Minneapolis Lakers. In Game 1 of the Finals the Nats would lose just their 2nd home game of the season 68-66. The Nats would not recover as they fell behind 3 games to 1 before falling in 6 games. \n\n1950/51: Despite several teams leaving the NBA to reorganize the NBL the Nationals deiced to stay put. In their second NBA season the Nationals would play mediocre basketball all season finishing in 4th place with a record of 32-34. However, in the playoffs the Nats would play their best basketball of the season as they stunned the 1st place Philadelphia Warriors in 2 straight taking Game 1 on the road in overtime 91-89. However, in the Eastern Finals the Nationals would be beaten by the New York Knickerbockers in a hard fought 5-game series losing the finale by just 2 points.         \n\n1951/52: Al Cervi, playing less and coaching more, emphasized a patient offense and a scrappy defense, which led the league by yielding a stingy 79.5 points per game, as the Nationals won the Eastern Division with a solid 40-26 record. In the playoffs the Nats would knock the Philadelphia Warriors off again in a 3-game series. However, in the Eastern Finals the Nats would fall to the New York Knickerbockers again dropping the series in 4 games.\n\n1952/53: The Nationals would finish in 2nd place in a hard fought 3-way battle for first place in the Eastern Division with a record of 47-24. In the playoffs the Nationals would face the Boston Celtics dropping Game 1 at home 87-81. Needing a win in Boston to keep their hopes alive, the Nationals would take the Celtics deep in to overtime before losing in quadruple OT 111-105, in what remains the longest game in NBA history.\n\n1953/54: The Nationals acquire Alex Groza and Ralph Beard as the Indianapolis Olympians folded leaving the NBA with just 9 teams. Once again the Nationals would battle for the Division title falling 2 games short with a 42-30 record. In the playoffs the Nats would win all 4 games of a round robin tournament involving the 3 playoff teams from the East. In the Eastern Finals the Nats would stay hot beating

"PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE \nHow good are you? If you're a junior, now is the time to start looking into these things. For a division I-A school, you must be VERY good to walk-on. Most schools have intramural teams and many have JV. If you think you're good enough to get recruited, go to the schools athletic websites and most schools will offer a ""Prospective Student Athlete Form"" to fill out, where you put things like how strong you are, your speed, etc. \nOnce you get to a school, get in contact with the athletic department, asking them when walk-on tryouts are. Be relentless. \nWhat schools are you looking into?"
It has rarely, if not never been done before. twin turbo set ups usually work with very small turbos, with one turbo spooling initially, and the second turbo spooling at higher gears/rpms. I suggest a single turbo set up, as it conserves space. I cant even imagine what a twin turbo manifold on a 4 cyl car would look like.

No.  It was never available in europe, so you can't even get the engine computer to talk to the transmission computer.  The SMG transmission can't handle the additional torque of the 5.0L V8 on the E39 M5.  The E46 M3 has less power and MUCH less torque, so it works.  The 2005 M5 has a V10 engine and totally different electronics from the E39 chassis.  Also the SMG III in the new M5 is a seven speed unit which is dimensionally different from your transmission.

Get the fundamentals down first.  Some of the simplest things people forget.  Don't look down when you dribble.  Deliver a 2 hand chest or bounce pass.  Set picks, roll off the screen, etc etc.  \n\nJust goto your local parks and get in a pickup game.  If they're all heads and shoulders better than you, good.  That's the only way you'll get better.  You need to play with people who are better than you.  Good luck.

Some baseball players are fast, but some (like David Ortiz) are big and known for their homerun hitting abilities.  The further you hit the ball, the less fast you need to be, and if you hit a home run you can take your sweet time.\n\nBaseball players use anabolic steroids to make themsleves get stronger faster and be able to hit the ball further easier.

As a high school tennis coach, I can only address the Tennis question.  Players can NOT jump over the net.  A players racket may NOT touch the net.  The racket can go OVER the net, as long as the player strikes the ball on his/her side of the net and then follows through over the net (without touching the net).  The only time a player can strike the ball while it is on the opponent's side of the net is if the wind blows the ball back to their opponent's side of the net before he/she has a chance to hit it back.  Hope this helps.

It depends on what exactly you are looking for. I don't know of many places in the city that are cheap (I have found some good deals at Lombaridi's on Polk, but not cheap), but if you have a car or can borrow one go to Tri-City at 40900 Grimmer Blvd in Fremont. There I have found some of the best deals on all types of new gear; clothing, skis and snowboards. The later you go in the season, the cheaper things get (of course).\n\nIf you do not mind buying used or surplus gear, try the Wilderness Exchange in Berkeley (1407 San Pablo Ave), the store is great. I have found some good deals there on winter clothing and camping gear.

1) Push at a comfortable speed, remember the faster you go the better the pop. \n2) Place your front foot near the middle of your board, about two inches under your bolts. Put your back foot on the tail. \n3) Squat, so you can spring yourself up. \n4) Kick your back foot down so you can pop as you jump up, your front foot should rub upward on your griptape. \n5) Make sure you tuck your knees to your chest, picking up your back foot as well to level the board at a good height. REMEMBER you are jumping forward. \n6) Then come down comfortably, both feet on the board. It will look better if both your feet are over the bolts as well as lessen the stress of impact \n7) Finally bend your legs as you touch down to give it that smooth style and roll away stocked\n\n\n\nu have to remember to slide your foot foward,\n\nkeep practicing, i can now ollie almost two feet!

SF's Fat guys ( oline) is not that good.  They don't do a god job run or pass blocking that makes it tough for a young QB.  Smith should have sat out the whole year just like Palmer did a few years ago.  If Smith had better protection and more of a balanced attack he would do better.  It is way to early to write him off yet, in my books anyways.  SF needs help and having the first pick will not solve all thier problems.
The Broncos are a better regulare season Team but they lose composure in the BIG games.  Therefore I would say the Patriots are better!

In a move to bring baseball to all parts of the country, O'Malley also convinced Giants owner Horace Stoneham to move his Giants the same year to San Francisco. Just a little more than six months later, on April 18, 1958, the Dodgers played their first game in Los Angeles, defeating the Giants 6-5 before 78,672 fans at the Coliseum.""\n- Patrick Spreng"

"1. Don't think of it as ""jumping"" hurdles, it should be a big step, especially if you are running the low hurdles.\n\n2. You aren't going anywhere if you are float in the air over the hurdle. Get your lead leg back on the ground and moving you towards the next hurdle.\n\n3. Work on your strength. Run repeat 200's, 300's even 400's. My college coach had his 400m hurdlers run 600's a couple of times a week plus running either repeats over the first 5  or 8 hurdles on other days.  You would be surprised how many people are faster than you, but can still be beaten because they run out of gas over the last couple of hurdles."

It depends on how active you are. It shouldn't be over 100 resting(thats if your in bad shape). If your in really good shape, it could be as low as 50.

You'd be surprised at how easy it is to start, you don't need anything fancy, just a pole, bait, and a good spot. You can probably pick out a good pole easily with the advice of any Wal-Mart associate. My best advice would be to go to a sporting goods store, like cabelas, or gander mtn. sports, and see if they have any clinics where you can learn the basics. It's easy to figure out on your own, but cheaking up on things like this will greatly improve your luck when you get out there. For spots reasearch the department of environmental conservation (DEC) where they should list public land for fishing. Also almost everytime you're on a road that follows a stream, and there's a parking area, you can fish, or get permission to fish from a landowner. Good luck with it!

As far as I understand, deer are colorblind.  This is why hunter's\ncamoflage is red and black - it has the same values of dark and light as\nmilitary forest camoflage, so colorblind animals have a hard time seeing\nit.  Most people, at least those who are not red-green colorblind, can\neasily pick out the red color among the forest greens and browns.  So as\nlong as hunters only shoot at what they see, it reduces the chance of being\nin the line of fire.
Not necessarily.  For example, a local girl that graduated from my old high school in 2004 (I grad in 97 so I didn't know her that well), is off to the Torino 2006 Winter Olympics as part of the US Luge team (look up Erin Hamlin).  And they are in charge of their own fundraising to get there.  There are buttons saying Go Erin for sale, bake sales, donations taken, etc.
"One sure way to find out what something is worth is test the price that the market will bear, i.e. put it on Ebay.  Assuming Ebay is (more or less) a fair marketplace at the time at which you sell the item then the marketplace can give you an idea of what the item is worth. \n\nPricing an item this way also ""automatically"" takes into account the condition of the item and (because of the size and scope of Ebay) also takes into account the rarity of the item.  Where such a method fails is in the assumption: if the marketplace isn't fair (your item doesn't have the proper exposure or the people who are interested in your item aren't looking on Ebay) then you will of course fail to realize its true value.\n\nBut I still think Ebay will give you a good 1st-order approximation.\n\nWhile a newspaper"

If he wants to start, he better hope he gets traded, because he just watched his job in KC disappear. The Chiefs would have to be fools to not start Larry Johnson who, in the 9 games he started, rushed for 1351 yards. Do the math, that's 2400 yards for a full sixteen-game season. No running back on pace to beat the single-season record by 300 yards sits. Priest's high since coming to KC was 1600 and that was three years ago, time to find a new home, Holmes.

I like to mark a point on the wall and stab it, but that doesn't sound like an option.  The next best way is the tennis ball method - poke a hole in a tennis ball and put a rope out one end.  Toss the ball over something it can safely hang over (a basketball goal or maybe a hook in the ceiling) and tie the other end of the rope to a point in the middle of the rope, creating an adjustable loop.  You could also just fix the length and make a more permanent hanging tennis ball.

In lieu of actually seeing the object, you might try this. \n\nGet a length of rope and tie it to an anchor. Hold onto the free end of the rope and drop the anchor near the center of the area you want to search. Holding the rope swim away from the anchor until the rope is pulls tight. Swim in a circle around the anchor, along the bottom, at the end of the rope. If the object is sticking up and hasn't settled in the silt, the rope will snag. At that point, you follow it back to your target. \n\nI know of at least one case where this method was used to retrieve a snowmobile that had gone through the ice on a frozen lake.

the steelers because the logo was just temp, they didn't know if they would like the steelmark, after it replaced the players numbers on either side of the gold helmet, Jack hart (equip manager) insisted on leaving it on one side of the gold helmet, then they finished second for eastern conference, qualified for playoff bowl, they wanted to do something special for postseason game, so they changed the color of helmet to black from gold, which highlighted the new logo. since then the logo only on one side brought on a lot of interest, and b/c of the teams success after that they decided to leave it that way
go any in the world is only Ryan GIggs who started the premiership frm 92-till date followed by Alan shearer frm 95 till date.

They are set so as to try to create equal amount of money bet on each side.  This allows the casino to collect the most.  The line is not set in order to try directly to predict the outcome of the game.

I watched the game. Unfortunately, a playoff caliber team can't expect to go very far with 5 turnovers. I think the dynasty is over.

I heard on the radio that Conference USA who supplied the refs apologized for many plays. I don't think the refs were doing favortism, they did spot the ball horribly in Iowa's favor twice off by a yard or more. But they did hurt Iowa bad on 5 horrible calls. The refs come from a conferecne that has much slower and smaller players. They could not keep up with the game.

Notre Dame cannot stop the Ohio State offense.  Their only hope to stay close is to win the turnover and special teams battles.\n\nGiven the history of Tressel's Ohio State teams, I see OSU winning 35-24, but the game won't be as close as the score.\n\nI agree with the previous answer, ND would kill Old Dominion.
I have been working diligently to find the answer to your question over a month ago. Here's what I got: Small-sided games are better than drills. It teaches players to be creative as opposed to rigid training that does not allow for such a thing. There are a number of things I would like you to check out for yourself. See which one might work.
In the AFC it will come down to the Steelers or Colts. The Colts are fantastic, but the Steelers are as well. Aside from the loss to the Colts and the Patriots by three, the Steelers lost three games due to injuries. Those three games Jaguars, Ravens and Bengals all came down to the final minutes or overtime and all were by 6 points or less and in two of those games Maddox gave up six turnovers. Now they are all healthy and running on momentum. The Colts I'm sure will be ready, but I don't know if they will be flat or not for essentially not playing for a couple of weeks. With Jerome Bettis considering retirement and the superbowl in his hometown I think the Steelers have extra motivation. The defense is playing very well right now too. During the game with the Colts the Steelers lost 26-7, and they should have. But Big Ben's knees were still iffy and he broke his thumb halfway though the game. The Steelers did not run the ball 35 times, only 20 some. When they run the ball 35 times or more they are somehting on the order of 102-2. The Steelers had a chance to score 10 as they missed a field goal and the Colts scored 3 at the very end so there is the possibility that the game could have been 23-10. The Colts got a touchdown very early in the game in which the d-back did not stay with his responsibility. So say that mistake could have made the game 15-10. Aside from another touchdown the Colts scored three field goals. I think both teams are very even and it will be a very close game, something the Steelers have seen but the colts have not.
No, first of all the Steelers are an extremely tough team on the road.  Then they have to face either Denver or the Patriots.  This is not a foregone conclusion for the AFC title at all.  They could easily lose to any of the three teams left in the AFC.
Some exameples are: skateboarding, inline skating, snowboarding, or one of the more extremer sports, such as Moto X, skysurfing and kytesurfing.\n\nExtreme sport (practically synonymous with the term action sport) is a general term for sports featuring speed, height, danger or spectacular stunts. A feature of such activities in the view of some is their alleged capacity to induce a so-called ‘‘adrenaline rush’’ in participants (a misnomer, since often the rush or high obtained is a product of increased levels of dopamine endorphins and serotonin).\n\nExtreme sports are often associated with young adults wishing to push themselves to the limits of their physical ability and fear, in turn pushing the boundaries of a particular sport. This youthful demographic accounts too for extreme sports’ frequent association with youth culture, not restricted to clothing fashions and music.\n\nSome contend that the distinction between an extreme sport and a conventional one is as much to do with marketing as it is to do with perceptions about levels of danger involved or the amount of adrenaline generated. Snowboarding thus has a more extreme ‘‘image’’ than skiing due to differing marketing strategies and the fact of being a newer sport, even though skiing is a faster and at least equally dangerous activity.

The rules for eligibility for the draft varies depending on the league.  If a league allows 18 year olds to be drafted, like the NBA used to, then it's a matter of some team thinking that the player in question is good enough to be drafted.\n\nIn short, high school players get drafted because league rules allow it, and some team thinks that the player is worth drafting.

You need to stretch a lot.  Then sit in that position.  Start out with 30 seconds at a time and work your way up.  It takes a very long time though.  I was a gymnast, and it took me a few years before I could do them comfortably.  Be patient.
For that kind of price range, I would strongly suggest the Burris Black Diamond line. They are super clear and reliable for a fraction of the price of the Leupold of Swarovski. I have the 8-32x50 and it is an amazing scope. There is a dealer on ebay that sells a lot of them for several hundred dollars below retail.

Its actually a rule in Football (socccer). Basically it  is designed to stop players hanging around the goal! A player is offside if he is nearer to his opponents' goal line than both the ball and the second last opponent, unless he is in his own half of the field of play. Recently the rule has changed to be only active players, causing much controversy!\nCheck out the BBC site here:\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/default.stm\n\nOffside rule:\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4679881.stm

I'd go with Chone Figgins, myself.

Dwayne Douglas Johnson (born May 2, 1972 in Hayward, California), better known by his stage name The Rock, is an American actor and former professional wrestler. He has starred in such motion pictures as Be Cool, Walking Tall, The Mummy Returns, The Rundown, The Scorpion King, Doom, and others. He is of multiracial descent, as his father is African-Canadian and mother is Samoan.\n\nJohnson first gained mainstream fame as a standout in the World Wrestling Federation (now known as World Wrestling Entertainment). Before becoming The Rock, he was known as Rocky Maivia, in homage to his father, Rocky Johnson, and his maternal grandfather, High Chief Peter Maivia. With this family history, he became the first 3rd generation wrestler in WWE history. Since his entry into acting, Johnson continues to be known simply as The Rock.

There's a different mind set when you're home.  You have the fans, you get to relax, etc.  Cowher doesn't want his team thinking that.  This isn't supersticious, it's smart coaching.
Baseball stitches that hold the two identical halves of a baseball's horsehide skin together permit the pitcher a better grip and also contributes to curve balls.  As the curve ball spins, the velocity of the skin relative to the air surrounding the ball on its path is different on opposite sides of the ball, creating a slight vacuum altering the course of the ball.  You can shape your hands and fingers to simulate the special curvature of a baseball skin and seems.\n\nThe baseball skin was invented in my home town of Stoughton, Mass. where I believe they were going to erect a suitable monument at one time.  At the baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, I saw only a small faded news article, within a glass case filled with the oldest baseballs, that even mentioned the invention.  I'm glad you asked.

"My national league favorite is the Cubs.  Probably because they have such a similar history to my real favorite, the Red Sox.  I'm a fanatic and either watch the games on TV with the MLB package because I live in Florida, or XM radio, and even sink to watching the play by play on ""Gameday"".  I don't think I've missed a pitch in 3 years.  Oh, yeah, I go to St. Petersburg whenever they come to play the Devil Rays.\n\nBut, I'd love to see the Cubs win the world series.  With the way things are going the past few years it's only right.  Better yet, play the Red Sox in the world series.  They can win that one if they promise to go 7 games, but if they end up playing the Yankees I want the Cubs to sweep with a 4 game shutout."
"The Florida Seals are a minor-league ice hockey team, currently a member of the Southern Professional Hockey League (SPHL). Originally based in Orlando, Florida, they are now based in Kissimmee, Florida, a suburb south of Orlando in Osceola County. The ownership group of the Seals is led by David Waronker.\n\nThe team was formed as the Orlando Seals, and played its first season beginning in October 2002 with the Atlantic Coast Hockey League (ACHL). It was the winner of that league's first and only President's Cup in 2003. When the ACHL folded, they and two other teams, the Jacksonville Barracudas and the Macon Trax, merged into the new World Hockey Association 2 (WHA2), founded by Waronker himself. After the 2003-2004 season, the World Hockey Association served a cease-and-desist order on the WHA2 and it merged with the South East Hockey League (SEHL) to form the Southern Professional Hockey League (SPHL).\n\nThe Orlando Seals were scheduled to play in the 2004-2005 SPHL season, but on August 22, 2004, the City of Orlando revoked its lease at the TD Waterhouse Centre, causing them to miss the season. On October 19, 2004, the ownership group announced a new three-year lease with the Silver Spurs Arena in Kissimmee. The team resumed play in the 2005-2006 season, hosting their first home game against the Jacksonville Barracudas on October 29, 2005.\n\nThe mascot of the Florida Seals is Sealvester. He wears a jersey emblazoned with the number ""02""."

If you must choose one, the coach, and the system and discipline he brings, are more important than talent.  Of course, both are needed to be succesfull, but a well disciplined team with a solid gameplan is far more sucessful than a talented but undisciplined team.

Well, he could in a movie, but all the boxing fans would be really upset. In real life, I doubt it. In fact I don't see how people could have thought he won the first fight with Apollo Creed. Creed was too fast and knew how to keep his distance working from the outside, although Creed may have come out too tense in the rematch which led to his exhaustion. Clubber Lang was unproven. And the whole Ivan Drago thing was just a farce. Even with Drago having had only one prior professional bout, Rocky just had no skill. I understand guts and a granite chin can win you bouts, but it can't win you bouts against a top contender or champion. I don't know, those movies are just too unrealistic for me sometimes, though I do like the music and the training scenes.

Here's the full answer: The 1994 season was shortened, due to the Player's Strike. Before the strike, Major League Baseball had begun to implent the Wild Card into its playoff structure, but due to the strike, it didn't begin until 1995. The top teams in the leagues were as follows:\n\nAmerican League\nAL East: New York Yankees (70-43)\nAL Central: Chicago White Sox (67-46)\nAL West: Texas Rangers (52-62)\n\nNational League\nNL East: Montreal Expos (74-40)\nNL Central: Cincinatti Reds (66-48)\nNL West: Los Angeles Dodgers (58-56)\n\nNow there are some that will say that the Expos were robbed of a possible championship season, but one could say that of the Yankees with their record, also. Unfortunately, we'll never know...

"Unless the top 4 teams all choke badly in the next couple of weeks, I think #5 is the highest the ratings people are going to allow Gonzaga to go. That said, they *should* have a #2 seed in the tournament as long as they don't lose in the WCC tournament, but I can see the selection committee trying to shaft them again and give them a #3 seed because of ""their schedule"" and ""weak conference.""\n\nHonestly, I think I like the guess of the person who said ""Elite 8,"" though I really, truly want to see them make the Final Four. Everyone looks at Adam Morrison, but J.P. Batista is averaging nearly a double-double (19+ points, 9+ rebounds) and Derek Raivio is a great free throw shooter. But Morrison will have to carry them through the latter games for them to go really far."
Chicago and Denver.\n\nNo one really knows at this point, but these are two highly competitive teams that I expect to go deeper into the playoffs next year than they did this year.

Two main differences, both related:\n\nOne, the Tasco scopes usually have 1-inch main tubes and many (most?) Leupolds have 30mm tubes. That extra 5mm means extra elevation adjustment before your stadia (the thing that holds the reticle) hits the side of the scope.\n\nSecondly, the Tasco has two adjustment knobs; one for elevation and one for windage. But the configuration is like this: One knob at 12 o'clock, one at 3 o'clock, and one spring at 7:30 to press the stadia against the adjustment knobs. It's a common configuration, but it means that as you adjust the windage, the elevation can change as well. Leupold uses 2 springs placed 180 degrees from the adjustment knobs - so a knob at 12 and 3, and a spring at 6 and 9. It makes the scope more repeatable as you make adjustments.\n\nIf all you want to do is sight in your rifle at, say, 200 yards and then shoot a deer or two a season, the Tasco will do just fine. if, however, you're dinging clay pigeons at 700 yards with a quartering wind you'll want the scope that can perform for you.\n\nA really simple test of a scope's adjustment mechanism is to shoot a 3-shot group at the center of a large piece of cardboard - right at a target dot. Then move your windage a few minutes of angle to the right - I like to move it 6 minutes, or 24 clicks on a 1/4 moa scope. Place the reticle on the same target dot, and press the trigger 3 times. Now adjust your elevation 6 minutes up and repeat, then 6 minutes left, then 6 minutes down. You should have a perfect square defined by the 5 groups you shot, with the group in the lower left being 6 holes and the others being 3. If you have anything but a square, or your ending group isn't at the same place as your beginning group, your scope has a repeatability problem when adjusted.

in the nhl fighting is part of the game. it really is just frustration taking over.  it's not really aggression.  in reality, many of the players are friends off ice and foes on ice. it is just for fan base. but there have been some justifible fights like the march 2001 incident at the joe louis arena when darren mccarty of the wings and claude lemieux of the colorado avalanche fought. they fought becuz of morals.  lemieux gave a dirty hit in the playoffs the year before that caused a broken jaw to kris draper(another wing) and mccarty was paying him back.  it was a great fight.  it can also make a game exciting. as far as the olympics i'm not sure if they fight.  in junior they have less fights. they focus more on skill. in beer leagues they fight for all reasons. i don't mind it. it does not make the sport of hockey violent

Well, of course, the refs influence the outcome of everygame. Even if they call a perfect game and don't make any mistakes, their calls will influence who wins the game.\n\nBut I don't see what the big deal is with the refs in the Superbowl. Overall, they did a good job. The only call that they missed was that block by Hasselback, other than that, they made all the right calls. People just want someone to blame for their team losing, unfortunately the refs are the easiest people to place the blame on. Anyways, if the refs had called a mistake-free game then the Steelers still would have won.

Wild Turkeys live in open woodlands and forests  with lots of clearings and meadows. They travel during the day looking for food.\n\nWild Turkeys eat a great variety of foods, including: insects, spiders, snails, slugs, salamanders, small lizards, small frogs, millipedes, grasshoppers, very small snakes, worms, grasses, vines, flowers, acorns, buds, seeds, fruits, clovers, dogwood, blueberries, cherries, hickory nuts, beechnuts, and other vegetation.\n\nWild Turkeys travel in small flocks. For most of the year, they are single-sex flocks. Females are with females, males with males. Young turkeys follow their mothers.\n\nWild Turkeys have good eyesight and hearing, and they are very fast runners.\n\nThe breeding  season is in March and April. A male turkey will try to find a female flock to make his harem.\n\nTo attract females, the male will gobble and strut, fanning out his tail. He will mate with several females in the flock.\n\nWild Turkey nests are made in the ground. A shallow depression is lined with leaves and covered up with vines and other plants. Ten to fifteen eggs are laid. Eggs are light brown, with black and dark brown spots. The female will sit on the eggs for a month are more. This makes her very vulnerable to predators.

Spurs! Good people, good team, and they live and breathe defense.
Where a person plays should not be based on their size, but their skills. A point guard needs to handle the ball well, see the floor well, pass well. A center needs to play well with their back to the basket, rebound well and maintain position. Some tall players would make better point guards and some shorter players could make good centers ... but decide where to play people by their skills, not just their size

In the late 1800's Hans Gamper and ten other enthusiasts were playing an unknown sport called 'foot-ball'. When Gamper went on to found Barcelona Football Club on 29 November 1899, he could hardly have imagined the momentous events that would follow!\n\nThroughout some of Catalonia's most difficult years, the flag represented the people's hopes for freedom, and today that very flag is the symbolic link which continues to represent the ties between a very special club and its' supporters.\n\nOver the course of 100 years, the club has lived through moments of glory and tragedy, through good times and bad, through epic victories and crushing defeats. Each one of these moments has contributed to shaping Barcelona into the absolutely unique club that it is today.\n\nBarcelona's renown can be attributed, in part, to impressive statistics but another factor is certainly that Barcelona is one of the most highly decorated teams in the world. With the exception of the International Cup, the showcases of the Barcelona museum contain every trophy possible. Topping off the impressive collection is the European Cup, the crowning glory of a Wembley final that went into the history books.\n\nQuite apart from winning the supreme continental prize, Barcelona is also in the extremely enviable position of being the only team in Europe to have participated in every European Cup since 1955 the first year the tournament began. Their massive European trophy collection also includes the Cup Winners' Cup, which the club has won no less than four times - making it undisputed king. In addition, Barca accumulated three Fairs Cups (nowadays know as the UEFA Cup) in the 1958, 1960 and 1966 seasons. The Club retained the trophy in perpetuity after winning a special final in 1971, which paired together the first winner of the competition, FC Barcelona, against the last winner, Leeds United. However, Barca does not just reign in Europe but also in Spain, specifically in the Kings Cup, leading the ranking of winners in this competition with 24 titles. \n\nOf course, Barcelona reigns in Spain as well as in Europe and no other Spanish team can equal Barcelona's 24 championship titles in the Copa del Rey.\n\nAs for the Spanish championship league (historically one of the toughest competition grounds for the club), Barcelona celebrates the centenary birthday with 16 league titles to its name. Six of these were amassed over the last ten years alone.\nBut most outstanding of all was that glorious night of May 20, 1992 at the legendary Wembley Stadium in London, when Barcelona beat Sampdoria 1-0 to win the European Cup. Ronald Koemans goal in the 112th-minute of the game now forms part of the Blaugrana legend and the side that featured in that historic match has gone down in gold letters in the clubs proud history: Zubizarreta, Nando, Ferrer, Koeman, Juan Carlos, Bakero, Salinas (Goikoetxea), Stoichkov, Laudrup, Guardiola (Alexanko) and Eusebio.\n\nThe last few years\n\nThe Cup Winners Cup, Spanish Cup and Spanish Super Cup won by English manager Bobby Robson's Barca in 96-97, the League and Cup double in 1998, and the League in 1998-99 (the first of Van Gaal's two periods in charge at the club) were the last major titles to be won by the FC Barcelona first team.\n\nAnother highly emotional occasion was the Club Centenary in 1999 (Antoni Tàpies designed the official poster), which served as a link between a glorious past and hope for continued success in the future. In its historic centenary year, Barcelona won the football, basketball, handball, and roller hockey leagues.\n\nOn July 23, 2000, Joan Gaspart took over the presidency of the club, and on January 22, 2002, work began on the 'Joan Gamper' training grounds in Sant Joan Despí. Another of the Club's proudest moments came on May 11, 2003, when the basketball team won the Euroleague for the first time ever. The final was played in the Palau Sant Jordi aga

He has been injury free for a while but you never know. And right now Pujols has been really injury free.

final drive for a 2000 is 4.4:1....this is on the type R heres some info\n\nSo how do we make a car that has a motor putting out such weak torque faster? That's when gears come in. Gears will multiply the torque by certain factors depending on their size/teeth count. Take a GS-R in first gear (3.23), when the motor spins 3.23 times, the driveshaft will turn once. And for every 4.4 turns of the driveshaft, the differential (final drive, 4.4) will turn once. That is directly connected to the axles which turn the wheels. You can simply multiply 3.23*4.4 to get an absolute gear ratio of 14.212:1. This means for every 14.212 turns of the motor the wheels will turn once. So if the motor gets to turn 14.212 times in order to only turn the wheels once, the amount of torque the motor is applying to the wheels gets multiplied that many times.\n\nif you were also asking for the 91 i dont have that info

"First of all, it isn't OFFENCES, it's offense. Now, I don't understand what you're asking, but here you go:\n.\n.\n.\n.\nAlthough the rules do not specify any positions whatsoever, they have evolved as part of basketball. During the first five decades of basketball's evolution, two guards, two forwards, and one center were used. Since the 1980s, more specific positions have evolved, namely point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward and center. On some occasions, teams will choose to use a three guard offense, replacing one of the forwards or the center with a third guard.\n\nTwo main defense concepts are used: zone defense and man-to-man defense. Zone defense involves players in defensive positions, guarding whichever opponent is in their zone. In man-to-man defense, each defensive player guards and follows a specific opponent and tries to prevent him from taking action. Variations of these two main structures are used.\n\nOffensive plays are more varied, normally involving planned passes and movement by players without the ball. A quick movement by an offensive player without the ball to gain an advantageous position is a cut. A legal attempt by an offensive player to stop an opponent marking a teammate, by standing in the defender's way such that the teammate cuts next to him, is a screen or pick. The two plays are combined in the pick and roll, in which a player sets a pick and then ""rolls"" away from the pick towards the basket. Screens and cuts are very important in offensive plays; these allow the quick passes and teamwork which can lead to a successful basket. Teams almost always have several offensive plays planned to ensure their movement is not predictable. On court, the point guard is generally responsible for indicating which play will occur.\n\nDefensive and offensive structures, and positions, are more emphasised in higher levels in basketball; it is these that a coach normally requests a time-out to discuss.\n\n\nShooting\n \nPlayer releases a short jump shot, while her defender is either knocked down, or trying to ""take a charge.""Shooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball through the basket. While methods can vary with players and situations, the most common technique can be outlined here.\n\nThe player holds the ball to rest in the dominant hand's fingertips (the shooting arm) slightly above the head, with the other hand on the side of the ball. The ball is shot by extending the shooting arm to become straight; the ball rolls off the finger tips while the wrist completes a full downward flex motion. Generally, the non-shooting arm is only used to guide the shot, not to power it.\n\nPlayers often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to deaden its impact with the rim. The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat arguable, but generally coaches will profess proper arch. Most players shoot directly into the basket, but in certain situations the shooter may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket.\n\nThe two most common shots are the set shot and the jump shot. The set shot is taken from a standing position, with neither foot leaving the floor, typically used for free throws. The jump shot is taken while in mid-air, near the top of the jump. This provides much greater power and range, and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender.\n\nThe best shooters have good coordination, balance, courage and are well practiced. Realizing a shooting opportunity and using it is as important as basic technique; top players at the professional level rarely miss when given an unguarded look at the basket.\n\n\nPassing\n \nCarlos Arroyo shown here with the Utah Jazz, left, passes to a teammate.A pass is a method of moving the ball between players. Most passes are accompanied by a step forward to increase power and are followed through with the hands to ensure accuracy.\n\nOne of the most basic passes is the chest "
Tim Duncan.  Always look to the guy with the rings, and when it doubt, pick a tall guy.  Guard play is nice, but Big Men = Championships
The highest seed???  Heck, there's been plenty of #1 seeds to win the tournament, it's a pretty long list.\n\nDid you mean the lowest seed?  That would be 8th seed Villanova beating Georgetown for the title in 1985.

Since you alreay know how to use a computer, I'm very surprised you haven't used a search engine like Google or Yahoo to locate the Official Rules of Tennis online, and answer this question yourself.\n\nIf you have further questions about tennis rules, you should find it helpful to visit the USTA's (United States Tennis Association) website.\n\nHERE IS THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION - - - -\n\nThe Official Rules of Tennis give the following 3 options to the coin toss (or racquet spin):\n\n1. Choice of Serving or Receiving -\n\nIt's considered an advantage to serve first because a speedy ball is difficult for an opponent to return.\n\nIf you have a consistent and fast and/or tricky serve, which makes you more likely to win the opening game of the match, then definitely serve first because you gain the psychological advantage of holding serve.\n\nIf you have a weak serve, and are more likely to lose the opening game of the match, which is a definite psychological disadvantage, then definitely receive first.\n\n2. Choice of Side -\n\nOften, the choice of side makes no difference. In fact, if you're playing tennis indoors, there's generally no difference at all because there are no climatic conditions to affect your match.\n\nHowever, it is possible, although quite atypical, that there are other factors to influence your decision. This could include having something in the background behind the baseline that makes it difficult to see the ball well.\n\nMost of the time, a meaningful difference occurs when you're playing tennis outdoors and unfavorable weather conditions warrant making a choice.\n\nOne unfavorable condition is having the sun low in the sky and shining in your eyes, making it difficult for you to see. In this case, it's best to choose the side not facing the sun, even if it means relinquishing your serve to your opponent. After all, you wouldn't want to lose the psychological advantage of winning the opening game.\n\nAnother unfavorable condition occurs when the wind is blowing so strongly that it makes it difficult to keep the ball in. Unfortunately, there are many differing opinions on what to do in this case.\n\nIn my opinion, if you're good at generating topspin, I'd say it would be best to have the wind at your back, thereby giving you extra speed on both your serve and groundstrokes.\n\n3. Choice given to Opponent -\n\nMost tennis players don't actually know the Official Rules of Tennis and, therefore, aren't aware of this choice.\n\nI'm a decisive person, so I always prefer to make a choice when it's warranted. If making a choice isn't truly warranted, then don't worry... it doesn't matter anyway!\n\nSPECIAL NOTE #1: Please don't make the mistake of combining Choices 1 and 2. The two choices are kept completely separate because it would be completely unfair to choose to serve with the wind behind you.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE #2: Don't worry about making a mistake when it comes to making a choice. After all, tennis players change sides every other game which tends to even things out. In fact, it's only the opening game that's affected by the choices. Still, in the case of a hotly contested match between players of more or less equal skills, this could make a difference.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE #3: It's a very sad fact that the vast majority of tennis players haven't read the Official Rules of Tennis and, therefore, make mistakes about the rules more often than not.\n\nDo yourself a favor... Read the rules!
In Salt Lake City, the USA scored 10 golds, 13 silvers and 11 bronzes giving a total of 34 medals so I would guess based on the lack of home soil, a figure of 25 seems fair (as of 1648 GMT on Feb 12th 2006, the USA stands at 2 golds and 1 silver, giving a total of three)
It is a complicated math formula which gives points based on each aspect of a quarterback's performance ... completed passes per attempt, yards per pass attempt (not just the completions), number of touchdowns, number of interceptions. A perfect score is 158.3 and anything over 100 is considered very good.
They're not the greatest team ever.  But they are doing pretty good this season.  If they make it to the playoffs, then maybe even championships, they'll only lose to the Pistons.  But yeah, Terry, Nowitzki, Dampier, Diop, and all the rest make Dallas a great team. Definitely not the best ever, though.  I mean, Wilt Chamberlain and Michael Jordan, you can't forget them!

WELL OBVIOUSLY ITS ENGLAND, BUT HERE IS SOME INFOMATION ABOUT ITS ORGIN:\n\nThe Laws of the Game are based on efforts made in the mid-19th century to standardise the rules of the widely varying games of football played at the independent schools of England. The first set of rules resembling the modern game were produced at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1848, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury, but they were far from universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs were formed, thoughout the English-speaking world, independent of schools or universities, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club (formed by former pupils from Harrow) in 1857, which led to formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867. In 1862, J.C. Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules.

at meetings for the 4 9 back in their day....the great jerry rice could be seen squeezing clay in his hands...he preached that hand strength is the key to hard catches...throwing and balls againt a wall to increase your hand eye skills...cone drills for your feet and agility.remember hips low clean quick cuts...as for running... sprints are best for acceleration..try 40m dashes on the track and 30yard dashes with Cleats in the grass(cone drills should be done this way)..

Absolutely Not. You can have a professional train you. Or you could've grew up on a ranch and taught it like me, by your dad (or someone). I've been riding almost as long as I've been walking. \n I trained my children and I now train my grandchildren. They start learning by the age of three. My oldest started breaking children horses by the age of 7 years with my help.\n You might even get a job at a boarding stable and work for the training.\n But it certainly doesn't require college.

A ball signed by Willie Mays alone will run around $250-$300 depending on the quality.  A ball signed by Bobby Bonds alone will run around $200, again varying by quality.\n\nA ball signed by both, and then more will be worth much more.  Especially if it has any established providence (You can authenticate the signatures and any good, real stories behind it).\n\nAs for being a WS ball, it is not one.  The four players you named only played together for 2.5 seasons, 1968 (Bond's rookie season) - July 1970 (when McCormick was traded).  Depending on other players on the ball, you may be able to narrow it down to the exact season.  They did not make the pennant in any of those seasons.  If you want to cross-check some other names, go to http://www.baseball-reference.com and go to the SFG page and look at those years for the rosters.\n\nHowever, the ball still has some classic HOF worthy signatures, and if authentic, could be worth some.  Value for an item like that is only what someone is willing to pay for it at the moment you want to sell it, and a reliable collectables shop should be able to get you a relatively good value, and help you get it sold if you want that.

No man Christiano is fun to watch, eventhough he didnt perform in a some games this season, but who did this season???!!! many of the Man utd arent playing their normal football, they lost the sense of confidence, but they will get it back probably after they reinforce their team. I think the most boring at this time is Darren Fletcher, he isnt defending well in the midfield and isnt performing the kind of passes that are needed in the English leauge

Michael Jordan *had* to be better to will his teams to 6 titles. Magic played with guys such as Kareem, Worthy, and Michael Cooper - Jordan had Pippen, Grant, and Rodman (for a couple of years) along with some guys who knew their roles. Of course, Magic would have a few more rings if not for Bird and the Celtics, but I'd still take Michael, who became a better defender.\n\nThe below link shows a nice table for the greatest of the NBA all-time greats:

Custom League commissioners cannot manually adjust the Can't Cut List. However, if a Custom League should later decide to add or drop this feature, the commissioner can make this change through Commissioner Tools.\n\nThe Yahoo! league office reviews the Can't Cut List on a daily basis and adjusts for performance and/or injury factors. If an underachieving player remains on the list, it is because the league office feels his long-term value exceeds that of any player who might be available on the free agents list.

The length of the field (pitch) should be in the range 90-120m (100-130 yards) and the width should be in the range 45-90m (50-100 yards). Anything that falls within those limits is acceptable.\n\nThe only other requirement is that the pitch must be rectangular, meaning it can't be 90 X 90.\n\nSo all fields are (literally) not created equal. I think there's been an effort at standardizing the new fields at 100m (long) X 80m (wide) but I can't give you any more details on that.

the only real difference is the boxing sanctions.  theres the WBF(world boxing association) WBC(World Boxing Council) IBF (International Boxing federation) IBO (International Boxing Organization) and a few more.  They're just different sanctions for the purpose of making more money.  But of course there could be a boxer who wins the nationaal championship in his country, and then travels to another country and challenges they're national champion and wins.  he'd be holding national championships from two different countries.  which would by definition make him an international champion.  Hope i was of some help to you.

"Physical abilities are only part physical.... they are also part mental!!! Yes, training harder than her will help but since she is already faster than you chances are she has something else developed more. If she is a twin and you don't notice her as being more physically fit then the biggest difference is probably in her head. Try to create a mantra, something you repeat in your head over and over as a practice. Let this mantra be short and sweet and most importantly, believable! Try something like ""I'm better than before"", and when you say it imagine yourself doing just a little teeny weeny bit better everytime and because you believe it in addition to training, not because of training alone. Belief is more powerful than a week of training if you have a strong enough will.

First Powerplay is mandatory where the fielding team should have only 2 fielders outside the circle and two close in fielders catching. The next two sets are of 5 overs, where the fielding side can take anytime in the match after 10 overs. There is no need for close in fielders.

chevy starters have the solenoid built into the starter itself- located on the back of the bendix drive- replacing the whole starter is recommended - this will cure your issue. your starter if I remember right sits under the exhaust manifold in the front of the engine and gets extreme heat from the exhaust and will dry out the solenoid and bendix along with the rest of the starter.
Normally it is set up like the NFL's where the top four teams get a bye, with 5vs12, 6vs11 and so.  The winner of the 5vs12 team would play the fourth team, while the winner of 6vs11 plays the third and so on.  The other option is to allow those four teams a bye, and reseed immideately after the first round.

Every year, predicting this becomes harder and harder.\n\nThe good old days of knowing at the beginning of a season who will be in the top five are gone.\n\nLast year, no one would have picked wests tigers except there supporters, and st george looked dead and gone at the halfway point in the season.\n\nI think what the tigers have done for themselves will inspire other clubs and bring fresh enthusiasm.\n\nWatch out for Manly...Ben Kennady looks ready to lead from the front.
Sandy Koufax pitched for the Brooklyn Dodgers from 1955-57, then on the Los Angelese Dodgers (The Brooklyn team relocated) until 1966.

The above answer is partially correct. I suspect you're looking to get spin on a full wedge shot, or possibly some short wedge shots around the green? \n\nBasically you need to realize that most golfers don't play on courses that are mowed with tight enough fairways to get clean enough contact for as much spin as you see the pro's get on TV....they play on fairways that are like our greens. \n\nYou need to have a clean clubface contact with the ball, NO grass in between the ball and clubface. The club must strike the ball at a decending angle of attack (easier with a wedge). \n\nIt's easier to get spin on knockdown type shots....instead of hitting a full sandwedge from 100 yards try hitting a 3/4 pitching wedge or nine iron, you might have more success in getting some spin if the ball comes in lower.....it'll hop once and then stop....

Milan in the 1980s and early 1990s. He is regarded as one of the finest strikers of all time and scored 276 goals in a career cut short by injury, known for his strength on the ball, his tactical awareness and spectacular volleys. His grace earned him the titles ""San Marco"" and ""The Swan Of Utrecht"". Van Basten, who was named European Footballer of the Year three times (1988, '89 and '92) and FIFA World Player of the Year (1992) is currently the coach of the Dutch national team.\n\n[edit]\nPlaying career\nVan Basten played very briefly for Elinkwijk before Ajax signed him. He played his first game for Ajax in April 1982 and was proclaimed the new Johan Cruijff.\n\nIn 1987 Silvio Berlusconi brought Van Basten to Milan along with fellow countrymen Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard, joining them in 1988. In his first season Milan won their first scudetto (league championship) in eight years, but Van Basten played only eleven games and was constantly troubled by an ankle injury. Despite this, in Euro 88 Van Basten showed a dazzling run of form, including three goals against England and a spectacular volley in the final against the Soviet Union.\n\nHelped by his form in international competition, Van Basten had an excellent season in 1988-89, winning European Footballer of the Year and scoring nineteen goals in Serie A as well as helping Milan demolish Steaua Bucharest to win the European Cup. In 1989-90 he was Capocannoniere (Serie A's leading goal scorer) and Milan defended their European Cup successfully. The Dutch national side had a very poor World Cup in 1990, finally going out to West Germany in the second round.\n\nMilan's 1990-91 European season was ruined in the semi-final against Olympique Marseille and the club received a year long ban from European football. Van Basten had been banned for four matches earlier in the competition following a cynical elbowing offense. Domestically the club's season was also disappointing and Sampdoria won the scudetto. Van Basten fell out with Milan's manager Arrigo Sacchi and Berlusconi sacked Sacchi to placate him. Undistracted by European football in 1991-92 and managed by Fabio Capello, Milan did not lose a single game in the league and won the championship, Van Basten scoring 25 goals and becoming Capocannoniere again. Internationally the Dutch went out of Euro 92 to Denmark in a penalty shootout, Van Basten missing one.\n\nMilan stretched their unbeaten run into the 1992-93 season, going 58 matches in total before they lost a game. Van Basten played exceptionally well in the early part of the season and was voted European Player of the Year for a third time before his troublesome ankle injury recurred in a game against Ancona. Van Basten underwent another in a series of operations and returned to Milan for the final few domestic games before they lost the Champions League final to Marseille. The final was Van Basten's final game for Milan; despite enormous effort, he was unable to recover from his injuries.\n\n[edit]\nCoaching career\nVan Basten officially left Milan in 1995 and retired from football, stating he would never try management. However, he eventually realized that football was too important for him and successfully took a course with the Royal Netherlands Footba"

Steel is about 7850kg a cubic metre (490lbs a cubic foot). If you can calculate the cross-sectional area of the tubing (i.e. the area of the circle minus the area of the hole in the middle) you can calculate mass-per-length for each size of tubing. Then it's just a matter of adding up the lengths.

Your time has expired on this question. The above answer seems pretty correct.
I like bass fishing in cold water.  Here in middle Georgia lakes never freeze more than some skim ice, and that is unusual.  Usually the coldest water I fish is around 45 degrees, and most winters it will range from there to about 52.  These tactics have worked for me in that range of water temps over the years.  \n\n• Fish slowly. Bass slow down as the water cools.  They are less likely to hit a fast moving bait, so slow your presentation down and give them time to eat your bait.\n\n• Fish steeper banks.  In-Fisherman Magazine recommends fishing banks that have at least a 30 percent drop and 45 is better.  Bass like to move vertically in a short distance during the winter so bluff banks are good.\n\n•  Chose a bait you can keep in one place on the bottom.  A jig and pig is a classic bait for cold water. Crawl it slowly along and make it stop and twitch when you bump cover.  A jigging spoon moved up and down in one place works well.  Slow moving crankbaits and spinnerbaits slow rolled, or crawled, on the bottom are also good.\n\n•  Fish Deeper.  Bass tend to hold deep in the winter, so look for the ends of long points, steep bluff banks and creek channels.  They hold there until there are several warm days, then they move up into more shallow water.\n\n• Be patient.  Don't expect a lot of bites, but the ones you get may be big bass.  Take your time and wait on that one big bite.\n\n•  Dress for the weather.  You can't catch bass if you are miserable or if you can't stay out there.  Get warm clothes and layer so you can adjust.  Be sure you have something with you that will turn rain and stop the wind, too.\n\nI caught my biggest bass ever, a 9 pound, 7 ounce beauty, the second weekend in February a few years ago.  She hit a slow moving crankbait on a steep rocky point.  It was the only bite I got that day.  I caught my first 8 pound bass in a January tournament on a slowly moved crankbait.  I caught my second 8 pounder on a big spinnerbait crawled across the bottom, in a January tournament.  Both of them were also the only bites I got those days.\n\nGive winter bass fishing a try.
"""Fore"" is another word for ""ahead"" (think of a ship's fore and aft). Yelling ""fore"" is simply a shorter way to yell ""watch out ahead"" (or ""watch out before""). It allows golfers to be forewarned, in other words. \nThe British Golf Museum cites an 1881 reference to ""fore"" in a golf book, establishing that the term was already in use at that early date (the USGA suggests the term may have been in use as early as the 1700s). The museum also surmises that the term evolved from ""forecaddie.""\n\nA forecaddie is a person who accompanies a group around the golf course, often going forward to be in a position to pinpoint the locations of the groups' shots. If a member of the group hit an errant shot, the thinking goes, they may have alerted the forecaddie by yelling out the term. It was eventually shorted to just ""fore.""\n\nA popular theory is that the term has a military origin. In warfare of the 17th and 18th century (a time period when golf was really taking hold in Britain), infantry advanced in formation while artillery batteries fired from behind, over their heads. An artilleryman about to fire would yell ""beware before,"" alerting nearby infantrymen to drop to the ground to avoid the shells screaming overhead.\n\nSo when golfers misfired and send their missiles - golf balls - screaming off target, ""beware before"" became shortened to ""fore.""\n\nThis is another term, however, whose exact origin can't be stated. It does originate, however, in the fact that ""fore"" means ""ahead"" and, used by a golfer, is a warning to those ahead."

Art Shell has been burning to get back into football since he was fired 10 years ago. He felt he was let go unfairly (and has probably been proven right).

Combine that with the fact that as bad a job as it is perceived to be. The Raider HC job is one of only 32 in the world. Something that should not be overlooked.

"It cames from Maccabees (in hebrew the group of these rebels its called maccabiim it ends with im because is the plural name, if you talk about a single male rebel of this group is called maccabi) who were were Jewish rebels who fought against the rule of Antiochus IV Epiphanes of the Hellenistic Seleucid dynasty, who was succeeded by his infant son Antiochus V Eupator. The Maccabees founded the Hasmonean royal dynasty and established Jewish independence in the Land of Israel for about one hundred years, from 165 BCE to 63 BCE.\n\nIn 167 BCE, a Jewish priest, Mattathias, started the revolt against the Seleucid overlords of Judea by refusing to worship the Greek gods and slaying the hellenistic Jew who stepped up to worship the idol in place of Mattathias. He and his five sons fled to the wilderness. After Mattathias' death about one year later, his son Judas Maccabaeus led an army of Jewish dissidents to victory over the Seleucids. After the victory, he entered Jerusalem in triumph and religiously cleansed the Temple, reestablishing traditional Jewish worship there. Every year Jews celebrate Hanukkah in commemoration of Judas Maccabeus' victory over the Seleucids.\n\nThe story of the Maccabees can be found in the deuterocanonical books of 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees. Books of 3 Maccabees and 4 Maccabees also exist, though they are not directly related to the Maccabees.\n\nThe name ""Maccabee"" is sometimes seen used as synonym for the entire Hasmonean dynasty, but the Maccabees proper were Judas Maccabeus and his four brothers. The name Maccabee was a personal epithet of Judas, and the later generations were not descendants of him"

Both the movies and radio were very popular in the 1930's. The first drivein movie theater was opened in 1933. Radio was the main form of entertainment similar to television today.\n\nGambling was popular as people sought extra income - it was legalised in 15 US states. Board games were popular with Monopoly invented in 1935. Baseball was the most popular sport in the US with stickball popular. Stamp collecting was apparently popular. It was also the Golden age of comics with both Superman and Batman making their debuts.

DO NOT GET BIG FEET or snowblades as suggested by the person above, They have an incredibly high rate of injury on the mountain, most often incidents lead to head trauma. Person number two is right, you are looking for a forgiving flex, the degree to which it is soft for you is determined by your weight.  So don’t go out and get a super soft ski unless you weigh ninety pounds. I would suggest a low level salomon scrambler 5, 6, or 7 series, or the K2 omni 4.5 to 5.5. These will last you a couple of years and offer significant value and performance.

Yes. Not only does it stop the clock and force a player to make free throws (usually under pressure), but you get the ball back.
If you want to achieve the level of success that Michael Buffer has, you're probably out of luck. There are very few positions available for televised announcers.\n\nThose that are hired usually already have some kind of connections with someone high up in the group they work for. Even to do announcing at a local club you will need to have connections with the people who work there, but if you can meet them and convince them to give you a shot, go for it. If you ever do meet someone with betters connections, you'll be able to let them know about your experience and they might think of you if they ever need someone.

"While its possible some FEMA assitance was given to saints players (not likely, but I dont know the FEMA rules on that) the money your probably thinking of was given by the NFL as part of the ""pay for play"" adjustment in the CBA.  Normally, this adjustment goes to those players who played alot of downs  but were not paid ""starter"" money. The theory is, minimal contracts are given for backup players and if a player hired for just special teams/backup is moved to a starter position through injury or great performance he has earned to be paid along with other starters. \n\nThe Saints recieved their money for ""performance in adverse conditions"" notably havingno true locker room, practing under an underpass and playing a home game in NY."

Everyday. I am 23 years old. I can shoot with both feet. I can dribble and run as fast as slim boys. I am overweight by 30 kilograms, about 75 pounds. I weight 230 pounds and my height is 5'10'' (1 meter and 78 centimeters). I have a wide body from the pectorals to the legs. This made easier for me to dribble, the other players just will hit against my body as if it were a wall.\n\n   I also can header the ball with real strenght. The main way to do this is to run from a point were the ball is not pointed directly to you. For example, ask your friend (the one who is centerin the ball to pass the ball to a point in front of you) always have in mind that the his pass must be not really fast, otherwise you will not reach the ball. Then, jump curling your body in a > greater than sign form, try to get a good position before trying this jump. Next, curl your body to a smaller than position < sign form. Got it.? I hope so.\n\n   To shoot with real precision (accuracy) you do not need to hit the ball hard nor use your toes. Just hit the ball with the interior side of your foot. To shoot blazing shoots just run as fast as you can and hit the ball with the upper side of the foot. If your feet are big, try to inclinate your body to the opposite side the ball is being shoot from. From example if you shoot using the right foot inclinate your body to the left as much as you can. \n\n  There is another way to shoot really hard. Run towards the ball and while you shoot, jump so your foot will not hit the ground. Like this . /| (the point here represents the the ball, the slash represents the shooting foot and the vertical line represents the other leg, which is known as the point of support for your body).\n\n  I hope this will help you improve your soccer abilities. :D Maybe you do not need to improve, but I gave you these tips anyway.

"in sixth grade i was playing center field going for a fly ball , i called off the left fielder and he drops to the grass bounced back up and clipped me in the left leg breaking my knee and growth plate. a year later they found my leg grew crooked because it broke only half of my growth plate. so they took a chunk of bone and straightened my leg and stopped all growth in my right leg. well it stopped my growth at 6'2"" at 12 years old. i was supposed to be 6'7"". i also have size 18 feet."

If he can prove that he belongs in the MLB and his YOUNG team can get things going.... he could be an OUTSTANDING starter on my team....

Moon by far. Spurrier was a bad NFL QB who had like 20 more career INTs than touchdowns. He never threw for 2000 yards. Moon was a great all-time statistical QB.
His uniform number is 42, which has been retired by all Major League Baseball teams since 1997 in honor of Jackie Robinson. However, Rivera is permitted to use the number due to a grandfather clause, and he is the last active Major League player to wear the number. Given the many uniform numbers retired by the Yankees, it is very likely his number would have been retired by them after his career ended anyway.

Depends on the setup of the league - what stats are they counting, what is the draft like?\nBoth players put up similar numbers, with Pujols on one hand consistently having more doubles and fewer strikeouts, and on the other, consistently getting a few less RBI's, HR, and SB than Rodriguez.\nThere will probably be fewer RBI chances on the Cardinals than the Yankees, but Pujols is younger and is just entering his prime rather than perching on the tail end of it.\nAnother factor: there are fewer impact 3B than there are impact 1B.  In a six-team league, take Pujols. In a 12+ team, you might want to grab the best player at a somewhat difficult position to fill in ARod.

"I've been looking for about an hour thru internet and I got to a Toronto web page talking about World Football League, which I didn't know it was an existing league played in the States in 1974 and part of 1975.  And in the rules page, this is what I found.  Read, there is a little reference about moving the goalposts from center to end of the end zone.\n\nThe WFL had several important rules differences from the National Football League of that era: \n- Touchdowns were worth 7 points, instead of 6. \n- Conversions, called ""action points"", could only be scored via a run or pass play (as opposed to by kick as in other football leagues), and were worth one point. \n- Kickoffs were from the 30-yard line instead of the 40. Prior to 1974, NFL teams kicked off from the 40; starting in 1974, the NFL moved its kickoffs back to the 35. Twenty years later, the kickoff line was pushed back to the 30. \n- Receivers needed only one foot in bounds for a legal pass reception, instead of two feet in the NFL then and now. College and high school football have always used the one-foot rule. \n- Bump-and-run pass coverage was outlawed once a receiver was 3 yards beyond the line of scrimmage. The NFL later adopted this rule, with a 5-yard bump zone. \n- The goalposts were placed at the end line (the back of the end zone). At that time, college football goalposts were at the end line, but the NFL had its goalposts at the goal line from 1933 through 1973. Starting with the 1974 season, the NFL also moved its posts back to the end line.\n\nhttp://toronto.northmen.en.ogarnij.info/\n\nNo reference at all about a player paralyzed for hitting goalpost."
Usually when it's close, there are time-outs and foul shots that take up a lot of time. The team that is down by a few points in the last minute is the desperate team, and they will fight on to the very end.
With Palmer's injury after an astounding year, the Bengals may just regress back to the Bungals. They still have good talent, so the only way that can be avoided is if the Steelers fall off the mountain, the Ravens continue to choke in the middle of the season, and the Browns continue to be the Browns.

Welcome to the Sport of English Riding.  Are you showing Hunter rail classes or Hunter/Jumper?  If you are showing Hunter, you want to wear a Hunt Coat that accentuates you and the horse.  If you are riding a dark horse, then possibly wearing a light jacket will look nice, tweed color. If you are riding a lighter horse then go with the darker jackets (navy blue or Black)  Tan breeches are typical.  Tall field boots are the norm for adults. White shirt is typical, although I have seen the colored shirts shown as well.  If you are showing in schooling shows, not a rated show, you can show without a coat. Tan breeches, colored shirt, and half chaps are okay.  Check with the club you are showing, they typically post the riding attire requirements.  Show clothes are expensive.  Check Ebay, there are always good deals there.  If this is Dressage, everything changes.  You have to have a Dressage Coat, black, white breeches, black gloves, tall field boots or dress boots, and Hunt helmet with the bow on the back.  I forgot to answer regarding helmet for hunter, need to have Hunt helmet velvet cover.  Can be Troxel or similar with a velvet cover that is removeable.  I hope this helps.

A legal throw-in:\n1. Feet must be on the ground when ball is thrown in.\n2. You can jump.\n3. You can drag your foot, but it can't come off of the ground.\n4. Ball has to be thrown from behind the head.
I think so.That guy is gifted.
It is: http://www.pittsburghxplosion.com/
nope. in fact, im pretty sure it agined fans. Ad it gained players from different countries. The MLB is so different from the WBC, it couldnt change the way i look at the MLB.  Ive been a Knicks, Jets, Mets and Rangers fan since im on this earth. And besides for 94 ( rangers) and 86( mets) it has been a sort of hell-hole to be a fan of those teams. But even thugh they lose, i stay strong. Stay strong for the Americans and soon enough youll get rewarded with good play.
Logically in his mind, he feels he's a better player.  Therefore he should get more play time.  Nothing wrong with that logic.  Seniority is a fact of life though as unfair as it is.  I don't like to practice it in the work enironment but there are rare instances when decisions have to be made and length of service becomes a deciding factor.  Teaching him to roll and bow down may not necessarily be the best thing to teach him.  Has he pointed out his feelings to his coach?  The coach might take it into consideration.  The coach might even admire his confidence and try not to discourage it.  Throwing tantrums however won't get him far; a mature approach is best.  Making the coach aware might make the coach give him the encouragement he needs.
beginner or average ... not expert
Thanks for the credit, element.  :-)
Definitely not.\n\nBrazil will win it. The other teams I'd like to see in the Semi Finals are France, Italy & England.
Since you are asking this question, I assume that you are new to the game and so you don't strike the ball consistently all the time.  Hey, we all had to be beginners sometime.\nTherefore, for now, if you are more than 100 yards away from the pin use your 5-iron.  Inside 100 yards, use a more lofted club like your 9-iron or pitching wedge if you have one.\nAs you progress, spend some time at the range just learning to strike the ball solidly.  At the same time you will learn how far each club goes when you hit it right and then you can use that on the course later.  Also, if you think you like the game, why not sign up and take just three lessons from a pro.  He'll get you swinging correctly and you'll progress faster.
Yes it could but it would ber expensive and you would need some kind of servo steering system, dependant on size of boat

Afterwards, another stretch, and then any therapy you feel is helpful, such as the ice, etc...\n\nBut, if you have a structural issue, it may never resolve. It might be a good idea to see a medical professional to verify you you are not causing 'future damage' to your knee by virtue of toughing through your activity.

Length has nothing to do with the belts speed of course. Length only makes sure they reach all pulleys involved. The speed of any belt is based on diameter of the pulleys they turn and the driving forces (drive pulley) to the belt.\nOf course the more or wider belts you have the better the grip to the pulleys if high torgue loads on the pulleys are expected.

"I'm Mexican-American and honestly, personally, i think that the U.S. is better than Mexico at soccer. i mean i grew up in a ""Latin"" neighborhood and i understand both sides of arguments on who is better at this sport. Mexicans believe they are better than the U.S. at soccer for the same reason the U.S. think they are better than Japan at baseball, they are more passionate about the sport than the U.S. are. Americans are more passionate about baseball (or at least i think they are) than Japan is, but if you ask a Japanese Person the same question about baseball, obviously they would respond that Japan is better than the U.S. at baseball just cause they won the WBC. Anyway to make a long story short, U.S. is better than Mexico at soccer but Mexico is definitely more passionate about soccer than the U.S. is."

Joe Albi Stadium\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJoe Albi Stadium is a 28,646-seat multi-purpose stadium in Spokane, Washington. It opened in 1950. It is a part-time home to the Eastern Washington University Eagles football team and Spokane Shadow soccer team. It also hosted as the football site many of the Spokane Metro area high schools as well as many of the state playoff games. Although the measure has been contested many times former Spokane mayor Jim West began a proposal to sell the stadium to a real estate developer interested in bulldozing the stadium in favor of housing developement.

i really like smoke and yes, i do think that he is an aggressive driver, but that he has toned it down alot.  i think that that alot of the drivers are aggressive, but that he gets more 'flack' for being aggressive because of issues in the past.  if you want a truly aggressive driver, why not take a look a kyle busch?\nand no, tony stewart is not my favorite driver; that would be bobby labonte, one if the least aggressive drivers out there...
This is probably one of the most difficult things to stop doing for most golfers. One that may help is to think about keeping your right elbow (assuming you're a righty) closer to your body on your downswing.  This tends to promote more an inside out swing path.\n\nAlso, if you can maintain your shoulders in a level position, or have your left shoulder pointed slightly upwards, it will be difficult to get over the top as well.\n\nGood luck!

First of all, he was signed to a free-agent deal; he wasn't traded. Second, being a huge Cowboy fan, I think that signing him was a good idea. Andy Reid is too soft to handle players like Owens. Look at Keyshawn Johnson. When he left the NY Jets and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he left on bad notes. When he came to the Cowboys, he uttered little word under the direction of the drill sergeant of the NFL, Bill Parcells. Parcells knows how to control outspoken players like Johnson and Owens.

If the only handicap you gave McEnroe was one serve, I'd say Johnny Mac would kill them all. The fact is Johnny Mac never really needed more than one serve. With his wonderful slice spin, excellent direction, and relatively fast speed, John seldom double-faulted and baffled many good players.\n\nHowever, when you throw in the additional handicap of giving the women the doubles alleys to hit into, every single female tennis player you cited would kick John's butt.\n\nIndeed, each one of them can hit with enough angle and speed to not only hit a fair amount of winners, but also wear Poor Old John out.
They need to train with international coaches. India would need to spend massive amounts of money in order to lift its standard. Looking after the people should be a start. I would bet there are some from the lower regions (poverty I mean) that could compete very well given the chance. But to do that they need to be able to eat and train which they get no chance of.

Mid to Late 2008
"They will probably get conditional draft pick(s) for him. He is coming off an injury and didn't do so hot last season before he injured, so no other team is going to be stupid enough to invest too much in him until he has proven he is worth it. Where he goes, nobody knows yet, but I'm betting it's Oakland. They just cut Collins, so they have room in the cap to get DC. The thinking also is teaming up DC and Moss again will be great, but I don't think it will be as good as it has been in the past. DC is coming off injury and will be ""gun shy"" for the first season at least, and Moss is past his prime. He still a few good years left, but not great years. He's been sitting out games with injuries he would have played through a few years ago, and he is slowing down.\n\nWhat the Vikes need to do is keep Johnson as starter and draft a QB 1st round that they can groom. Johnson has 1, maybe 2 years left as a starter. Their running game is what is really hurting ever since Robert Smith retired. With all the money they have to spend this year, they can get a good back in free agency that can do 20+ carries a game (James or Lewis), and get some good defensive players for the new ""Dungy D"" or ""Tampa 2"", or whatever they are calling it now. The front O line may need some tweaking, but with Birk coming back, that alone will greatly improve it's performance."

It is the same but it is a soft cap, meaning that there are ways to go over the cap, like the Bird Exception which is signing your own players for contracts that take your over the cap, there are several other exceptions that you can use once you are over the cap.  There is also at salary level at which they apply a luxury tax, which I think for every dollar you are over that level you pay a dollar.
If Bonds is allowed to play and if he breaks the HR record,there should at the VERY LEAST be an asterisk next to it.

Go and get some physio therapy on you back and they will also teach you some very good exercises to strenghten your back.\n\nThis will help prevent future back pain and if you do get more back pain it shouldn't last as long if you have been doing the exercises.\n\nI know this beacuse I have painful back episodes myself and have had a lot of therapy over the years.\n\nWhen you feel good you tend to get lazy about exercise so try and keep doing the exercises as it's the only way to prevent or lessen the trouble.

no chance of a comeback... but he has the sympathy of the indian public.. afterall... what was the need of so much of humiliations he has gone thru... \n\nif the selectors had already made up their mind.. that he is not required in the team.. then.. he should have been given a proper farewell.\n\nnot that the people in power(Chappel & kiren more ) have spoken so much against him.. he needs to fight!\n\nand v'll all support him!

It's not a penalty or a foul, but it's a stoppage of play, like offsides.\n\nWhen you have the puck behind the red line (your half of the ice), and you shoot it to the other side of the rink (behind the goal line), and the other team is the first to touch the puck (USA rules, in Olympics you didn't need to touch the puck), then play stops, and there is a faceoff back in your zone.\n\nA new rule this year in USA hockey was if you iced the puck, you can't substitute any players.

The Lakers are better.
They are at different stages of their career.  Ponting is at his peak, his average up to 58 (the all time 9th best career average) and is the number 1 ranked test and ODI batsman.  Lara and Tendulkar are near the end of their careers, both with career averages down below 55.  Lara peaked in his first 40 matches with an average over 60, Tendulkar, like Ponting, peaked from 50-100 matches.
there is no golden goal rule anymore..what are you talking about its changed and for quite some time may i add!! you play the first 15 minutes of extra time and whoever is leading when that 15Min's is up wins but if you are still tied after the first 15Min's you play the next 15 Min's until there is a winner and then if not you go to penalties..
Yes!!!!  This guy is a franchise quarterback.  He was one of the best players in the league before his injury.  As long as his injury is behind him, he's worth way more than a 2nd round pick.  I can't believe the Raiders turned down giving up a 2nd rounder to reuinite Moss and Dante.
How far in advance do you need them?  Do you need guaranteed seating in a certain place?\n\nThe Pirates don't sell out, so if you decide at the last minute (like me and my friends usually do) to go to a game, just head down to the stadium and get them from either the box office or a scalper.  Typically, you can get them cheaper from a scalper than the box office because the scalpers are usually people who bought the tickets and at the last minute decided not to go and just want a little money back.\n\nBut, if you need them in advance, go to the Pirates website http://pittsburgh.pirates.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/index.jsp?c_id=pit and click tickets to buy them.  I believe you may still be able to buy season tickets.\n\nGetting the best seats in a section is easy.  The whole field has a good view.  If you want to be by home plate, try ticketmaster- it will show you on the map where your seats are.

KIRBY DIED????\n\nWTF is kirby????????
Oh my gosh I love to play soccer! I play it all the time...anyways.... in soccer you can't touch the ball with your hands unless your throwing it in. The object is to get the ball in your opponent's goal, and defend them from getting the ball into yours. There are positions in soccer like midfield, forward, and defense. There's also the goalie. Including all those people on the field, there should be eleven players from each team on the field. You are allowed to make subs, but only on your throw ins or on a goal kick. A goal kick is when a team is taking the ball down to the goal but they kick it out behind the goal. And a corner kick is like when the team is taking it towards the goal, but the other team stops them by kicking it behind the goal so they won't score. Man, if you didn't know any of that or  you still don't understand some of it....you've got a looong way to go! Wait a minute....you were talking about soccer(futbol) weren't you?
Um...are you coaching people to perform hoaxes, or to recognize them?

Definitely.  This team has hot streaks and cold streaks, and if they get hot at the right time, you can bet they'll be a contender in the NCAA tournament.  Plus, they almost made it last year, losing in the Elite 8, so I'd say look out for the Mountaineers in 2006!

Definitely the best modern day pitcher and probably top five all-time. The problem with comparing him to a guy like Grove or Young is that the advent of five-man rotations and relief pitchers changed things so much. Five-man rotations meant less starts and relievers meant a pitcher could run out of gas in the sixth but have someone else finish his win for him.\n\nThe problem with Clemens is he doesn't lead career strikeouts, wins, or winning percentage, so it's hard to say he's OBVIOUSLY the best ever. He has alot of Cy Young awards but that's just as much a measure of league talent as it is an individual pitcher's talent. Top Five in no particular order: Clemens, Carlton, Walter Johnson, Warren Spahn, Cy Young.

Only if the college All-Star team had about 6 mos of playing games together and had an offensive and defensive system in place.  They would also need a team of coaches to work them and define their roles.  After doing all of this, they would still only be as good as those NBA teams that have some of the worst records in the league.  They would likely still get beat in close games to a team like the Atlanta Hawks.  The reason is that professional teams are comprised of full grown men that do this for a living.  They are very physical and have played at this level for a number of years.  They make adjustments better and they know how to isolate another teams weakness.  However if the college All-star team was picked with role players in mind and was assembled as a true team, not just a bunch of scorers.  Then it wouldn't suprise me if they were able to win a handful of games over the course of an NBA season.  Usually in the NBA it takes a rookie player 1 year before they really get an understanding of how teams are defending him and what he can do to gain an advantage to help his team win.  Most rookies don't know where they are supposed to be on the floor and end up standing around watching the veterans.  There are a lot of great college players that played only one or two seasons in the NBA and then lost their jobs to another player.
"In theory, no.  The player and the player alone is supposed to decide whether or not to challenge a call.\n\nIn reality, we all can see that coaches and even fans can have an influence on decisions made by the player on whether or not to challenge.\n\nIf you watch the umpire, they will say ""It's your decision to challenge or not challenge"".  They get no assistance from courtside.\n\nBut just wait and watch.  Abuses will begin to crop up here and there."

If you're fairly athletic and have a good sense of balance, it's not the hardest thing in the world at all. Well, the basics aren't. But it's something you have to practice regularly to get really good at. Its harder than riding a bike and easier than rock climbing.
Ok, long answer.\nBasically, I just saw this on T.v. by the way.\nWhen you throw all the big stars on 1 team (Lebron James, Dwayne Wade, Kobe, etc), they are all good players, but that doesn't necessarily mean there as good or function as good as a real team. A player can be as good as he wants, but you need teamwork, and teamwork takes a while to develop you see.\n\nThe idea behind the Olympic team is they want to get the whole team as a bunch of young guys (Lebron, Kobe, Wade), so that in 4 years these same guys can play in the Olympics again, therefore building teamwork in the process because they would have played together before you see. They specifically didn't want older players because who knows where these older players will be in 4 years (Iverson, think of any older player, probably will not be on olympic team)

Very simple installation first do some research this is a common upgrade theses days compared to 3 years ago alot of company's make kits that are vehicle specific ... By a kit I mean you will get your tube with a flange already welded to it ...a BOV, possibly two hard springs , vacuum hose,snap ring , hose clamps and T fitting .. install your hard pipe or silicone sleeves into place find the best place for the BOV to to sit good clearance is something to keep in mind .. place your BOV in the flange use close snap ring pliers to secure the BOV to the flange now splice a main Vacuum to the manifold your tee T fitting will go here run the vacuum hose from the BOV to this T use hose clamps on both ends of the vacuum ... dont worry about tuning this since you bought it vehicle Specific  ... Installation instructions are also included

"The Tre Kronor (Three Crowns) is the national emblem of Sweden. Here's what Wikipedia has to say:\n\nThree Crowns, or Tre Kronor, is a national emblem of Sweden. Nominally they are three coronets ordered two above one which is present in the Coat of Arms of the Realm of Sweden. The history of this symbol isn't entirely clear. Most historians believe it was brought from Germany to Sweden by Albrekt of Mecklenburg in the late fourteenth century. The symbolism is in this theory believed to be a representation of the three wise men, also known as the three kings, that came to visit Jesus at the epiphany. Another theory is that the three crowns simply represented the three old kingdoms that joined to later form Sweden, Three crowns one kingdom. However, that theory is less widely accepted. Another theory is that the three crowns was leftovers after yet another failed attempt at creating a Scandinavian union and that the crowns represent the royal families of Sweden, Denmark and Norway. Swedes generally don't know any of these theories and what the symbol is believed to represent, and this is mostly a subject discussed among historians.\n\nThe crowns sat on top of the old royal palace in Stockholm, which was thence called Tre Kronor, and which burned down in 1697. Later, they were reinstated on top of the tower of Stockholm's City Hall, and (to some controversy) have come to symbolize Stockholm as well as Sweden as a whole.\n\nThe emblem is often used as a symbol of authority by the Swedish government, but other less formal examples exist such as the Swedish national men's ice hockey team, which wears three crowns on their shirts and thence are called ""Three Crowns""."

In my opinion the best British sports car is LISTER STORM 99'.It is the best because it has a great speed (200+ km/h) and Lister has a very good handling tradition. Of course, I haven't driven it but I read it in several magazines.One more thing is that STORM has won many races in it's class back in time (1999).

"The easiest sport for a rookie is definitely the NFL. If you are on the teams roster even if you don't start you can make a big impact on a team. \n\nSome of the greatest NFL players started out on special teams and have used that to make a name for themselves. A virtually unknown rookie aka. Samkon Gado can become a good starter for an injured player.\n\nThe hardest place for a rookie would have to be in the MLB. Even if you make the 40 man roster it doesn't mean that you will play in a game. In baseball if you are a rookie and you screw up you get sent to the minors to ""refurbish"" your skills until they become ready to play in the majors.\n\nThe minors is a tough buisness for a baseball prospect. They get payed less than a teacher's salary and often don't get much playing time. \n\nBaseball is by far a tougher sport to get started in, but if you are good enough you could be making in the upper 100 millions. While in football it is easier to be a rookie, but when you make it big you would be lucky to get half that."

I would go with the automatic if it has the capability of shifting like a manual.  Some call it trip-tronic, auto-stick, and the like.  This tranny allows you to shift without taking your foot of the gas.  I live in Pittsburgh, way to many hills and stop-n-go for a stick.
I dont think its fair because just bcoz of a short bad patch of form( those fights between coach and captain shud never be brought in front) earlier he is not being given the chance. How will u justify VRV Singhs place in the team without letting him play a one day match. He is one of the greatest batsman and its not easy to make 10000 runs in ODI`s. If you do think Ganguly is playing badly then please go out and try to hold the bat. We will see how many runs are being scored by you.\nP.S. He is playing well by the way

I don't exactly know, but you have to take into account all the facts.\n\nFirst, some players have been told they should use performance-enhancing drugs by those they respect within the organization.\n\nSecondly, when players were extremely good because of performance-enhancing drugs, some players were forced to take them as well so they could keep up with that level of play.\n\nNext, for a period of time, these drugs were not strictly prohibited, so many players were using them.\n\nLastly, there are many people who have denied that they have used these kinds of drugs, like Rafael Palmeiro, but were really lying, and no one found out for a while.\n\nIn conclusion, I can't give you a precise number, but I would say a good portion of pro baseball players have used performance enhancing drugs - maybe 35%?

"It's called a let. When a let occurs, the serve is redone. If the server is on their first serve and they get a let, they redo their first serve. That is why some players say ""take two"" when the server hits a let. The same with the second serve. But if the ball hits the net and goes out, it counts as a fault."

I do martial arts as well and the easiest way to go would be to take a hot bath and directly after stretch your muscles as far as you can.\nTheory here is that all your muscles will be heated up (not just the ones you try and warmp up through various stretching excersises).\nIt does take a couple of weeks to go completely flat.\nTry going down as far as you can and keep that position for as long as you can before getting up. the muscles have to become used to a stretched position.

"I grew up in northern Ohio, and all winter long we played hockey on a little pond in the neighborhood.  In some places in the weeds behind the ""goals""--which were nothing but little snow banks we built up--the ice was thin, so if the puck went back there we sent our little brothers back to get it in case the ice broke.  It was the price of being a rookie.\n\nOf course, that was 35 years ago; if I tried playing now, I'd be in the hospital before the end of the first period."
Depending on what you intend to do with the colt/filly when the broodmare foals. Breeding is not a science, it is an art or a highly probable degree of expectancy from the results, at best. \n\nChances are, by crossing a Tennessee Walker with a Quarter Horse, you will not get a faster quarter horse. With over two hundred disciplines, many horses carry their traits to their offspring and are bred for a particular reason.\n\nBy crossing the two disciplines, the Quarter Horse and the Tennesssee Walker, you may get a better cutting horse, that may be needed for farming, or a better dressage horse, where appearance weighs a lot in judging or challenging the grand prix circuit with a hunter-jumper, might be an interesting idea.\n\nHowever, the down side of it all is that when you cross breed specific horse disciplines, you may also be inviting a genetic inheritance that could effect the progeny. For example, it has been noted that many bred thoroughbreds  from the Bold Ruler blood line carry arthritis into the genetic structure off any foals born of that line. Laminitis, a hoof condition that caused the death of Secretariat, a direct decedent of Bold Ruler, colt-progeny, may also be an inherited trait, doubtful, but a possibility. Only time will afford blood lines genetic structures to be noticed and determined. And, even over time, one negative trait may disappear with the breeding of the progeny to another blood line.\n\nTo make any assumption as to what to expect from any type of breeding, you need to know the intended purpose of an owner of the eventual foal. In essence, the question is thrown back to you as to what do you expect to do with the foal from the breeding of a Tennessee Walker and a Quarter Horse.\n\nIt would be a good idea to check with the equine veterinarian within your community or any college or university to deteremine if the combination of a Tennessee Walker with a Quarter Horse will produce what degree of success. The University of Colorado has an excellent equine breeding curriculum as does Kentucky.\n\nRemember, you must first deteremine your intentions before you breed any specific discipline with any other specific discipline. And, have a knowledgeable veterinarian carry the broodmare to full term.\n\nYou may want to look into artificial insemination and genetic engineering before doing any seriuous cross breeding between the equine disciplines...Good Luck.

There are not a lot of people who get paid to play Tennis.  The only way to become a professional is to compete in tournaments.  Even then, you are not really being paid to play tennis.  It's more likely that the fame you win for competing in those tournaments gets your sponsorship deals with companies that sell things to people who play tennis.  The short answer is compete in local and regional events until you are good enough to compete at the national and international level.  If you are relatively young, plan ahead to attend a college that is known for it's tennis program and talk to the school's athletics association about scholarships.

"Here you go this should help:\n\n""The whole notion of growth being stunted by weight lifting is a myth. It didn't stunt the growth of Shaquille O'Neal, David Robinson, Karl Malone, Michael Vick, etc. They all started lifting in their early teens, and all have gone on to be well over 6' tall and star in professional sports. \n\nDave Draper and Arnold Schwarzenegger started lifting very \nyoung and both are 6'1"" or taller. Lou Ferrigno started \nworking out at 14 years old at the height of 5' 9"" and grew to 6' 5"" - taller then anyone in his family!\n\nSo the answer is no, weightlifting does not stunt height growth, or any other kind of growth, for that matter. There is no scientific evidence to support such ideas and, in fact, books such as the Russian, School of Height, suggest that weight training may stimulate growth. The latest weight training studies done on teens showed only positive effects. \n\nI'd also point out that activities such as running and jumping create forces on the body that are six to eight times one's body weight. The compression forces on his legs and spine are far greater in running and jumping than they will ever be in squatting or pressing over head. \n\nNot only will proper weight training not stunt growth, it allows teens to grow up with stronger muscles and bones, along with a healthy lifestyle. It certainly benefits any other sport they engage in."""

Azumah Nelson (born September 19, 1958) is a former boxer who was a three time world champion. A native of Ghana, Nelson is not a prince: He is not related to the Ashanti royal family. He is from a different tribe. He is from the Ga tribe. He used to wear a crown into the ring before his boxing fights.\n\nNelson also has endured personal loss: His wife of many years died during the 1990s of cancer.\n\nNelson's professional boxing debut, in 1979, did not cause much furor, except in Ghana, where he was known because of his family ties. Internationally, Nelson lacked the recognition for such an event to be given its due importance. With the years, however, all of that changed because he garnered world wide fame as a boxer.\n\nHe beat Billy Kwame in Accra by a decision in eight to mark his professional debut. In his third fight, he fought on March 3 of 1980, he knocked out Henry Sadler in the ninth round to win Ghana's regional 126 pound title. On December 13 of that year, he knocked out Joe Skipper in round 10 to add the African continent's belt to his Ghanian regional championship.\n\n1981 was a productive year for the young fighter. He beat Bozzou Aziza in his first fight abroad; held in Togo, and then he beat Miguel Ruiz in his first United States fight, held in California. He added the British commonwealth's Featherweight title with a five round knockout of Brian Roberts.\n\nDespite all his early achievements and being undefeated in 13 fights, Nelson was virtually unknown outside Ghana. Because of this, he was a decisive underdog when he challenged WBC world Featherweight champion Salvador Sanchez on June 21 of 1982 at the Madison Square Garden in New York. Despite losing that fight by a knockout in round 15, Nelson's stock as a boxer rose after that fight, and he established himself as a deserving leading contender in the eyes of many fans. Sanchez sadly passed away almost two months after this fight, suffering a car accident in Mexico City. Sanchez-Nelson was Salvador Sanchez's last fight.\n\nIn his next fight, Nelson knocked out fringe contender Irving Mitchell in eight rounds.\n\nNelson won all four of his fights in 1983, and he began 1984 by beating Hector Cortez by decision on March 9 in Las Vegas. Then, on December 8 of that year, he became boxing royalty by knocking out Wilfredo Gomez in round 11 to win the WBC world Featherweight championship. Behind on the three judges' scorecards, Nelson rallied in that last round to become champion in Puerto Rico.\n\nNelson held on to that title for three years. He could not fight for 9 months after the Gomez bout, but when he returned, he retained the title in Miami with a fifth round knockout of Juvenal Ordenes in September 1985, and then in October of that year, he retained it again with a first round knockout of Pat Cowdell in Birmingham, England. The Cowdell knockout in particular became a highlight film material: Cowdell was left frozen on the canvas by Nelson's knockout punch.\n\nIn 1986, he retained the title two times, beating future world champion Marcos Villasana and former Barry McGuigan challenger Danilo Cabrera (once again, in Puerto Rico).\n\nIn 1987, Nelson retained the title against Mauro Guitierrez, by a knockout in round six, and in a rematch with Villasana, once again, by decision. After the second fight with Villasana, Nelson abandoned the WBC's World Featherweight title.\n\nNelson began 1988 by fighting former Julio Cesar Chavez rival Mario Martinez for the vacant WBC's world Jr. Lightweight title. He beat Martinez by decision in 12 rounds on February 29 at Los Angeles to become world Jr. Lightweight champion, and then he defended the title with a knockout in round nine against former world champ Lupe Suarez and with a knockout in three over Sydney Del Rovere.\n\nHe proceeded in 1989 by beating Martinez in a rematch, by knockout in round 12, and then fighting Jim McDonnell, with exactly the same result. The fight with M

Because FIFA has instituted a rotation between the confederations in awarding the World Cup, the next time a North American country will be hosting the tournament should be in 2018 (Asia 2002, Europe 2006, Africa 2010, South America 2014).  As we hosted the 1994 World Cup, I would think Mexico and/or Canada would be the frontrunners to host that tournament.  I would guess that the next time the U.S. will host the tournament will be in the year 2038.

This is a complicated question.  They do affect one another, but not directly.  Generally. I (in line)is used on smaller engines while V shaped engines are larger ones that have to be built in a v shape to get them in the same engine room and generlly the larger capacity (displacement) engines have more power because of there increased size.  BUT there are so many other variables that these are very general guidelines.
Myoflex, Blue Goo, are both more powerful, but if you are also looking for something that doesn't smell like medicine you should try Arnica.

"With plenty of sun--get some black drainage pipe, the corrugated 3"" stuff.  Stretch it out in the sun so the entrance is higher than where you want it to exit.  I get about 10-15 degrees higher water temperature at 25 feet.  Helped us get in the pool a couple weeks earlier and stayed in it for awhile longer.  I found this on the web some time ago, the next step is to build a plastic box and use a coil of the pipe, may increase temp by another several degrees--I haven't figured it was worthwhile yet."
JAKE THE SNAKE Plummer (that was my Chris Berman imitation) is on fire and will lead his team along with Tatum Bell far into the playoffs next year. They have depth, and there under-rated defense is a lot stronger than most people think. They can stuff the ground game or Champ Bailey and company can swat down the passes (or just reel 'em in and go for a TD).\n\nWatch out! The Broncos are comin' to town...

Baseball is my favorite sport and Albert Pujols is my favorite player.
1934, I don't have a month.
Front crawl is the best for stamina and endurance- unless its done properly breast stroke is more of a leisure stroke.\nFront crawl is also good for working your lung capacity - try alternating your breathing pattern from every 3 to every 5, 7, 9 etc.

I've been cycling for about 6 months now and I can do a 10k in about 19 mins. And from what I get from all the people I ride with, that's about a nice average pace.  It can be done in about 14 mins, though.  So I've got some work to do.
The devil rays are stacked with young players in the majors and high minors and are finally moving in the right direction, but play in a division stacked with financial heavyweights. They need too much pitching help to make the Series having to beat out the sox and yanks, and even the Jays by the end of the decade. But at least there is some hope for the future. \n\nThe Pirates have developed a dynamite young pitching staff which makes them at least an interesting team to watch. The NL Central is not stocked with financial heavyweights and if the pirates can just get a couple of bats to go with Bay, and the young pitchers continue to develop they have at least a punchers chance. \n\nThe Nationals chances for a championship lie with whoever buys them in the future and their fiscal policies. The end of the decade seems to soon for them to win.\n\nThe Royals ...LOL..I could try and say something positive about them, but my Mamma taught me not to lie.\n\nThe Mariners also have a shot. The Angels have big money and talent in the division, but the M's could compete with everybody else. Beltre is a monster, Ichiro is excellent, and Hernandez may be one of the top 5 pitchers in the ML. They may have the best team of this group and the best chance of appearing in the World Series.\n\nThe rockies will never be able to attract the pitching it takes to make the world series. They seem to be taking a step back.
The Indianapolis Colts!! no doubt.  They have the best quarterback, Peyton Manning, (minus the superbowl ring) plus Marvin, the Edge, Stokely, Freeney... Need I say more?
Fishing is a state of mind.  I mean, who fishes primarily in order to catch fish?\n\nOf course people who see you fishing in a lake that has no fish are going to think you daft.
In the 1st Round, you should always draft the HIGHEST ranked player that is availible to you.... Since I dont know the draft order position you are in, I dont need to list names, just take the highest ranked player.... That is what you should do in the first 2 rounds........
they will need new players and a lot of rebuilding  to have any chance of promotion next season. it will tough but \n if the right players come in they might just do it..
Try the bulletin boards at eteamz.com:\nhttp://eteamz.active.com/fastpitch/announcements \n\nYou can also get a list of teams from your ASA and AFA affiliates and call around to see if teams are looking for players.\n\nIf you're under 18, I'd assume you're playing high school ball - if your school has a decent program, your high school coach should be able to help.\n\nGo to a local tournament, teams often post announcements about looking for players.  Your best bet to find a team is at the end of the high school season at this point because most teams are looking for players to compete in the summer.  However, it's best to find a team is right after the summer season ends.
The Eagles lost Super Bowl XXXIX to the New England Patriots and Super Bowl XV to the Oakland Raiders. They have never won a Super Bowl, but did win NFL championships in 1948, 1949 and 1960 before the Super Bowl came around.
Check with your local game warden. Many state owned game lands have wheelchair accessible hunting accommodations or allow disabled hunters special allowances to help them out.  The allowances vary from state to state but could allow you to hunt from a car, setup a bench rest, or have other assistance to help you get that big buck or your limit of small game.  Another great source of info are your state congressman or senator.  If you call their office they will make sure you get all the info you could want!
It just is not gonna happen in 2007. In 2008 or 2009 maybe but they still have too many weak points.
After John Arne Riise's power shot, the ball met Alan Smith's foot. He jumped bravely to stop the shot but he broke his leg and had dislocated ankle. BBC Sport had calculated that the shot from Riise was with 192 km/h. Alan Smith had successfully been through two operations. He is out of season and he's expecting back September.\n\nP.S. I am Arsenal supporter, but my respect for Smudge(that is his nickname)
many do have it.  Some don't because of interest and equalizing the number of sports with girl.
The Eagles all the way dude
Matt Kenseth. \n\nDale JR. is a safe bet. \nMaybe Kurt Busch.\nbesides those 3 the top 10 will be; Denny Hamlin, kevin harvick, Elliot saddler, Dale Jarret, Jeff gordon, Greg Biffle, and Jeff Burton.\n\nBristol is a hard one to call. A lot of time a driver could win by process of elimination.
"You need to know the gear ratio in the transmission and the final drive ratio.  Here is an example:\n\n32"" diameter tire spins 32*3.14159=100.5"" per turn, or 8.38 feet per turn.  Say the engine is spinning at 2100 RPM in overdrive.  Overdrive on my car is 0.74 (as showin in specifications for transmission.)  My Final Drive ratio is 3.73:1.  So every time the propeller shaft turns 3.73 times, the tire spins one time.\n\n2100 engine RPM * 1/0.74 * 1/3.73=760 wheel RPM.  So the engine speed is first increased by the overdrive, then reduced by the final drive.  The wheel spinning at 760 RPM will give 8.38 Feet * 760 = 6369 feet per minute. Multiply by 60 to get 382128 feet per hour.  Now, in one mile there are 5280 feet.  So 382128 feet/hr * 1/5280 feet/mile = 72 MPH.  NOTE: numbers have been rounded off.\n\nOOOPS--for a bicycle wheel do the following:\ntake the diameter of the wheel, multiply by Pi.  \n26"" wheel * 3.14159/12 = 6.8 feet per turn.  If the wheel is spinning at 380 RPM, then at 6.8feet/turn = 2584 feet per minute * 60 = 155040 feet per hour *1/5280 feet/mile = 29 MPH."
That would be sick dude. It might not work the first year but one or two years down the road this would be insane in the membrane. Forget Isaih and Larry! Let's have a mutiny and do it. I love Thomas on defense and Williams is going to be J Kidd not long from now if he keeps on at this rate.
It is a let.\n\nIf a ball from another court rolls on yours during a point, the general rule is that it is considered a let and the point is played over.
Dunno about wrestling, but in the bed, I'm a grandmaster.

Lowes chevy. Jimmie Johnson had nothing to do with it. Just sayin, I don like JJ.
Giant Slalom, Half-Pipe and Cross
Because they were fueding.  The lakers probably thought Kobe would be better to keep because he was younger, and maybe they saw more potential.
Buzz or Jerk baits work good here. Work the structure and cover, Bass like to hide and attack.
Boy thats a loaded question.  Bass bite at different things depending on water temperature and lighting conditions.\nYou should have in your tackle box at least a few of each of these in diferent colors and sizes\n1. Worms(plastic scented ones work best.)\n2. Spinners\n3. Crawdads\n4. Top water jigs\n5. Diving jigs\nThe list goes on and on. Check with your local fishing shop. they are always your best source of information.
Whistler has the highest vertical (5200 feet), and I believe Kicking horse is the highest at +8000 feet.  Sunshine, which sits on the border between BC and AB, is at 9000 feet. Both of these are FAR more than vermont or montreal areas (I think an big hill in the east would have less than 1000 vertical feet-not including tremblant).

Except in a keeper league with a deep enough bench, I wouldn't use a spot for any of them.
here are body kit sites:
You can soften a loss by making it close but you should never let someone beat you.
For the last time. Morrison is better. He can shoot, create his own shot(by moving and off the dribble). He is an excellent passer as well as a better rebounder. While Reddick maybe a pure shooter he lacks the medium game and can't beat anybody off the dribble. Against long, athletic, & lean players he struggles to get his shots a la Temple from LSU or those guys against Florida St. (his poorest performances of the year). At 6-4 he lacks the ballhandling skills to play point and can't guard. In the NBA he would see those 6-6 to 6-8 athletic 2's every night and would get murdered. His game is great for college but it does not translate to the NBA. He could be a shooter like Steve Kerr or John Paxson but that's dependent on a low post presence to draw a double teams or a dynamic point for draw and kicks. Shelden Williams should get a third of his points for creating doubles for him. Morrison is a liability on defense but he looks like a gym rat and will work to be a average one-on-one defender AKA Bird. But leadership and that assassin's approach to the game is what really seperates the two. For example, Jordan, Magic, and Bird are assassins. While competing they would smile in your face but drop a 3 with no time remaining, they willed their teammates to be better, and have rings to show for it. Guys like Ewing, Karl Malone, and Barkley could play but didn't know how to close the deal. If Morrison played with Duke, they would be playing this weekend. They said the same about Bird because he went to Indiana St. but the boy was bad. Just a thought.
No he won't get more then 100 in a game, he won't even get 100. I say 81 will be his best game.
Off course,we will win the world cup!SRBIJA!

You need to identify what's wrong with the victim. If it is a life-threatening injury, the most important thing you can do is to call 911, the ambulance or fire department.
a basketball for each with a team picture and their record on it. If you want to spend more add a pizza party.\n\nYou could use the computer and printer to turn the team picture into a sticker (you need sticker printer paper)put it on the ball and underneath write(with a magic marker) the record and year. This is something they could treasure for years to come and I have never seen this given out its usually plaques or something so this different
The idea of weight screws in a clubhead has been around for quite some time, the thing that makes the new line of drivers unique is that they're so much bigger and the center of gravity can be manipulated to a much greater degree, therefore you can change your driver to meet the conditions of play....example:\n\nIf it's windy you'd put the weight high in order to give your ball a lower launch angle and keep your ball from being affected by the wind as much. \n\nIt is not a gimmick, it does work, however it is expensive as all getout! So you have to weight that against any improvements you might be in line for. \n\n\nYou can read some reviews of people who have tried it here:\n\nhttp://www.golfreview.com/cat/drivers/taylor-made/PRD_321533_2948crx.aspx#reviews
Here's a link to the 1983 results for Boys 4A. On that page you can change the year, gender, and classification to see the results you want.
LSU- Glen Davis and Darrel Mitchell. Davis is 6-9, 310, Mini-Shaq who averages 18.5 ppg and 9.9 rpg. Darrel Mitchell averages 17.3 ppg and just under 5 apg. LSU has 4 players who average 12+ ppg. Plus they are in the Atlanta Region, not to far from Baton Rouge.\n\nKansas- One of the hottest teams in the nation is just coming off a Big XII tournament win. They have one of the best coaches in the ranks in Bill Self. The Jawhawks could be argued as the most versatile teams in the tournament. They also have a very deep bench, which averages over 31 ppg. Kansas also has the most stingy defense in college ball today. They held their opponents to the lowest field goal percentage in the NCAA.\n\nUCONN- With a starting crew that could someday all be NBA allstars, how can you go against them? UCONN has 5 players who average more than 10+ ppg and in total average 81.3 ppg. With that firepower, only the Phoneix Suns could beat them in a shootout. Rashad Anderson is Mr. Clutch; he can nail 3-pointers like layups, shooting 41.3% from deep. Rudy Gay is just one of the special players who can suck the momentum straight out of a team by making a big steal or a gargantuan dunk. Watch for UCONN to win it all.\n\nB.C.- The Golden Eagles were to points away from knocking off Duke in the ACC title game, and Beat UNC on their way their. With 3 players averaging over 11.5 ppg this past season, 2 over 16.5 ppg, recognition for this ACC powerhouse was finally achieved. If B.C. can wins against Villanova in the Sweet 16 (which shouldn't be to hard, especially with the injury to Allen Ray, Villanova's 2nd leading scorer), the Eagles almost cemented their trip to the Final Four. \n\nWatch for the Huskies to beat LSU in the title game.

You need to have a set up carve it is kinda the key to it all. backside 3's are the easiest way to go (your back will face the landing in the first 90 degrees) it is almost like doing a S up to a jump (goofy)<you are at the most left of the bottom of the jump carve into it going right and @ about a quarter to the top get on your toe side and carve left and pop at the end of the lip and you should get it. (you will take some bad falls so start real small )\n          Hope that helped.
I believe that the ban only applies to minor league baseball - the use of both chewing and smoking tobacco was banned beginning on June 15, 1993. (see link below) As you'll see in that article, the major league's players' collective bargaining agreement was seen as likely to block any efforts to institute a similar ban in the majors - in fact, the anti-tobacco regulations for minor leagues were written specifically to exclude any major league players who might be relegated to a minor league club on rehabilitation.\n\nThe NCAA banned smokeless tobacco in 1994, but one estimate suggests that 40% of all college baseball players are in violation of the rule.

They play army.  One team invades France and France raises their white flag and surrenders.
they haven't announced the schedule yet. But, usually its either the first weekend in april or last in march. It depends on if they will play their opener in Japan or elsewhere like the Yanks and DRAYS did last yr or the A's-M's were suposed to be but was canceled due to terrorism concerns.
If you just want a court to shoot around and have some fun with your 12 year old son, the slant surface shouldn't be too much of a problem.  I would say the most important thing is getting the backboard/hoop set up.  I would recommend an adjustable height style hoop.  As for the surface, put the hoop up at the lowest level.  The 17X36 concrete cement can be purchased at Home Depot or any similar store.  I would lay just a thin layer of cement, not too deep into the grount and let it dry.  Best of Luck.
A good source of information when new to an area is the local tackle shops. Most will be able to answer your questions, may even sell permits, or be able to give you contact details.\nThe Environment Agency is also another good source of information.\nAlso have a walk around the area you want to fish and ask any anglers for info, they will be able to tell you about clubs, day tickets etc in the area.\nHope that helps, happy fishing

"Jumping Rope\nWorkout Suggestions- change workouts to include jumping with both feet, one foot, and alternating feet. Jump rope 2-4 times per week. Alternate between the following two workouts: \n\n1) Quick Bursts- 30-45 second intervals at the fastest tempo possible without breaking your rhythm, with 1 minute rests between each repetition. Try 3 sets of 3 reps. with a 2 minute rest between each set. \n\n2) Endurance- Jump 20 minutes at a moderated pace, alternating your foot patterns throughout the workout. Set goals of 5, 10, 15, or 20 minutes without a ""miss"". Jump with a walkman on, listening to your stereo, or while watching TV. \n\n\nMuscles Worked- Primary: wrists, ankles, calves. Secondary: shoulders. SOFT FEET. \n\nInline Skating\nYour primary objective should be to reinforce correct skating techniques. Anytime you are in skates, hockey or inline, correct skating motions should be executed. This will develop good habits, not bad ones. Assuming you do this, enjoy a nice sunny day on your blades and remember to ALWAYS wear a helmet and sufficient protective equipment. \n\nWorkout Suggestions- Vary your workouts to include distance training and technical skills training. Train on your inline skates 2-3 times per week. To avoid dehydration and sun burn, skate in the morning or evening and drink plenty of fluids. Select a safe, newly paved surface. \n\n1) Distance Training- skate a 50% speed for 20-30 minutes maintaining a 90 degree kneebend. Try to find a route with changing scenery. \n\n2) Technical Skills Training- Work on your skating and puck control skills for 30-45 minutes. Create drills to develop your forward and backward strides, crossunders, turns, stickhandling, passing, and shooting. This is a mental workout, rather than a physical workout. The emphasis is on precise execution, not power or speed. Skills must be practiced at a learnable rate. Again, for technical skills training ideas and effective drills, call 1-800-320-7545 for our latest hockey skills training video. \n\nMuscles Worked- Quadriceps, hamstrings, cardiovascular. \n\nSlideBoard Training\nA training tool widely used by international speedskaters and competitive hockey players to develop leg strength, correct striding, and to provide a challenging cardiovascular workout. \n\nWorkout Suggestions- Vary your workouts to include distance training, quick burst training, and technical skills training. Incorporate slide board workouts 2-3 times per week. \n\n1) Distance Training- stroke a 50% thrust for 20-30 minutes maintaining a 90 degree kneebend and a consistent head level. Swing your arms back and forth to involve your upper body and to finish the transfer of body weight. Adjust the slide board to a challenging length. \n\n2) Quick Burst Training- Adjust the board to a shorter length. Maintain controlled strides, pick up the tempo of your strides to approximately twice that of your distance training. Three sets of three 30 -45 second bursts at 80-90%. Rest 1 minute between reps and 2 minutes between sets. \n\n3) Technical Skills Training- Complete, explosive leg thrust and upper body control must be maintained throughout any workout involving striding motions. \n\n\nMuscles Worked- Quadriceps, hamstrings, cardiovascular. \n\n\nRunning Steps/Stairs\nThis could very well be one of the best cross-training activities, one that simulates game-like situations, challenges you mentally and physically, and allows you to breathe fresh outside air on a nice summer day. Step training will develop explosive leg strength and quick burst speed. \n\nWorkout Suggestions- Go to your local high school or stadium and run 2-4 sets of 3 reps, 1-2 times per week. Each repetition should involve a 20-30 second burst up the steps, with 45 second rest intervals between each rep. Concentrate on exploding off deep kneebend, swinging arms front to back, and maintaining a level head position. Change your step workouts to include running every other step, or using only "
First, it depends on what kind of bike you want i.e road or mountain.  Road bikes are measured in centimeters, while mountain bikes are measured in inches.  Also, sizes vary between brands of bikes in both categories.  For SMALL size mountain bikes, I would recommend looking at Trek and Specialized for the best fit.  Others are out there but these two seem to fit small in general and have paid the most attention to size for smaller folks.  The same can be found for road bikes but there are also some road brands that have even smaller wheels sizes (650c) for shorter people.  That will often cost more and most bike shop people can help fit you on a stock bike (700c wheel size) with a few changes in stem length / height and handlebar configuration.  Other brands to look at are Bianchi, Giant and Raleigh.  These brands will all have a good fitting 50cm or 52cm bike that can easily be made to fit.  Hope this helps.
Train a lot!!!
yeah they are so comfortable you should get them
That's a good question. The team they fielded in 2003 was the best team they've had in 50+ years. I think a combination of heart and desire is what makes a team a champion.\n\nLook at the White Sox. I really don't think they have the most on-paper talent in baseball, but they did the little things it takes to stay close in games and win them.\n\nThe Cubs need a collection of players that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle and play like a single unit instead of a bunch of individuals. I think Derrek Lee, Aramis Ramirez, Michael Barrett, and Todd Walker fit that mold. The big questions are in the outfield. How well will the new guys fit in? People think their pitching is suspect because of Wood and Prior, but they have a very deep minor league system.
I have done both, the B16 is easier But the B18 has more power. you almost have to shoe horn the 1.8 liter in. I had to get new engine mounts for it so it would fit.
you can buy rosin at this place.  If you google some more you might be able to find a dealer that sells a smaller container.

The Conn Smythe Memorial Trophy is awarded annually to the most valuable player during the National Hockey League's Stanley Cup playoffs. The winner is chosen by the vote of members of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association and is not necessarily a member of the Cup-winning team. The vote is conducted during the 2nd period of an elimination game in the Stanley Cup Finals. If the finals is not over in the game, the votes will be discarded and the procedures will be repeated until a Stanley Cup winner is decided. The trophy is handed out prior to the presentation of the Stanley Cup by the commissioner, not during the NHL Awards the following week.\n\nThe trophy was named for the late Conn Smythe (1895-1980), a Hockey Hall of Fame builder and owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and as such, the trophy depicts the old Maple Leaf Gardens...

no, not as a direct bolt in. The Supra is a rear wheel drive car and the gts is a front wheel drive car. You might be able to custom fit it by doing a full tube chassis and using the entire drivetrain out of the supra and then adding the body to the chassis but thats a lot of work. hope this answered your question.
The jersey is probably worth close to $200 mabey. The cards probably arn't worth to much but could go up in value when he retires.
"Mayweather has been pretty dominant and is currently the top pound-for-pound boxer so it's hard to imagine anyone beating him right now. Though there are some fights that could give him a little bit of trouble, ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd has demonstrated that his power, speed and defense will still lead him to victory.\n\nIf Mayweather moved up in weight again to fight Winky Wright, that might be the end of his undefeated streak, but it's higly unlikely that would happen anytime soon. Unless there's a new prospect coming along or someone just gets lucky, I see Mayweather retaining his pound-for-pound status for a while yet."
"Tom Wills, a Victorian cricketer devised the rules in 1858. A letter by Wills was published in Bell's Life in Victoria & Sporting Chronicle on July 10, 1858, calling for a ""foot-ball club"" with a ""code of laws"" to keep cricketers fit during winter. An experimental match, played by Wills and others at the Richmond Paddock (later known as Yarra Park, next to the MCG) on July 31, 1858, was probably the first game of Australian football. However, few details of the match have survived.\n\nOn August 7, 1858, two significant events in the development of the game occurred: the Melbourne Football Club was founded, one of the world's first football clubs in any code, and a famous match between Melbourne Grammar School and Scotch College began, umpired by Wills. A second day of play took place on August 21, and a third and final day on September 4. \n\nSome aspects of the laws came from English public school football games which eventually became rugby most notably the mark."

Learn to float face down, arms above head in water depth you are comfortable and safe.  Start by fingertips hanging on to side if you have to, but eventually, this must be without support.\nTurn head, swing one arm back towards body along surface, elbow curved and turn your face up that direction just enough for inhale.

There is no minimum number of days the player must remain on the Disqualified List before the player can be reinstated to the Active List. A player on the Disqualified List does not count against a Club's Active List limits or its Reserve List limits.""\n\nBecoming “disqualified” translates into Soriano losing his salary for 2006, losing any credit for 2006 service time and his chance to become a free agent at the end of the season would also be lost as he would remain the property of the Nationals."

The best way is to keep going out there as much as you can and paddle until you just can't paddle anymore. But I'll assume that you are like most of us and don't have time to get out as often as you would like. Swimming is a great way to get in shape. If you don't have access to a pool you can lift weights to get stronger. For surfing you'll want to target lifts that work you shoulders. Military presses and flys will give you a good work out.

Running on the balls of your foot for short distance allows you to quickly grace the ground without fighting gravity as you lift your food back up again. Also if your talking about competitive sprinting you should check out the source to see which starting point is more beneficial.

steaua has good chances if they succeed over rapid which is the hardest opponent they can get at this round. After that they will probably have to win middlesborogh which is not the best team from england and at the final everything can happen.
Sure.  But I would probably go after a QB with the first pick.
definately number one!...he doesnt win them all, but no great champions ever do...its the staying power and the greatest achieved along the way that counts.

Jacksonville Jaguars!  I never watched football until the Jaguars inaugral season and I haven't stopped watching since.  Why?  Because I live in Jax and I fully support the team.
They'll be better, but winning 10 is a stretch, even though they're in the weakest division in the NFL.  Too many holes to fill, and too many new faces in the line-up to expect this team to come together to the extent necessary to win 10 games.  A .500 season would be a good year for the Lions this year.
I believe those hide the stitches on the leather.
First, add an egg to coat the glove well, second , add bread crumbs and cover the glove well,(seasoned bread crumbs are the yummiest), third, cover with aluminum foil,and bake. Fourth, take out after 30 minutes, you just hit a home run and dig in.   OOOOOO Yummmmmmy what a treat.

It really depends on which one you do better.  Both can be almost unstoppable, but most people who aren't really skilled at foos have a tougher time with angles.  But......blazing speed is impossible to stop if you're faster than anyone else (I can beat just about anyone anytime with my push or pull shot when I'm on and fast).  So it really depends on your skill level with each.  And, to some extent, the skill level of your opponent(s).
"OUCH!!!  I hope this wasn't something you did recently!  I've actually been pretty fortunate in that all my injuries have been relatively minor (broken toes and fingers, the occasional broken rib), but I had an interesting experience with electricity that I'd like to share.\n\nI was testing a piece of RADAR equipment on a ship and was following along with the Maintenance Requirements Card.  The card said ""Turn on the test equipment"", which had a metal ON/OFF switch that turned out to be broken, causing 110 volts to shoot through me when I turned it on.  I bounced off the wall behind me and, somewhat dazed, looked at the card again to see if that was one of the requirements.  It didn't say anything about bouncing off the wall and, in my altered state of consciousness, I decided that the voltage on the switch couldn't be doing the test equipment any good so I reached out and switched it off...sending another jolt through me and bouncing me off the wall again!!!"

Peyton Manning is the best all-around QB in the NFL.  Tom Brady is definitely the best clutch QB in the NFL.  But I'll tell you one thing, Ben Roethlisburger is coming up fast, not only as an all-around and clutch QB, but also as a fantasy QB.  But Manning is still the man.
I myself am a life long Suns fan.  Just the other day I was asking my friends if the Suns were cursed.  It sure seems like it sometimes.  But I honestly beleive that if we keep most of the team together over the off season that next year we have a real good chance at winning the title.

To kick the ball high get your foot under the ball and don't follow through when you kick the ball - stop your follow through just after striking the ball.  Keep your ankle locked (firm) and strike low down on the ball.  \n\nIt takes a lot of practice, so repetition is the key.  Try to find a wall and just practice striking the ball against.  Overtime you'll have this mastered.\n\nAlso, try to find a training partner, someone who is experienced, and practice with them.  Another good tip is to watch good players.  There are numerous ways to strike the ball and various techniques.  Through watching other players you find the one that works for you.

With biking you dont burn that many calories. It would be better to go out and walk for the same amountof time and you could do nearley twice the work. I suggest since I'm a rower to try a rowing machine it burns calories like crazy. Yet, for you I would suggest running over biking its a lot harder a better workout and you can lose weight faster. One more suggestion mix it up you dont have to do the same workout everyday. Bike one day and run the next,
Try every putter you can get your hands on.  Ask if you can use the on the putting green.  Heavy putter's for slow greens and light putters for fast greens.  Stay away from the putter that take all day to line up.  When you come across a putter that looks good and feels good.  That is the one for you, it may be $19.95 or more.  All putters feel different.  So, make sure when you find the one you like, get that putter.
They earned these past two premiership titles, but I see the window of their dominance closing quickly, as in next year might be their last year. Their downfall is, surprisingly, going to be their depth and ignorance. Chelsea has the MOST stocked midfield in European football. Because of this great young players have missed out on developing like Shaun Wright-Phillips and Joe Cole, who are crucial for England's National Team success in the future. These players would be starters on any other team and they will eventually leave to get their starting gigs. And Jose Mourinho will get canned next year after another dissapointing Champions League exit and his refusal to sign a world-class striker and stay with an immensely inferior Drogba. Also Man U and Arsenal are developing some great YOUNG teams.

Sounds like you know what you want already, so check out the various brands, and find out what they have in your price range, then go to the shops and test ride the ones you are interested in.\n\nIf you want to ride off road make sure your tyres aren't too slick.\n\nI wouldn't think that a road bike is particularly comfortable by the way, since it's primary concern is speed, it's designed for a riding posture that minimises air resistance, with your spine leant a long way forward, for comfort you need a bike that allows an upright spine.\n\nAlso if your thinking of riding down anything particularly steep off road, I would reccomend making sure the frame shape allows the seet to be lowered quite a lot. So that you can shift your weight back a lot, and also so you can jump off the back easily if you need to\n\nAlso tell the people at the bike shop what sort of riding you intend to do they would be able to give you further advice.

when you exercise do so in segments.\nexercise for 10-30 minutes, then take a break of 10-30 minutes. it gives your body time to completely recover.\nthen you can exercise some more, then break some more.\ntry to do a routine of different muscles worked out over time, so that you do not do all the same muscles all the time. try to find a amount of effort that you can put into your training, and then back off 18%-30 precent so that you can do training easy and well do reps. you should not be able to hurt yourself if you take it easy. it may take more time to get into great shape, but you will not have injuries to slow you down getting there. be careful.
"There are no ""rules"" for how you hold the racquet.  The physics of the game of tennis will determine the best way to hold it for a particular shot.  As for the backswing, again that doesn't really matter as long as your stroke starts down and goes from low to high.  Without the low to high motion you will not get sufficient lift on the ball to have it carry over the net.  The backswing is just a way to get the racquet to the postistion to start your forward motion to the ball."
no, i think that england gremany or some other european team will win this year. brasil is good, but they are beatable
The best method is takeing deep breaths through your nose and exhailing through your mouth,,slows your breathing down!!! Same with any type of exercising!!
This can be very difficult! However, when I had the problem I allowed the water to leak away until it stabilised at one level, then with care I applied a scrubbing brush at water level to clean the liner and left it to dry. \n\nNext I cut two inch widths of liner (in my case from left over stuff from when I'd originally installed the liner) and using a glue provided by the pond shop, I stuck this on all the way round at water level, leaving no gaps and smearing glue along both edges of the fitted strips. It took a long time and a lot of patience, but it worked.\n\nFinal tip: Lie on planks laid across the pond as you do this work!

"Everyone likes Brasil because they don't know any other team or players and say to themselves, ""hey other idiots like Brasil, so they must be good.""

And anyone who has half a brain knows that there is a big chance that Brasil won't win it all."
I guess because its become so marketable. I have seen it on sports show just a couple of weekends ago. I remember at the end of some paint-balling days, (to get a couple of more games in) we would shorten the field and just go straight at each other and it was good fun. The guns were old pumps and a couple of the new semis.

Postion yourself between and tyhe base you want the ball to come  to..  Get the outfielders to throw an strike over your head to a predetermined base.   From 9 to 5, from nine to 4 or 6. , from 8 to 4, from 8 to 5; from 7 to 4, or from 7 to 6.  Always get your pitcher to back up your third baseman in throws from the outfielders.

I play the 400 SZ and I LOOOVE the driver I consistenly hit my straighest and longest shots with it. I play it with a regular flex and as many golfers, I do tend to push it to the right, but usually I can correct it by the next hole. The Taylormade quad is also a good driver, my best friend has that and I've hit it a few times, the Cobra is more forgiving as it is not a tour driver like the taylormade, but you will hit the ball a tad longer with the taylormade and the weights help a lot. And the 440cc size of your driver makes it quite forgiving and easier to hit. Ultimately the decision is yours on how each club feels.
Brain Tumour.
The key to football is not like any sport. Sports are about using your athletic ability to complement the game in hand. In football you use your brain more, and in defence this is more so. People are saying your good, and this proves you have the sporting ability.\n\nEvery time somebody runs at you with the ball (which will happen a lot playing full back) have a think about where hes going, and when hes going to put the ball in the box. Watch the ball and the feet, and get used to thinking quickly.\n\nAnother good tip for a full back is practice coming forward. You may be a defender, but it is good to support your wingers. Overlap them when they hold the ball up and practise your crossing so they can lay you off by the byline.\n\nStay fit and healthy, because to be a good right back, your going to need to get up and down the pitch. Im not sure what level your playing on, but anothe good tip is to listen to your coach. He may not always be right, but discipline will reflect on the pitch.\n\nAlso, try simple training methods;\njuggling- control\npassing against a wall back to your feet- passing and control\nskills- if your up to it, watch and try and repeat\n\nGood luck!

"tough conversion. do-able, but will require custom headers, motor mounts, firewall mods, mods to the trans tunnel, custom driveshaft and of course, a new rear.  Probably the easiest way to physically get the engine into the car would be to use engine plates.  They will give you the most room to work with when it comes to putting an exhaust on the thing. oil pan issues may arise as a result of the stock crossmember, just be aware of it.  One or the other (crossmember or pan) may require surgery.  Working your way back, the struts up front need attention--the added weight of the small block may cause front tire clearance issues.  \n\nhammers, mallets, torches--they can be used to ""modify"" your firewall and trans tunnel as necessary.  Your trans crossmember will require attention to adapt the new trans.\n\nif you do the measurements correctly, just about any driveshaft shop can handle that part of the project.  The could probably help you with getting that rear narrowed.  I reccomend a ford 8.8 (readily available) + you can get decent axles, brakes, and wheels to go with it at a reasonable price."

Scouting is much too sophisticated today for them to waste their time on stuff like this.\n\nYour best bet is to contact a minor league team in your area to see if you can arrange a tryout with them...\n\nMajor league baseball is a business, and like most businesses, you don't just walk into the President's office to talk to him/her ... you have to see the receptionist first, who'll direct you to the President's Administrative Assistant.... same with baseball.  First, show a farm team that you've got skills, then they might let you in to see the boss, if you're not already too old...\n\nEven with these odds though, we wish you luck!

In most leagues, you don't need a backup catcher. It's a waste of a roster spot. Now, if your league requires that you start two catchers, then you obviously need two catchers. But even if your starter gets hurt at some point in the year, you can get Matheny (or someone just as good) off the free agent list. Backup catchers are a dime a dozen.

In the past, players who had dual citizenship or became citizens of another country were allowed to play for more than one country. \n\nHowever, FIFA disallowed this practice of switching allegiences in the 1960s and once a person represented a country at senior international level he could only ever play for that country.
3-1 to England from what I can make of this website
i like the concept of zone much more then man. it forces the players to practice and get better on their outside game. \n\nit also makes it harder for each team to get offensive and deffensive rebounds since all of the people in the paint at once. otherwise, having a really big guy like yao or shaq wouldn't really matter cuz it would just be like a one on one. too easy, more people fightin for the ball make the game more exciting. \n\nplus, if everyone had to go to man, the excellent pointgaurds in the league would have no trouble getting past their deffender and that would tempt them to be more of a ballhog. while talking about ballhogs and zone, zone asks for more passes then man and that usually helps a team get more open looks outide\n\nso overall, i would stick with zone, it has been working pretty good so far.

Atlanta was supposed to host it in the '04-'05 season but I believe that they're hosting it in 2008 now.  Phoenix was supposed to host it this year ('05-'06) but it was cancelled due to the Winter Olympics (which I wasn't happy about because I live in Phoenix).  Comissioner Gary Bettman said that they will host it in several years. Dallas is hosting it next year.

LeBron has the best chance at winning his series. Kobe has the best chance at having a better series. LeBron has a little more around him than Kobe does, so Kobe should have bigger numbers. LeBron is playing the Wizards, who play questionable defense and Kobe is playing the Suns, who play no defense. Look for LeBron to advance, but Kobe to have a bigger series.
Maybe the year after that....Newcastle have to get more defenders...and they have to rebulid theire team around good players like owen, given and parker...they might habe a chance

Parks are free, but manning them and maintaining them is not.  Consider the costs: paying the employees, covering their benefits, ensuring against worker's compensation, cleaning and bettering the parks, etc...  If you want a nice park to enjoy yourself, you have to pay for it.  After all, you are the one getting the use out of it (which thereby increases the need for maintenance).
It is definatley Ronaldinho. He is a modern style Pele. He has incredible skills and smarts. Just watch him this summer.

The shoe should come pre-assembled.  You will have to mount cleats on the bottom; these will typically come with the pedals that you purchase for your bike.  You will need an allen wrench (hex key) to tighten the cleats to the base of the shoe.  Ask your bike shop if the cleats you have will fit the shoe that you have.  If not, you will need to get an adapter from the shop or manufacturer or switch to a different pedal/cleat that is compatible with your shoes.\n\nHope this helps!

If you're inquiring about VISA's recent sponsorship of FIFA and all of their events from 2007 - 2014, then yes it does cover the whole world and the sponsorship is very true ... just ask MasterCard.\nIf you're inquiring about this particular promotion, I would have to say that it is globally true and valid due to the fact that Yahoo are also FIFA World Cup sponsors and are therefore subject to abide by the rules and regulations set forth by FIFA.

Gear ratio refers to the difference in the revolution that the engine does with the revolutions that the transmission sends out to the differential. It is commonly refer ed as the supplier first and then the output.  When the output is lower than the input then it is called to be an overdrive.  Personally i found it difficult to believe that a racing car has that gear ratio, and more if you refer to third gear if it is very high even for first gear.

Skateboarding is for losers, Basketball is way better
A player is in an offside position if, when the ball is played by a team-mate, they are nearer to the opposition's goal line than both the ball and the second last opponent. \n\nYou can't be offside if: \n\n\nYou receive the ball directly from a goal kick, a throw-in or a corner \nyou are in your own half of the pitch \nyou are level with the second last or last two opponents \nyou are level with or behind the team-mate who plays you the ball\nyou are not actively involved in play\n\nFor any offside offence, the referee awards an indirect free-kick to the opposing team, to be taken from the place where the infringement occurred.
"Everyone hates them. Thats their JOB. If you look at how those guys MOVE and wrestle, they are ALL actually pretty darn GOOD. Wrestling would be NOTHING if there werent characters that the fans could completely HATE (e.g. Edge, Triple H, Kurt Angle) Cant have a big time good guy like Cena without some top knotch bad guys to even it out. I laugh at the spirit squad because I know some male cheerleaders and they dont pull half the ""gay"" moves those guys do. Its a RIOT!"
As good a match Italy vs. S. Korea was, I truely feel that the best game was Brazil vs. England. It was the individuality vs. British soccer, and gave us a taste of what Ronaldinho was all about.
To be honest, I don't think any of them will. The posters so far have picked teams that haven't even qualified (Egypt, Cameroon). Most of the teams from Africa are first time qualifiers and don't have the skill or experience that more developed African nations have (eg. Cameroon, Nigeria). I think they will struggle to get out of the groups stages after the very tough draws.\n\nThe only team I can see managing even that is possibly Tunisia, and that's only if they spring a big surprise on Ukraine.

Prior to 1931, a ball that bounced over an outfield fence during a major league game was considered a home run. The rule was changed to require the ball to clear the fence on the fly, and balls which reached the seats on a bounce became ground-rule doubles in most parks.\n\nThere are also many other quirks, some of them described in the referenced link.
Important general skills are physical fitness - you must have the ability to run for the full 90 minutes. Another important aspect is positional awareness, players have to know where the ball is and where to move. Defenders have to know when to step up if playing offside. Other vital skills - ball control, dribbling, heading, tackling are all fundamental skills. Have all of these and you will probably make a decent if not brilliant football player.

"you can switch, but it will take a week or two before youll want to get in it so be prepared.  Let your baquicil level drop as much as possible, get your ph situated into the ""good"" range (7.2 - 7.6), then double shock and filter, filter, filter! Make sure you clean your filter frequently, clean and soak if you have a cartridge, chemically clean and backwash if you have sand (you may want to replace the sand but it should't be necessary), and clean and replace media if you have DE. Keeping your ph level ""good"" will help the change go better, so check it and make any adjustments BEFORE you shock. You will have to do this two, three, or more times before the water will clear up.  When you do see the water start to clean up you will want to make sure you get a good algaecide in there too, putting it in before your water clears up will be a waste as you will be loosing water with the filter cleanings."

The men of the NBA are among the highest paid employees on the planet, making an average of almost $4 million each for the 2004-05 season, according to the Players Union. The women of the WNBA, on the other hand, earned on average between $46,000 (says the union) and $60,000 for the season (says the league). \n\nIt certainly seems unfair that WNBA MVP Lauren Jackson can make a maximum of $87,000 per year (according to the latest collective bargaining agreement), while perennial NBA disappointment Shawn Bradley is guaranteed a minimum of $1,100,000. But consider the following: average NBA attendance is about 17,000 per game, while the WNBA brings in 10,000. The average NBA ticket price is over $45, the WNBA just $15. \n\nThen of course, there's the TV money. And in last year's contract dispute that delayed the start of the woman's season, the league claimed it had never turned a profit. While many WNBA players said they were disappointed with the final agreement, they did gain some new benefits, including the right of free agency and a less restrictive list of products they can endorse. \n\nStill, with NBA yearly salaries ranging as high as a whopping $28 million for Kevin Garnett in 2003, some may feel compelled to sign a petition urging the WNBA to cough up a little more dough for the ladies. \n\nHere's some WNBA player salary and contract info from 2004:\n\nJune, 2004: The minimum WNBA salary for players with 0-3 years of experience is $30,600 and for players with 4 or more years of experience it's $43,700. The maximum WNBA salary is $87,000. 2004 WNBA Rookies make somewhere between $41,000 and $34,000. Players on the team that wins the WNBA championship each get a bonus of $10,000. Players on the runner-up team each get $5,000.\n\nWNBA SALARY CAP\n\nJune, 2004: The 2004 WNBA team salary cap is $647,000. For 2005, it'll be $673,000. For 2006 it'll be $700,000. If the WNBA collective bargaining agreement is extended, then for 2007 the WNBA salary cap will be $728,000.\n\nJune, 2004: The WNBA minimum team salary cap is 90% of the salary cap.

Skydiving. You only need one ball for baseball.
He is certainly huge. The thing that makes Nikolai Valuev such a difficult opponent is that he also has a great jab. (Unfortunately, I have not been able to see it myself since his fights haven't been televised in the US to the best of my knowledge.) This, combined with his reach advantage, is enough to keep the distance against most opponents at the same time as getting in some pretty good offense.\n\nIf (and that's a big if) he gets to fight Wladimir Klitschko anytime in the near future, he would definitely give Wlad some problems. Of course, Wladimir isn't a small guy himself, though he would still be giving up a good half foot in height. The problem for Wladimir is that he also relies heavily on the jab, so that reach advantage (though not so great as Valuev has over other fighters) could become a major factor. I'm not really sure how this fight would go.\n\nI do think Sergei Lyakhovich has a definite shot against Valuev, though, because of his stamina and athletic ability. If Valuev gets tired, Lyakhovich would be able to take complete control of the fight.\n\nSince Valuev already has the WBA title, he's up there with the semi-name fighters already. I don't see his next opponent Owen Beck posing much of a problem for him because of his size, but I would like to see him against any of the current top heavyweights. Valuev is still undefeated with 43 wins (31 by knockout), so it would be very interesting to see if and how any of those other top fighters manage to get past him.

Well for the reason you just said. I am a S.F giants fan and one of the only main reasons i am SUCH a fan is because of Bonds. I have been a fan of his for 10 years, and i wouldnt know what to do if he left. I dont really mind all the steroid things, but thats besides the point. The point is that theres one aspect that you like about the team, and usually it is the player. I also like the Stadium, which has one of the best atmospheres in all of baseball. I know the Red Sock's fans are crazy and exciting, so the best way to get back in is to go to couple games. Just seeing others so excited will get you motivated as well. It works here in S.F. since a lot of people go to games and get excited over Bonds. But i must say, when Bonds leaves in a year or so, it will never be there same and it will be me asking your same exact question. :(

The only manager who comes close is the mighty Bob Paisley who took the foundations Bill left him and won a raft of trophys for us.  Fergusun, Wenger, Mourinho etc are all talented but they have (a) more money (b) more technology (in terms of fitness etc) and (c) more support.

"I couldn't agree with you more.  Pro athletes today are selfish egocentric pr*cks who think they are entitled to multi-million dollar bonuses on a yearly basis.  Athletes, like T.O., are so low as to say that can't live on x millions when most people like on $30K!!  The reason they run out of money is because they're spending the money as fast as its coming in on condos, strippers, and 26 inch rims for their Bentley's.  If more athletes were like Tom Brady, who restructured his contract trying to keep the Patriots team together, sports would be a better place.  \n\nI also feel that by paying these athletes the gross amounts that the owners do, sports are not competed at the highest possible level, except in football.  Basketball has become so watered down that WNBA games are played with more team skills.  NBA players are so worried about getting that ""Nike"" endorsement that they forget that they are playing a ""TEAM"" game with teammates to help them win.  If the players think its a one-on-one game, lets change the NBA to that and see how many fans show up to pay their salary.  Maybe then will they realize that they are not the only person out on the court entertaining the fans. \n\nOh, and to C Web and AI, I hope the both of you get ran out of Philly and I hope the door hits your azzes so hard, it knocks you into European Leagues so we never have to see your two ungrateful faces again."

Esteban Loaiza.  He should be good for a win.  Minnesota hasn't done too great this year.  Oakland has a pretty good offence, great defence and great pitching and bullpen.\n\nLoaiza is 10-8 vs Minnesota in his career.  He has allowed 54 earned runs has 94 punch outs, and a 3.71 ERA.\n\nHe last played against Minny in 2004 whily playing for the White Sox and fared decent against them with a 1-1 record and 4.09 ERA.\n\nHe didn't play them in 2005 due to being in the NL for the Washington Nationals.\n\nIn 2003, at Minny's field, the Metrodome, he was 1-0, allowing 3 runs on 9 hits and had an ERA under 4.\n\nHowever, All time at the Metrodome, Loaiza is 3-6 with a 5.12 ERA and only 42Ks in 11 games and 58 innings pitched.\n\nAgain, however, Loaiza usually pitches his best baseball in the month of April.  He's compiled a record of 18-6.\n\nHis home-away stats are not relevant to this situation as they are pretty similar.\n\nIt's a toss-up.  I really don't see a problem from having anyone start any games, because they're usually bound to get you a few K's and potentially a win.  All public leagues don't count losses against the scoring and only ERA is affected.  Being early in the season, most pitchers are giving up a lot of runs.\n\nGood luck.\nCraig

the only times i enjoy watching soccer is during the World Cup and soccer girls. The world cup is an adrenaline rush, you get to root for your country and you have a legit reason to stay up at 2 am in the morning to watch games. And soccer girls are so fine, they got some nice legs and they tend to look good. other than that i dont really pay that much attention to it.
The number varies anywhere from 330 to 500 dimples.
Yes it will. It is very popular with kids today. When this generation gets older, the popularity of soccer will grow along with the kids. It will not be the number one sport but it will be up there.
Does you speak English? Yes, then how about you go back to grade school to learn to write.
The NY Mets will win because the Braves stink now that they have lost Leo Mazone as pitching coach.

Catcher: Molina is 20-25 hr bound, so he's solid\nFirst Base: Konerko could be in the top 5 in AL 1st base stats at the end of the year. keep him\nSecond Base: Even though he's a Devil Ray, hes a 30hr,100rbi,.300 avg potential player. Plus hes eligible at 3b, so hes a keeper \nThird Base: THE WBC helped this guy, so either he couls snap out of last's years slump, or he could stink even more. I would go with the 1st option so keep him.\nShortstop: TOP 5 AL PLAYER IN ANY POSITION, D'UH.\nOutfield: Not the best out there (1 of these 3 I would keep)\nDye is past his prime, Hunter I am sketchy on, but Edmonds I like, especially when he is healthy.\nUtility: You can find someone better, but I woudl not drop Loretta\nBench: Nice bench, leave it alone.\n\nStarting Pitchers: Martinez is nice (especially when he is healthy), Beckett is good, but its going to be hard for him to adjust from NL to AL power, Lopez is a sleeper, Wang is a huge question mark, Santana is another sleeper, Washburn is good, but I would watch him closely, and Glavine is 40, so watch him closely too. I see u already know about C.C., but when he gets healthy, you'll be paid nicely.\n\nRelief Pitchers: I like Turnbow (especially at the pace hes going), but you could find someone better than Weathers.\n\nYou have a great team, but I would adress the hole immediately.

I think it is going to be an interesting season for the Vikings. They got rid of Tice, who seemed to want to be everyone's buddy instead of their coach, and got Childress, who seems to run a tight ship (no pun intended) (OK, maybe a little pun intended). They got rid of Culpepper, who proved the critics correct last season that he could not play without Moss. Yeah, the front line was not great (they kind of sucked), but Johnson was able to adapt to it, and if Culpepper was as high caliber QB as he thinks he is, he should have adapted also. Speaking of the front line, Hutchinson will really improve the line, and with Birk coming back this season, and the addition of Taylor as running back, their running game (hopefully) will be vastly improved.\n\nOne area that will hurt them is the loss of Burleson. But they still have some pretty good receivers. I think KRob may get the starting job. He started as kick-off returns last season, but step up as one of the go-to guys when Johnson took over. If they draft a receiver with one of their 2nd round picks, they should be OK in that department. And defense is an area that has really plagued them for the last few years. Now, with a new defensive scheme, it may take half the year (hopefully not longer) for the players to adapt. The area they really need help is linebackers. But, if they can at least play to the level they did at the second half of last season, and with the improvements to the offense, they may have a shot this year. But, I've been a Vikings fan long enough to know not to hold my breath over it.
They scratch it.  You dumb ass.

If you had the bindings mounted yourself, with your boots, the installer should have set the bindings at a middle setting.  You should be able to adjust the bindings about an inch forward or backwards.  You could check, there is a tab at the back of the binding that you can lift with a regular screw driver...lift and slide the rear binding.

Edson Arantes do Nascimento, or better known as Pelè was born October 23rd 1940. He went on to become perhaps the best player of all time. He made his senior debut for Santos in 1956, a month before his 16th birthday and ten months later he played for Brazil against Argentina. Pelè missed the first two matches of the 1958 World Cup, before making his debut against Russia. His first World Cup goal came in the 1-0 quarter -final win over Wales and he scored a hat-trick in the semifinal against France and two more in the final over host nation Sweden. At 17, Pelé became the youngest ever winner of the World Cup.\nSource-Sam

Now if your looking for a good way to raise money, I suggest you have some type of event on the par 3's.  One that seems to do well is having six holes in one green.  You put them all in the same area, make sure they are set up with flags.  The person pays $5.00 and wins a prize if they make birdie.  They get to chose which hole when they putt to.  Since you are going to ride around you could make a list of fines.  Any person or group you catch in the rough, hazard or what ever has to pay a fine of X.  That may be the best way to do it without making up rules that will change the results.
no way. let's say barcelona went to nou camp to earn a draw against Milan. but at the stade de france, its going to be a different ball game. i tip my bets towards Barcelona.
I'm particulaly well-suited to answer this question because I've been playing tennis for 37 years, I'm a nationally certified tennis instructor, and I'm also a mechanical engineer. So, I know alot about vibration.\n\nI can tell you with complete surety that tennis racquet vibration dampeners are absolutely useless. In fact, the only way to prevent harmful vibration that could hurt your elbow is to avoid hitting the ball outside of the sweet spot.\n\nWhen the ball hits the sweet spot, no vibration reaches your elbow because it is completely absorbed evenly by the strings. Since good tennis players always hit the sweet spot, they have no need for a vibration dampener. Perhaps that's why most of the better players don't use vibration dampeners.\n\nHowever, if a sporting goods company paid me $1M dollars to use a vibration dampener, then you can bet I'd use one whether it worked or not.

If you don't believe in yourself, how can anyone else believe in you.  If you don't have the support of those around you who don't believe it you, then you have to find it in yourself and realize you want something so bad that you will achieve it.  As hard as the road can be, if you don't keep trying, you are just going to prove all those other people that they were right.  Set your mind to it and try and your chances of achieving what you want will be pretty high!\n\nI'll beleive in you!

I agree...I think its funny how people jump on the bandwagon no matter what it is. The media doesn't like someone or something or vise verse. People are so quick to jump on it and beat it in the ground. Your telling me that everyone is Booing Bonds because he cheated. You show me any team in baseball that doesn't have 3-4 players that didn't juice up if not more....Bonds is a major attention draw for all he has done, if it was Craig Counsell it wouldn't make any headlines and wouldn't get any attention.\n\nI HATE BONDS....but people give it a rest....they tested him he is clean now and that's all you are going to get.....HE isn't going to admit anything who will when it comes to that stuff. Let him shoot himself in his own foot or let it come out in due time.\n\nAnd why does this damn league keep opening a new wound to every damn book that is published...you are just giving that writer more publicity and money...and who even know if they are not lying to make an easy buck over a high publicized topic.\n\nOff the Soap Box
There are jobs for game testers (see link below), but it's a lot less fun than it sounds.  If you'd like to be in the game industry, your best bet is to either learn to program or make 3-D art.  But keep in mind, the game industry is not all fun & games--it's really, really hard work.
simple here are the reasons per priority\n\n1- There is no commercial break.  Teams have to play 45 mins without interruption and this would only allow for commercials during half time.  The US is learning that there are other ways to commercialize this sport by having brands sponsor the team shirts and by having logo placements around the field. (Red Bull has even purchased the MLS team in NY and changed the name to the NY Red Bulls, very smart move) (you also have Chivas USA, lets not forget).  So this is becoming better and the sport will grow even more.\n\n2- The US has a lot of other sports: Baseball, Football, Golf, Hockey, etc... It hard to push one more sport to the market.\n\n3- There aren't a lot of points scored so you need a history of rivalry to make it exciting, the sport in the US is not there yet as the teams need a more impact history!!!  \n\nHope this helps
You can't.  You have to spend at least one year out of high school before you can go to the NBA.

It all depends on where you get your material. Remember to call and have all your under ground pipes and wires marked. To get a round shape I used a piece of PVC, it was probably 3' diameter, that I got from a farmer that used it to supply water to his fields. I just dug the hole a bit bigger than the PVC and filled with concrete in between the ground and the PVC. I Then Put a brick they sell at Wal-Mart around the top edge before it dried. It looks like its all brick. I stacked them about 3 bricks high and used the concrete as a mortar. Then about a week later when it was all dry I mixed up some more concrete and put some in the bottom (removed the PVC first) and let it set. About a week later we used it. And we used it a lot. We also had expanded metal Cut to the size of the pit so it can double as a grill. Just remember to have handles welded on if you do this. This is so when you need to add wood you can remove the metal with gloves. Smores + fire pit + beer = a good time. I bet you could get something similar to the PVC I used, like maybe culvert. You could also just do it with all brick. I hope this helps. Good luck. And remember to get it how you want it the first time. I ended up digging up the one I described to build a bigger one. And the second time around it was pricey. To buy all new materials it could vary in price depending on how you choose to do it.

"Champions League (More prestigious)\nAli sort of had it, but it is more complicated than the top four teams from each country league qualify.  The different countries have rankings based on how good the league is.  The top 3 leagues each get four teams, the leagues ranked 4-6 have three teams, the leagues ranked 7-15 get two teams, and leagues ranked 16 and lower get one team.  So the Spanish league, ranked number one, gets four teams qualified, while the Dutch league, ranked number seven, gets two teams qualified.  But then it gets even more complicated because they don't all enter the tournament at the same time.  The champions from the top 9 ranked leagues all automatically get to the group stage (32 teams in total), along with second place teams from the top 6 ranked leagues and the Champions League returning winner.  The other 16 teams come from previous round qualifying stages.  The link provided has a good breakdown of all the stages.\n\nUEFA Cup is basically the best teams that don't make it to the Champions League.  In fact, some teams that get eliminated from the Champions League in the group stage get thrown back into the EUFA cup competition.  \n\nCheck out the link.  \nThe second link shows the ranking of the leagues (scroll down to where it says ""League Coefficients"")"

According to an italian friend of mine it is a double sized shape of a man smoking a pipe on one side, and those two faces together seems to be like a bird.
Well, if its name be used, and any league qualifies, then I would say the champions league.\n\nit has the best of all the leagues across europe, all those champions fighting it out to see who will remain standing after the long group stage and then the pivotal knock out rounds.  Just look at the teams still in there (Arsenal, Barca, AC Milan) and you can see that, short of the World Cup and possibly the Euro competition, it is the showcase for players.

"Silver Lake Camp Preserve\n\nThe Silver Lake Camp Preserve encompasses a bog, swamp and northern hardwood forest upland. The bog and swamp can be explored from a one-half mile, handicap-accessible boardwalk. Along the way there are 15 interpretive stations that key in with a brochure that can be picked up at the sign-in box.\n\nThe spruce-tamarack bog section is acidic and holds sphagnum moss and carnivorous pitcher plants; the cedar swamp contains lots of ferns. Unlike marshes, bogs provide limited opportunities for plants and wildlife. Among the bird species present in the wetlands are Olive-Sided Flycatchers, Hermit Thrushes and Maryland Warblers.\n\nA good insect repellant or head net, especially at this time of year, will add to your comfort while walking above the wetlands.\n\nThe upland section is characterized by northern hardwoods and hemlocks and includes a view of Silver Lake from a ridge. There are a couple of miles of trails in the Preserve, 61 total acres owned by the Nature Conservancy.\n\nTo get there from AuSable Forks, take the Silver Lake Road to the ""Y"" at Silver Lake. Turn left and drive about a mile to the Old Hawkeye Road. Take a left; the Preserve sign is on the right a short way down the road. From Route 3 in Clayburg, take the Silver Lake Road to the ""Y"" and turn right, then proceed as above."
Ive always liked using shaving cream. Glove oil is oil based, while shaving cream is water based, so the shaving cream will evaporate, leaving the glove softer. After that, I put a ball in my glove and wrap it in a rubber band... the classic trick.

Presuming a player is currently under contract to a club, that club have the right to enforce that contract for it's duration.\n\nShould another club want that player they can offer to buy him from his current club - this offer will normally take the form of a cash bid, but the exact nature of it is entirely up to the clubs concerned. The club can then decide to accept or reject that bid.\n\nShould they accept the bid and decide they want to sell the player, it is then up to the player what they want to do. As they have a contract with the club, they can decide to stay where they are, or they can decide to move.\n\nThe top players can attract bids huge bids from other teams, but the counter side is that when a player is out of contract they are free to sign a new contract with any club they like.\n\nFor this reason most clubs try to prevent their players reaching the last year or 2 of their contract, and if a player won't sign a new one by this stage they will seek to sell him to another club while they still have some value left.\n\nThis is just an overview, and many more complex rules exist particularly in relation to younger players, and when transfers can actually take place.

Do not trade A-Rod for Vlad.  A-Rod is just heating up.  Also, A-Rod plays 3B, a much thinner position than OF.  If you have a great backup 3B and a serious need for an OF, then maybe you should do it, but you should be able to get a little bit better of a deal (maybe an extra player that can contribute).
Whether you like it or not, the winner's gonna be Brasil!\n\nDream Semi's - England/Italy & France/Brasil
I think they have a real chance. Germany will qualify for sure, and then it's a toss-up between Ecu, Pol, and Costa Rica. I think that if Ecuador play well their strategy, they will definitely be able to handle Poland and Costa Rica.
"Our little league team plays a nice form of dodge ball where they roll the ball and try to get it past the other team. If they get it past, the person who missed it has to sit down. They do this to train the kids to feild ground balls.\n\nFreeze tag is fun, too.\n\nMy 8 year old just told me her favorite game is ""Snowball USA"". No teams. You need soft balls - less than the number of kids. It's like a snowball fight. But if you get hit, you aren't out, but you have to play on your butt. If you catch a ball instead of getting hit with it, you can stand up, and if you hit someone with a ball you can stand up.\nIf you hit someone in the head or other sensitive areas, you are out. :-)\n\nThey also bought mini erasers in a tiny bag and hid them in the sand area and the kids had to dig for them. It probably cost them 5 cents per kid and the kids spent a LONG time digging for them.\n\nHave fun! It's GREAT that you do this!"

"Don't worry about your total score, especially while playing.  You should just focus on each shot one at a time and at the end of the round, add em up and see what you got.\n\nThe important thing is to have fun and enjoy the game.\n\nThe one advice I can give you is to allocate at least 50% of your practice time to your short game.  Specifically, 100 yards in.  This is were you will shave off the most stokes.  Improve your short game now, so that when your body matures and your start hitting the ball farther, your scores will begin to improve dramatically.\n\nI would also recommend reading ""Golf is not a game of perfect"" by Dr. Bob Rotella.  This is an awesome book that talks about the psychology of the game and course management.\n\nIf you practice smartly now, it will pay big dividends down the road.\n\nBy the way, I am currently 37 and carry 0.2 USGA handicap index.  I started playing when I was 12 and when I was 14, I was playing bogie golf (shooting 45ish for 9 holes and 90ish for 18).  I used the practice strategy I mentioned above and when I was approximately 16 or 17, I went from driving the ball from around 240 yards up to 300 yards.  During that same time frame, my score dropped from the mid 80s down to the low 70s.  This literally happened over the course of a couple months.  I went on to play high school  and college golf.\n\nAnyway, just have fun, keep a good attitude and enjoy the outdoors.  Best of luck,"

Rooney was saying how much he admires Riquelme and wants him to come to OT. Plus Fergie has been to watch him play, Villereal are rumoured to be OK to release him and Riquelme has said that he admires United's players - so I think he will come. He will be a great creative playmaking addition, but United still need a defensive midfielder, so they might go for Duscher. I think Diarra is off the list now though thanks to their greedy owner saying he will be more expensive than (the overpriced) Essien. Essien cost 24 million - I don't think United can pay that much.

May 19th is indeed the day Kane's movie (See No Evil) will be released. May 19th is supposedly the day Kane was burned during a fire the Undertaker started when they were kids (according to the storyline). May 19th is also a Friday, with a rumor of Kane moving to Smackdown! to take Rey Mysterio's World Heavyweight Title.\n\nTo correct a mistake in a previous answer, Glenn Jacobs has been the only one to play the Kane character (aside from the times Taker played him for a 'cahoots' storyline). Rhino in TNA could not have played Kane prior to the demasking, as Rhino is not tall enough to have played Kane.

Football is a team game. Its need 100% team-effort to win a vital match. It is true that the world best players are playing for Real Madrid, but maximum of them are aged. They are now not as good as they had before four years. So the efficency of team is quite low than other renowned team like Barcilona, Villareal, Real Jaragoja, AC & Inter Milan, Juventas, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, Man United, Benfica etc. Not only that, the ego problem is also ruin the team efforts of Real Madrid. The coach is unable to control those super stars. The Real Madrid Management have change their coach several times in recent past. I hope they will overcoma this problem and contract with some young star footballer like Henri, C. Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Kaka, Mesi, Balack, etc. in future.

Interesting question.  I think guys like male sports because they can relate to male sports.  Also, I think more women like male sports too..based on media coverage and popularity.  An example is the professional soccer league for women which did not get enough popularity and failed..I still think women are not as enthuisastic to watch some sports. I hope this will change in the future.

Serena has bigger muscles, so she is stronger.
Winter Olympic sports involve things like ice, snow, or both.  Hockey, Skying (distance jump, slalom, and cross-country), and figure skating need either one of the two. Gymnastics does not need ice or snow, and it does not need cold weather to be practiced.  Besides, the hosting nations and the International Olympic Committee make more money by having two Olympic sporting events every two years instead of just one big event every four years.
I think they should get rid of him and get a new forward like Shevchenko or Eto'o, Cisse should go back to France to play.

Most runs scored in a game (since 1900):\n\nOne team: 29. (tie) Boston Red Sox vs. St. Louis Browns, June 8, 1950\nChicago White Sox vs. Oakland A's, April 23, 1955\n\nTwo teams: 49. Chicago Cubs beat the Philadelphia Phillies, 26–23 on Aug. 25, 1922, at Wrigley Field (then Cubs Park) in Chicago.

I love Henry, he is the best striker in the world, and Arsenal are my favorite squad, but I don't like the French team to go deep enough into the tournament for him to win the award.  I think someone like Robben or van Nistelrooy from the Netherlands or Wayne Rooney could pull it off.

Conservation Department, but Carp does not always do the job, and insures you will have fewer other fish.
i think the bluejays are doing quite good this year. They have like 7 or 8 comeback wins already. The power in wells and glaus are really impressive (clutch power that is). Pitching has not been as good as advertised. I just dont trust Burnett, and Towers I think the league has figured him out. The bullpen is doing great with Ryan and Speier.\nHitting is getting us wins so far. But we cant rely on it much longer. Cause we're going to get cold, pitching needs to step it up.

I saw a report somewhere recently that Duke has most number of NBA players currently active compared to other schools, which pleased me, but was surprising.  I didn't know Shavlick Randolph was on the 76'ers roster, cool.  Anyway, the media would have people believe that NBA GMs will be high on Sheldon Williams based on the recent success of other Duke big man alums in Carlos Boozer and Elton Brand.  Personally I think the Landlord (Williams) merits considerable consideration for his accomplishment over his college career including multiple defensive player of the year accolades as well as being only the 3rd collegiate player to amass so many rebounds, points, and blocked shots in a season.  I think Williams' accomplishments on the court get overlooked because of all the attention on Reddick.\n\nAll that said, Sheldon Williams should be a definite lottery pick.  I really wouldn't be too surpised if Portland (the worse team in the NBA) had the #1 pick and took Williams.  But then again I could understand Portland taking local, collegiate All-American Adam Morrison for both the player and the fan support.\n\nSo I'll go with the Hawks at #4 (based on present overall standings) overall taking the Landlord.  The Hawks have their backcourt set fairly well, but they need a strong prescence inside and Williams should make an instant contribution, potentially starting from the 1st day.\n\nJ.J. Reddick is a bit more difficult to project in terms of figuring out what NBA GMs might think about him.  On one hand if you believe the media then Reddick is going to fall to around the 20th slot.  I wonder when the last time the College Player of the Year fell out of the lottery.  I've heard critics say Reddick can't create his shot, he's too slow, he can't play defense, he's one dimensional, all to which I say is bogus.  Reddick is extremely talented with near unlimited range, a player in the mold of Reggie Miller or Ray Allen.  In the present NBA where jump shooters are in the minority, whomever drafts Reddick will be getting a steal.\n\nThat all said, looking over the draft board, it would make the most sense for the Charolette Bobcats to take Reddick at #3 overall.  The Bobcats are presently lacking outside scoring, as well as someone that can run with ex-Tarheel Raymond Felton.  How scary fun would the Bobcats be at least from a publicity draw to feature a roster of some of the best Duke and UNC alums...?  Very.
I agree with you about Geo. Mason.  Kudos Patriots!\n\nI think the biggest moment in basketball came when Michigan State played Indiana State in the finals of the 1979 NCAA tournament.

I gotta say Francesco Totti has impressed me beyond belief. He carried Roma through the hard times, until they set the new Serie A record with 11 consecutive wins. He did not have any lapses in judgement and discipline as in seasons past, and showed he has grown into a true champion. \n\nWhen he complained about being tackled too much, they called him a baby, and 2 weeks later he got that serious injury. Despite that, he supported Roma's players who were shocked from the loss of their captain, and pushed them on from the sidelines. He also forgave the player who injured him right away, showing everyone that he is a real man.
their first choice is Vince Young, if he is not on the table, then they will draft A.J. Hawk, in the event that both players are gone by 7, the Raiders may draft Huff from Texas.

"The Pistons were a great team that year (2004), but the Lakers had a good chance to beat them with the team they had.... But Malone, of all people, was injured in the finals and was ineffective.\n\nMalone took just a bit of a salary cut in 2004, down to $1.5 million (after making over $19 million - that's nineteen million - in 2003).\n\nI probably would have done the same thing as Malone. Karl Malone had already made over $100 million in his career, and the only other thing he wanted was a championship. It almost worked.\n\nThe amazing thing about his injury is that, in his 19 year career, he only missed 9 games, and I think 2 or 3 of those were because of suspensions, not injuries.  \n\nHe picked the wrong time to get hurt, but even though the Lakers tried to assemble ""the greatest team ever"" that year, the Pistons were at the top of their game by the time the finals arrived, and they deserved to win it all.\n\nThat year, the Lakers were seemingly able to come back from any defecit (they in fact overcame a huge defecit in game 2 of the finals), and this caused them to sometimes become complacent, which you can NOT afford to to against a team as defensively strong as the Pistons. (This was the year that the Lakers came from way down to beat the Spurs in one of the playoff games, when Derek Fisher threw in that off balance jumper with less than a second left to win the game).\n\nBut to literally answer your question, I wouldn't say Malone got 'burned' by leaving the Jazz, as the Jazz weren't going to win it all anyway... the Lakers appeared to be his best shot. Acquiring Gary Payton and Malone, to join Kobe and Shaq, the Lakers did in fact have 4 Hall of Famers on the floor... and Malone was not interested in his personal stats (had he stayed in Utah, he might have become the NBA's all time leading scorer, rather than remaining 2nd behind Kareem Abdul Jabbar). He just wanted a ring.\n\nBut even though the Lakers had a good record that year (56-26, they started the season at 18-3, then lost 2 in a row, they were 20-5 at one point) they were still a bit inconsistent, as Gary Payton never fully adjusted to playing the triangle offense.\n\nKarl Malone might have been the hardest working player in the history of the NBA, not to mention being the 2nd most durable after Wilt Chamberlain. I'm sure if he had to do it again, he would make the same decision."

Most low-level players like Bard doesn't have great value, unless they get better down the road.  For now, I could see paying $10-$20 for it.  If he stays the way he is, so won't the value of it.

Yes the is a difference. Besides the size of the ball, the distance between the bases are shorter and you can only throw underhand pitches. Other than that the rules are the same involving the innings and the line-up.

Focus on things thay are within your control.  If the way you play is effective and helps the team, continue to play that way.  Although, I'm not sure what you mean by you playing like a guy.  If it means more one-on-one moves then just keep in mind that an offense is in place for a reason.  Take advantage of your opportunities without forcing shots.  Do this and work hard and you can only hope that your coach notices.

ny rangers, stars, philly, anaheim, carolina.  i don't think any of those teams have a chance to get to the finals.  3 of those teams are behind two games in their series.  dallas really is a disappointment to the west.  the stars were a pick to win the cup but they won't due to their lack of hunger.  philly just is too physical.  carolina is too inexperienced.  they say detroit is too old but i say they aren't.  they have the most experience out of the playoff contenders and should have the most hunger for the cup.  i think they will get past edmonton and colorado.  they will face the flames and it will be a dog fight that will produce the winner of the cup.  the eastern teams are good but not good enough outside of new jersey.  i see a matchup of new jersey and detroit in the finals.  seven games with detroit as the winner.

I can't say always, but very often it is. I read an article about this a while back. Turns out that when you're exerting and hot and sweaty like these guys, a tiny cut in the right place, like on the forehead at the hairline, will produce a scary looking, but inconsequential, stream of blood, with no significant pain or risk. Some people's body chemistry makes them really good bleeders. So they do very often have with them the means of making the cut at the right dramatic moment. The wrestlers are essentially stuntmen. What they're doing is difficult, physically demanding, and dangerous, even if the risks are controlled and the fights are mostly optical illusions. Pain and blood are a fact of life for them, and they take it in stride, as a pro football player would.

Zinedine Zidane was born June 23, 1972, in Marseille, France. Zidane got his start in football (known as soccer in North America) at an early age, when he joined the US Saint-Henri club. \n\nHe moved on to Septemes Sports Olympiques after the coach convinced the director of the club to sign him. After leaving Septemes at the age of 14, Zidane participated in the first year junior selection for the league championship, the same year he was discovered.   \n\n\n\n\n Off to Cannes\n\nHe was called in for 3 days at the sport regional centre in Aix-en-Provence, where Jean Varraud, Cannes' recruiter, noticed the French/Algerian player. He ventured off to Cannes for what was intended to be a six-week stay, but remained even longer. Playing with professionals at the age of 16, it would only be a matter of time when he too would turn pro, and he knew he was on his way to realizing his dreams.\n\nShowing the determination of an athlete who wants to exceed expectations, Zidane had played his first game in First Division at the age of 17, and it was from then that football went from an ambition to a passion. The Cannes midfielder scored his first goal on February 8th, 1991 (he received a Clio as a promise from the Cannes President, who promised him a car when he scored his first goal as a professional), and his first season with the club was marked by a qualification for the UEFA Cup.\n\nZidane's second season with Cannes wasn't as promising, but on the non-professional front he met his future wife Veronique, a Spanish dancer. After a lukewarm 91-92 season, Zidane felt it was time for a change and switched to Bordeaux after he was asked to sign a four-year contract. Marseille also wanted Zidane, but Bordeaux proved to want him more.

"Mattias Johan Sundin (born February 13, 1971, Bromma, Stockholm) is a Swedish professional ice hockey player in the National Hockey League (NHL). A 1.95m (6 ft 5 in), 105 kg (231 pound) centre, he is the current captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs. He was named the 16th captain of the Maple Leafs in 1997, becoming the first European player to wear the Captain's ""C"" for the Leafs. His nickname in Sweden is ""Sudden"".\n\nOriginally drafted by the Quebec Nordiques with the first pick in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft (from the Swedish Elite League club Djurgården), Sundin was the first European in league draft history to be chosen with the first overall selection. On June 28th, 1994, Mats was traded by the Nordiques to Toronto in a blockbuster deal involving then-Leafs Captain Wendel Clark. Sundin has played his last 10 seasons for Toronto. Statistically, Sundin's best season came during the 1992-93 campaign with the Nordiques when he combined 47 goals with 67 assists for 114 points.\n\nHe has represented Team Sweden at various international competitions, such as the World Cup of Hockey and the Olympics, and has held the position of team captain for the national squad for the better part of the last decade. Sundin is widely recognized as one of the top players in the world in these international competitions, and has added a highly impressive list of accomplishments to his credentials as a result of his outstanding performance in the 2002 Winter Olympics and 2004 World Cup of Hockey. Sundin finally clinched a gold medal with Team Sweden in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin."

Hockey might be the most athletic sport.\n\nIt depends on how you define it, but my theory is this:  For baseball, players can play 3 hours in a roll.  Basketball, they can usually play more then 35 minutes per game.  Hockey, even the best player can only play 25 minutes or so, during a 60 minutes game.
They've been doing it for a long time, and most likely focused on their training much more intensely and specifically than the average person. They now train with power meters and heart rate monitors, as well as doing specific testing with coaches and doctors to optimize their performance.\n\nMaximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) and Lactate Threshold (LT) are the things the pros work on religiously. Natural ability/genetics have some say in things, but LT is highly trainable.\n\n40 kph isn't all that fast for the pros. When riding in the pack, riders benefit from the drafting effect, saving up to 30-40% of the  effort of the riders taking the full brunt of the wind. The professional peloton can cruise along at well over 40 kph for hours on end.\n\nIn individual time trials (albeit the effort isn't necessarily long, per se), average speeds of over 50 kph have been recorded. Sprinters can get the speed up to over 70 kph in a finale of a race. The same can be said for track sprinters (the fastest kilo ever done was clocked at just under one minute, and that's from a standing start).\n\nTheir bikes, especially their time trial bikes, helmets and clothing, have all been designed to minimize drag and save time. Teams now regularly use wind tunnels to test equipment and fine tune riders' positions to further help in this endeavor.\n\nAnd yes, riders do dope up. Whether it's steroids, EPO (red blood cell producing drug), or blood doping (transfusion of blood into the rider's system) it's an ugly side of the sport that is a very real problem. It'll make riders fast, but it also puts their health at risk.\n\nThe theory is that blood doping or EPO makes more red blood cells. Red blood cells are what transport oxygen throughout the body. So the thought is that more is better. The only problem is that it also makes the blood thicker. When EPO started showing up in the early 90s, riders were dying in their sleep from heart attacks brought on by the thickened blood.

Nets are playing sixers \n\nCeltics are playing pacers\n\n       Sixers are currently winning and I believe they will win because they need this game if Indiana and Milwaukee and Chicago lose then Sixers go from 9th seed to a tie breaker for sixth. Its gonna be hard to beat the nets though \n\n       I hope Celtics win. So Sixers can get a higher seed\n\n      Edit:    Sixers winning by 21 at half sorry to all the players who say that Nets have better record. I know you guys were thinking a different team but sixers almost have the same record as Celtics. And not as much depth as Nets. But sixers need it and are winning it. 3 in a row.

its a start...very nice but it could be better. mike piazza and trot nixon???no thank you. drop them immediately and you can find someone better than them on waivers. \n\nas for the pitching whats wrong with your RPs....thats terrible. find some closers and stick em in there. drop batista, drop tallet, drop towers, and wakefield is mediocre you can do better than this.

if you are going to hike through the island, bring a frame pack. if your going for seven days, bring ten days worth of clothes, but always extra socks and underwear. regular clothes, rain gear, cooking stuff, like pots and pans and water purification tablets or filters. plenty of matches, get a map of the area and a compass, make sure you know how to use both. bring walkie talkies, an emergency beacon if you can afford it, emergency kits are a good idea, they usually come with mirrors to signal someone, water proof matches, space blankets, and other survival equipment.\nbring at least three really sharp knives as well as a small sharping stone, and axes or hatchets, lots of rope and maybe even a tarp or something. \nthey have freeze dried meals which cut a lot of weight and space. they are usually five bucks a meal, but there is a lot of food in them and its pretty good. just add hot water, let soak for 15 minutes and enjoy. \nmake sure to bring a decent tent.\nmost importantly, know where you are going, let people know where you are going and how long your gonna be there.\nif possible, get a gps. bring extra batteries for it. lanterns are always a plus, as well as a few flashlights.\nbefore you go anywhere, ask yourself, whats the weather going to be like, whats the nearest civilized spot, wild animals, stuff like that.\nbe prepared for the worse but hope for the best.\ngood luck

Benfica fans aren't stupid, I'm one myself and stupid isn't one of my qualities. Portugal may not yield good soccer teams, but they have great soccer player that play internationally. Example(C. Ronaldo, Luis Figo, Pauletta), just to name a few. Benfica fans are loyal regardless if their team wins or loses, unlike some so called fans of other teams that make excuses when their team loses.  We are honest to admit that our team didn't play to win. And for you to call us stupid it's an insult.

Redick is a much better shooter and had a much better season than Dean this year. Dean will be lucky to be drafted while Redick will be a lottery pick. Redick also is a much smarter player than Dean too.\n\n\nYOU MUST REALLY LIKE DEAN BECAUSE LOOK, TWO OF THE MOST REPUTABLE SITES BACKED ME UP! nbadraft.net says he's going to be drafted 50th and draftexpress.com says he isn't going to be drafted at all... see for yourself... Being on the All-Senior team doesn't mean that much in my opinion anyway. I think DEAN was really lucky to even get on it too.
no heart, they never gave their all and got into the games like they do in the playoffs. I didn't feel the emotion that playoff games have.
Pro players don't play streetball because of the risk of injury.  A minor injury could cost them tens of thousands of dollars.
With the numbers that they both put up during the season and also in the playoffs i think both have a very strong chance to get drafted

"History overview\n\nThe club was founded in 1927 as an amateur team, part of Dinamo, a nation-wide Soviet sport society. This society later became officially funded and patronized by the NKVD (a KGB predecessor), and later by the interior ministry (MVD). In the 1950s–1980s, team players were even officially ranked as police officers. However, thousands of ordinary Soviet citizens paid symbolic membership fees for the ""sport society"".\n\nDuring the Soviet era, the club was one of the main rivals, and oftentimes the only rival, to the football clubs from Moscow. Its ability to challenge the dominance of the Moscow clubs in Soviet soccer, and frequently defeat them to win the Soviet championship, was a matter of national pride for Ukraine. Leaders of the Ukrainian SSR unofficially regarded the club as their national team and provided it with generous support. Thus, Dinamo became a de-facto professional team of international importance.\n\nAfter the Soviet Union's collapse, the club, now using the Ukrainian name Dynamo Kyiv, became a member of the new football league of Ukraine. Dynamo's status as the country's principal club did not alter as they went on to dominate domestic cups. This dominance has recently been challenged by FC Shakhtar Donetsk from the eastern region of Donbass, which won the national championship in 2002 and again in 2005, leaving Dynamo with a second place.\n\nSince 1993, the team has been owned by Hryhoriy Surkis, a Ukrainian businessmen and oligarch, one of the richest tycoons in Eastern Europe (with interests in electricity, oil trade, and allegedly in organized crime). The Ukrainian opposition has accused the government of setting too low a price and other irregularities during the privatization of the club. Surkis is closely linked to former President Leonid Kuchma, being a member of the so-called ""Kiev holding"", or ""Dynamo group"", an influential business and political clan, formally organized as the SDPU(o) political party. The team's symbols and players, formerly including Andriy Shevchenko, have been used in political advertisements for pro-Kuchma politicians in recent elections.\n[edit]\n\nThe ""Death Match""\nPoster of the return match\nEnlarge\nPoster of the return match\n\nThe story is often told of how the Dinamo team, playing as ""Start, City of Kyiv All-Stars"", was shot in the summer of 1942 for defeating an All-Star team from the German armed forces by 5 goals to 1. The actual story, as recounted by Y. Kuznetsov ([1]), is considerably more complex. After the Nazi occupation of Ukraine began, the Dinamo team found employment in the city's Bakery No. 3, and played football on wasteland, where they were spotted by Germans and invited to play against an army team as ""Start"". ""Start"" comprised eight players from Dinamo, Nikolai Trusevich, Mikhail Sviridovskiy, Nikolai Korotkykh, Aleksey Klimenko, Fedor Tyutchev, Mikhail Putistin, Ivan Kuzmenko, Makar Goncharenko and three players from Lokomotiv Kyiv, Vladimir Balakin, Vasiliy Sukharev, and Mikhail Melnik. In July and August 1942 ""Start"" played a series of matches against German and allied sides. On July 12 a German army team was defeated. A stronger army team was selected for the next match on July 17, which ""Start"" defeated 6-0. On July 19 ""Start"" defeated the Hungarian team MSG Wal by 5-1. The Hungarians proposed a return match, held on July 26, but were defeated by 3-2.\n\nAt this stage it appeared that ""Start"" were ready to be beaten, and a match was announced for August 6 against a ""most powerful"" ""undefeated"" German Luftwaffe Flakelf team, but despite the game being talked up by the newspapers, they failed to report the 5-1 result. On August 9 ""Start"" played a ""friendly"" against Flakelf and again defeated them. The team defeated Rukh 8-0 on August 16, and after this the playe"

The Redwings definitely get the shaft when it comes to conference affiliation.  They have to travel 1000's of miles to play teams like the Kings, Sharks and Mighty Ducks several times a year.

lose. james is not easily replaced, and defenses aren't going to fear rhodes/mungro/maroney(or whoever they draft), so the play action isn't going to be as effective. Whichever back they put in there isn't going to be as good as James at picking up blitzes/pass protection, so Manning is going to get even more of what the steelers/charges brought toward the end of the season.  so, they will lose.
nah kobe is the best
These sports franchises do give back to the cities and states they occupy, they do pay taxes and other surcharges.  But I do agree that it is unfair to expect taxpayers to flip such a cost that could equal one quarter of the total cost.  But politicians in new york love kissing the asses of the yankee fans in hope of winning votes.
Actually, the year was 1996 (they were playing for the Asian Cup), and the one who scored 4 goals was Ali Daei.
The longest your stick can be is 72 inches (6 feet). That's generally used for defence, but sometimes midi's use it on faceoffs. It's also called a 'long stick'. A team may have no more than four long sticks on the field at any given time.

"Is a Flyers fan and that was an awesome hit on Umberger.  Though I really hope then get the BS out of the way so they can play the game and not have something cheap happen.  I say let Campbell and Brashear drop the gloves get it over with and play the game the last thing either team needs is for someone to do something cheap and hurt someone else.  This way the Flyer get there revenge and everyone is happy.  \n Update: Umberger learned a lesson about skating with his head down in Game 1 of the playoff series with the Buffalo Sabres, getting clocked by defenseman Brian Campbell in the first overtime, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. \nRecommendation: ""I was in the right position. I probably should not have gotten the pass,"" Umberger said Sunday. ""... Everybody says maybe I should have had my head up."" He remains questionable for Monday night's game, although he says he is fine. Coach Ken Hitchcock seemed optimistic, saying Umberger's only symptom was stiffness in his neck."
I can't stand the kid, so I would say yes, it should have been more.  Especially since it was a RED flag, which means STOP WHERE YOU ARE...but taking into account NASCAR and what they usually dish out for penalties, it seeemed about right.
Albert Pujols is probably the best answer. He's got all the statistics, and he will probably AGAIN be on the best team, The St. Louis Cardinals. Problem is he will be the first pick out of the draft. So who do you go from there if you do not have the first pick?\n\nAnother good hitter on the Cardinals is Jim Edmonds. He puts up decent numbers, and the wins can always count.\n\nPitchers do not play everyday, but they can generate major points. Do not forget about Chris Carpenter for the Cardinals or someone from a powerhouse pitching squad like the A's, Rich Harden can put up good numbers, but not enough for a 1st round pick. Pedro Martinez for the Mets can be over-rated. \n\nBut you need points every-day?\n\nSome good hitters are Carlos Beltran for the Mets. The Mets should have a good year experts say, but thats also what they said last year. So if you pick Beltran, it COULD be a risk, but a low-risk. I personally believe they'll have a good year. \n\nIf I had to pick and I was like in the middle for the 5th pick in my draft, I would pick somebody from the White Sox. Paul Konerko just got a major extension. That should be a major boost for him to have a good season. Or Scot Podsednik is a great under-rated hitter than can put up the numbers. Everybody says White Sox are going to have a repeat year. Although, I would not count on Jim Thome, he was a great hitter in 2004 but he got injured and missed all of 2005. It will take him a while to get back into the game.\n\nThats my opinion, always glad to help.

Two answer this question better, there are two answers i.e, two solutions.\nOne, Off the field, when the players are done playing and practicing, they should have good enough income to supprot their families, so that they can focus on the game. This can be achieved by sponsorships and ads and fundraisers.\n\nSecond, practice practice and practice. They need to practice team work. There should be team building activities. There should be trained and have fitness sessions everyday. They should be passing and dribbling practices. They should have an obsticle football course. They should have target practices varing the target sized etc. \n\nThis should really be helpful...
First they will hopefully sigh back Pennant from City as they will be reglated. Second, they will sign Adu, what a furture with Fabregas, Senderos and RVP. Ashely Cole will stay, signing a new contract. Dirk Kuijt will be a likly as Pires will likely move on, and we need a winger. Theo will come of age next season.

"TALLADEGA, Ala.

Talladega County Coroner Jerry Castleberry pronounced them dead at the scene.\n\nThe Aaron's 499 race will be run at the track on Sunday. Fans commonly use poles to fly flags touting their favorite driver.\n\nWitnesses said Wright and Stell were attempting to anchor a flagpole when it was caught by wind and pushed into power lines running along a road outside the track.\n\n""They were trying to pull the flagpole back off the lines,"" said James Snider, who was sitting about 30 yards away from the victims' camp site. ""I heard a loud pop that sounded like a firecracker, and I went running because the power lines fell. They were both lying on the ground, and two women were trying to get them away from the wires."""

"The biggest problem of the Flyers this year has been consistency.  With a healthy lineup intact and playing to their potential, they have shown themselves to be capable of beating any team in the league.  However, this has rarely been the case.  Injuries have devasted them.  Forsberg has missed a lot of time, along with Johnsson, Pitkanen, their leader Primeau just to name a few.  Even when their lineup was semi-back together, they still have failed to play the way they are capable most of the time.  One of the brighter points about the Flyers this year though has been the play of their rookies.  Mike Richards and Jeff Carter have played strong in their debut season.  Antero Niittymaki has been amazing.  Even R.J. Umberger, despite being clocked in game 1, has played very well.  Another thing that always seems to stick in my mind about this team is that, i hate to say it, they play stupid hockey.  Every game it seems they take dumb penalties on things that have been getting called all year.  They have not been able to adapt as well as some other teams to this ""new nhl.""\nAs far as the playoffs so far have gone, game 1 was actually an amazing game.  Robert Esche was flat-out phenomenal.  Despite a lackluster performance by most other players out there, he almost singlehandidly kept them in contention.  I wish they could have won the game if only for the way Esche played.  Even Forsberg, despite an awful beginning, bounced back and showed why he's the best player in the world.  As far as game 2, i really don't even know what to say.  They simply got blown out.  It didn't even look like they were trying.  Buffalo's a fast team, but they have to expect that and be ready to play.  Moving on now to the future in game 3.  This time, they're coming back to philly.  Sure, they didn't get the split up in Buffalo like they would have liked, but they can still bounce back, its just there's almost no room for error.  Plus, the readdition of Keith Primeau to the lineup could provide the team with the spark it needs to get over the hump.  All it takes is a win in game 3, and the flyers will be right back in it.  In game 1, if only Sami Kapanen didn't hit that post in overtime, imagine where this series would be now..."
It all depends on the lie and the deepness or flatness of the bunker. Mostly you would use a sand wedge, but I have seen pro's putt out of a green side bunker. It also depends on where the bunker is. If it is a fairway bunker, you may choose any iron and again, I have seen pro's hit a wood out of a bunker if the lie is good and they have quite a distance to the green.
You can check out www.runnersworld.com for other info, they have advice from some current and former running stars that might help. I'm not sure if you're asking about racing or completing the 3-5k. If you want to complete the 3-5k then I'd suggest start slow and gradually increase your pace over the duration. \nIf you're trying to race it then ...I ran crosscountry and track in college in the US and my tactic for the longer races (3km,5km and CC) was to hang with the leaders of the race as long as I could. Over time, and with specific training, I was able to keep up with the leaders and be competitive. My opinion is that trying to hang back in the early going and sprinting at the end was a bad tactic, because I was so far back I was never going to catch the leaders. Go out fast with the leaders..if you sense the pace is going too fast for you then begin to settle into the pace you can handle (but remember, the winner is the person who can handle the pain for the longest, so your handling pace should still have you in some mild discomfort). Always look ahead and see if you can pick off the runner ahead of you. Some of this depends on your goals - do you want to win, do you want a fast time, are you training enough etc. Anyway, hope this helped.
From everything ive been reading the 49ers have two players that are their top picks, AJ Hawk from The Ohio State and Mario Williams NC State.  There have also been reports that their reasoning for trading theit  second and third round picks with Denver was to position themselves to move up to the top 3, the thinking would be that Williams and Hawk will both be gone at 6.  But for the question asked I'll assume they stay put.\n\nFor the 6th pick Id go with Michael Huff.  Its really a bit of a reach at this high a pick, but I believe that his versatiltiy of playing either corner or saftey in the NFL would benefit the very thin defensive backfield of the 49ers. \n\nAs for the 22nd pick, it would be ideal if either WR Santonio Holmes of The OSU or Chad Jackson from Florida were available to select one of them.  Another option ive been hearing of lately would be DE/OLB Manny Lawson, but any 49er fan knows that the offense is miles behind the defense in every aspect.

You need to introduce a spark about 2-3 inches from the end of the exhaust pipe.  Make sure your exhaust tip is far enough behind the body of the car so you don't burn your paint.  Here's a couple of web sites where you can order kits for your car...
Kilkenny ;-)\n\nNo, to be serious I think it's likely to go to a northern team. Maybe Derry or Tyrone.
forget piazza! theres a reason why they didnt want to sign him again; because hes getting too old. Paul LoDuca is a decent and younger catcher.
which world cup?just kidding.Anyway I know it wont be too long before the u.s has added to its huge arsenal of world trophies.
St louis Cardinals. the most successful National League team in MLB history. The Cardinals have had such great players that play solid defense and dominant pitching. The post season record and many world championships speak for itself. And we did not have to over pay for the teams.(Yankees)The yankees have had 200mil+ payrolls and were horrible. One of the reasons the Cardinals have been so successful is that we play in the same division as the Useless by September Cubs. I have to thank the cubs for sucking so bad, that we never had any real competition from them for the N.L. Central. Thank You cubs for being a terrible baseball team through out history. I am sure glad the Cardinals won a Championship since I have been alive. The suck-ass cubs barely have any fans old enough to remember a winning post season. Cubs Blow! Cards Rule!
good question.\n\nlets see:\nanswer depends on what you mean by kinds.\ni mean if we group martial arts by where they are from, in big groups, then probably a dozen tops. if we group them by how they fight; inside (very close), outside (very far), close, medium, long, far ranged, light or heavy footed, wide or narrow stance, kicking, or biting, or hitting, or slapping, or grabbing or crushing, or even entangle. \nkung fu, karate, nin jitsu, i could go on for days.\nprobably hundreds of different names, and many names view their own martial art differently but do EXACTLY the same  moves for the same reasons. there is only so many ways the human body can move. so practically there do exist different ways of learning martial arts, but it is all the same in the end. you either find a way to honestly express yourself or you do not, to misquote bruce lee. i would say most people would answer a few hundred if not thousands.

NO.  he gets injured to fast and with federer nadal and nalbandian it will be way to hard.  but he could come close and magy win a grand slam but breaking the top 6 is way to hard
i believe this is the answer to your question. \n\n3.08\n(a) If no announcement of a substitution is made, the substitute shall be considered as having entered the game when_ (1) If a pitcher, he takes his place on the pitcher's plate; (2) If a batter, he takes his place in the batter's box; \n(3) If a fielder, he reaches the position usually occupied by the fielder he has replaced, and play commences; (4) If a runner, he takes the place of the runner he has replaced. (b) Any play made by, or on, any of the above mentioned unannounced substitutes shall be legal.

Eddy Mercx was the greatest.  He raced everything.  He attacked in the Tour de France even when he had a ten-minute lead.  He won the one day classics and multi-day tours.\n\nNothing against Armstrong, but he had only one other major win besides the Tour.  That was in the World Championships back when he was a youngster.
well australia will always be the favourites going into any cricket tournament.you need to be best in all the departments when u r against australia.but recently aussies hav struggled in odi's due to their ageing team members....but india is doing the best in this department.so hands up to india.but u never know world cup always springs a surprise.so wait a little longer to confirm this

Well, they break because you cut into them ever so slightly every time you hit the ball. It will happen more often if the little grommets break.\n\nA light recreational player might only need to restring their raquet once a year. If you're playing pretty regularly, practicing your serve and hitting against a machine, it might be monthly--or when you break them!
Goodness yes.  They're all over the place.  What exactly are you looking for.  California has the most and the best male and female skaters because training facilities abound.   At the EastWest Ice Palace in Artesia, you'll find many national champions (including Michelle Kwan).   At the Aliso Viejo Ice Palace you'll find Sasha Cohen and others.
I agree.  The League Cup is certainly past it's sell by date.  By removing this cup the SPL split could be done away with.

Red Sox would like to give Johnny Damon a 4-year, 40 million contact.  Yangkees gave him 4-year, 53 million contact.  It's 13 M difference, huge enough to made him leave and cut his hairs.

RVD vs Shelton Benjamin- RVD won, while the ref was knocked out he did a Vandaminator on Shelton Benjamin with the Money in the Bank briefcase, then he did a Five-Star Frog Splash and pinned Benjamin.\n\n5. Big Show vs Kane- No decision, while they were wrestling the lights dimmed down and Kane heard, MAY 19th then Big Show got a chair and put Kane out of his misery, Big Show then walked away sad.\n\n6. Shane McMahon and Mr. McMahon vs Shawn Michaels and ""God""- Vince and Shane won, before the match Vince announced that the match was a No Holds Barred match. They made Shawn bleed but he got back up and he did a repeat of Wrestlemania 22 except he was going to break both Shane and Vinceon seperate tables, while he was on top the Spirit Squad came and Shawn jumped on them instead of the McMahons then it was a 7 on 1 and the Spirit Squad broke Shawn on the table (like they threw Big Show to win the Tag Team titles) then he got pinned by Vince.\n\nMain Event- John cena vs Edge vs HHH- Cena took it, it was a hellacios match HHH was bleeding like crazy. While HHH went 4 a pedigree Cane reversed it into a pin. Edge almost tapped but was later taken out with a steel chair can't go into details cuz i'll spend all night here.

Starting with the grip:\nYou probably want to use a 'Semi-Western' or a 'Western' forehand grip. Essentially you want to hold the racquet as you would a frying pan, making sure you grip it at the very bottom of the grip.\n\nThe swing:\nTo start you racket head wants to be back and lower than where you want to make contact with the ball, keep your arm reasonably close to your side.\nContact with the ball is the most imporant part of the swing, the 'contact point' wants to be in front of your body, idealy at around net height, your racket heads wants to be pressing forwards and up.\nTo finnish the shot you want to keep your eyes on where you made contact with the ball, your racket head finnishes up high over your shoulder and your hips and shoulders should be 'squared' to the net.\n\nTo really learn a top spin forehand you want to get on a tennis court with someone that can either teach you, or knows how to hit one and you can watch their technique.\n\nPlayers like Rafael Nadal hit with alot of topspin so I would recommend you watch him play on TV if you have the chance, and Roger Federer is awesome and everyone can try and learn from him.

Well, you are not going to get that much for 500 bucks. JEEP IS NOT A GOOD BRAND. It is better to get a reputable brand like Jami or Kona but first you have to decide on what you are going to use this bike for. The main categories are trail bikes,cross country race bikes, black diamond bikes,downhill bikes,mountain cross bikes and jump bikes.                                                                                                                    If you are just going around the trail now and then there is no point in buying anything other that a trail bike. The rest are expensive and unpractical. I would recommend a Specialized ,GT,Kona,Trek or Jamis is fine. Look for something with disk brakes,aluminum frame,decent front fork with more than 3 inches of travel and a rear shock but you are going to spend more money for the nicer features. Buy from a reputable dealer and don't make any hasty decisions. If you need more information buy any mountain bike magazine buyers guide or go to a dealer.
Chelsea will win the Premsiership this season.  But, having failed, again, to win the Chamions League, can they call themselves the best team in England?  Who knows.\n\nNext season, four teams will have everything to prove.  Chelsea will try to win more than just the Premiership.  Manchester United will try to re-establish themselves as the top English team.  Liverpool will need to repeat their Champions League win.  And Arsenal will need to show that they can treat their new stadium to the best football in Europe.\n\nAll four teams have a lot to play for: I am looking forward to it already!

I dont know but a Yellow card is basicly a waring and a Red card kick you off the field.
The playoffs are not completely determined yet. The Lakers and the Clippers are both in the Western Conference. Their are two conferences (Eastern and Western). Their are 16 teams in each conference and 8 teams from each conference make the playoffs. The Clippers have guaranteed themselves of a spot in the playoffs and are positioned in the 6th seed, although they can jump up to the 5th seed depending on how they and the Memphis Grizzlies do in their last few games. The Lakers are not yet guaranteed of a spot in the playoffs (they have three games left to play), but they will most likely make it as the 7th seed in the Western Conference.
Short and long are just that. there is a long version and a short version. Most short versions are found on pre-'70's small blocks. All depends on the brackets you plan on using and as long as you don't have a newer vortec block with reverse flow system or 4 outlets in the block. Most cases you have a long pump. Either short or long will bolt up and function the same way.Parts supply house should be able to help you further on your selecton if you show them what you are working with.
Mistake, yes.  To think that you're set with Kitna and McNown is insane.  Neither is a franchise QB.  Leinart is.  I expect Leinart to be starting by week five and to win between five and six games, right around .500.  Next year AZ will probably draft him that dump out TE optioin and he'll win 9.  Year three puts AZ in the playoffs if they can get a touch of defensive help.
i just watched his interview. he's nowhere near his brother characterwise. he's a spoiled brat who thinks his shit don't stink. i watched couple of his games, too. and i wouldn't even put him in practice squad.

Keep your eye on the ball and focus on making contact.  Check the length and weight of the bat as well.  It may be too short or too heavy.  You should be able to hold it comfortably just above the shoulder (not resting on the shoulder) and be able to swing it easily and smoothly.  If your swing is not smooth, then change the bat and find one you can swing properly.

"IF your looking for short term improvement look to T.O.  Did you see what he did for the Eagles,  14 Tds not even in a whole season, But in the long run ruined a year for his teamates, who he doesnt care about.       So if your looking for long term go Moss.  Yes he has some of the problems that T.O. did but he has learned to ""calm"" it down,  He can control himself better."

Not very happy with the ideea...  Being a Yankee fan all my life, I relish the history associated with the stadium...  It's something that cannot be replaced..  All the greatness of the franchise, all 26 world championships (hopfully a few more before its torn down), etc. will be missing from the Stadium, sure it will always be a part of the Yankees history, but its going to lose its symbolism..\n\nAt the same time thouogh, I will forever be a Yankee fan wherever they play...  And in time I will accept it, which it looks like we will have to being the fact that its already in planningh
They will at least make it to the semi-finals. Then, it depends who they play.\n\nIf they play any other team than Brazil, then yes.\n\nThis squad is the best England squad ever. Even better than '66. It is time they won something.\n\nOh, and there is PLENTY of togetherness. A lot of the players have been playing together for four or more years now.
They have the talent to do it, but they come out of the gate so slow, that if they're faced by a strong team they might get run off the pitch...look at their last matches against Uruguay and Argentina
I do both and i play soccer(it's very fun and stuff)
The industry recognizes two two methods of green construction.  \n\n1.  USGA Step 1 - The Subgrade\nThe slope of the subgrade should conform to the general slope of the finished grade. The subgrade should be established approximately 16 inches (400 mm) below the proposed surface grade - 18 to 20 inches \n\nStep 2 - Drainage\nStep 3 - Gravel and Intermediate Layers\nThe entire subgrade then shall be covered with a layer of clean, washed, crushed stone or pea gravel \nStep 4. The Root Zone Mixture\nThe sand used in a USGA root zone mix shall be selected so that the particle size distribution of the final root zone mixture \nStep 5. Top Mix Covering, Placement, Smoothing, and Firming\nStep 6. Seed Bed Preparation\nStep 7. Fertilization\n\n2.  California There are some key differences between USGA and California greens, and cost is just one. Typically, USGA greens cost $60,000 to $100,000 more than California greens on a 19-green renovation.  California greens also differ from USGA greens because they consist of 12 inches of pure sand placed directly on the sub-base. In contrast, the USGA method requires a 4-inch layer of gravel and, depending on material sizes, an intermediate layer of coarse sand to keep root-zone sand from filtering into the gravel. Both methods call for a herringbone tile pattern to drain water from the green cavity.

The suns are a great team team. They make great plays and work well together, unlike the Lakers who depend on a few people only. Basketball is a team sport. Plus, Suns are a better team then the Lakers.
If I knew more I could try to help, but I can tell you there is a trade analyzer at fantasyfootball.com that you can input the pick numbers and see who the trade will likely work out best for.  It's an inexact science, and if you have a certain player you want, it can be worth taking a small hit.  But that can give you a bit of a guide to it.
Yes, I do watch soccer whenever I can, I think soccer is the best sport that was ever invented. In the 2002 world cup over 28 billion TV viewers, in 213 countries, watched the cup games. FIFA has 204 national associations, more members than the U.N. There are 250 million active players, and 30 million women players, which beats football, baseball and basketball together! The first mention dates back 2,000 years! Soccer will never die, it is the game of the people! To bad soccer is widely ignored in the US media, no soccer fever here! It should be way more often televised. Having only antenna TV, makes me watch soccer on Mexican TV stations every week end. It would be great if the US team would get in to the final round in the 2006 World Cup, that would change the interest quota for sure.

I picked the Mets to win in 2006....I just like their lineup.  Starters might not be the greatest but they probably don't have to be.  Solid bullpen with Billy Wagner closing things out, a bounce back year from Carlos Beltran, Delgado, Wright and Reyes doing what they normally do and I like the Mets chances.  Maybe i'm dreaming too....

because its close to the homebase and its easier to walk to in case they have to take that walk of shame when they strike out. where else whould they be?
"Yes, in the 17 of August 2004\nsee http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/040818/11/20kw.html\nBrazil routs Haiti 6-0 in 'Match for Peace'\nBrazil routed a weak Haitian team 6-0 Wednesday in an exhibition soccer game aimed at promoting peace in the Caribbean country.\nRonaldinho scored three times and Roger twice as goals by the World Cup champions went flying past Haitian goalkeeper Fenelon Gabart. Nilmar had the other goal, and Brazilian star Ronaldo assisted twice.\n\nThe highlight was Ronaldinho's first goal in the 32nd minute. He dribbled up the middle around and through four defenders, then jumped over the goalkeeper and tapped the ball into an empty net.\n\nThe sellout crowd of about 15,000 chanted ""Haiti, Haiti,"" but many also cheered when Brazil scored --` at least for the first few goals. After that they cheered the home side.\n\nThe game was billed as a ""Match for Peace"" nearly six months after a rebellion culminated in the ouster of Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Brazil is heading a U.N. peacekeeping force meant to bring stability to Haiti."

If this is a trick question the answer 7 on each team for a total of 14.  In normal 11 v 11 games each team must have a MINIMUM of 7 players to start a game.  Hopefully each team has at least 11 players each and the game starts with 22 players on the field....
I think that Cleveland is dramatically improving every year. Sure, theyre not there yet, and theyre probably not even making the playoffs this coming season, but they are a team to watch for the future. Theyve got a young, skilled QB, an experienced RB, and a pretty decent coach. They have some holes defensively, but with the work they did this free agency season, and if they come out well in the draft, they could be a team to watch the next few years. I predict that they will win the superbowl with 15 years from now.

you prob wont be able to get those unless a player gets them for you.. my coach (college) takes all the play books and all the scouting reports from all the players at the end of the season so people cant just get em
Your best bet is to call your nearest Bass Pro Shop or Cabelas Shop. They will probably have any info regarding lure companys and lure stocks.\n\n Ask your local Baitshop guy to hunt one down for you,( more than likely they will). Good luck!

It doesnt mean that a good player can be a good captain. the player should be aggresive for him to make a good captain, like ponting(australia) and smith(south africa), and their performance is proof for this. \nI think one player in the windies team  who falls in this category is Chris gayle. I think he is aggresive and the right man in the current squad to lead this depleted windies team.
Running definitely increases your endurance and you'll need that. But I recommend finding a brick wall and kicking the ball against it as many times as you can.  Kick easy some, harder at other times.  Switch feet and kick style.  Over time, this will increase your feel for the ball and these touches will come in handy when playing with others.
I am sure that if you go to see a Chicago White Sox game and got to the ballpark early you might be able to meet Ozzie Guillen and a few of the players. Or go online to the Major League Baseball website and go to the Chicago White Sox site and look and see if they have a way to contact the ballpark. I know this isn't much but I hope that it helps. I don't live in Chicago and I am not a real fan of the White Sox so I don't know do much about them.
When he finally called it a day at the age of 34, Santos marked his passing by removing the No.10 shirt from their line-up. It was an admission that no-one could compare with The Master. \n\nThen, in 1975, Pele surprised everyone by coming out of retirement to play for the New York Cosmos in America's fledgling soccer league. The price probably helped - a small matter of $4.5 million. \n\nThe end of a supreme career finally came in 1977 when Pele hung up his boots for good and settled for a role as a sporting ambassador, later becoming Brazil's Minister for Sport.
I have done alot of mountain backpacking, and what i have found works best is walking long distances with backpack (at least 50 pounds) on your back. Also, when walking up hill there is aloit of stain put in the calf muscle and the best way to strengthen that is stand on the edge of stairs with your toees the only thing touching and then stand on your tiptoes, adn tehn come back down as far as you can do that daily your calves with thank you later. If u have any more ??s my AIM is tkachuk51 and i would be happy to chat with you (i am leading wilderneess trips this sumemr too)

Why bother? You'll never be able to get any item back in it's package with the ease that the manufacturer claims. They have special robots that pack the stuff, normal humans just can't compete. The most effective solution is to just to wad up the parts in a ball as tight as you can and CRAM, CRAM, CRAM! Good luck, I think you'll do alright as it sounds like there isn't a lot of pieces you'll need to worry about.
I agree that CRA didnt have a complete lineup, and America did, but CRA played better the last 20 mins of first half. Then they lost their groove, and With that looser of Sabah it was no surprise with the result. The only good thing about this game was Chelitos superve play making, but he cant do everything. still CRA has a better position in the general ranking, hell america might not make it to the ligilla.
I have heard enough of this bonds crap the season started its excited lets enjoy baseball and not wory about the past.

Kids have great visual imaginations, so make use of it with this drill: imagine there's a coathanger in your back and your arms are being hoisted up by a puppeteer. Run a short 200 metre course imagining you're still suspended on a rail, keeping a straight line right down your form from head to toe. Practice like this until it feels natural, always keeping upright and erect. Keep arms at your hips and don't pump too hard. Accelerate by pushing forward fro the knees down. It's how professional athletes are trained at first. Balance, posture, control are core elements of any training to articulate to kids. Enjoy!

hmm.. its very like soccer.. the field is tha same size. juss dont let the ball hit your foot.there are websites u can go to that tell u the rules. my advice- try it!! see what you think of it most chance u will like it,,, its not hard to play. juss get tha basics right first.. then every thing will come easier. just go to ur local club and ask if u could try it.
You can play around more in the regular season than in the playoffs. In the Playoffs, you have to play a more complete brand of basketball to win. Phil must have made it abundantly clear that if Kobe didn't get the other players involved, they wouldn't stand a chance.\n\nAlso, seeing Steve Nash win MVP could have done two things to Kobe. It could have made him think that if Nash was considered, by the majority of the voters, to be more influential in making his team win, by passing as much or more than scoring, then maybe he would too. OR it's possible that the ultra-comptetive Kobe has come out to prove that he can play a more sharing, Nash-like game better than Nash can. Or maybe he's just trying to show he can play a more balanced game, to show that he should have been voted MVP. Or maybe this is part of his attempt to clean up his image. Maybe he's trying to overcome the stigma against him that he doesn't pass, and he's doing it on a national stage where everyone can witness it.\n\nMaybe he's learning to trust his teammates. Maybe his teammates are giving him more of a reason to trust them. \n\nThe Lakers are a franchise built around Kobe at this point. Late game, he is their go to guy. He is always put in a position to win the game at the end, bring them back, or keep the lead up in close situations. Maybe it's sinking in that it's his team, and he's not feeling as pressured to prove it is. Maybe he had enough big individual scoring games this year that he feels his talent can't be called into question if he doesn't score.\n\nWho knows. Just know that Kobe's competetiveness and ego are probably the driving factors in this change, since they seem to have driven the rest of his noticeable behavior so far. Since winning is how success is measured in the Playoffs, he could satisfy his ego and competetiveness more through winning than individual performance - although one could argue that his individual performance is more impressive now, despite the decline in scoring.
Rafael Marquez.. no doubt about it. He plays for the biggest clubs, and he's one of their best players.\n\nFonesca is very promising. He's been doing really well but Marquez is way too good.

"The Bengals were poised to win it all last year until Kimo did that hospital-job on Palmer.  The team made moves in free agency but the overall make up of the team stayed about the same (using Scouts.com player values, the average player leaving vs. those coming had the same value) and everyone is a year older.  I had them as the second best team last year according to my system (I'm a numbers guy and have way too much time.) with only the Seahawks better then them.  It's going to be hard for the Steelers to make a repeat.  They got hammered in free agency and retirements  and is actually worse off.\n\nAnd regarding the above comment that the Bengals line is ""getting old""...the most senior guy is Bobby Williams who's been in the league a whopping 5 years, so they are just hitting their stride as a unit."
When Nadia was about 14 she scored the first perfect 10 at the Olympics in Women's Gymnastics. She was only 86 pounds and 4 feet 11 inches. That's about the size of a really tall 4th grader! No person, especially such a small one, had ever scored a perfect 10! \n\n    Nadia Comaneci was born to Gheorge and Stefania-Alexandria Comaneci on November 12, 1961 in Onesti, a factory town in the mountains of Romania. Nadia and her family lived in a small apartment. She was an active child who enjoyed running and jumping. In fact, her love of jumping broke four of her family's couches when the springs snapped. \n\n    One day, the gymnastics coach of an Onesti sports school, Bela Karoloyi, visited Nadia's school. Noticing Nadia and another girl pretending to be gymnasts, he started to go over to talk to them. Suddenly, recess ended and he lost the girls, for they rushed away quickly and disappeared into the school.

Winning Pitcher in a ball game.\nStarting Pitcher has to leave the ball game with the lead lets say 5-4 at the half way point in which if the game was called due to weather or any other odd thing, 9 innings they call it the 5th Inning so both teams get the same amount of field time. Now he can leave with the lead and the team win and not get it if the other team scores more then what his team had when he left. So if its 6-5 final he would get the no decision and the pitcher who was pitching at the time they scored the winning run would get the win. Easy and clear as mud huh. \n\nMain thing to remember is after 5 who ever is pitching for the team that won when the winning run happend. Not the next inning but that inning.

Actually, Perfessor (How are you?), people love to hate them! The Flyers have been, for as long as I can recall, a bunch of huge brutes (very talented brutes, mind you) that have been near, or at the top of hockey. I respect them - but my allegiance to the NY Blueshirts prevents me from doing any more than that. I don't hate them, though. Those that do hate them are probably just jealous, especially in Toronto. Can you imagine... a team from Philly consistently kicking the butts of a team from the birthplace of hockey. Oh, the humanity of it all!

My favorite thing to do in gymnastics is a layout full on the floor because it invovlves both twisting and flipping - and because it took me awhile to progress from the half twist to the full twist.  But now I can double twists on tumble track, both forward and backward.  So I feel like learning the full twist was hard, but I mastered twisting after that.  Now it's all a question of building up enough power to attain the height necessary to do double fulls on the floor.

The main thing is he mustn't do any hard-impact exercise,"" Roberton told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme.\n\n""It's better for him to swim. Being young it can take between four and six weeks for this injury to repair properly.\n\n""He must build up gradually the amount of exercise he does and have rest days between sessions. When running 40 or 50% of the body's weight is put on the metatarsal's head.\n\n""He should rest and not do much exercise and should be back to normal in four to six weeks.\n\n""I would doubt very much if he could make the first game, or even the second, of the group stages.

WrestleMania.The super bowl of sports entertainment.A night where each wrestler goes out there and gives it their all.And that's exactly what happened at WrestleMania 12.March 31,1996 in Anaheim California.It was an important WrestleMania because it marked the last WrestleMania for WWE champions like Diesel better known as Kevin Nash,Yokozuna and Ultimate Warrior.It was also the last WrestleMania where Hall of Famer and undoubtedly the best heel of all-time Roddy Piper wrestled for the last time at WrestleMania.It was then that Steve Austin and the Game Triple H.Although, Austin was successful in beating Savio Vega.Triple H was easily squashed by The Warrior in less then 2 minutes.The Undertaker and Big Daddy Cool put on a wrestling clinic.Diesel had control throughout the match.He even managed to Jackknife Undertaker twice.But did not follow up.When he hit the third power bomb,he tried to go for a pin.As he bent down the Deadman caught him by the throat and chokeslammed him to the canvas.After a tombstone,it was all over for Big Daddy Cool.HBK vs Bret Hart is the best match of all time.Lets start with Shawn's entrance flying of the top of the building into the crowd.Even though,Bret should have retained the title.HBK won the WWE title at WrestleMania XII.Shawn also had a chance to win titles at WrestleMania X,XI and XX.All i can say,'It pays to patient'.Therefore,my favorite WrestleMania is WrestleMania XII.Hope you like my summary.

There only two great club teams in the world Manchester Utd & Manchester Utd Reserves
I like a few teams:one is Chelsea because recently there are good, hence they just won the EPL with the 3-0 victory over Manchester United. But I don't like Drogba on that team, because he is a cheater and always falls down trying to get the call. I like Arsenal because I think Thierry Henry is a player that is always able to get past defenders and score. I like Barcelona because Ronaldinho is on that team and is able to do tricks and still do well. I like AC Milan and Real Madrid because they have some good players but I dont like the fact that they can't use those players well enough to win their leagues. So I will have to say my favorite team is Bayern Munchen...though I change my mind often.

I would agree that there is a certain unfairness about having different-sized divisions, for the reasons you stated.  However, both the AL and NL have to have a even number of teams for scheduling purposes.  If things were evened out and both leagues had 15 - 3 divisions of 5 - then either there would have to be an interleague game every day, instead of at certain periods of the year, or one team in each league would have to be idle for a day or more likely 3 days at a stretch - the equivalent of scheduling a series against a null team.\n\nThe only ways to fix it would be to either go back to the old divisional set up - two 8-team divisions in the NL and two 7-team divisions in the AL, or expand the AL by two teams, so that both leagues have 16, and go to four 4-team divisions.

You can go on the web and check a search engine, like Google and check sports card shops that specialize in buying and selling sports items.  This is usually a good start.  They have a good pulse on the going rate.  Good luck.

No worry!  Even in college you won't know what you want to major in.  The average college student changes majors 2 times in their college tenure.  Just start to think about what types of things you enjoy and could be hapy doing as a career.  Do something that will make you happy.  You spend more time at work then you do with friends and family so be sure to pick something that you enjoy and puts you around people you enjoy too.  Good luck!
You can buy anti-fog goggles for a little more than regular goggles.
This will be the deciding game of the champions league semi-final. It will be a really important game for barcelona fans as they have almost won their home league already so this will be a very important game. You won't get tickets for more than 400 euros anywhere.
Jose Mourinho would be ordinary, mediocre, trivial, boring IF not for his professional arrogance. I have the highest respect for the man, his achievements, his style, his vision for the game. He has achieved for Chelsea FC what no other manager/coach has done. CONGRATULATIONS for winning the Premiership again (it's in the bag!)

Because here in america is just F#$%ing politics, money, oil, u know. I guess  some dont see the meaning and love of the game. U want to know about a real sport and want to learn how to touch a ball? just watch SOCCER a real sport.
Why do you ask? Why do you care? Why should anyone become one just like that? Why don't you become a Jew or a Taoist jsut because someone tells you to?
Yup, when tey were played in the USA. In 94, USA v Romania, and v Colombia, both at the Rose Bowl. Cameroon v Sweden in the Rose Bowl, Brazil v Cameroon, at Sandford Stadium, Romania v Argentina at the Rose Bowl, Brazil v Sweden at the Rose, also the thrid and final, with Swedena v Bulgaria, and Italy and Brazil. Also the Womens World Cup Third place ,Canada v USA at Carson City at the Home Depot Stadium. In fact I even met the Cameroon National Team, as they practice down the street at Oxnard College in Oxnard , California, and stayed at the resort my mother worked at, Mandaly Beach. I would Never Forget It.
Don't worry about game line up. At that age, they just run behind the ball all over the field. Let them have fun.

"Yes.\n\nI agree with some of the other comments on here that WELL-DONE commentary can add to the experience of the sporting event on television.   However, the operative word is ""WELL-DONE.""  I don't think that most commentary done on television these days is done WELL anymore at all.  \n\nConsider Dick Vitale.  He's got a mind of his own.  I love listening to Dick...""You can't stop him...you can only hope to contain him!""  or ""He's epiflectic, baby!""  Dick Vitale IS the charismatic, enthusiastic voice of the Big Dance.  His commentary is done WELL.\n\nYour opinions may vary.  But I'm the guy who really enjoyed HGTV's presentation of the Tournament of Roses Parade for several years because they offered it WITHOUT commentary (sadly, they added commentators this year).   I'm the guy who watches the State of the Union address on C-Span because I don't need the commentators to regurgitate what I just saw with my own eyes and heard with my own ears."

i cant believe the basic idiocy of some people on here!top 6 teams qualify for champs league my arse! if u dont know dont answer! most top european leagues have 4 teams entering, but some have 3,2 or even just 1. all teams are not guarenteed to get into the group stages, in most cases the 1st and 2nd placed teams would automatically be in the groups, but some leagues(for example the welsh and irish leagues) the winners have to go through the qualifying rounds.

As a mountain bike mechanic, I typically recommend this to my customers...\n\nAll bike tires will come with a range listed on the side with hybrids typically being between 60-100 psi.  It is important to adjust the tire pressure to the type of terrain you are riding.  If you are primarly riding on the road, I would look to inflate the tire to as close to the maximum pressure as possible.  This will give you the best surface contact and best speed/acceleration.  If you are doing a more rail trail style where you will be on a crushed limestone style path or a packed, unpaved surface, I would recommend deflating to the middle of the range or the upper 3/4 of the range.  If you have decided to take the hybrid off road more and choose to ride a more mountain bike style terrain I would use the lower end of the range.  \n\nIt is important not to under inflate your tires because the pressure on them could cause the tube to pop or you could experience what is called a pinch flat, where your tire gets stuck between 2 rocks and pops.  But also make sure not to inflate the tire beyond capacity because you can pop the tire under too much pressure.  But by following the above guidelines, you should be good to go.

1. past performances. look at the horse's past races. compare races to see if the horse is improving from race to race or if the horse is inconsisant. also, check to see if a new equipment is added to a horse (such as blinkers or shadowrolls) sometimes, it will improve/hinder a horse's performance. see if the horse is running longer or shorter than it usually does.\n2. look at the horse's physically features. look at their gait before the jockey mounts. look at the horse's body language and see if the horse WANTS to race. but then again, a horse that is bouncing all over the place usually won't do well in med/long distance races. \n3. for horses that are new in racing: pedigree, dosage, trainer. check the sire & dam & the trainer. some trainers just have knack of training good 2 year olds and other trainers are good at the fillies.\n4. check the morning line odds. the favorite is at lowest odds for a reason. ;)\n5. if all else fails.... throw darts at the program. :P

First off are you using your spinning reel or a bait caster? If your using the spinning reel you shouldn't get a backlash unless the line is just falling off the reel, in that case you may want to try a different line and I belive the person above answered pretty well on a bait caster. You can use what they call a screw-in weight or a slip sinker booth of these sinkers you will put your line through the sinker and then tie your hook, you can probably get bullet weights at walmart or kmart stores( slip sinker). The screw-in type sinkers you will have to go to dick's sporting goods, gander mountain, Basspro, or Cabella's. For line I would recommend Fire line ( a Braid) or if you can get access to some new line they just came out with last year called GAMMA line ( it's like a mono) but is extremely stong I have used it and I'm verry pleased with it, I used 8 lb. test and caught two under docks and had no problem hauling them out. I fish in local tournments in Western NY. Also fish the Walmart BFL in NY and Virginia. If your close and want to go fishing some time drop me a line ( bmck33@yahoo.com). hope this helps you some, Bill

I'm sitting at home on Saturday night answering questions on Yahoo Answers, what do you think?
When the World Series started (1903), the USA was the only country that seriously played baseball. The American champion was the de facto world champion.
In the sport of cricket an over is a series of six consecutive balls bowled by a single bowler. No bowler is allowed to bowl in consecutive overs.\n\nSpecifically, an over must consist of six legal deliveries. No balls and wides do not count as one of the six balls in an over.\n\nIn one-day cricket bowlers are restricted to the total number of overs they may bowl in a match and the length of the game is determined by the total number of overs bowled (usually 40 or 50 per innings). In Test and county cricket, teams are usually required to bowl a minimum number of overs per day to prevent spoiling of the game by a slow over rate.\n\nEach consecutive over is bowled from the opposite end of the pitch ensuring that both batsmen face the bowling.\n\nA maiden over is one in which no runs are scored.\n\nTactical considerations in bowling overs\n\nThe over is a fundamental unit in the tactical planning of the fielding side. Since a single bowler has six, and only six, legal balls before another bowler must bowl, he typically plans to use those six balls to set up a pattern of play designed to get a batsman out. For example, bowling a few balls with a repetitive line, length, or spin, followed by a variation designed to surprise the batsman.\n\nEarly in the over the bowler may tempt the batsman into scoring runs by providing balls that are relatively easy to hit. If the batsman takes the bait, the bowler can follow up with a variation designed either to hit the wicket or induce a catch. A batsman still in aggressive run-scoring mode may make a mistake playing the ball and end up losing his wicket.\n\nThe captain of the fielding team decides which bowler will bowl any given over (subject to the restriction that no bowler may bowl two overs in succession). Generally two bowlers will alternate overs from opposite ends of the pitch, until one tires or becomes ineffective, at which point the captain will replace that bowler with another. A period of bowling every second over like this is called a spell of bowling.\n\nTactical considerations in batting\n\nIf the two batsmen are not similar, tactical considerations may affect their play. If one batsman is stronger than the other, they may attempt to engineer their scores so that the stronger batsman faces the bowling more often. This may take the form of the stronger batsman trying to score an even number of runs on early balls in the over and an odd number on the last ball; the weaker batsman will attempt the reverse, and the bowler will try to disrupt this pattern.\n\nIf one batsman is right-handed and the other left-handed, they may try to score odd numbers of runs to disrupt the bowling pattern and tire the fielders by making them reposition themselves frequently.\n\nHistorical number of balls per over in Test cricket\n\nModern day Test cricket (since 1979/80) has been played all over the world with six balls per over. However, Test cricket started with 4 balls per over and has had varying number of balls per over around the world upto 1979/80.\n\nBalls per over\n\nIn England\n\n1880 to 1888: 4 \n1890 to 1899: 5 \n1902 to 1938: 6 \n1939  : 8 \n1946 to date: 6 \n\nIn Australia\n\n1876/77 to 1887/88: 4 \n1891/92 to 1920/21: 6 \n1924/25  : 8 \n1928/29 to 1932/33: 6 \n1936/37 to 1978/79: 8 \n1979/80 to date  : 6 \n\nIn South Africa\n\n\n1891/92 to 1898/99: 5 \n1902/03 to 1935/36: 6 \n1938/39 to 1957/58: 8 \n1961/62 to date  : 6 \n\nIn New Zealand\n\n1929/30 to 1967/68: 6 \n1968/69 to 1978/79: 8 \n1979/80 to date  : 6 \n\nIn Pakistan\n\n1954/55 to 1972/73: 6 \n1974/75 to 1977/78: 8 \n1978/79 to date  : 6 \n\nIn India, West Indies, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and United Arab Emirates (venue, not host) all Test matches were played with 6 ball overs.

Lean back and relax. THink of your lungs as a balloon.  As long as there is air in your body, you will float.  The trick is not to panic.  If you do, your body will take in shorter amounts of air, and it will be a lot harder to stay afloat.  Just relax and take in big and slow breaths.  Try it in the shallow end until you feel more comfortable.
Yes it does happen but I think less often these days.  \n\nIn the extreme exertion of a marathon the body loses fluids, electrolytes (salts) and tends to overheat.  If a runner gets to a state of extreme dehydration and exhaustion the muscles that retain the 'poo' simply let go involuntarily.\n\nWith more knowlegeable runners, proper diet and hydration I think that this phenomena is now mostly behind us.
Most local gun smiths can take care of that or know where to send it. I take mine to Gander Mountain to have it done.. they send it out but they do a nice job.

hard question. see, a lot of people doubt portugal and iran, but i am pretty sure they can make a huge comeback this year. mexico is a great team, but there are many good teams this world cup. so technically, i do not believe that mexico will win the world cup, but they have a good chance. also, i do not think brazil will win it this time because many players are starting to give up, like ronaldo. this will be his last year in the soccer career.

What always worked for my kids teams was a picnic. Depending on what your budget is, you could bring in something like fried chicken and some salads and chips, or if you have no budget, pack a grill and bring some hot dogs, burgers and have parents bring a dish to pass. The kids love the opportunity to run around and play while the parents talk and you can even schedule a parents against the kids baseball game if you find a park with a backstop (The kids really enjoy beating mom and dad's team and, trust me, you will talk about it for weeks).\nAnd don't forget some awards ... give the kids something to put on a shelf that always reminds them of this season and great time in their lives.
Thierry Henry OWES it to Wenger to stay at Arsenal. Henry was a nobody at Juve, playing as a winger. He came to Arsenal & was put as a forward & look at how dangerous he is now! Wenger believed in him back then & held on to him when nobody else wanted him... It's only because of Arsene Wenger that Henry is such a star. He should stay at Arsenal! Hope they win the Champions League final though!\n\nGO GUNNERS!
*rises to the bait, as a Spurs fan* ;-)\n\nSeeing as the club probably has 30,000 regular visitors to White Hart Lane, each week, and many many more supporters (it's supposed to be in the top 5 of supported clubs in the English Premier League), then you make a bold claim. Do you claim to say that you've met a majority of these people, and can verify that each is an idiot? That would imply that at the very minimum you have met 15,000 Spurs fans, and have been struck by their idiocy.\n\nI think the asker has pre-existing bias against Spurs, and should be examined for the Arsenal-virus in his blood, and held in quarantine till he responds to treatment ;-)
Depends what the event is.

"this isnt meant to dash your hopes at all, but youve got a HUGE road ahead of you.  the only positive is that you are a catcher.  there is a ""shortage"" of quality catchers throughout college, minor, and major leagues.  i found during actual tryouts that teams are looking for the long ball hitter.  they have all but given up on defense and consistant hitting.  \nyou also have the ""supply & demand"" arguement as well.  anyone who needs a catcher will ""pick you up"".  i think any college you can get to will be the right step in getting where you need to go."

Hell yeah.\n\nI know it's too obvious, but Elton Brand. Maybe in the future it will be Livingston, when he begins to reach his potential, but right now it has to be Brand. He is too much on both sides of the ball and could have been named MVP this year.
when u flick the board make sure that u rnt flicking to the corner of the board in a downward motion, make sure u flick closer to the center of the board pulling your foot up and then pulling it down to the board practice just landing with front foot and then just landing with back foot and then conbine the 2 to make your kickflip
"The muscles most worked when biking are the ""quads"" and the hamstrings in otherwords your upper leg.Cross one leg over the other while standing, feet flat, and slowly try to touch your toes.

With the other grasp the ankle, bend at the knee and the ankle should stretch towards the butt."

"All sports, including college, are all about the money.  With the amount of loyalty franchises seem to show players that have given the best of their careers to them it is no wonder that athletes have become money first.  In an erra when Mike Piazza can become a Met or Junio Seau can become a Dolphin I personally don't blame athletes for being ""me first"".\n\nThe only difference in college sports is that the stars don't get a piece of the unbelievable amounts of money."

I am a Cub fan but I don't blame Bartman for losing the NLCS. I think a lot of the other Cub fans just want to blame someone other then the team for losing the game. I watched that game and Bartman wasn't responsible for blowing the game that night. I love the Cubs and I support them. But the Cubs lost the game not Bartman. Fans just don't want to admit that.
It helps, me and my friends skated for a few months, i skated about three times a week, just went around my neighborhood, to the shopping centers, just went around for the fun of it, and lost about 25 pounds in 3 months, same for him.  so yes, skateboarding will help.
Normally Ronaldinho starts at the left depending on the formation Parreira uses. Zé Roberto also plays on the left but in a more defensive position.
Giants are much improved on defense and if they get Arrington they'll even be better the game will also be home for them in the Meadowlands. The Colts lost their star running back and it's not known if anyone can fill it. Peyton Manning got exposed against the Chargers and Steelers. With all that being said I say the Colts by 3! Ha ! Vinitari kicks game winner.
During a fall, a cat can reflexively twist its body and right itself using its acute sense of balance and flexibility. This is known as the cat 'righting reflex'. It always rights itself in the same way, provided it has the time to do so during a fall. Certain breeds that don't have a tail are a notable exception, since a cat moves its tail and relies on conservation of angular momentum to set up for landing.
Amare Stoudemire was a bust, but T-Mac didn't do so great either.
I agree with Joe Thortnon IF San Jose can make it at least through the 2nd round.  And this is coming from a Bruins fan! Thank you management for kicking us while we were down.  It wasn't enough to have a lousy season but trading our two best guys for mediocre players is just the icing on the cake!!
"its like the old days when they only had a radio and/or the radio was a big part of their lives...my grandpa still likes to hear stories on the radio  (which I didn't even know existed) because they used to listen to it when they were kids- reminds him of the ""good times"" :)"
Trek/GF had a major problem with their chainlines a few years back, they didn't make them to the specs required by Shimano in order to ensure perfect chainline running. \nSo on smaller frames (where the differences were more noticible) they had big problems. The only reason the World Cup MTBers went ok is because the Trek mechanics filed off the BB shell.\n\nMy point is go for Specialized. They look way cooler too :)

Yes. Ottawa,Calgary and Montreal are all likely to qualify, Toronto are alson in with a shot to get into the play offs, \n\nToronto are on a hot steak at the moment and if they qualify they are in with a good shot\n\nMontreal have been playing very well at the moment and will definetly hold onto the 7th playoff spot and have a chance to go on to the final of the Conferance\n\nCalgary are not the team they were before the playoffs that said if they qualify they are definitely in with a shot\n\nOttawa have excellant goal tending defence and attack and are one of the best teams in the NHL  and are odds on to be the conferance winners, they are definately in with a shot\n\nThis could be the year that the jinx on the Canadian teams that has been there since 1993 will be lifted

I think its a country club for old people, certainly nothing to do with football. Not as we know it, anyway.
Have always been a good putt. I tend to think all golf swings are the same including putter, that is you have to keep you head still and eye fix at the ball. I've played snooker before and I think it helps. \n\nWith putt, first you read the line, the slope and the grass, then align your ball path, give it a point where you want your ball to stop (e.g. if it's uphill you want the ball to stop after the hole, and down before the hole, break left right of the hole, and right left of the hole). Then, you pretty must know where your target is (like you would any golf shot), then execute it by eye fix on the ball, and have a good swing. Once you made up your mind on the target line, nothing else would help except positive thinking, just hit the shot as planned. Picture every putts go into the hole, that's the only way it should be done, into the hole.
True dat bro (I wrestle in high school.) Sick of all this WWE giving the true sport a bad name.
"Unfortunately, explanations of caliber and bore can differ, depending upon your particular purpose (even within the context of firearms).\n\n   Caliber, as a standard of measure, is given in tenths of an inch, though for technical purposes, thousandths of an inch are also given. Some will state that this later case is not correct.\n\n Example:\n   an M1 Garand fires a bullet having a diameter of .308""\n   an AK-47 fires a bullet having a diameter of .311""\n   They are both referred to as being .30 caliber rifles.\n\n   The bore of the gun is the inside of the barrel (like a ""hole,"" it's not actually anything concrete, but where stuff is missing) it can also refer to the inside walls of the barrel (""there is rust in the bore"")\n\n   Most barrels have rifling, which is also described as ""Lands and grooves"" the lands are the areas sticking up, and the groves are the areas pressed (or cut) away.\n   If you imagine a cross-section of a gun barrel now, you would see something like a circle with a ""gear tooth"" edge. (remember that the metal is on the outside of this shape, not inside it) You could draw one circle touching the tops of the lands, following the inside shape (cutting off the teeth), and one circle touching the bottoms of the grooves (making the circle as big as the teeth).\n   The diameter of the smaller circle (measured from the tops of the lands) is the Bore Diameter. It is the largest round thing you could pass through the barrel, without having to miss-shape it to make it fit.\n   The diameter of the larger circle (taken from the bottoms of the groves) is the Groove Diameter. This represents pretty much the largest thing you can pass through the barrel, and whatever you push through it, will be cut, or pressed into by the lands of the barrel sticking up, in its way. Bullets, for the most part, are this diameter.\n   Caliber USUALLY refers to this larger size, and thus, too the diameter of the bullets used in the barrel too.\n\n   To give an example (I think these numbers are correct, but I have not verified them):\n   If you have a .30-06, the bullet 308/1000 of an inch (.308"") passes through the barrel, which has a BORE of .300"" and a grove diameter of .308"".\n   If you have a .50 BMG, the bullet .510"" passes through a barrel with a bore of .500"", and a groove diameter of .510""\n\n   Unless you are involved in some technical aspect respecting firearms, most people will use the bullet's diameter ""Caliber"" to describe both the barrel and the bullet, because one number for everything is much easier for everyone involved.\n\n\n   As for bullets and weird sizes, I'll add to that: Why do they use numbers that don't reflect anything accurately?\n   You will find, in many cases, that weapons firing bullets of seemingly similar calibers, even if from different cartridges, are, in fact, the same caliber bullet. Markets usually don't reinvent the wheel. The .30-06, .308, .300 Win Mag, and .30-30 (I believe) all use the same .308"" standard. similarly, 6mm and .243 cartridges are using the same caliber, and most center-fire (not rim-fire) .22s are using the .224"" bullet. These include the .22-250, .220 Swift, .223 Remington (aka 5.56mm x45/NATO) and more.\n   I've always found it interesting to note that, while it makes sense to round .308"" to a nice, round ""thirty,"" that the actual metric equivalent to that is 7.82mm, and that the no-less-complex 7.62 is simply a nice, round ""thirty"" in inches.\n   Despite what I state here, if you're dealing with foreign cartridges, you will often find them using similar but different actual diameters. (the British .303 is something like .312"" and the AK-47 is .311"" I believe)\n   Also worth mentioning is that the .38 is a .357"" and the .44 is a .429"". Sometimes they're not that close.\n   The best advice I can give you"

It completely depends on how much you want to get into it.  for example, some people like to buy jerseys, shoes, pants and other unnecessary things to improve their game.  The basics include a gun, which ranges from the prices of 50 dollars to 2000 dollars.  A mask, which can range from 15 dollars to 120 dollars.  a gas tank, which ranges from 60 dollars to 600 dollars respectivly. a hopper to hold your ammo, which can range from 5 dollars to 120 dollars depending on what gun you have, the hopper you would want to get is either electric (more expensive) or not electric (less excpensive)  these are the essentials.  Then you need to buy paintballs, which can range from 40 dollars to 70 dollars a box (2 thousand paintballs) there are cheap quality and good quality.  You can usually buy these at your local fields.  Then you need to pay for admission, and when you have the gear, it usually costs at most 30 dollars. (including all day admission and all day unlimited gas refills)  you can buy all this gear at www.paintballgear.com these are the same prices as a store, but if you want you can go to the store, ask about what they recommend, and they can order it for you.

Albert Pujols is the one with the highest possibility.  He is young (26), powerful (avg. 40 HR), make good contact (5-yr avg .333), didn't strike out much (avg. 60 per season).  And he is very consistant.  If Cardinals can have better hitters in from of him, he can get more RBIs.  RBI is his weakest category now.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I think so.  In football, especially, I think its important to go with dominant guys for short periods more than longevity records.  He was the best player on a team that won two Super Bowls.  That should be enough.

Everyone who said the Braves is correct. They have actually reached the postseason every year from 1991 to 2005, except for 1994. As someone mentioned earlier, nobody made the postseason in '94 because of the strike. But the Braves can still claim 14 straight division titles.

In my opinion, the question has to be answered by choosing a great player per position. How can I compare a defender with a scorer, when both have totally different assignments on the field. So I will name the greatest player per position:\nGreatest Defender: Franz Beckenbauer\nGreatest Midfielder: Diego Maradona\nGreatest Foward: Edson do Nacimento (Pele)\n\nEach of these players have redefined their positions, defined their era, and won world cups for their countries.

legendary dodger great kirk gibson was going for a pop fly and he fell down and when he did, a can of corn that someone threw out onto the field got stuck up his butt and it was a very embarassing situation for the gibson's and the dodger organization.  thus, everytime there is an easy pop fly, they say can of corn to make light of the situation.

"The 2014 FIFA World Cup will provisionally take place in Brazil. On March 7, 2003 FIFA announced that the cup would be held in South America for the first time since Argentina hosted it in 1978, in line with its policy of rotating the right to host the World Cup amongst the different confederations. On March 17 the CONMEBOL associations voted unanimously to adopt Brazil as their sole candidate. The final decision as to hosting will be made sometime in 2008. However, on April 13, 2006 Sepp Blatter said that does not necessarily mean that the tournament would be in Brazil. ""For the time being, I don't think Brazil has a stadium for the Cup."" But it should be noted, that he had only visited stadiums in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Porto Alegre. Blatter also brought up the topic of co-hosting, suggesting that Argentina and Chile launch a joint bid.\n\nFor Brazil to host the 2014 World Cup, the country would need a lot of investment in security and infrastructure."

A few simple things will go a long way. Stay active all summer so you get in great shape. Work on staying low when you start and getting up to speed very quickly. You can do jumping drills to help get more explosive. Also work on your sprinting form, learn about proper form and train with a friend so you help each other out. Better form and a better start mean a lot for the 40.\n\nRunning a 40, resting 20 seconds then running another, resting 20 and running another, then taking a few minutes rest is also a drill that some of the college kids use before the NFL combine.
Fit and slightly muscular. It'll take quite a bit of energy to run up and down the fields shouting yourself hoarse. Also, if it's stunting, you'd need to be even more fit/muscular because you'd have to support the cheerleaders at the top. To be the cheerleader at the top, you'd have to be small in physique, thin and less than 100 pounds so that the other girls can support you.\n\nI hope this helped.=)

You don't need to be at any specific level physical fitness to begin training. Training in itself will work on your fitness and get you where you need to be to compete (if that's what you're looking for). You just need to find a good teacher who can work with you and help you reach your goals.\n\nNever be afraid to start a marital arts program just because you feel that you are not fit enough. One of the main points in training is that it will help you to become fit, and as you do your confidence will improve.
Vick is and will remain better.  Vick can be a pocket passer it's just Atlanta never had any receivers who were good so he had no options...with Crumpler, he can pick apart an offense.  He can read defenses better than Young will ever be able to. And even when he can begin to do that in a game situation, defensive coordinators will just play a plain, vanilla scheme in the first half and after halftime, just throw all kinds of different looks at him to confuse the crap out of him.  NFL teams are athletic enough to put a spy on him and defensive tackles are smart enough to plug up the middle so he can't run, unlike USC's sorry OLIne in the Rose Bowl.  \nSo, it's not that Vick is so much better, it's just that Young will be that much worse.  Too bad, he's a good guy.
Slap in the face to Michael. Lebron is to young to determine and Kobe is to one dimensional, and not to mention people hate Kobe, Michael was loved by all.

locktheglock...I dont think the game of cricket has anything to do with speaking/writing english. If you think so you are a hell of a racist, I know where you are coming from. \n\nAnyways, getting back to the question, I think over the years Austrailan cricket team is getting a little better over verbal abuse. If we are talking about the time before 2004, Austrial cricketers did use foul language on the ground despite the fact that ICC doesn't allow it. Anyways, from what I have seen in last year, they are calming down. The verbal abuse has gotten lesser.
"""Eriksson has included Theo Walcott, who has yet to make a Premiership appearance for Arsenal, in his squad alongside Michael Owen, Wayne Rooney and Aaron Lennon - but there are NO places for Ledley King, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Jermaine Defoe or Darren Bent"".\n\nSource: www.soccernet.com\n\nHere is the line-up:\n\n• Goalkeepers: Robinson (Tottenham), James (Manchester City), Green (Norwich) \n\n• Defenders: G Neville (Manchester United), R Ferdinand (Manchester United), Terry (Chelsea), A Cole (Arsenal), Campbell (Arsenal), Carragher (Liverpool), Bridge (Chelsea) \n\n• Midfielders: Beckham (Real Madrid), Carrick (Tottenham), Lampard (Chelsea), Gerrard (Liverpool), Hargreaves (Bayern Munich), Jenas (Totenham), Downing (Middlesbrough), J Cole (Chelsea), Lennon (Tottenham) \n\n• Forwards: Rooney (Manchester United), Owen (Newcastle), Crouch (Liverpool), Walcott (Arsenal). \n\n• Standby players: Scott Carson, Luke Young, Nigel Reo-Coker, Jermain Defoe, Andy Johnson.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefoe is on I guess the ""waiting list"" or rather on ""standby"". He got replaced by that 16-17 year-old kid Walcott. To think that kid hasn't even played in ONE premier league game--yet. Like what in the hell??? \n\nWhat a wanker Errikson is huh?"
i guess khali might win..however undertaker is a legend and will surely put up a great fight and upset odds..
I can recommend an Asian club if you're good.
There is no pay for ball kids.  They are volunteers, and some of them are junior tennis players that want to get closer to the athletes.  They usually give the ball kids a free lunch, tennis clothing representing the tournament, and sometimes they can get a private autograph session after a player has finished with their interviews.
the surgeons repositioned all the fragments of bone back into the position they should have been in and then stabilized the bones with a plate and 27 screws. so far he seems to be doing alright but there's still a 50/50 chance, with them hoping he doesn't develop infections or rebreak the bones.

Er, theyr not.
Definetly the toss should have the impact on the result. If you take at a look at the statistics about Sabina Park, Kingston - the team who fielded first has won the match more times. The pitch is hardest as well as pacy. Lot of movements will be their and ball will not easily come to the bat on the very first hour of the match, moreover it will be very difficult to play easy shots.\n\nA player like Sreesanth can get more support from this kind of pitch.

What is SST PURE? \n\nSST PURE® is a patented process of shaft alignment that analyzes a golf shaft to find its most stable orientation. Using proprietary patent-pending computer software and sensitive data-acquisition sensors, the SST PURE Shaft Alignment System quickly locates the “neutral” plane in each shaft. By assembling the club with the shaft in this SST PUREd position, off-line twisting and bending during the golf swing and at impact are greatly minimized. The SST PURE system also generates a printout for each shaft, showing its structural and performance analysis. \n\nWhy do shafts need to be PUREd? \n\nLike snowflakes and fingerprints, no two golf shafts are exactly the same. Every shaft contains irregularities in straightness, roundness and stiffness that are inherent to the manufacturing process. These structural inconsistencies can negatively or positively affect a shaft’s performance depending on how the shaft is aligned in the clubhead. SST PURE locates the most stable orientation in any shaft. \n\nThe SST PURE process works on any shaft, regardless of its material; steel, graphite, even boron or thermoplastic shafts benefit from the SST PURE process. \n\nWhat are the performance benefits of the SST PURE process? \n\nThe result of the SST PURE process is that players of all skill levels hit the ball longer, straighter and more uniformly consistent than ever before. Independent testing on players of all skill level has established that SST PURE improves impact repeatability on the center of the clubface by up to 51 percent. Clubs that have been PUREd have a softer feel than randomly installed shafts, which is the current standard for club assembly.

elliott did a little stage dive at the speed stage during trackside live friday night.  jeff hammond jumps each year so something and talked elliott into jumping as well.  jeff cleared the stage and the fence b/t the stage and the fans.  elliott hit his head on the fence or something.  he is okay and will be racing.\nit was all around awkward!  hopefully they won't be doing that again.  don't you know robert yates had a few things to say to elliott after that.
I'm a fan of ray too but no offense, i think jeff gets this one. Rey does a lot of crazy stuff out there in the ring and sure does have a big heart.

Hi: John Naismith was an early dual citizen. In Canada\n we tend to adapt anyone we can as our own. Steve Nash\n was born in Johannesborg S Africa, lived for a time in MY\n home town, Regina Saskatchewan, Canada, then, moved to\n Victoria, British Columbua, Canada. We also sort of claim:\n golfer Steven Aimes, tennis doubles man Daniel Nestor\n and Heavyweight Champion Lennox Lewis, who claims several \ncitizenships. So basketball originated right here in Canada.

The Astro's deserve credit for what they have done. I lived in Houston over fourteen years(79-93) and all the sports teams were always saying - wait till next year. Got sick and tires of hearing that. After I moved the Rockets won back to back NBA titles(which was great). I know live in Webb City, Mo. and mostly St Louis fans here. It was great for Houston to beat St Louis last year in playoffs.

Yes, they want to build a new stadium in Miami but want the state or local gov't to help with funding. So far, the Marlins have been rebuffed by the city and state and have been entertaining the idea of moving the team to Las Vegas or Portland, OR. However, two Miami Senators are gathereing support to attach a $60M sales-tax subsidy that would help the NBA's Orlando Magic finance their new arena. Stay tuned...
lol, what a great idea.

Change the entire defence, or at least get some back up. Those old legs can't run forever. Maldini and Cafu have to go. Full credit to them for their illustrious playing careers but I think its time for a coaching role.
Not now, but some day in the future.  Maybe 20 years, maybe 50, maybe 100.  Many performances previously thought unreachable are now quite common - the 4-minute mile, sub 10-second 100 meters, etc.  Athletic performances are continually improving, and I can think of no reason for that to stop.

Probably because neither team supporters want to loose. They can't blame their own team for not playing well so the referee cops it. No doubt that mistakes can be made by a ref but it goes both ways. They should look at their own players who didn't play well.

"In Game 1 of the 1954 series Mays made one of the greatest defensive plays of all time, a brilliant over-the-shoulder catch of a long drive by Vic Wertz, deep in centre field of the spacious Polo Grounds.

After the Giants' victory, Mays was announced as winner of the National League Most Valuable Player Award and the Hickok Belt as top professional athlete of the year."

I'll give him his due. To hold a guy that size up in the jackhammer is damn impressive. But as the most dominant I personally have ever seen? I don't think he really was as impressive as a lot of other guys when they were in their prime. Everyone knows about Andre's feats of strength (the guy used to pick up his friend's cars and turn them around the other way while they were in bars), and what's even scarier is he never showed people his full strength in the ring because he was afraid he'd hurt someone. Bruiser Brody's a guy who did whatever he wanted to whomever he wanted all across the world and is arguably the greatest brawler of all-time. He influenced the modern hardcore style, changed the finishes of matches in the ring and despite his opponents best efforts, they couldn't do a damn thing about it in the ring. Brody's partner in Japan, Stan Hansen, was another guy who some say was even meaner than Brody and was even more sucessful, holding the AWA world championship and the All-Japan Triple Crown 4 times; no other Westerner has held it more than 2 times. And when you're talking about dominance and intensity, you simply can't forget the Road Warriors, the single greatest tag team of all-time and the only duo to hold the AWA, NWA and WWF tag team titles in their career.\n\nAnd by the way, it was the February 9, 1998 episode of Monday Nitro where Goldberg got manhandled by William Regal.
jlowes12345\n4 days ago\n\n\n \n the bes beginner guns on the market are the tippmann 98 custom the custom pro, and the A-5 you can literally bang them against a brick wall and they will still work lie they came out of the box. a big bonus is that you can customize these guns to fit your style of play as you get more experienced. you can put on sniper barrels, drop in just about anything that will make you shoot faster, you can put on nitrogen without having to replace any parts, and so much more plus tippmann just came out with a new anti chop system for these guns so that means if a paintball gets stuck you can still shoot without having to clean your barrel. another thing is that you can field strip it and fix the gun if it malfunctions during a game. tippmann has made great strides in producing reliable, dependable, and cheap markers. i would recommend them to anyone even to people who have been playing longer than i have

"The genesis of the .410 does not coincide with the heyday of shotgun design, which occurred from circa 1850 to 1870. It wasn't until about 1900 that the cartridge is making its appearance in catalogs and the proof houses of England. No one today knows who invented it. There is a good amount of speculation that the .410 was originally a rifle caliber, the .444 Marlin. This is probably so, due to the rather recent discovery of older ""rook rifles"" that were originally rifles that were converted to shotgun use."
The England football team looks great on papers but never on the field. Rooney was the gifted player and with his absence i dont think they can win the world cup.

They never did. They were made by pacific cycles (the same company that makes all of the k-mart and target bikes) and sold under the Eddie Bauer brand. Nobody makes a decent 7speed bike any longer, just cheapos. If you need replacement parts try a local bike shop same for a second bike.

In the 400 it is a sprint.... but you have different phases of the race... your drive, hard stride, and kick... a huge mistake people make is they come out too slow and by that time the race is lost or they use too much energy i the beginning and die at the end only to get passed in the last few steps.  In the 4 people normally come out hard...hard stride the back stretch and kick at whatever distance they can ( 100, 150, 200)... The 100 hurdles just try to stay low to the hurdles and have a clean race, maintain good form and attack the hurdles... make sure your step after you jump the hurdle is used to keep momentum going so you aren't stopping and restarting and have fun!

I'm not a fan of knockoffs and I believe there are some differences.  It may be in the material or the construction of the club as well as the shafts used.  If you are starting out or haven't golfed much they would probably be ok.  I would strongly recommend going to a golf pro shop and play with the original clubs first then purchase the knockoff clubs. This way you will be able to determine any differences, and hopefully, the internet business you will be dealing with has a good return policy.

On February 20, 1998, that Raman Lamba, fielding close to the bat, copped one on the skull off the bat of Mehrab Hossain. Lamba, playing for Abahani Limited after retiring from a long first-class career with Delhi, had just come up to forward short leg, and did not wear a helmet, contending that he only had three balls to field in that position. \n\nMehrab, who would later go on to play for Bangladesh, was batting for Mohammedan and struck a short ball fiercely. The ball was hit with such power that it ricocheted off Lamba's head, and ballooned to Khaled Mashud, the wicketkeeper, who had to backpedal to take the catch. \n\nLamba, shaken and with an understandably nasty headache, dusted himself off, picked himself up and walked off the ground unassisted. When he reached the changerooms, the team doctor laid Lamba down, and gave him a glass of water to drink. By this time the hemorrhaging had begun. Finally, when the gravity of the situation became obvious, Lamba was taken to the Institute of Post Graduate Medicine and Research, then considered the best centre for neurology in Bangladesh. But by then, it was too late.

My team is the Buffalo Sabres and we just upset the heavily favoured Ottawa Senators in their own building last night. It was a fast-paced, high-scoring see-saw affair which required overtime to finally decide it. I've the feeling this whole best-of-seven series will play out in much the same way (better get my blood pressure checked, lol). So, in answer to your question, my team is doing just great, thanks! =)\n\nAnd you have a lovely weekend, too, Moon! :)

I think you should think & add another 10 points then they have a chance to win.
India loss to West Indies as after Kaif ,Sehwag No one played well they just came and got out and played very slowly i.e there strike rate was very low in the 15 overs wheas ithe batsmenb of other cricket nations hit in the last 15 overs indian batsmen play slowly , moreover the indian bowlers did not bowl good (Except for Bhajji) .

While books can be a valuable source of information, why not locate instructional videos? They are even more helpful, in that you can see the entire technique that's demonstrated (whether it be skating, shooting, defensive play, checking, and even conditioning). I'm sure the internet has a large number of hockey store sites that you can peruse. As a former hockey coach, I have a collection of both instructional hockey books and VCR's, and I tended to favor the tapes for getting tips on technique improvement.\nAs for the mental aspect of playing, I think that reading about successful players (and how they got to be successful) will be helpful to you - I'm sure the common denominator in all their stories will be hard work, talent, and more hard work. Take stock of your strengths and weaknesses, and focus on improving your weaknesses. Find someone who is knowledgable, like a player or coach, to help you with your training. And don't underestimate conditioning....make sure you get in proper playing shape. Off-ice training is a very important aspect of conditioning for hockey. Good luck.

only one i would get is the russian, shear pin is forged instead of stamped (chinease). freind found out the hard way. he took it to firing range fired a box thru it but he didnt know that on the last round the shear pin broke, he was in his bedroom and loaded a full thirty-round clip in it, pulled back the bolt to load the first round in the chamber. justr as soon as the bolt slammed the first round it went off (without him touching trigger) full-auto and emptied the whole banana clip thru his wall into neighbors living room!!!!!  as for accuracy, well lets just say, 100 just isnt a challenge. i was plinking things on the bullet stop behind the targets which were at least 250 yrds away and never has to raise the sights off lowest setting. ask any veitnam vet about the sks....they fear it. one vet told me you could take any given rifle in the woods, fire it, then fire an sks, and he could pick it out. they were simply out-gunned. m-16 was a .223...a mere high powered .22. sks is a (7.62x39) very close to a .30 caliber with more bullet mass and range. very formidable assault rifle. and the sks wasnt designed for fully automatic, it was a semi-auto feild infantry rifle, the full auto that shoots the same cartridge (7.62x39) is the ak-47, which is made by several diffrent countries; afganastan, turkey, china,and russia. its been about 8 years since i had mine but i was buying boxes of 20 at army surplus stores of imported russian non-corrosive hollow points for around 4.50 cents a box. and they are hunting legal.

i would say that bridge and neville were obvious choices, as to be honest, do you know any better english fullbacks? hargreaves seems to be in every squad, and i have no idea why, but dont worry, he wont actually play unless all the others fall ill or get injured. i think jenas is also a mistake and we should have picked another striker like defoe, as otherwise we have no real backup.
An at bat only consists of the time you are at the plate and get a hit or get out.  Therefore, if you are 3-10 and batting .300, you got on base 3 times via a hit and got out 7 times.  Now, your on base percentage does factor in walks and times that you are hit by a pitch.  Therefore, if you are 3-10 and batting 300 and have 4 walks, then your on base percentage is .500.  It is .500 because you went to the plate 14 times and got on base 7 of those times (3 hits and 4 walks) - half of the time you went to the plate you got on base.
Yes, pick teams that will go far in the cup so you dont need to switch players alot.

Players who play for any national team (such as England) have to be a citizen of that country, and not have played for any other countries.\n\nSo for the England team, they are all English, and all born in England, apart from Owen Hargreaves, who is Canadian, but because of passports and parents' nationalites could have chosen to play for England, Germany or Canada, and I think Scotland or Wales if he had chosen. Unfortunatley for England, he chose to play for them. He really is terrible!\n\nIf you mean English league teams, then the laws about these are dictated by EU law - any citizen of any EU country is free to work their chosen trade in any other EU country. This is the same for all EU countries and leagues (Spain, Italy, France etc etc).\n\nEach league has slightly different rules for non-EU players, depending on their countries labour laws and local decisions, but in England I don't think teams can field more than 3 non-EU passport holders in a team, and these palyers must play in a certain number of games each season, or their work permits are withdrawn.\n\nThere has been controversy in the past with football agents getting Portugese passports for Brazilians - allowing them to play in the EU without the restrictions that normally apply to Brazilian players.

Well contrary to public opinion...I'd pick Bonds. First I'd like to say I'm from Atlanta and have never lived near or in California and I'm not a huge Giants fan. That being said, lets take Canseco out because he is a snake who is profiting on ratting out players for doing exactly what he did. I wish nothing good for Canseco! That being said it's down to McGuire and Bonds. Assuming they both took steroids(which is a pretty safe assumption) lets look at their raw numbers. Bonds has 7 MVPs, 8 gold glove awards, and 13 all star games...all while batting .300 and having over 500 stolen bases. McGuire on the other hand has 0 MVPs, 1 gold glove, and 12 all star appearances...all while batting .263 and having 12 stolen bases. \nWhile people may not like Bonds as much...I think he is a much better athlete the McGuire and I'd be rooting for him to beat Ruth over the other 2 guys.

I believe there is a chance that we will eventually, however I would not say that it would make us win the world cup, cause teams create great players all the time and doens't mean they are gonna win the World Cup, look at Spain and England, and even Argentina hasn't won in awhile.  To win it takes a good mix of luck and talent.  Right now the closest thing we have to a possible Pele, or Maradona is Freddy Adu, and while I think he is a great player, I don't believe he will be as good as them, but he is developing nicely, he is only 15 or 16 I am not sure.
I am in level 4, have 12 medals & 12 trophy.\n\nGymnastics is a sport involving the performance of sequences of movements requiring physical strength, flexibility, and kinesthetic awareness, such as handsprings and handstands.\n\nIt developed from fitness and beauty practices used by the ancient Greeks, including skills for mounting and dismounting a horse, and circus performance skills. In ancient times the term implied exercise taken in the nude in the context of a gymnasium, a venue for intellectual and physical education.\n\nIt is often considered a dangerous sport, as the difficult acrobatic maneuvers often performed on equipment high above the ground puts the athlete at risk of serious injury.\n\nDisciplines\nModern gymnastics, as regulated by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique incorporates six distinct disciplines:\n\nArtistic gymnastics (further classified as Men's Artistic Gymnastics and Women's Artistic Gymnastics) \nRhythmic gymnastics \nSports aerobics \nSports acrobatics \nTrampolining \nGeneral gymnastics \nPower Tumbling \n\nOf these disciplines, the two sub-disciplines of artistic and rhythmic gymnastics are the best known, having been part of Summer Olympic Games competitions. Individual Trampoline has been included in the Summer Olympics since 2000.\n\nThe discipline of rhythmic gymnastics is competed only by women (although there is a new version of this discipline for men being pioneered in Japan, see Men's rhythmic gymnastics), and involves the performance of five separate routines with the use of five apparatus — ball, ribbon, hoop, clubs, rope — on a floor area, with a much greater emphasis on the aesthetic rather than the acrobatic. Rhythmic routines are scored out of a possible 20 points.\n\nSports aerobics  \nSports aerobics involves the performance of routines by individuals or pairs, emphasizing strength, flexibility, and aerobic fitness rather than acrobatic or balance skills. Routines are performed on a small floor area and generally last 60-90 seconds, being judged out of a total of 10 points. \n\nTrampolining  \nTrampolining consists of four events, individual, synchronized, double mini trampoline and power tumbling. Only individual trampoline is included in the Olympics. Individual routines involve a build-up phase during which the gymnast jumps repeatedly to achieve height, followed by a sequence of ten leaps without pauses during which the gymnast performs a sequence of aerial tumbling skills. Routines are marked out of a maximum score of 10 points. Additional points (with no maximum) can be earned depending on the difficulty of the moves. Synchronized trampoline is similar except that both competitors must perform the routine together and marks are awarded for synchronicity. Double mini trampoline involves a smaller trampoline with a run-up, two moves are performed and the scores marked in a similar manner to individual trampoline. Tumbling involves a sprung track, athletes must perform a succession of tumbling moves and are marked on difficulty and execution.\n \nGeneral Gymnastics  \nGeneral gymnastics, sometimes called group gymnastics, enables people of all ages and abilities to participate in performance troupes of 6 to more than 150 athletes. They perform synchronized, choreographed routines. Troupes may be all one gender or mixed. There are no age divisions in general gymnastics. The largest general gymnastics exhibition is the quadrennial World Gymnaestrada which was first held in 1939. \n\nArtistic Gymnastics  \nArtistic Gymnastics is usually divided into Men's (MAG) and Women's Gymnastics (WAG), each group doing different events; Men compete on Vault, Parallel Bars, the Pommel Horse, the Rings, the High Bar, and on the Floor, while women compete on Floor, Uneven Bars, Vault, and Beam. Though routines performed on each event may be short, they are physically exhausting and push the gymnast's strength, flexibility, endurance and awareness to th

Snooker is a billiards sport that is played on a large (12' × 6') baize-covered table with pockets in each of the four corners and in the middle of each of the long cushions. It is played using a cue, one white ball (the cue ball), 15 red balls and 6 colours: a yellow (worth 2 points), green (3 points), brown (4 points), blue (5 points), pink (6 points) and black ball (7 points). A player wins a frame of snooker by scoring the most points, through using the cue ball to pot all the red and coloured balls. A match consists of an agreed number of frames. Snooker is particularly popular in English-speaking countries (Britain, Ireland, Canada, Australia and South Africa), and there has recently been a surge of interest in East Asia, with players from Hong Kong, China and Thailand entering the rankings. It's also very popular in Pakistan and India.
Both the shows are basically the same.It is only that the styars are different.The concept is the same.Also with the draft lottery the stars of the two shows keep getting interchanged therefore not leaving much of a difference between the two shows.

I would definitely say Steven Gerrard is in the best position to lead the English.\n\nDavid Beckham does not command the respect of his teammates. He doesn't inspire at all cos he doesn't have pace, can't dribble, can't tackle and is basically good for nothing except sending in curling shots and crosses. \n\nGerrard can do much more. He can take the free kicks well, maybe not as well as Beckham but already excellent. He can shoot from distance from open play - just look at how many times he has scored. He can defend as well.\n\nAnd most importantly, he can inspire and commands tremendous amounts of respect from all those around him: just look at last year's Champs League finals against AC Milan and this year's FA Cup finals against West Ham. Look at how he rallied Liverpool to come back from 3 and 2 goals down respectively, and ultimately triumph on penalties. This is definitely good enough testimony to prove Gerrard's worth to England. For that, he should be made captain.\n\nWell, as for Beckham, how many times has he inspired victories? Furthermore he's been fluctuating drastically in form ever since he moved to Madrid. Even before the move, he was playing terribly at Man Utd. In fact, he was quite useless at Utd but just had to be fielded cos he was captain.\n\nSo lesson to learn is, ditch Beckham as captain of England so that he need not play!\n\nLet Gerrard wear the armband and lead England to the World Cup!

"The owner moved in the cover of the night with the Colts. Indy offered them a better stadium and a way to make more money. So the moving vans pulled up and were loaded late at night. They kept their name because it was theirs to began with. Now with the Baltimore Ravens they had been the Cleveland Browns. Then owner Art Modell a few months after promising that he would never move the team announced late in the season that they were moving to Baltimore. Yeah Baltimore just basically pulled the same move of building a better stadium. Modell couldn't get a better one in Cleveland and was enticed to move to Baltimore, who had been without a team since the Colts left. The city of Cleveland SUED to keep the name and history of the ""Browns."" That is why they kept the name and Baltimore didn't. As to the Cleveland Browns the NFL decided to expand again a few years later to add Cleveland again. As to why no team was moved in instead, simple Commissioner Tagliabue was against further moving of teams after Cleveland was moved to Baltimore. Remember that was shortly after both teams moved out of L.A.(Raiders to Oakland and Rams to St. Louis) as well ant the Oilers left Houstan(now the Titans.)"

First of all the slap shot is by far the most overrated shot in hockey.  If you watch any game higher than say bantam the defencemen are the only ones that really take slap shots.  If you have a wicked wrist shot and a snapper you shouldn't be playing back on D leaving you with next to no reason to even use a slap shot.  As a goalie, I know that the problem with the slap shot is that it's so predictable from a shorter distance and much easier for a goalie to stop than a snapper or a wrister while when it's taken from the blue line it's so unpredictable that it rarely ever even on net.\n\nBut if you have your heart set on improving your slap shot, I know a couple things you can do:  \n\nFirst, your stick, lots of people have very different opinions on stick size.  I have found that the majority of guys with mean shots have their sticks to between the chin and the nose on dryland without skates on.  Some think it should be between the chin and the nose on skates though.  Really, whatever you're most comfortable with is what you should be playing with.  You don't want it to be too short otherwise you may miss the ice and shoot air and you don't want it too long or you'll hit the ice too far behind the puck and lose a great deal of power and torque on it.  \n\nSecond, work on your wrist strength.  A great thing to do for this is take a weight with a hole through it, take an old, broken stick or one that you don't mind breaking and a strong string of some sort.  Tie the weight onto the bottom of the string and the other side of the string to the stick.  The weight should be about at your knees when you hold the stick out directly in front of you at shoulder height.  Twist the stick so that the string rolls around it until the weight is at the stick.  Then slowly untwist it.  Make sure you do this forward and backward.  \n\nAnother good one you do with another person.  Take a pipe or a bar that fits well in your hand and you can wrap your hand around it comfortably.  Have the other person grip the bar as tight as they can while you twist it.  Make some kind of dot or marking on one part of it in the middle so you can count rotations.  Twist left, right, forwards, and backwards.  I would say that after about 5 rotations you'll be able to feel it pretty well.\n\nThe absolute best thing you can do to improve your slap shot would be to get out there and practice it over and over again.  If you can't get ice time, get on some roller hockey skates and set up a net or a tarp or something to aim at and line up a bunch of roller hockey balls or tennis balls.  By practicing with roller hockey balls and/or tennis balls you will be able to aim much better as well as it'll help you get better control on the ball and make you feel more confident with a puck next time you're on the ice.  You may also consider taping a stick weight to the bottom of your stick by the heel of your blade just for the dryland practice.  It'll make your stick feel so much lighter when you're on the ice and that too will make you feel so much better with your shot.\n\nGood luck to you and I hope this helps some.
Ahh It looks like an A or A-, you don't need better pitching, you just need your pitchers to come around. \n\nNo way Sheets should be doing this bad. Clemens will sign and be winning some games for you and Lowry will come back. Peavy is a machine and Arroyoo is doing alright in the NL now. \n\nLooks good!!
I really hope that Miami can win it all this year. I know that they can win, but will they is the question, obviously they have to protect their home court, if they just win their home games, thats it..game over, but winning their home games against Detroit will not be easy.  Then IF they do make it past Detroit, then they can worry about the West.  But for now, lets just focus on the East Finals.

its just like a football game but it doesnt really count.  like if its at your school it doesnt count towards your team's record, its kind of like a practice game.  it's just not as serious as a real game.

Do not buy anything yet.  First go around and hit every driver you can.  Now if your score is over 95, than do the same with 3 woods.  Your 3 wood may be a better driver for you.  While your out there try out the Hybirds.  The same goes for a good sandwedge.  I also suggest you go to some Demo days.  I have some of the company sites on my blog roll.  They have a place to enter your zip code to find out when and where the next demo day is in your area.  Once you know what club, loft, shaft, and grip you want you can start looking on E-Bay and everywhere else.  The last thing you want to do is spend money on something you can't hit.  Everyday I see people with clubs they purchased at a great price put they can't hit them.  \n\nYou need a 3 wood and a sandwedge \n\nThe sandwedge bounce is the key.  Find one you can hit out of the grass and sand.  You can get a sandwedge for little money.  You can always upgrade down the road.  Once again if your a new player you can get a sandwedge for $25.00 or less and save the rest for your 3 wood or driver.  Please make sure you hit some first.  I suggest having someone fit you a couple times. \n\nCheck out \nPGA Director of Instruction Rick Martino takes a look at all the factors you need to take into consideration when getting yourself fit for a set of custom golf clubs.\nhttp://www.pga.com/improve/tips/rickmartino/improve_martino050206.cfm\nGolf clubs are expensive these days.

"Jerseys are tough to size for wearing as streetwear because they're not made to be worn like clothes:  they're made to be worn over hockey gear.\n\nI looked online and found a decent sizing chart for you here:\n\nhttp://www.dickssportinggoods.com/sm-hockey-jersey-sizing--bg-1381341.html\n\nIt looks like it breaks down like this:\n\nYour Chest Size (inches)/ Jersey Chest Width (inches)/ Size \n36 44-48 Small \n40 48-50 Medium \n44 50-52 Large \n48 52-24 Extra Large \n52 54-56 XX Large \n\nAs you can see, a 36 chest wears a 44-48 jersey to accomodate gear.  Authentic jerseys are just always going to look weird without gear, though.  \n\nThere's a whole school of thought (I'm indifferent one way or the other, just for the record) that says that jerseys are to be worn to play hockey, or if you get someone's jersey as a souvenir, you display it but you don't wear it, and that logo gear (team windbreakers, hats, T-shirts) are what you wear to games.\n\nPersonally, if Scott Parker gave me his jersey I'd sleep in it.  Every night.\n\nBut... you know... to wear it?  It'd look stupid as street clothes.  He's like 6'5"".  I'm 5'4"".  It'd be down to my knees, like a sack dress."

You probably have quite a find there. Clemens pitched only briefly with the New Britain Rock Cats in 1983 before being called up to Pawtucket in AAA.

If your staff is strong, keep him through June.  If your staff is killing you now, keep him through June.  You are concerned about your history with young pitchers.  Now you are talking about getting Jered Weaver instead. Zack Duke is young and has won before.  If you are concerned about bad numbers in a roto league, bench him.  If you are in a head-to-head league, play him anyways.  One bad start might hurt your ERA, but you will want the other stats like Wins and Strikeouts.  I would much rather have a young pitcher in a slump than an old pitcher doing poorly (Radke).  The old guy will only get older, the young guy can get better.

"they might not know better yet. kids learn from their parents, but they are not tied to what they've been taught. when they get older, if they are willing to see the world as it is, and lay aside the prejudices they've been brought up with, then they can become their own person. my own parents are hardly evil, but they go about their lives in a way that i have found to be unsatisfactory. i never realized this until the past few years, when i moved out of the house and made my own life. now, i'm trying to identify and utilize the good lessons they taught me over the years, and rid myself of the harmful or useless. it's not easy, but it also isn't impossible. no kid ""has"" to be so mean; they choose to."
what hes saying is since no one answers the card catogory so he had to post here if anyone knows or has a video of how to throw playing cards like chris jesus fergonson does. but to ansewer the question no i don't know.

im gonna laugh in everybody's face that didnt think they were gonna win....\nthey just needa put Henry as left striker and give him motivation and put him in a good mood, when hes like that, hes unstoppable, he can do things even ronaldo or ronaldhino cant, and also they got zidane, best player in the world, he can own ronaldhino anytime, watch his vids on google video, he dangles him with no difficulty at all, hopefully they'll win, and if not, theres like a 80% chance Brazil gets it
No! They are going through a rough stretch right now but they are still only 2 games below .500\nOnce the hitter get hot, (they are due!) the pitching will settle down and I think the Giants will win between 80-88 games this year. Possibly enough to win the NL West!
I love the Spurs, I got pissed when I found out too. They're such a good team, where did they go wrong?

Yes...if a player is injured during his at bat (ie: fouling a ball off of his body resulting in broken bones or getting a major muscle strain where he just can't swing/stand the pain)  It happened to Jermaine Dye when he was with Oakland.  They were playing the Yankees at Yankee Stadium and he fouled a ball off of his leg and shattered the bone below the knee.  Dye was carried off of the field by 2 players.  The batter who replaced him inherited his count.  I think it may have been a playoff game and El Duque was pitching (not positive about this).
If its merely out of true and not kinked then you can fix it by adjusting the spoke tension. You can do this with small pliers, but it is better to use a special spoke tool. These tools are small and can be bought very cheaply, but first check if one of your existing bike spanners has a tiny square notch in one end - this is an integrated spoke tool and will work just fine.\n\nTurn your bike upside down and deflate the tyre on the affected wheel. Slowly rotate the wheel and watch how the rim runs between the brake blocks. As it begins to run close to one block mark the rim with a felt pen. Continue to rotate the rim until it has moved away from the block and mark it again.\n\nBetween your marks you need to adjust the spoke tension to true the wheel.\n\nSpokes entering the rim on the concave side of the warp need to be tightened and those entering on the convex side need to be loosened. Importantly make only small adjustments to each spoke and always adjust pairs of spokes (one loosened, one tightened). Rotate the wheel to check progress and keep repeating until the warp is removed.\n\nGood luck!
Just wish your team luck
"You have to understand that every guy you named has been a slugger since Little League...McGwire and Bonds were jacking out homeruns when they were skinny rookies.  Keep in mind, the main reason baseball players used steroids is not for increased power but for the increase in recovery from injuries so they can play more games.  Look at the list of guys you put up there who have ""used"": Bonds, McGwire and Sosa were all home run hitters but were getting older and had more nagging injuries.  Why do you think Barry can barely jog to first base these days now that he's not on the juice?  Pudge is a catcher, the most physically taxing position in baseball so his use for recovery purposes is understandable.\nARod and Jeter are still reasonably young so they can absorb the punishment.  Let's see how they do in 5 or 6 years.  Interestingly, how do you think Griffey Jr's homerun total would have been affected if he juiced?  The guy was always injured and steroids may have gotten him back on the field quicker."

Be prepared to start cheering for the Lakers!!
Of course not he learned his lesson when they let him off for his previous murder
Yes he was, but he was actually traded for Stephon Marbury, you think Kidd chose to go the Nets?  At one point in time the Suns had J-Kidd, an old Kevin Johnson and a young Steve Nash stuck deep on the bench.  Then KJ retired, Nash was signed by the Mavericks in a deal thought to be way too high at the time, and Kidd went to the Nets for Starbury.  They tried Marbury for a while but the stigma of how much Kidd succeeded in Jersey led to Marbury getting traded to the Knicks and Nash coming back to the Suns as a free agent in a deal thought to be way too high at the time, detecting a pattern?

In theory, U'd best go 4 a 4-4-2 or variations of the 4-4-2 e.g Brazil's 4-2-2-2 & 4-3-1-2.\n\nAttack is always the best form of defence. A 4-4-2 allows the team to defend a four-pronged attack, dominate a midfield opposition of 3 players ( your 4 against their 3) and provide the drive to feed two efficient strikers.\n\nA 4-3-3 is the direct response for a 3-3-4 opposition but i do not like the posture. Both teams would cancel each other, not my style. 4-4-2 is it.
The problem with a lot of the Negro league records is that they are not well documented. It is difficult to merge two sets of data when one set isn't necessarily reliable.

Yes, I definitely think he will make the world cup, maybe not the first match but definitely later matches. Injuries are always exaggerated to psyche out the opposition and because everybody likes a bit of drama\nThe medical facts are that a metatarsal bone can be healed in five days only but since he has broken more than one bone he will need no more than two weeks for them to heal. From there on it is only a matter of regaining his fitness and for that he will be using an oxygen tent which worked wonders for David Beckham.

This was a huge trade for the Red Sox. Doug Mirabelli had 6 passed balls last year as Tim Wakefield's personal catcher. Bard already had 10 this year in the same role. This trade will help Wakefield get comfortable on the mound again and keep runners from constantly getting extra bases because of a catcher that can't grasp the knuckleball. It takes a special talent and Mirabelli has it.

"Karl Malone must be considered one of the greatest Power Forwards in the history of the NBA in his very long career. He was formidable in posting up, a very good low post scorer, a rock solid defender and nobody else could play the pick and roll quite like him.\n\nCharles Barkley must be one of the greatest undersized Power Forwards to ever play the game. He was only 6""6 but you couldn't tell it from his amazing leaping ability that made him a rebounding machine, not to mention his athleticism and ability to read the game.\n\nKevin McHale was also one of the great power forwards (and one of the 50 greatest players in the NBA) and formed the most famous frontcourt trio in the NBA with Larry Bird and Robert Parish.\n\nGoing further back, Bob Petit who played most of his career with the Hawks was a perennial All-Star and All-NBA selection and had huge scoring and rebounding numbers.\n\nElgin Baylor was also a legendary power forward for the Lakers and is one of their all time leading scorers."

"If you had to chose between the 2, I think Pete Rose should enter into the HOF.  His individual accomplishments as a ""pure"" athlete are truly amazing.  If you look at Bonds' career before he supposedly started taking steroids, he should also enter into the HOF, but not before Rose.  What I don't get is people who say he didn't take steroids, or that it wasn't illegal in baseball at that time to take it.  Are you kidding me??? Bonds testified under a grand-jury that he ""unkowingly"" took steroids.  That's like saying, ""I didn't know my friend was giving me pot brownies for the past 5 years.""  Of course you're gonna' know something's up if your body/mind has a drastic effect from something you're taking.  Also, what makes baseball above the law?  ""Steroids weren't illegal in baseball at that time.""  Yes, they were.  They were & are illegal in the United States."

It's widely known that when Cris Carter retired and couldn't help Daunte in the huddle, his numbers dropped off dramatically.  Joey, I think, has all the talent in the world and with Saban, who is way more structured than Mooch ever was, is the kind of guy who can lead younger players.  Joey is their best bet to win.\nRicky Williams was suspended for violating the drug policy...again...he will play in Canada this year as permitted by Saban. If they keep him, they need him in shape and if they trade him, they need on the filed performance to offset the drug tests so Nick had no choice but to let him play.

I watched it and thought Barbaro was AMAZING to watch. His jockey let him out and his just asked for more rein. He is a powerful horse. But Brother Derek was so far out at the 18th spot that I think he has a good chance at the Preakness in the 5th spot to take it this time!

great question. ticket touting is illegal and yet these firms are asking many. times the face value of a ticket. An average price of an england ticket for example for the first round games are £600 for group c seats , face value £50 c.a.  fifa and the various associations of each country do little to stop this and let the real fans from following their teams. please beware, if you do buy tickets off of these sites as i was sent tickets for a different game to the ones we had ordered at euro 2004. I was not allowed to resell these tickets at the game which i would have let go at cost price as i have no desire to make money off of fellow football fans . we also lose lots of seats to corporate firms( SORRY DEVIATED FROM ORIGINAL QUESTION) fifa must stop this and find better ways to distribute tickets to the real fans who pay to watch there clubs and international teams .
"It's not only in European leagues, it's all over the world.  Racism is not limited to soccer, it is in everyday life.  I can't stand it.  You can take a child from each 205 countries that started qualification for the cup, put them in a sandbox and the only fight you would have would be ""he stole my shovel"".  Kids don't care what color people are.  They know there is a difference but racism is a learned thing and when adults quit teaching it, racism will be no more."

In 1953 Campenella won The NL MVP award. What you are probably refering to was the tragic automobile accident that occured on Jan 28 1958 when the car he was driving lost control on an icy patch of road in Long Island NY and his car struck a telephone pole. He suffered 2 broken vertebrae in his neck and was paralyzed from the neck down, thus ending his baseball career. He was the first black catcher in the Big leagues and the second black elected to the Hall of Fame. He died June 26,1993. Hope this helps.

Kareem Abdul Jabaar is the highes nba scored in NBa history with 38,387 points for His carear.  Wilt Chamberlin holds the record for most points in a agame but their is no evidence that he ever did that. (the game was not televiised and there were no reporters covering it) It is undisputed that Kareem scored all his points.
No, because what if he is just another overated backs. I mean like collage is different from the NFL. The defence hits harder for one and they are not going to let you get away with one. I think he will do well but maybe not who knows? I would of put out a 10M contrat maybe higher but he might get injuryed alot so. On the other hand he may be a Hall Of Famer. You are just gonna have to watch.

lol one night me and my pops went fishin out at canyon lake, he was wasted so I drove the boat out to the fishin hole. when we got out there I hooked me a monster of a catfish (weighing 28.5 lbs) and he couldnt hook nothin... for a while at least... first fish he hooked was a bigmouth bass, pulled him off the boat and into the water (he was very inebriated)then he got back in the boat for another go... in which he somehow ended up passed out in his chair... right as he was fallin asleep, he got a pull, it yanked his 200 dollar reel up, smacked him in the face with it, then took off... long story short, gettin drunk with your dad is nowhere near as much fun as watching him make a fool outta himself

fast or slow, depending on the player.
Depends on the retailer, brand, and model.  The most expensive models have the most markup.  The basic, more popular models have the least markup.\n\nSome of the best deals can be made on last year's models that are still on the floor.  The dealer's cost is usually between 60-70% of the MSRP.  They'll be much more willing to part with last year's model than a hot new model.  \n\nNote that a lot of retailers will automatically give you a 5% discount for paying cash.  This way they avoid the credit card transaction fee.

It's just a huge stereotype.  I know a lot of women who like football.  Most of them like it more than I do.  I'm a Basketball man myself.

Well, I guess you could look at a guy like Andrei Kirilenko or Bruce Bowen once again.  I might even look at a guy like Ron Artest, but you're right, Big Ben is the class of the league defensively.  I personally like the interior defense of Elden Brand quite a bit, but he gets a lot of help from Chris Kamen and his team defensively isn't as consistent as the Pistons, who were 17th in Field Goal Percentage Defense this year by the way.

Where.
I think the answer to this question depends on the type of dojo you train at. I trained in judo and at my dojo, the first hour was nothing but cardio drills, footwork, push ups, abdominal work with medicine balls, calisthenics, stretching,etc. Then the next hour was actual Judo where we learned techniques with repositioning, throws (Tachi waza) as well as ground fighting (Ne waza), pins, joint locks, arm bars,etc. Even the second hour was tough because it takes energy to grapple. That was my school. Other judo schools, you will just see a bunch of fat guys standing around working on throws and what not. But overall, I think Judo is great for fitness.
Ron Artest got traded this year from the Indianapolis Pacers to the Sacramento Kings
No, played for the San Diego Padres last year, he's playin for San Francisco Giants now. He's a 1B and OF. He hits lefty. I think he throws righty though. He's been a very good back up for the Giants this season with key hits and all. and yes it does piss me off when u say that.\n\nGO GIANTS!!!!!
I don't think Mexico are in the easiest group, Portugal was the most difficult opponents and you play them last. Iran will be difficult first game. Brazil and Germany have easier groups.
Walk the dog is a trick where you are basically using the tennis ball like a basketball bouncing it between your legs as you walk.  Spinning the racket on your finger is self explanitory.  Catching a ball in mid flight without a bounce requires you to catch and cradle the ball as you turn the racket over while decelerating the ball in harmony with the take back of your racket.  Throwing your racket in the air spinning fast and catching the handle a la Hicham Arazi the magician, is the best I have ever seen at this.  Also there is spinning the racket around your neck and onto your other hand, which is very difficult and I have only known a couple of players that could do it.  There is some other tricks to, but explaining the racket motion requires a lot of typing and is not easily explained without having seen it done in person.

If it has a Sturmey Archer rear hub on the wheel, especially a 3-speed, the date will be printed on the hub.  \n\nSee www.sheldonbrown.com for more information about this type of bike. \nAlso, there are several Western Flyer collectors on the web.  \n\nSome of the Western Flyer are commuter grade and some are less.  Rarely, there are a few very stylish cruisers in the Western Flyer brand, so those are worth more.  The higher value models are almost all 3 speed, with a few derailleur based.  The lower value models are almost all single speed.  \nThe rare exception is one or two outrageously styled single speed cruisers that were made in the 50's.  Those are also valuable, but without the date on the hub, you'll have to look at classic collector's websites.\nNot matter what date, the more outrageous the styling, the higher the value of the Western Flyer bikes.    \n\nBut, I'm saying, check and see if it is a 3 speed, and if so, just read the date right off the rear hub.  ;)
the chances of that are slim, but if God willed, then they could be the champs.

It all depends on a few things.  I know that out in Calgary I believe that they start training in October, and the first International Competition is in December, but there are competitions as early as the end of October.  I know that in Ontario we don't start skating usually until December/January.  I would suggest you check out the Speedskating Canada website at www.speedskating.ca.  It might be really useful and will give you a contact for getting information about next season.
First of all, you had better have the tackle to land the monsters.Sure, people get lucky every year and land a 50 pounder on a bluegill outfit, but I wouldn't reccomend it.if you need help picking out the right equipment, grab a copy of Infisherman Catfish Guide, and it will help you chose what equipment is best for you.I personally use Abu Garcia 6000's and 7000's reels.Okuma reels are also great for catfishing.For rods, I like Bass Pro's Spiral Graphite Musky rods, and thier Power Plus musky rods.Both of these rods are inexpensive, but very strong and dependable.Line is a personal issue.I like Berkley XT Solar and Big Game line.Get you an assortment of hooks in sizes from 10, for catching bait, to 10/0 for huge shovelheads and blues.Sinkers, floats, stringers, swivels and a few more odds and ends are all that is needed to catch giant cats.Now,as to where you fish, it really isnt that hard.Most states have huge populations of cats, and picking what lake or river to fish is easy.In rivers, try to find a hole that has both depth, and cover.A log jam, boulders, rip rap,man made cover, such as a wing dam, or anything that a cat can hide in.In one creek I fish here in Ohio, the best hole has old car bodies sunk in it.In lakes, find some heavy cover, logs, rocks, boat docks, stumps, etc., in at least 5 or 6 feet of water.Remember, the shallower the water, the heavier the cover must be.Cast your bait close to the cover, and stick your rod in a rod holder, and set the bait clicker or open your bail to allow the fish to run line off when they pick up your bait.Bait should be fresh and lively for your biggest cats.Yes, chicken liver is wonderful bait, but the largest cats will rather have live food.Bait can be anything that is legal in your state.Sunfish, shad, suckers, carp, yellowbellies, to name a few.Just make sure of what is legal where you are fishing.Good luck.

The person who holds the highest veritcal jump is a white guy. Look at all the high jumpers in track and field, mostly white guys. Ethinicity has nothing to do with the ability to jump high. It does seem balck guys jump higher in b-ball, but that is b/c there are more black guys who play basketball. Can you say white guys are better skaters and swimmers? No! Less blacks in those sports.\n\nI have played and coached for over 20 years and you know what makes you jump high is your inate ability, athleticism and drive, not skin colour.

You don't usually wear underwear. In fact, those made of cotton would negate some of the benefits of spandex. If you really want to wear underwear, I've found that the best types of underwear would be the Underarmour brand boxer-briefs. They are made of wick-able material, and they compliment the no chafing of the spandex and chemise of the bike shorts
They do the lineups and the Singing of the National Anthem and then throw the first pitch at around 5 after.

This job - or that of an umpire - is something people often do part time, either after retiring from actually being a pro, or through a hobby that starts to take over.\nThe main requirement of course is to know the rules for your sport inside out and to the letter, and to be able to apply them.\nYou will need good judgement, be attentive to detail and able to deal with any conflict situations that may occur.\nThere is always high demand for this sort of role, though at the professional level competition is tight and you may have to work your way up gradually or have some 'in' to get your big break.\nThere can be good money to be made at the very top of most sports, but many perform this career just for fun and a few dollars extra income!

Ira James Murchison (February 6, 1933 - March 28, 1994) was an American athlete, winner of the gold medal in 4x100 m relay at the 1956 Summer Olympics.\n\nBorn in Chicago, Illinois, Ira Murchison was noted for his exceptional speed from the starting block, which earned him a nickname Human Sputnik.\n\nBefore the Melbourne Olympics, Murchison equalled twice the 100 m world record of 10.2 and ran in Berlin a new world record of 10.1, thus becoming one of the favourites to win the 100 m Olympic gold medal. But at Melbourne, Murchison managed to finish only in a disappointing fourth place. He also ran the leadoff leg of the 4x100 m relay team for the United States, and helped the American team to a gold medal in a world record time of 39.5.\n\nIn 1957, Murchison repeated the 100 yd world record of 9.3 and, as a Western Michigan University student, won the 1958 NCAA championships in 100 yd. At the 1963 Pan American Games, Murchison finished third in the 100 m and helped the American 4x100 m relay team to win a gold medal.\n\nIra Murchison died in Harvey, Illinois, aged 61.

Most odds makers say it will be Indianapolis and Seattle.  However, I think Indy choked away their best chance under Peyton Manning last year.  Edgerrin James is no longer there and will be replaced by a rookie. I would say New England and Pittsburgh will play in the AFC championship, with New England getting back to the Super Bowl.  Seattle is a good bet in the NFC, but Carolina and Philly could also.  Many are saying that Dallas loaded for a run for it all this year, but I don't think they have the offensive line to keep a very immobile Drew Bledsoe off his back.  Sadly, I am a Dallas fan, but am trying to stay realistic here.

"On November 13, 2005, Guerrero was found dead in his hotel room in Minneapolis, Minnesota, at the Marriott City Center Hotel by his nephew, Chavo. He was thirty eight years old. Several hours later, WWE.com released the following announcement:\n\n""WWE is deeply saddened by the news that Eddie Guerrero has passed away. He was found dead this morning in his hotel room in Minneapolis. Eddie is survived by his wife Vickie and daughters Shaul, 14, Sherilyn, 9, and Kaylie Marie, 3."" \nThe same day, WWE held a press conference with a speech from his nephew Chavo, who spoke of Guerrero's four years of sobriety that would have come on November 15 of that year. Chavo adamantly defended his uncle, saying he had defeated his ""personal demons."" WWE Chairman Vince McMahon declined to speculate on the causes of Guerrero's death, and both men said that Guerrero would have ""wanted the show to go on.""\n\n[edit]\nCause\nAn autopsy revealed that Guerrero died as a result of acute heart failure, caused by undiagnosed arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease and enlargement of the heart as a result of prior anabolic steroid abuse. Although Guerrero had not taken alcohol or illicit drugs for over four years, his past excesses contributed to his heart failure. At the time of his death, he had recently used narcotic painkillers.\n\nGuerrero's wife Vickie said that he had been lethargic and unwell in the week preceding his death, but that this had been attributed to the stress of continuously traveling and performing. She added that the doctors had told her that Guerrero's blood vessels had shriveled and weakened owing to undiagnosed heart disease, and that he had simply dropped into a deep sleep.\n\nOn the November 30, 2005 edition of WWE Byte This!, Chavo Guerrero, Jr. said that Guerrero had been working very hard and was at peak physical fitness as a result, doing cardiovascular and weight training exercises every day. There had been no symptoms or cause for concern. Guerrero, Jr. noted that, while many people abuse drugs for over ten years with no ill effects, Guerrero, despite having ceased to abuse drugs four years earlier, had suffered heart complications that were not detected in time to prevent his death."

I'm huge ROCKETS fan, and this questions comes up all of the time.  But I would go with Yao, because he is harder to replace than T-Mac, there are alot of great shooting guard/small forwards in the league.  With a trade or draft, you easily find a guard or forward who could put up 20-25 pts. a game.

"Christoph Metzelder (born November 5, 1980 in Haltern, North Rhine Westphalia, Germany) is a football defender for Borussia Dortmund. He is currently considered one of Germany's most talented defenders.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Metzelder signed for Borussia, and he was an instant success. He not only won the German championships with BVB in 2002 as a regular first team player, he also reached the 2002 World Cup final with Germany. In the tournament, he was also voted the ""Best Player Under The Age of 23"". But despite offers from other big clubs, he extended his contract until 2005. After his long injury lay-off, fans and team-mates are now both hoping that Metzelder will be able to make a comeback next season that mirrored the start of his career four years ago.\n\nOne can hardly fail to notice the main strength of the BVB skipper: With a height of 1.94 metres, Metzelder is outstanding in the air. And despite his young age, the centre back, who can also play on the right of defence, has nerves of steel and necessary combination of composure and confidence. This, along with his superb tackling skills, both in the air and on the ground, make Metzelder a very good defensive player.\n\nProfile\nDate of birth: 05.11.1980 \nPlace of Birth: Haltern \nSign of the zodiac: Scorpio \nNation: Germany \nHeight: 194 cm \nWeight: 84 kg \nNumber: 21 \nPosition: Defender \n\nHonours\nGerman Champion 2002 \n2002 World Cup Runner Up \n\nClubs\nBorussia Dortmund \nPreußen Münster \nFC Schalke 04 \nTuS Haltern"

"These days, it's tough to go wrong.\n\nJust to start out with some perspective, during the winter in Southern California the water gets down to the mid to high 50's. Sometimes it'll pop back up to the low 60's for a few days. Other days it'll drop down to the low 50's. \n\nAnd since (as you well know) water temps are controlled by currents and ocean swells, even in the summer it can get pretty chilly.\n\nSo, with that said, here are my suggestions:\n\nFor the winter months, get yourself a good 2/3 fullsuit (most surfing wetsuits are a different thickness in the arms/legs than in the torso, the logic being that your arms and legs need more flexibility). A 2/3 has 2mm thick arms/legs and 3mm thick torso. \n\nThe best fullsuits on the market are widely considered to be the Rip Curl ""Bomb"" series and the O'Neill ""Psycho"" series. Xcel, Hotline, Hurley, Quiksilver and Billabong all make good suits, but 80% of the guys in the water here wear Rip Curl or O'Neill.  \n\nThe Rip Curl ""Bomb"" series comes in two versions - the ""E-Bomb"" and the ""F-Bomb"". They're basically identical suits except that the F-Bomb is coated inside the torso section with this fuzzy insulation stuff, which supposedly keeps your mid-section a bit warmer. The E-Bomb doesn't have the coating and is 100% pure ""Elastomax"", which is this super squishy, stretchy neopreme. \n\nRight now I'm using a 2/3 E-Bomb. I find it to be astonishingly warm. However, I also have a 2/3 O'Neill Psycho II. It's made of an almost identical super stretchy material. \n\n6 months ago I would have suggested the O'Neill over the Rip Curl because they always seemed to be better constructed (the Rip Curls have always been more flexible, but had a tendency to start falling apart after a few months). However, with this new E-Bomb, I stand corrected. It's just as sturdy as the Psycho II. Maybe even better. \n\nOne more factor to consider is the fit. I've always found O'Neill wetsuits to be a bit tighter fitting than the Rip Curl. Then again, I'm on the bigger side (at least as far as surfers go). While you want your suit to be as snug and form-fitting as possible, a few wrinkles here and there can sometimes equal a bit of extra free movement.  \n\nAgain though, I'm nit-picking. Bottom line:\n\n2/3 O'Neill Psycho II\n2/3 Rip Curl F-Bomb\n\nYou can't go wrong with either one. If you get cold easily, go up one thickness. OR, just pick up some booties for those really cold mornings. \n\nCheck out the Rip Curl store in San Clemente or check out Jack's Surfboards in Huntington Beach. Both have a MASSIVE selection of suits. Or just order online. \n\nQuick note: If you plan on surfing in the Fall/Spring, your 2/3 fullsuit will still work beautifully and keep you extra warm. \n\nBUT, if you have the extra cash and like the idea of shedding a little rubber when the conditions warm up, get a short-sleeved ""comp"" (used to stand for ""competition wetsuit"" back when they inroduced them in the 80's). The only drawback to the comp is that you can get a nasty farmer's tan on your arms. Another option is a long-sleeve springsuit or short-arm springsuit.\n\nFor the summer, get a thin wetsuit top to wear with your boardshorts. Keeps you warmer than a rashguard and keeps you from having to find someone to smear sunblock on your back.\n\nProbably more information that you wanted, but there's a LOT to choose from and the conditions can vary quite a bit. But with the links below, I think you'll be all set. \n\nSee you in the water!"
Snooker is a billiards sport that is played on a large (12' × 6') baize-covered table with pockets in each of the four corners and in the middle of each of the long side cushions. It is played using a cue, one white ball (the cue ball), 15 red balls (worth 1 point each) and 6 colours: a yellow (2 points), green (3 points), brown (4 points), blue (5 points), pink (6 points) and black ball (7 points). A player wins a frame of snooker by scoring the most points, using the cue ball to pot the balls in the manner described below. A match consists of an agreed number of frames. Snooker is particularly popular in English-speaking and Commonwealth countries, and the Far East.
I hope not.  Matt is too good for Lita.
yea i know
hells yeah!! it is going to be crazy!! i hope it does like a 2 show thing like what hhh was going to do with batista like one of the dudes goes over to SD! and wins a championship.
Start out lifting small weight, as curls and also doing push ups. My son began with 2 push ups a few months ago. BUT he was consistent. NOW he does many and is much stronger! I used to throw to him and I am his mom! I cannot do as well, but I keep lifting weights gradually and doing arm exercises....\nAlso, keep practicing throwing, as well as lifting either your body weight or weights....\nI hope this is helpful.
maddux tends to get in a groove as season goes on. If you need wins and ERA/WHIP help and waiver wire is realy thin, go for it as bonds will be hurt off an on. Depends if this is roto league or head to head. Monroe and mench will supply some HR. Pods and Ibanez not a whole lot. First counter for maddax and middle reliever.
Geeze, it's difficult to get a straight answer around here. \n\nJrwinte, I expect Barbaro to win if he can hold off Steppenwolfer and Point Determined at the wire.

"Mahendra Singh Dhoni is a promising future for Indian cricket and a nightmare to the opponents.\n\nOverall, he is a true gentleman which was proved when the opponents tried using the ""un-cricketing"" means to disrupt him. For instance, when Danish Kaneria flung the ball at him which was played back to the bowler and was rooted in the crease; this gentleman did not budge from his stance nor did he show his agression to the bowlers rage."
Too late my friend all sold out watch on TV it's cheaper to stay at home.
Babe Ruth. He was a pitcher for the Boston before he became a pernament outfielder and hitter. he wanted to be in the game everyday, so he worked on his hitting. when he was traded to the Yankees, he became one of the best home run hitters of all time. He has a carreer of 714 homers. he also has a record of hitting 60 homers in a season, but it has been broken by several players (Ex: Roger Maris, Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa). When he was still a pitcher, he was good. at one season, he was 18-8 (won 18, lost 8). He went 23–12, with a 1.75 ERA and 9 shutouts in 1916; the shutout mark is still tied for the best mark for an A.L. left hander. in 1917, he was 24-13 and he has an average of .325. he has a carreer of 94 wins, 46 losses, a  2.24 ERA, and 488 strike outs.
Most experts agree that England has 11 of the best players in the world, but that they can never show their true level outside the island of the UK. \n\nIt's likely that the only way that they might win it again is if the World Cup was in England.
"""The Mavs deserve a Championship.""\n\nAnd the Suns don't??? \n\nPhoenix has been playing basketball since 1968.\n\nDallas has been in the NBA since, what, 1980?\n\nPhoenix clearly is more overdue than Dallas."
Ten
I have a lot of doubts if they should take him to the World Cup. He would probably be better off having a good recovery and start fresh next season, than hastely recover just to play maybe only 1 match in this World Cup.\n\nHe can still be replaced by another player up to 24 hours before the first England game.
Going by your spelling, it must be the Lakers or Pistons.
no it's fake!
"Probably not such a good idea. As a sports person myself I find that if I'm feeling unwell any kind of physical activity can aggrevate your symptoms. \nPlus at any gym there are health warnings on the machines that state ""Stop activity if you are feeling unwell"". Your best bet is to leave it until you are feeling better."
Batisa by a long shot. LAST TIME I CHECKED THIS WAS WRESTLING. Cena has good skills on the mic and thats it!!!!! If he want to just talk he can stick to his acting career. But leave the wrestling to the real wrestlers. Batista is one of the best in ring athletes the WWE has seen in a long time. Its just a shame he didn't start wrestling at a younger age like Orton.
The new guy is kind of soft and fat...\n\nIt's still a mystery; WWE wants us to stay tuned and watch the show next week.\n\n...Is it Undertaker under...? Little soft and fat? Nah.
Depends how many legs you've got.
They're not going to win game 5, so there's nothing to be excited about.

Not in a scramble.  In a scramble you are allowed to mark where you are going to hit from with a tee....then move the brick.   Replace ball and hit...No penalty.
Yes of course.Prolonged slump in any player should not be tolerated considering the bench strength and the amount these people get paid,they are required to be in top form to be in the team to do justice to other players who are waiting for their chance.
they must relegated to serie b\ncuz they just cant cheat in match games they are agood team and having really good players so they should get it with honor not with cheating

I have hunted for more than 40 years, and it took me 15 years of dedicated archery and firearm hunting to bag my first 10 point buck (actually was 12 pointer) and it was during a depredation hunt to control deer numbers on agricultural land.  There weren't supposed to be many bucks there, let alone huge ones (mine weighed 220 field dressed).  You're quite lucky, but don't let it go to your head.  Best results are achieved through knowledge, experience and preparation.  Don't count on luck.  Good Hunting.

Bauer makes an excellent skate, and the XXX is one of their top line models.  If you watch any pro hockey, you will see a large number of pro players wearing Vapors; they are probably the most popular skate worn by NHL players.  They are expensive, just like all top of the line skates.\n\nI have always worn CCM; Tacks growing up, graduated to Vectors in the last few years.  They fit my feet the best; Bauers are too narrow for me.  My son LOVES Bauers, and hates CCM.\n\nThe new Reeboks are also great; I would probably try them next, if I had to buy a pair of skates.\n\nBottom line; you've gotta try them on to know which is best for you.  Just like any other top of the line athletic footwear (basketball shoe, cross trainers, etc) there is a huge personal preference factor determining what is good.  Go to a good hockey shop, and spend some time just trying on skates.\n\nHope this helps...

"Mix a solution of one part bleach to one part water. Spray on mold and mildew spots and gently rub. Let sit for 15 minutes and re-apply if it dries out. Rinse thoroughly.

I THINK YOU DONT NEED THAT.\n\nYOU CANT TIME THE BALL WHERE YOU DECIDE TO HIT.
"Well, being a softball player for years (slow pitch), I can tell you that 1st base holds a LOT of responsibility....You will need someone who can jump higher than trees to catch a tall ball, someone that is made of rubber to stretch to get hold of wild balls, that sort of thing...\n\nAll joking aside, 1st base is the most important position on the field. It takes someone who keeps their head in the game at all times and someone willing to get run over once and a while.\n\n3rd base is a dangerous spot though. I have found that the majority of batters are right handed and a lot of those balls will fly straight down 3rd base line. Also, you need someone with a good throwing arm to play 3rd so that if the play is at 1st, they can get it there without a wild throw.\n\nAlso, remember that a lot of people are learning to ""place hit"" which means that they will seek out the weaker players on a team and drill them.\n\nHope this helps!!"

How dare you!\nGetting drunk and punching people is an integral part of football it demonstrates all the qualities that make England great: Fighting spirit, rebelliousness and a fine taste in alcohol (lots of it, yes, but expensive and enjoyed none the less).\nI personally do not make a habit of the above since I am young and must conserve any good looks I have, so I leave it to the fat guys with the shaved heads and greenish tattoos.

Individually, Ovechkin is a great and talented player. Maybe not the best yet, but he is good especially for his age.\n\nAs a team player, i dont think he is that great. He should learn to pass more and involve his teammates. He also isnt much of a leader.

From my experience but check with the DZ:\n\nHeight - no restriction\nWeight -  depends on type of jump you want to do (tandem, AFF, static line) and equipment DZ has).  Unsurprisingly you need a bigger canopy for more weight :-)\nAge - no restriction I am aware of - some DZs may require medical certificate.  I have jumped with a 70 year old - I would suggest a reasonable degree of fitness without knee or back/neck problems.\n\nBasically I would turn up to the DZ and 'lurk' for the day ... see what goes on and have a chat with the folks and the instructors - I promise you wont meet a friendlier bunch of folks.\n\nDrop me a note if you need more.\n\nBlue skies =8-)
"That really depends on the relative size of the players in your league. I played DB in high school (both corners and the later free safety) and corners are usually smaller and fast, and in high school, they're usually around 5' 6"" and 5' 10"", occasionally taller, with weight of around 140 ~ 180.... But since corners are smaller, speed, quickness (ability to break on the ball), jumping ability, body control and tackling ability are very important. I ran a 4.6 40, but the range is between 4.3 ~ 5.0.\n\nA corner's responsibilities vary depending on the type of coverage called.  A corner will be given one of two ways to defend the pass (with variations that result in more or less the same responsibilities): zone and man-to-man. In zone coverage, the cornerback is responsible for an area on the field. In this case, the corner must always stay downfield of whoever it is covering while still remaining in its zone, always between the sideline and the opposing player. \n\nThe free safety is responsible for reading the offensive plays and covering deep passes. Depending on the defensive call, he may also provide run support. He is positioned 10 to 15 yards behind the line of scrimmage, toward the center of the field. He provides the last line of defense against running backs and receivers who get past the linebackers and cornerbacks."

Turnabout is fair play.\n\nI think SJ fans are upset by the idea that the #8 seed could possibly knock them out.  I would be too (especially since I'm from Minnesota and was a big fan of Roli).  But during the playoffs, people get this mentality of ""us vs. them"" (US vs. Canada).  EDM is the cinderella story of the season, and I am happy to see them make it this far - especially since they knock-out the Wings.\n\nIf you were to ask any fan in the HP center ""were you proud about booing the Canadian national anthem?"", 99% would say no.

I don't know that many but i know Duke, NC, and UCONN.
Honestly I think right now they are the hottest team but they have a tendency to do the same thing every year then fade dowqn the stretch.  I hope it doesnt happen this year but I think it will.  Also I think the mets are over rated.  Every year the braves start off bad and every one writes them off and then they end up blowing up in the second half and win it by like 15 games.  So until it doesnt happen I still think they are the team to beat.  I do think the Braves are going to have a tougher time with out Mazzone as their pitching coach.
I'd say 6-1 Detriot.

well i would have to say that it would be argentina. they are the best team besides brazil in the world cup and they will take it to river and wash it down. they will be champions this year, only if brazil decides not to play because they feel that this competition has no merit and that they are far too good for the WORLD. good day.
No, if LBJ did it, they'd blame the girl. I love the sin aspect, too. They love to say that Kobe cheated on his wife. Well, Lebron just had a child out of wed-lock. Adultery & fornification are both sins, so get off Kobe's jock.\n\nKobe cheated on his wife and paid the woman hush money. Jordan cheated on his wife and paid the woman hush money. Kobe punched Samaki Walker. Jordan punched Steve Kerr. Kobe (allegedly) ran off a coach(Phil Jackson). Jordan (allegedly) ran off a coach (Doug Collins). Kobe gives overly polished post-game interviews. Jordan gave overly polished post-game interviews. Kobe hasn't won a title w/o Shaq. Jordan never won a title w/o Pippen. Kobe talks trash on and off the court. Jordan talked trash on and off the court. Kobe shoots too much. Jordan shot too much. Kobe goes after teammates when they make mistakes. Jordan went after teammates when they made mistakes. Kobe is dominating his era. Jordan dominated his era. Kobe has titles. Jordan has titles.\n\nTwo different men, very similar lives. The answer to the question is in the threat. Kobe threatens the the Jordan lovers. He always has. They hated Kobe when he was squeaky clean. I know people that hated Kobe when he took Brandy to the prom. Even then, he threatened their precious Jordan.
You butchered his name!

"I'm sorry but OBA doesn't stand for ""opponents batting average"", it stands for On-Base Against (OBA).  \nwhich is calculated like this:\n\nDivide the total number of hits allowed, bases on balls allowed and batters hit by pitch by the total of the opposing batters' at-bats, bases on balls allowed, batters hit by pitch and sacrifice flies allowed. For example, if Greg Maddux allowed opposing batters 220 hits in 991 at-bats, allowed 27 walks, hit 7 batters with pitches and allowed 6 sacrifice flies, his opponents' on-base percentage would be .246 ((220+27+7)/(991+27+7+6)). \n \n\nBatting Average Against (BAA): The batting average opposing hitters have against a pitcher."

"Well, it depends on where your fishing(from a boat or from land).\n\nArtificial lures: For snook, your best artificial lures are jigs & ""curly-tailed jig bodies"" (1/4 to 1/2 OZ) in chartreuse, root-beer, or white/natural color's. Also, try any ""soft-plastic stick bait"" in the aforementioned colors,(""Senko's"", ""Wave Tiki baits"", ""Charlies""). Rig them ""Texas-style"" .\n\n MAKE SURE you buy some ""Menhaden"" spray attractant to ""sweeten up"" ANY lures or jigs.\n\nOf course, ""saltwater"" Rapala's and ""Yo-zuri"" Crystal Minnows will work too, but they tend to get ""hung up"" in the mangroves. Whatever artificial you throw should be as ""weedless"" as possible. \n\nBaits: The same 1/4 to 1/2 OZ, (use a chartreuse jig-head), jig-head rigged with a large ""mud-minnow"" or shrimp would probably be your ""go to"" bait of choice. Rig the shrimp ""hook through tail"" and the minnow ""through the lips"". Also, a GREAT bait are ""Pogey's"". Cast-net some pogey's and use them as chum and under a ""popping cork rig"". The cork combo works great around jetty's and open-water situation's. Rig the pogey ""in the back"", and the shrimp ""right behind the eyes"". \n\nYou can fish on the bottom with cut-bait or dead shrimp but your odds on catching anything good (this is a  ""trash-fish"" rig) are slim. Unless, of course, you plan on going ""off-shore"" ,whereas ,cut-bait, and a ""bottom-rig"" will work great on Grouper. Go to Floridasportsman.com for further info.\n\nIf your fishing from a dock a ""float rig"" with ""live shrimp"" or ""pogey"" will work ,(and everything else I've mentioned too).\n\n If your at a ocean pier, use a pyrimid sinker #2-3, a ""sinker-slide"", a Fluorocarbon leader 12 lb, and a ""circle hook"" size 1/0-2/0. If you are at a pier you would be fishing for ""Whiting"", ""Reds"", ""Sea-trout"",Sheepheads ETC. Have one rod rigged with a ""pyrimid-rig"" and another with some type of artificial: jig, spanish-jig,ETC. \n\nSome of your BEST fishing will come in the early morning and late afternoon. The middle of the day is too hot for some fish. \n\nThe early bird catches the ""worm"".  GOOD LUCK & GOOD FISHING!"

"Arguably soccer was invented in London in 1863 when men sat down to codify the games that they had enjoyed playing at their ""public schools"". An association called ""The Football Association"" was formed. The word ""soccer"" is short for ""Association Football"", as distinct from ""Rugby Football"", which was another sport codified by ex public schoolboys in the late 19th century."

It was only the second time it had been seen on television and it earned Paul a cool £52,000. He remain to be the only person to achieve a 9-darter in the event's history.

In football, the captain doesn't really have the role of coaching players off the field. It is more of a leadership role on the field, during play. There is the arguement that he can only have a direct input to the defenders as he can't move around the field and tell the strikers etc what to do, but a goalkeeper can see the game happening in front of him - sometimes with little to do but observe. If the player has a strong, motivational side to his character, then there is no reason why a goalie in football shouldn't be ideal for the captain's armband.

Of course you can.  If you go on the day of the game you may even save more money as some teams have bleacher seats that they only sell on the day of the game not in advance.  Thats what the yankees and Phillies do anyway.
I disagree with you. I think Buffalo is skating better than they ever have. If they can avoid a goalie battle and stay focused on one goalie, they have a good chance to go all the way this year.
"I could give you all kinds of suggestions, however, I think the best thing you can do is go to a local department store to the sport section. Talk to an associate that knows a lot about fishing. They will be able to help you one on one better. They will be able to show you what kinds of things to get that suits the area you live in and what kind of fish are caught there. \n\nAs far as a gift ""basket"", I would say no. Go with a fishing vest and place the things in the vest that you are going to buy for him. Plus a nice fishing hat.\n\nHope I helped....Good luck!!"

WC 1966 in England.\n\nMost modern balls are stitched from 32 panels of waterproofed leather or plastic: 12 regular pentagons and 20 regular hexagons. The 32-panel configuration is similar to the polyhedron known as the truncated icosahedron, except that it is more spherical, because the faces bulge due to the pressure of the air inside. The first 32-panel ball was marketed by Select in the 1950s in the United States. This configuration became common throughout Continental Europe in the 1960s, and was publicised worldwide by the Adidas Telstar, the official ball of the 1970 World Cup.\n\nOlder balls were usually stitched from 18 oblong non-waterproof leather panels, similar to the design of modern volleyballs and Gaelic footballs, and laced to allow access to the internal air bladder. This configuration is still common, as are more novel ones, such as the 26-panel Mitre PRO 100T, and the 14-panel Adidas Teamgeist. There are also indoor footballs, which are made of one or two pieces of plastic. Often these have designs printed on them to resemble a stitched leather ball.

Here he is hitting .340 with 0 home runs and 6 RBI's in 14 games. The Royals are hoping Teahen can figure out his hitting issues and be able to contribute to the team

The Los Angeles Clippers first came into existence as the Buffalo Braves in 1970. The Braves were one of three expansion franchises to join the NBA that year (the Portland Trail Blazers and the Cleveland Cavaliers were the other two), as the league dueled with the upstart American Basketball Association for prominence. After struggling through their first few campaigns, the Braves soon found playoff success under the coaching of the legendary Dr. Jack Ramsay and high scoring Bob McAdoo. Unfortunately, drastic changes in the organization's ownership during the 1976-77 season threw the team into a tailspin, resulting in back-to-back losing seasons. \n\nFollowing a proposal by then-NBA attorney David Stern, the Braves were allowed to leave Buffalo after the 1977-78 season for San Diego. The deal was a complicated one, as Buffalo Braves owner John Y. Brown traded places with Boston Celtics owner Irv Levin. Levin, a California businessman, was unhappy in Boston and relished the opportunity to own a team in his home state. Levin immediately renamed the club the Clippers due to San Diego's bustling harbor and seaside locale. \n\nclip·per    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (klpr)\nn. \n1) One that cuts, shears, or clips. \n2) An instrument or tool for cutting, clipping, or shearing.

I like them, but they're in trouble.  It's maddening to see an everyday lineup with subpar players who aren't even worthy of the Royals (jk!) - Melky Cabrera, Miguel Cairo, Bubba Crosby (now on DL), Andy Phillips - and an awful Randy Johnson.  They need help in the worst way, but don't have the prospects to trade to get great players.

A basic form of the sport can be traced back to the 13th century, but it may have existed even earlier than that. The game seems to have originated among shepherds and farm workers in the Weald between Kent and Sussex. Written evidence exists of a sport known as creag being played by Prince Edward, the son of Edward I (Longshanks), at Newenden, Kent in 1300.\n\nIn 1598, a court case referred to a sport called Creckett being played at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford around 1550. The Oxford English Dictionary gives this as the first recorded instance of cricket in the English language.
I think she has a really good chance at winning more grand slams since nobody has been dominating tennis on the women's side. It would be great if she wins the French Open, the only grand slam she has yet to win. She just needs time to adjust a bit better to tennis, and once she does, she is going to be unstoplable. She is only 26 (not 28), so she is very young.

I'm 32, 5ft 9, can bench press 325lbs @ 2 reps of 10, 3rd rep of 10 @ 310lbs.  The arms get a little tired after the 2 reps of 10 @ 325lbs with no spotter, so I cut the last rep to 310lbs for safety.
Most racquet manufacturers that make junior models match racquet length to age. The attached link recommends a full-size between age 10-12 or when the junior player reaches a weight of 85 pounds. I played competitive junior tennis and switched to a full-length racquet when I was 11, but that was when juniors still played with low-tech racquets. \n\nIn general, you can go with a full-size racquet as long as the length doesn't interfere with stroke mechanics and the player can handle the weight. Sticking with a junior racquet for too long could encourage the player to hit with too much arm and wrist, and not enough hip and shoulder. \n\nBest recommendation is to go to a local pro-shop, get some current tips, and demo a bunch of racquets with varying lengths. Pick the one closest to the full-size that still feels comfortable.

"Thats a tough question. \n\nIf you havn't even ""touched"" a fly/rod/reel in your life,  and don't even know if your gonna like it, I would probably buy a ""Pflueger/Medalist-series Reel 1594 1/2 RC""; they cost approx. $32.\n\n Matched with a ""Redington Rod"" model CRF 907/8, 2 piece, 9 FT  OR  ""St. Croix, Premier Rod"" model P908.2 , 2 piece , 9FT. Both these rods will cost about $100. \n\nMatched with any #7 ""weight-forward"" line in green/clear color ; and 15-20 Lb backing. \n\nThis is a good starter combo, for a person who is a novice, and doesn't want to spend $1000 + on a rod & reel!\n\nIf you KNOW you are addicted to flyfishing and want to upgrade to something more ""savy"" try ""SAGE"", ""SCOTT"", ""G-LOOMIS"" rods  &  ""SAGE"", ""LAMSON"", ""ABEL"", ""ROSS"" , reels. \n\nRemember that your rod is really more important than your reel in fly-fishing. I've seen guys with $500-900 SAGE rods attached to a Pflueger reel from 1975,( it also depends on the type of fish you will be engaging). \n\nFly-fishing is a wonderful sport that has only recently become an ""elite"" sport because of the price of the equipment. I started fly-fishing on an old St. Croix rod, 15 years ago, and it STILL catches fish. Don't let the price tag ""fool"" you on some of those more expensive rods & reels. Unless ,you plan to become a professional fisherman , & fly-fish 200 days a year, you could not feel the difference between a ""SAGE"" & a ""REDINGTON"" rod anyway! \n\n Best start out inexpensive and go from there!\n\nBesides, you'll need extra money to buy ""flies"" & ""stuff"". Thats REALLY where it starts getting expensive! Lose 4 flys at $5 a piece , and you start getting mighty ""concerned"" where that fly lands! (LOL)\n\n\nStart easy: go to a local pond, (that has plenty of ""back-cast"" room), and try to catch some bluegill or small bass. It's fun, you'll learn the ""basic's"" , & it's cheaper on the wallet!\n\nGo to cabelas.com for further info."

There are a lot of soccer cleats (football boots) that are very good. It’s hard to say which are the best. It usually comes to personal preferences. If yours are the Kangaroo Leather and price under $80 I would suggest Adidas Predator Pulse. After Adidas released new version – Predator Absolute, these great cleats could be purchased for under $100 (about $80-$90 in some cases). Also Adidas has other Kangaroo models for less than $80:\nF50 TRX (2004 model), Aveiro and Copa Mundial.\n\nIf, for some reason, you don’t like Adidas brand, there are couple good choices within Diadora cleats:\nCarioca RTX 12 and Carioca MD 25 (about $40 – probably the least expensive Kangaroo cleats on the market).\nUnfortunately if you prefer Nike or Puma, all theirs Kangaroo cleats are over $100 (Nike produce only one Kangaroo model – Air Legend).\n\nYou can read more on how to and what factors to consider while selecting soccer cleats at
There were 130 goals in the group stages with Germany and Brazil each being top scorers with 11 goals each. Then there was 31 goals in the knock out rounds. Altogethter then there was exactly 161 goals (not including penalty shoot outs). A fair few.
"the only ""official"" record of this is Nolan Ryan when he was playing with the California Angels at 100.9 mph. Unofficially it has been reported he threw one at 104 mph. The only ones who know for sure are the ones holding the radar guns behind home plate, of course assuming the guns are calibrated properly."
Well, probably a day at the beach now.  The fall and winter are great times for hiking.  But now that's it's warming up, I'll take to the beach!
you don't exactly need arm strength to do back hand springs you just need to know how to do a shoulder pop.

For you, it'll be like trying to ice skate uphill.  You are at a severe disadvantage.  First, you are nowhere near a good facility to practice.  I guess you could beat a ball against a wall (that's what I did for my first 2 years), but without someone to play against, you won't improve much.  Second, you don't have access to a good coach.  Without a coach, progress will be very slow.  If you're serious about going pro, find a coach - now.  If you can't afford a private coach, find some videos or DVDs that will show you drills that you can do on your own.  And never underestimate the importance of good footware.  I've gone through cheap shoes (US$20) in a single day of practice.\n\nGood Luck

"Well, hold on a sec.\n\nThe ""perfect"" stick isn't necessarily a $200+ composite.\n\nLots of guys in the NHL and elsewhere still use wood.  I use wood.  The perfect stick is a combination of a lot of factors.  Flex, weight, length, what kind of blade you have and how the curve works for you.\n\nFlex has to do with how much weight (pressure) it takes to bend your stick.  That translates directly back to how much force it snaps back with when it unbends, which affects your shots in terms of how fast the puck goes when it comes off your stick.\n\nIn both a slap shot and a wrister, your stick is bending right as you collect the puck, and unbendending as it leaves your blade.  That rubberband effect gives the puck that much more velocity, which is why in theory a flexible stick gives a more rocketing shot.\n\nThe thing is, that's not always what you want.  Defensemen tend to like a stiffer stick \n\n(pause to giggle)\n\nand smaller forwards like a more flexible stick, but that's a huge generalization and in the end it comes down to personal preference.  I'm small and comparatively light, so I use an 85# stick.  For a big guy that would be ridiculous whippy, but it works just great for me.\n\nThe other thing to remember is... there's being cheap and then there's being reasonable.\n\nPatrick Marleau can break three sticks a game because the club picks up his equipment tab.\n\nYou buy that $200+ Synergy or whatever and in two months when you break it in a game you're going to be really unhappy.  And honestly, do you play well enough yet to really use a $200 stick to its best advantage?\n\nI use a $30 wood stick.  Bouchard curve, 85#, with a lie that's good for my height (or lack thereof).  I have two.  I know where to get more when they break.\n\nMost of the guys I play with out here on the east coast play with wood sticks, and have all their lives.  \n\nSo, you know.  More in this case isn't necessarily better.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe you're good enough that a $200 composite stick will really do something for you, who knows.\n\n**  \n\nTo clarify, although I did say -- the numbers have to do with how much force it takes to bend your stick.  100 flex means it takes 100 pounds of pressure to bend your stick 1 inch.  85 flex means it takes 85 pounds.  The higher the number, the stiffer the stick.  The lower, the bendier.  \n\nAnd... FYI when you cut length off your stick you change the flex. The more you cut, the stiffer you make it."

I guess the only way to get a statistic would be to just watch games and take notes.  Otherwise, the only thing I could think of was to get the average speed of which the ball leaves the bat and also the average distance from the plate that outfielders play.  Then you could estimate how long they have to react and how fast the ball is going.  As for positioning of the infielders, I don't know how you could account for that.  Hope that helps, just a quick idea!
Well clearly in the Playoffs you had the INT that got overturned in the Colts/Steelers game. I mean it was so bad that the NFL had to apoligize, thankfully it didn't cost the Steelers the game. Also in the playoffs if I'm not mistaken in the, Denver/New England game, where the guy clearly fumbled BEFORE going in the endzone and it was called a TD instead of a touchback. The refs really blew it in the playoffs. Then there was that game with the 2 point conversion where I think it was the FB Alscott(proably got the wrong name) that clearly didn't get over the line but was awarded the 2 point conversion that WON the game.

Your dog is probably testing you. You have to show him/her that you are the master, not him/her. Male dogs are more likely to be unruly. To train him to do as you want, give him a slight tug on the leash when he does not respond properly and tell him no--a slight tug not a jerk. Also give him encouragement when he does well--a treat and a good boy or good girl.

I think this is true. Whenever Kobe score 50 points he also has more than 10 turnovers by himself. Although hes hot most of the time when hes not he wont stop shooting until he starts making them. When you look at the 3 games that the Lakers have won against the Suns you notice that in two of those games Kobe wasnt the highest score and in the other game Kobe was the leading score by just a few points. If he does not pass the ball and wants to be the hero of the game his team is gonna lose. Hes gonna have to make more than 50 points in order to win the game. For example when he scored 62 against the Mavericks and 81 against the Toronto Raptors. But how likely is that gonna happen? The Lakers should lose game 7 against the Suns because Kobe is gonna be on edge with Barbosa back and hes prolly gonna wanna show off and score a bunch of points. The only way I see the Lakers winning is if Kobe scores way more than 50 points. If he makes 40 or more than the Suns are going to the second round of the playoffs.
I find it hard to believe that. If he lost to Mayorga, he would probably set a rematch for September 16th. He was looking forward to fighting Pretty Boy Floyd then, but how could he resist going out with a vengeance? ;D\n\nI do believe he's going to retire soon, but unless Mayorga finds a way to completely dominate Oscar (which I doubt), I see De la Hoya sticking to that one last fight he has planned.
It's PUJOLS, and he's the only one right now with a shot.
The Sens play an uptempo hockey that relies on accurate passing and quick skating.\n\nDuring the regular season, teams have limited opportunity to scout each other due to the crazy tight schedule. During the playoffs you play the same team, and you have tons of time to break down the opponent on tape and see what they do, pick their plays apart and discover other weaknesses. Buffalo, which is one of the most defensively sound teams in the NHL were able to shut down the Sen's passing game and slow down their attack. THey also managed to exploit the big ice surface that opens up as a result of the lightning quick Sens' forwards and their not so quick defenders, when getting puck possesion.\n\nAnother important point is that the level of officiating has changed dramatically during the play-offs, no doubt. What was hooking, holding and interference during the regular season is now washed out. This did affect the Sens' in that their forwards were not able to skate into open ice as quickly as they had done during the season, nor did they enjoy as many powerplays as a result of outskating and outpassing their opponents, but such is life in pro-sports.\n\nThere is of course more reasons to why Buffalo won... cause they did.. much more than the Sens lost, if that makes any sense. But I suggest you get on a hockey forum like www.hfboards.com, or something like that if you want to dig deeper into this.

Larsson started his professional career playing for Högaborg at the age of 17. He subsequently played for Helsingborgs IF and Feyenoord. Although he was finalising the details of the contract with Grasshopper-Club Zürich in 1993 he moved to Feyenoord for £295,000. Following a complicated contract dispute with Feyenoord, he was signed by Celtic manager Wim Jansen in July 1997 for a fee of £650,000. His debut against Hibernian at Easter Road was less than spectacular: he inadvertently passed the ball to Hibs player, Chic Charnley, resulting in a 2 - 1 loss for Celtic. He didn't fare much better in his first European game, scoring an own goal, although Celtic did run out 6 - 2 winners.\n\nHe is apparently going to finish his long career at Helsingborg.

"In compiling these ""triple double"" lists, keep in mind that blocked shots and steals were not official NBA stats until 1974. Therefore, Chamberlain's total of 'triple doubles' is probably grossly under-stated. Chamberlain retired in 1973.\n\nNewspaper accounts of Chamberlain's games, particularly early in his career, routinely mention him blocking anywhere from 10 to 17 shots - in fact, he blocked 17 shots in his first game in the NBA, against the Knicks... considering the fact that (1) he averaged 30 ppg during his career  (2) he was NEVER under double figures in rebounds in ANY game of his 1,045 game career  (3) he led the NBA in assists one season and averaged about 4.5 apg over his career   and  (4) he probably had a couple hundred games in which he was in double figures in blocked shots,  he would undoubtedly have more triple doubles and quadruple doubles than any player in history.\n\nBut yes, ""officially"", Oscar is the all time 'leader' in this category.\n\nWhat??? No Jordan in the top 5??? I thought he was the best ever... jeez, Wilt STILL beats him on this list despite the fact that blocks weren't even an official stat during Wilt's career..."

The risk of injury from hockey is pretty much the same as you face with any other sport.  The most serious possibilities are head and neck injuries and work their way down to the less serious things such as bumps and bruises.  USA Hockey, the governing body of ice hockey in the USA from the Olympic team down to the little guys, has done a pretty good job of educating players, coaches and officials of the risks and how to prevent them.  They have also made a priority of enacting rules to prevent the infractions that cause the most serious injuries such as checking from behind.  I have played for 35 years and have had my share of stitches but thus far (knock wood!) nothing serious.\n\nThere have been some well publicized injuries such as Travis Roy who suffered a spinal cord injury in his first college game and Clint Malarchuk who had his jugular vein sliced in an NHL game.  These are extremely rare occurrances and given the quality of hockey equipment these days, the risks involved are no greater than or even less than any other sport.  I do not have the numbers in front of me, but I have read that there are more injuries annually from both soccer and football.\n\nThere is one health issue that has popped up recently in hockey although more-so in other sports where players share a locker room and showers, flesh-eating bacteria.  It is much more prevalent in wrestling with the close contact and minimal clothes and equipment but there have been recent cases reported from hockey locker rooms as well.\n\nFrom a general health standpoint, visit your doctor and have a physical.  If you are in reasonably good health there is no reason you cannot play hockey.  It's a great game and there are levels of hockey out there for everyone these days.
I think its gonna be albert pujols. He is, no doubt, the best hitter. and the guy's an underrated fielder. Hes the man.

"Unfortunately, you are mistaken.  Nearly all horses can run the initial 2 furlongs in 24 seconds or less, yet very few can run the last 2 furlongs in less than 24 seconds.  The pace of the race and the outcome are determined by multiple factors.  If you have a horse in a race and that horse is the ""controlling speed"" many times you have the winner.  If that same horse is not the ""controlling speed"" and gets ""hooked"", i.e. a horse breaks even beside it, that horse, unless he is a superior animal will not win the race.  The pace will quicken and both horses will tire mid-stretch and be beaten.  A horse coming from well off the pace will benefit by a fast pace up front, provided one single horse does not clear the field and slow the fractions down.  In other words, the faster the race is run in the early stages, the more likely a horse mid-running or closing from well back will run past them late in the race.\nThere is NO mathematical solution, regarding acceleration, stride length that has ever stood the test of time. \nHence, IF the ""fastest"" horse always won, the favorites would win 100% of the time.  Industry wide, the ""fastest/betting favorite"" only wins 38% of the time. That means that 62% of the time the ""fastest/betting favorite"" loses. \nGood luck, but the game involves much more than mathematical equations.  There are different surfaces, multiple drugs administered, and many trainers are not even trying to win TODAY, they would much rather win later at bigger odds. \nThat, in a nutshell, is the reality.\nI'm a 50+ year old man who has played horses for over 35 years and numbers should only be a guide, never the rule.\nI would be happy to further elaborate if need be. \nGood luck to you"

YES! \nAt least we can have some one to put the blame on.
Apparently there is no official rule regarding when a half swing is considered a full swing (strike) (www.baseball-almanac.com).\n\nThe site below mentions that this ruling is completely up to the discretion of the umpire. Generally, factors such as whether the bat passes the front of the plate or the batter pulls his wrists back are considered in making this decision. \n\nI hope this helps!

I dont think theres a rule against it, but in order to become a coach in the NFL, you have to have a tremendous knowledge of the game. This usually steams from playing experience. I dont know if you have playing experience, but unless you do or will, getting a coaching job is extremely unlikely. But, hey, if you really think you can do it, go for it. Theres always a chance. You better be prepared, because a woman coach wont be well accepted by the NFL community. Theres never been a woman coach, but maybe you can be the first.

"I play softball, and I also love it!  But, I hate it when we're way worse than the other team and continuasly get beaten, or are way better than the other team and continuesly beat them.  I like it when we're even and have a challenge.  Also, it's a lot better playing with a team that has their head in the game and knows what they're doing!  If they don's, it's not as much fun, but still I""ll play!!!"
"Dumbo...First define what you mean by "" OUR cricketers """
Probably the Suns, but I'm going to root for the Clippers. It's been so long since they won anything.
I say JT.  I think people underestimate Jermain because of his poor (but victorious) showings against Bernard Hopkins.  Yes, Taylor looked bad in those fights, but Bernard Hopkins makes everyone look bad, and yet he still lost to Taylor twice.  I think we will see a much different Jermain this fight, especially since he his under the helm of Emmanuel Steward.  Not to take anything away from Wright, he is a world class boxer and a seasoned veteran, yet I do not see him having the strength or the hand speed to defeat Taylor, especially if Taylor can keep that jab on him.  Wright's gonna have to get inside to win this fight, and Taylor's gonna do everything he can to keep the smaller, shorter man at a distance.  Either way it should be a much better fight then the last middleweight title fight.
I think JImmy Johnson is, but I'm hoping for Earnhardt Jr. but he probably won't.  Maybe next year!
the best ever female wrestler is chyna cuz she can kick guys arses like any dude can. id love to see her rip cena in half and put his rollin stones in a vice grip.\n\nbut gail kim is my favorite female wrestler, and her wwe theme was aight. stratus, jaqueline, jazz, molly holly, lita, and victoria are all cool too. though barely wrestlers, kristal marshall, jillian hall, and maria are cool, just cause theyre hot as hell. candace is just triflin, though...
All depends if your looking at Right-Wingers or in general.  If your saying rw he is right up their as one of the best besides like bossy.  Overal, if your saying like in general he probabley ranks like in upper 10's like 15 out of 20.

No way, The Palace is gonna be on fire, and Rasheed Wallace is gonna come out with a vengeance. He promised that the series would be over in five, and I just can't see him being off by so much that they actually lose the series. I give 7:1 odds that the Pistons win.
The level that the Lakers are playing at would definitely make us Lakers fans believe that it is possible, however I doubt that they could beat the Spurs...nothing is impossible...the Lakers prove that saturday night! Laker Haters will say it will without a doubt never happen but these same people said that the Lakers wouldn't defeat the Suns...now that series is pretty much a wrap.  Holla!
Lebron James, Kobe Bryant, Gilbert Arenas, Allen Iverson, and Dirk Nowitzki in that order.

AL-Curt Schilling-It looks like he's fully heeled from his ankle surgery.  Throughout his career he's been a work-horse & this year should be no different.  He's playing for the BoSox so he should get the run support he needs to win games.  It won't be Josh Beckett just because he's  always dealt with nagging injuries (i.e. blisters on pitching finger).\n\nNL-Pedro Martinez-He always gets better with warmer weather.  We're barely in May & he's pitching lights out.  With an ERA under 3, & a stacked lineup, he should have no problem winning games.  He will also get 30 plus starts this year.  Reason being, he won't have to work as hard during blowout games where he will be able to exit the game in the 6th with a comfortable lead.
Indisputedly Klein.\n\nA high tech', well developed, near-perfect frame for balance, control and comfort. Beautifully made, right down to the highest quality paint job you'll find on any bike. Top spec' componentry, intelligently chosen for each model. No unnecessary crap bolted to the bike just to sell it - this is a bike by enthusiasts for enthusiasts.\n\nTruly durable - I've given my Attitude Race a seriously hard time for about 4 years now. Its got war wounds, but it goes as good as the day I bought it and despite the scratches, it still looks great too. It hasn't dated because it has classic simplicity.\n\nGo for a Klein.
If they stay healthy, they will have a pretty good offense. \nthey have Deuce McAllister and Reggie Bush in the back field. And Joe Horn out at WR. If they just get a good OL, they will be really good.

If he was your first pick, then you must like him, so you should keep it.  I have him in one of my teams too.\n\nI beleve he could be better, maybe an ERA in lower 4, 1.3 WHIP, 10 wins, and 150 strikeouts through the season.\n\nMariners is not a good team and in a very strong division.  It's hard for Félix Hernández to win a lot, and keep his ERA low if Mariners don't allow him to throw sliders.  Mariners would also try to protect him by limit his pitch counts, so 130-150 innings with 150 Ks is my prediction.

Of course they will! All they need to do is slide past the Phillies and the Braves for a seat in the playoffs.
not having a solid enough defense.
"In HS, A linebacker often makes the defensive ""play"" calls for the team. He will call which back to key on (Fullback or halfback), what coverage the secondary will play (man to man or various types of zone.... and will make calls for the Defensive line to shift left or right or to change fronts. \n\nThe calls that he is responsible for become more sophisiticated as he progresses through a system, and College LBs often have more responsibility than HS, and a Varsity HS linebacker has more responsibility than JV.\n\nAs for responsibilities on the field, some of the other answerers have been spot on. A LB generally is responsible for making tackles, and possibly covering the TE or RB out of the backfield on passing plays. They are also occassionally called on to Blitz..."

My blood pressure is just fine and dandy, ta, and I am ready to go! And more to the point, my Sabres are ready to go, too! We need to finish the Sens off tonight in their own building. We cannot let them get back into this series, they are simply too talented. Mind you, thestars, outshooting the opposition hardly equates to victory. Quality of scoring chances counts far more than quantity, and the simple fact is that while our young goaltender, Ryan Miller, has been stellar, your guy, Ray Emery, has (aside from game 4) stunk out the joint.\n\nMy expectations? My Sabres defeat the Senators tonight in Ottawa, decisively! Worst case scenario? We finish them off Monday night in Buffalo. Either way, the Buffalo Sabres advance to the next round; the Ottawa Senators look into available tee times. :)\n\nLet's Go Buf-fa-lo!!!
I've had the same problem. Something I've started doing to get my timing right is I count the seconds that it takes for the pitcher to start her wind up and get the ball over the plate while im on deck. It helps alot. Also before a game, I soft toss some which helps me to make contact :)

faster than 15 km for sure. i ride with a bike club that rides consistently around 20 miles an hour, and there are many women who ride. i'd definitely imagine a road race for women would be able to consistently hold above 6. whatever miles an hour 15 km/h equals. Me and several friends of mine (including girls) averaged much faster than that on mountain climbs in colorado.\n\nas for speeds they can achieve, if its in the mountains, going down it would easily be in excess of 50 miles an hour.
Argentina will always be a favorite. but since the world cup is in Europe and south American teams have not done well since Brazil in Sweden i have to say that a European team has the best chance.

Hm...I wonder why they think that.  She should ask them.  She could show them pictures of other female skateboarders from magazines or videos.  Talking to them is really the best thing to find out what is really going on.  Maybe they are worried she will break an arm or something.  Maybe they are worried since it is mostly a male sport and they don't wnat her to be around all those guys.  If skateboarding is what she loves to do then I say go for it girl...be different from all the other girls...change the perception and have fun!!!!
"RRJ for sure. Some may say they see the Golden Boy - Oscar DelaHoya, Maybe even Tito, all of which would be valid as well.\n\nI did forget E. Holyfield. Holyfield was a great boxer, and he did fight and beat the best, almost every time he was challenged, he never had the aura or ""that special something"" that makes people watch him or makes people listen to him. RRJ is a great boxer and a showman. Delahoya as well. That's the difference. Mike Tyson was not a successful boxer in the 90's. He is the great boxer of the 80s -not the 90s."
I really think that Roger will finally win this french open. \n\nHowever, French Open is one of the tourament that for the annoymous to climb up the top. Therefore, it is hard to say.
No, the goaltender who allowed the 4th goal in a 6-3 loss is the goaltender who takes credit for the loss regardless of who started the game.  This is different than the way some sports assess wins and losses.

Isaiah has created a grave indeed and it will take at least two more years to get out of it. Coach Brown is known for motivating young teams and instantly improve them. May be he will get on their case this summer and we will see Curry and Crawford way better than they are next season. If Brown can get them to be a 35 win team this year, they will be out of grave in two more years. Brown will have to show some patience and the team have to believe in him. Isaiah gets F greade in the deal, but Brown will have to be A and Curry and Crawford will have to be A+ this summer and next season.

Yes.  And we, the fans, should get to determine the amount they get.\nWe can all register with our favorite teams.  Then, after the draft, we all vote on how much a player should recieve in base salary.  If the player doesn't like the amount we vote on, he can quit and receive nothing.\nWe can also have votes after every game to determine if anyone deserves a bonus.

Well the pitching matchup on Friday is very uneven much favoring the Yankees despite Randy Johnson's struggles this year.

Yes, but the key is to be consistent. \n\nIf they called everything no games would ever be finished. \n\nA replay system would only add to the delays and confusion.\n\nAt the speed the players are moving at, and all of their various body parts moving at incredible speed, it is almost impossible to accurately call everything.\n\nEspecially when one considers the sheer number of things they're expected to watch for.

Loosen the grip and choke up on the bat.  Batting gloves wouldn't hurt either.\n\nAlso make sure his hands are not breaking when he swings the bat.  His swing should have his hands leading, following through the bat will naturally come around.  If his hands break with the swing it could cause an awkward vibration.
On an onside kick the kicking team usually floods most of it's players to one side of the field in hopes of recovering the kick. The ball must travel 10 yards before the kicking team can recover the kick unless it first touches an opposing player. Once the ball has traveled 10 yards or has been touched by the opposing team it is a free ball for anyone to recover.

Old question - same answer - BRAZIL!!
The English will naturally follow an English manager more than they would a foreigner and would likely be less inclined to start criticizing if things go afoul. However, I don't think McClaren is that strong of a candidate for the job and there are several foreign managers would've been better qualified.
It's hard to give you any specific tips without knowing what position you will be trying out for. But for starters, always keep you head up. Keep your feet moving constantly. You should practice getting into the stance of the position you want to play, such as two point stance or three point stance. \nIf you are thinking about being a ball carrier you should focus on sprinting. When running the football you need to be explosive. Stay low and keep you legs churning. You may also want to get a good feel for the ball. You can do this by buying the same size football you would be playing with and take it with you wherever you go.\nIf you are lineman material you want to work on exploding out of your three point stance. You need to be able to fire out low. I teach my linemen to strike with both hands in the chest and drive with short, choppy steps with a wide base.\nDuring the off season you may want to contact your coach and see if you can get a copy of the play book.\nHope this helps.
No won't continue forever. Burke was supposed to spell Biggio & the OFers to the tune of 3-4 days a week. Lamb is in so much cause he was hot filling in for Berkman. He always gets that way with regular playing time at one position, so he'll cool off back to pinch hitting, where they need the strong lefty bat off the bench & Burke will move around more with more playing time for both he & Biggio.
"Its the stigma that the Sens have. The Sens have always done extremely well in the regular season in years past, and they always choke in the playoffs. Nobody knows why, considering how many times they have played in the playoffs, but the Sens always choke.\n\nJust ask the Toronto Maple Leafs, and they will tell you just that. Thats why everybody always said about Ottawa: ""just wait til the playoffs come""\n\nBesides, Buffalo is a lot better team than most people give credit for. If you ask me, their young players may be more talented than those of the sens. Not as deep as a team, but talented nonetheless."

The USA has dominated the Summer Games. An American became the first Olympic Champion and first medal in the 1896 Athens games (James Connolly, the Triple Jump).\n\nSince that time, Americans have won 2,191 medals including 896 gold medals. The USSR (which included all the satellites and has since broken up) is next with 1,010 and 395 gold. These totals exclude the totals from the 1906 Intercalated Games, which are no longer recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as official Games.\n\nNow in the Winter games, Norway has been the dominant country, with 280 medals and 98 gold. The US is 2nd with 216 total and 78 gold.\n\nSo overall, the US is #1 with 974 gold 772 silver and 661 bronze medals for a total of 2407. We've won twice as many as any other country.

Baseliners. Because on clay court, ball doesn't come fast after hitting the ground. Thus making it difficult to make a fast serve. Serve and volleyers largely depend on good and fast serves which are difficult to produce on clay court.

As far as their rookie seasons are concerned, I'd say A.J. Hawk.  Bush will share carries with Deuce Mcallister.  Leinart will probably stay on the bench for at least the first 8 games.  If he starts, he'll suck like most rookie QBs.  Williams will - like most DEs in the 3-4 scheme - probably get stuck taking on tackles so the Texans linebackers can make plays.  I don't expect eye-popping stats from him.  Hawk, however, is practically a guaranteed starter at a position that traditionally racks up the tackles.

Flathead catfish have got to be the ugliest of the cats. They are native to the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio basins and as far east as Lake Erie and Florida. Its long, wide head gives it the name. Flatheads have become problems in some rivers in Georgia, eating native bream species almost to the point of eliminating the population. The largest flathead landed on rod and reel is a 91 lb. 4 oz.

I have already answered a question similar to this one but here's my opinion once again.\n\nGenerally speaking I believe that PRIDE has the best MMA competitors in the world. The main reason for that is quite simple. They are by far the highest paying MMA organization today and all the top fighters want to work there. \n\nAnd as far as weight divisions individually are concerned situation looks more less like this:\n\nUFC heavyweights are nowhere near PRIDE level. With fighters like Fedor Emelianenko, Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira, Mirko CRO COP Filipovic, Sergei Kharitonov, Josh Barnett, Aleksander Emelianenko, Fabricio Werdum, Mark Hunt and so on PRIDE is completely dominant in this division. UFC's best Tim Sylvia and Andrei Arlovski wouldn't even make top 8 in PRIDE.\n\nPRIDE is also dominant in LHW division with Wanderlei Silva, Mauricio SHOGUN Rua, Ricardo Arona, Hidehiko Yoshida, Antonio Rogerio Nogueira, Alister Overeem all there (their only big minus was the recent loss of Quinton RAMPAGE Jackson who signed for WFA). UFC, now that Randy Couture is retired, really only has two top level fighters in that weight class - Tito Ortiz and Chuck Liddell. Sobral, Bonar and Griffin are good fighters but they're not on the level of PRIDE's best.\n\nMiddleweight division is at the moment about even in PRIDE and UFC but there are really only two kings in this weight class and the rest of the competition is not on their level. They are of course Rich Franklin and Dan Henderson and that would be a dream match.\n\nWelter weight division (-170 lbs) PRIDE doesn't have (well they call -185 lbs division welter) but Matt Hughes is the undisputed champion and the best fighter in the world in that class and UFC's fighters are best there, no question about that.\n\nLightweights are without doubt better in PRIDE with Takanori Gomi, Tatsuya Kawajiri, Hayato Sakurai, Joachim Hansen, Luiz Azeredo and so on all there.\n\nSo I agree with you, PRIDE is better then UFC.
that`s pele  the youngest scorer of world cup  against wales in 1958 was 17 years and 239 days old  the younger player is norman whiteside of northern england 17 years and 41 days old against yugoslavia in 1982
"No, he was said to have a hand of god because he used his hand to score a goal in a world cup finals when it was the golden goal time and he wasn't caught by any referees. Thats why they call it ""maradonna's hand of god"" He won the world cup for argentina like that.\n\nCheers."

Well, that is a complex question. I personally like how MLB functions in the sense that a manager can go out there and argue with the ump. But not if it holds up the game for too long. The important thing is to keep the game moving along at all times. Baseball managers have a respect for the game and know when to leave the field after they either lose the argument (and they will ALWAYS lose) or are ejected. It's about respect. But I wonder if arguing were allowed all across the board in all sports if the players would have respect for the officiating crew. In other words, would they argue to the point where they would be abusive and have to be physically removed from the court or field? Call me crazy, but I think an NBA or NFL player just might argue to that point if arguing were allowed. I am surprised that I haven't really seen a physical ejection in baseball.

Atoz Armaments Dragunov SVD Spring Sniper they have the fastest spring rifle i have ever seen and it has a really good range 220-250 feet, or you can get a  Classic Army M24 SOCOM Airsoft Sniper Rifle you can get em both at  www.shortyusa.com but they are temporarily out of stock, they are very reliable, accurate and fast but I would go with the Atoz Armaments Dragunov

I don't think he getting hyped anymore. Everybody has already jumped on the Reggie Bush is a bust bandwagon. I think its unfair consider he not the featured back and his team is winning their conference.  Whatever they are doing is working.

For short range shots use a IC choke. Modified choke for longer ranges and a full choke for even longer distances out to 35 yards.
Damon Huard - Probably your best bet.  I actually just picked him up in my league.  Playing really well as of late.\n\nDrew Bledsoe - Riding the bench right now.  Tony Romo took his job.\n\nAndrew Walter - Ummm....No.  You would probably get more points if you didn't play anyone.\n\nSeneca Wallace - Might not be a bad pick either.  Has better weapons than Huard, and more mobility.  And, Alexander is going to be out for another week, so they might end up throwing more.\n\nTrent Green - Concussion.  Going to be out at least one more week.\n\nJoey Harrington - Stay away from.  Has decent weapons in Miami, but no O-line to speak off.\n\nJohnson wouldn't be bad to stay with.  He doesn't put up great numbers, but he is solid.  Go with either Huard or Wallace.  Wallace has better receivers, but Huard will be able to work the play-action pass better with LJ in the backfield.
Lytle and GSP. GSP is a different fighter and a better one now. He was scared and intimidated when he first fought Hughes and wouldn't even look him in the face when McCarthy was talking to them. Now he is stronger has the best stamina and all around better than Matt Hughes. Hughes is a good fighter but he got lucky with that arm bar against him, and he is wrestler and that's all. he is not a stand up person. GSP can knock him out. Hughes doesn't have knock out power. I think GSP will win in the second round.
I would go with Brees\nWayne, Fitzgerald\nDunn, Deuce(idk if reggie is back or not, if so then go with Glenn), Travis Henry

NBA: Kobe Bryant\n\nNFL: Peyton Manning\n\nBryant is a gamebreaker.  It's been rare to see one player take over a game, ala Jordan.  Anyone who drops 81 on a team is a superior player.\n\nManning is the best QB, and the offensive coordinator.  With all due respect to LT, Michael Turner could run behind the Charger line and make up much of the yardage and TDs.  Take Manning away from the Colts, and they are a 0.500 team.

It depends...whats your hangtime and also your distance in the air without the rolling of the ball...can you pin the ball deep and kick it where you want??  If you can do that then you should be able to make it.  A good hangtime would be atleast 3 seconds...distance in the air would be probably 40 yards...just keep practicing and you shuold atleast make college.

Cycle-Ops is a good trainer. They run anywhere from about $150 or so for a wind trainer up to about $250-300 for a fluid trainer. The wind trainer is the closest to a real ride feel (but noisy) with the fluid running it a close second in terms of feel but much quieter. You will need to get rid of the knobby tire for a smooth tread one like the others have said. Another trainer to consider is the Minoura rim drive. It runs the resistance on the side walls of the rim instead of the tire. The max speed recommended is about 25mph from what I remember but the bright side is that it won't wear down your tires so the knobbies can stay.
yep, sucks...my record this year 4-2-2, I think there should be a tie break rule each week, just like with the usual company football pick, or superbowl pick pool passed around the office every year...Monday nights game---WHO WINS, and TOTAL POINTS SCORED. Always seems to be a fair way to settle football problems and ties...besides a tie after Sunday gives you more to look forward to on Monday, have a good one..
The admission fees for races cover lots of things: closing the streets (and all the permits involved), food and water, usually you get a t-shirt and there is an after-party, plus just all of the overhead.  If you want to run, you certainly can do that for free.  But if you want the experience of running in a race, you are going to need to pay for it.

#1.When a body floats it displaces fluid (water here) equal in weight to its own weight. \n\n#2.Buoyancy is equal to weight of the fluid displaced\n\nso that we can say for a floating body: \nbuoyancy = weight of the fluid displaced = weight floating body\n\n#3.Sea water density is more  than that of  fresh water, \n\nso a lesser amount of sea water provides the required buoyancy to enable the swimmer float, and less sea water needs to be displaced. \n\nThis makes the job of swimmer easier.\n\n[BTW: A boiled egg floats easily in salty water for the same reason]
basic speed training are assisted and resisted speed training. Assisted training (also called overspeed training helps to improve stride frequency. Resisted speed training helps to improve speed-strength and stride length.  to improve your speed off the mark and acceleration. \nA typical session may consist of approximately 5 sets of 10 reps\n\ntry some of these sprinting technique drills like these could help improve your technique\nRaise Knees: 10 meters - jog - 10 meters - rest\nSprint 10 meters concentrating on raising knees as higher than normal. Jog for 10 meters and then sprint for 10 meters and rest. \n\nFast Knee Pick Ups: 10 meters - jog - 10 meters - rest\nJogging on the spot raise your knees to waist height while emphasising arm action. Move forward 10 meters with this action concentrating on the number of ground contacts rather than how fast you cover the distance. Try to get as many ground contacts as possible. \n\nFlicks: 10 meters - jog - 10 meters - rest\nWhile sprinting over 10 meters concentrate on flicking your heels up to touch your butt. \n\nLeg Speed: 60 meters\nThis is a normal sprint over 60 meters except all of your focus should be on your legs. Try to gauge the optimum leg speed for you by taking different stride lengths to see which yields the best results. \n\nHigh Hops: 3 x 40 meters\nBound from one foot to the other. The action is similar to skipping except your are trying to gain as much height as possible and stay in the air for as long as possible. Remember to recover fully between attempts. \n\nElbow Drive: 40 meters\nSprint for 40 meters concentrating on driving your elbow in a straight line. Keep your elbows flexed at right angles while keeping your arms relaxed.\n\nSpeed And Agility Drills\n1. Basic Sprints\nSet 2 cones out 10-20 meters apart. Sprint from one cone to the next and slowly jog back to the start. Vary the start of the sprint to make the drill more sport specific. \nFor example... \nFace backwards, lie down, jump up, pretend to receive a pass, jump to head a ball etc. \n\n2. Rolling Start\nExactly the same as above except you jog for 10 meters before sprinting. This drill is specifically designed to enhance acceleration rather than speed off the mark. Try running backwards or side stepping as well.

The benefits are only limited to the instruction you get and how you apply the training.  \n\nAs for those choices....  They can be excellent methods of training and self-defense.  Taijiquan offers a lot both in physical training and in philosophical and mental training (if you have a good teacher who can help you to do more than just a pretty, slow-moving form).  There are various forms of gung fu that offer a great deal of the same, but focus on different aspects or different strategies of dealing with opponents and with life.  \n\nJust don't get caught up in the hype and trappings.  Seek the essence of the art and you'll gain much more than a pretty sash to wear.

"""The numbers are mind-boggling,"" Chargers tight end Antonio Gates says. ""But you know what's really amazing – if he only did one thing, he'd still be a great running back. That tells you how good he really is. If he only caught the ball out of the backfield like he was a third-down back, he could still make the Pro Bowl. Remember, this is a guy that had 100 catches just a few years ago [2003]. And if he only ran the ball like he was a first- and second-down back, he'd still be a Pro Bowler. He's the ultimate three-down back."" \n\nSome will scoff at Tomlinson's numbers and say he has yet to win a Super Bowl. But like Sanders before him, he likely won't need it to validate his existence among the best of all time. In fact, even Schottenheimer's insistence that he may be the best ever may not be far off. Clearly, Tomlinson has proven to have an amazing mixture of many great runners. He has some of the vision and cutting ability of Sanders. He has some of the power and blocking ability of Smith. He has the acceleration and catching ability of Marshall Faulk. And if you want to throw Payton's name out there when you talk about tough yardage, find some film of Tomlinson's stiff arm. It's quite possibly the best in the league today – a wrinkle that even the greatest ever, Jim Brown, can appreciate. \n\n- By Charles Robinson, Yahoo! Sports"

I agree that other than big ten teams they have played no one and the teams from the big ten they did play aren't that good other than Michigan, who has you said PASTED the irish.  I think they get too much credit based on their history,   Personally I think West Virginia, Rutgers, Wisconsin and LSu should all be ranked above the Irish.  It will settle itself though once USC gives them a beat down in two weeks.
Hmmmmm....Kobe... or.... Shaq? That's a hard one. NOT!!!!!!\n\nKobe Bryant kicked out the second best coach in NBA history, Phil Jackson, who is behind Red Auerbach. Kobe also kicked out the guy who won him more than just one championship, the big dog, Shaq himslef. Since Shaq has left, Kobe has... lemme think... missed the playoffs and got eliminated in the first round. Since Shaq has left L.A., Shaq has helped his team to a Game 7 in the Eastern Conference Finals and helped his team win the NBA Championship last year. Now I'm not saying Shaq is the best player on the Miami Heat roster, because everyone knows Dwayne Wade is better right now. Even Shaq knows that. BUT, Shaq is by far better than Kobe. Shaq will go down in the Hall of Fame as a better player than Kobe. No Doubt.

If your not from Alaska you need to hire a guide. Your guide will have knowledge of the herd routes and also have a plane or other mode of transportation to get you to the herd. You just can't drive down a road and expect to see trophy caribou. You need a guide so as to not get yourself lost. You also want someone familiar with the other wildlife in the area, as bears sometimes follow the caribou herds and you are easier to catch then they are!

"Yes they did have a hell in the cell match.  It was on Monday Night Raw on August 24 1998.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_in_a_Cell#Match_history\n\nRAW (August 1998)\nThis little remembered match occurred in August 1998 on an episode of RAW Is WAR, a mere two months after the far more famous Hell in a Cell match at King of the Ring 1998. It is often forgotten due to its lack of hype and the fact that it occurred on broadcast television rather than pay-per-view.\n\nThe most notable part of the match once again involved Mankind falling from the cell. The Undertaker, still somewhat involved in a feud with Mankind, pulled him off the side of the cage whilst he was paused at the halfway point of the structure. However, the landing was botched, with Mankind's lower body destroying the Spanish announcers table that was supposed to break his fall, and his head, back and shoulders directly hitting the concrete floor from a height of fourteen feet. In his second autobiography Foley says that this fall actually hurt him more than his infamous bump from the very top of the cage in the previous cell match.\n\nMankind once again pulled a bag of thumbtacks from beneath the ring, and executed a modified piledriver than cause Kane to land on the tacks. However, Kane looked set to win the match after hitting Mankind with a steel chair three times, followed by a chokeslam and two tombstone piledrivers, the second onto the steel chair. ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin then burst from underneath the ring and attacked Kane. The Undertaker, watching from outside the locked cage, attempted to break into the cage through the roof, but was thwarted by Vince McMahon who used the controls to raise the cage. The match was declared a no contest."

It all depends.  If your league weighs heavily on TDs, then I think I would sit Tiki.  But if you play in a yardage league, I probably sit Gore.  Any way you slice it, though tough, this is a good decision to have to make.  You have 3 pretty solid RBs, and honestly I don't think you can really go wrong with any combination.  Good Luck.

"The funniest I saw was in a local league.  A substitute had taken his track-suite off (it was a freezing cold day) and had been waiting for a considerably long time for the ball to go out of play before the substitution could take place. Eventually when the time came for him to go on, he said to the ref ""about f***ing time I'm f***ing freezing"".   The ref turned to him and showed him the red card, and said ""all right son you can get in the shower and warm up"""

If you REALLY want to be a good sports analyst, you better know how the game works first, and you better know how the strategy of the game works.\n\nIf you do, tell what you see, tell what you think will happen next, tell what you'd do if you were a coach/player in that particular situation...if you don't know what's going on or how things work, your opinion really won't mean much.
"If you work on a Thoroughbred farm, you're going to start at the bottom-- general maintenance and cleanup, i.e., stall-mucking.  Much of the work you'll start out doing will be hard manual labor that doesn't involve hands-on work with the horses.  The work is tough and the pay isn't good.  Also, there may not be any health benefits-- which you may not care about until you desperately need them.\n\nOver time, you'll get to work with the horses more.  While horses are wonderful animals to be around, they are also large animals that can behave unpredictably, and anyone who makes their living handling horses knows that it isn't a question of whether they will ever get hurt by a horse, it's a question of when and how bad. \n\nThis is not to try to discourage you from working with horses, but you have to understand realistically that working with horses can be hard and painful.  It can involve days that begin before the sun is up, when the temperature is below freezing, that don't end until hours after dark.  It can mean being dirty and hot and tired.\n\nAnd the truth is that it just doesn't pay very well.  I have a friend who worked for 15 years at a Standardbred training center.  She broke green two-year-olds, trained racehorses, went to the track with the racehorses, and had her assistant trainer's credential.  After fifteen years of this, she was living in a run-down trailer that didn't have electricity, plumbing or gas, she had no health benefits, no savings, her car was 17 years old and had 190,000 miles on it.\n\nWhen she got an eye infection and ended up having to use the left-over ointment from her dog's eye infection to treat it because she didn't have money for a doctor, she decided that she'd had enough and quit the job.  She works as a pari-mutuel clerk now and has a ""day job"" as well.\n\nShe doesn't regret the years she spent working with the horses, but memories are all she came away with after 15 years."

hi juve, tried to resist answering this Q and you know why, lol. but some things must be said so forgive me this. \n\nWill Zizou and Marco ever make peace? \n\nmaybe, but not for a long time. marco often makes light of it but i think his words hurt zizou more deeply that any wounding ever could. that seems obvious from his statements and actions, a not entirely unreasonable reaction if I may say so. zidane is often labeled a hothead and we’re quick to condemn it as a fatal character flaw. but perhaps it would serve us to remember his background when we judge him. he grew up in a tough environment, always the outsider, someone who struggles to fit in but is never quite able to do so. he often says he is first and foremost “ a kabyle from la castellane”. i think that’s how he ultimately sees himself and there’s more of a connection there than we care to admit.  he is a proud man, always on the defensive bec. of his ethnic background, and every slight on his person, family or honor becomes no trifle thing. trash talk such as marco may have freely indulged in on the pitch is not something we can expect someone like zidane to ever get used to. he would not find it easy to forgive if he thinks his family honor has been defamed.  unless materrazi consciously and sincerely seeks it, there will never be peace. and even then, I’m afraid it would take an extraordinary gesture from him before zizou would open himself up to a reconciliation.
You know I really dissed them early in the season, and especially Herm Edwards. (I have always really disliked the Chiefs from my long history as a frustrated Seahawks fan. - I can forgive them for hurting my beat-up 'Hawks a week ago because they really hammered those annoying Rams THIS week, that's fair enough....)\n\nBut YES, they ARE starting to look pretty good are they not? I think they may be a little short in overall talent this season to take out the Broncos AND the Chargers, but its already a crazy season and who  knows. What the hell, the Chargers DO have Marty Schottenheimer - and that would obviously be: Advantage Chiefs.......
I thought he fought a cautious fight early on but in essence a smart one. He admittedly said he should have started using the jab and combination two rounds earlier and knocked him out in the fifth but Brock was an undefeated solid boxer and Klitschko is determined not to take anyone lightly. This is the second undefeated fighter he has beaten recently as he won a decision over Samuel Peter as well. In addition to the dominant performance over Byrd I think he has earned the undisputed number one heavyweight spot. The next step is unification and I think he will have little trouble with two out of the three unification bouts. I have believed for a long time he was the one and until someone shows me otherwise he is the man to beat.
Actually, I feel certain that the tradition started in Sunnyside.\n\nSunnyside is a neighborhood very near the university where the rents are relatively cheap, and you get what you pay for.\n\nBefore they built the new stadium, the old stadium was right where the Business & Economics building is now, which is right next to Sunnyside.  Most of the bars and partying happened in Sunnyside as well.  Using zoning laws, they drove the bars out of Sunnyside, but it's still probably overall the cheapest place to live in Mo-Town.\n\nIf I were guessing, I'd imagine that the tradition started when a houseful of partying students in Sunnyside pretty much ruined their couch, maybe left it out on the porch for a while until it got really nasty, and were looking for something to burn to celebrate a major WVU victory.\n\nAll hypothetical, but it seems logical to me.\n\n-- WVU College of Engineering Class of 1995

"Kung Fu is the general term that refers to all Chinese martial arts. It is also pronounced ""gong fu"" in the southern provinces (China is united through written language, not spoken!). The actual translation would roughly be ""work"", or ""hard work"", so it is not a very good label! I actually prefer to use the term ""Chinese Boxing"", and another answerer mentioned ""Shaolin Boxing"", which I suppose could be appropriate as well, but gives the impression of being directly related to Shaolin.\nStance training, conditioning drills, weapons (long-range, mid-range, short-range, and projectile), striking, kicks, grappling, in-fighting, ground-fighting, and various types of stretches are all incorporated in training. The moves are many and varied."

I'd be skeptical on using and early pick on him because of the sophomore slump rule.  But as always you draft the best players available or according to your particular startegy which can change at anythime during a live draft that is'nt going your way.  My guess is anywhere from the 4th to 6th rounds is where he should be picked, but if you are confident in his abilities. then you may want to go earlier.  I being from California have not seen the Marlins play that often, so its hard for me to tell if would be able to duplicate his solid rookie season.

A) Barry Bonds is a cheat, a lier, a loser and a disgrace to baseball.  Everyone knows he cheats and knows he lied to Congress.  Since when is that Professional?  He should be kicked out of the league, all records and statistics taken away, and dis owed from baseball.  You CANNOT cheat in a professional sport attempting to beat some of the greatest players b/c you do not have the ability to do so.  There should be no celebration for an records or marks he gets.  Babe Ruth DESERVES his mark in history and a cheat should not be able to surpass it.
"A side compartment in the ""grave"" that the wrestler, in this case the Undertaker, rolls into before the dump of dirt. The camera never shows the inside of the grave and therefore fools the audience. They then wait until the arena is clear and dig up the wrestler. Think about it: there have been several buried alive matches, why only one Undertaker?"
I think its probably up to the person. If the shorts aren't comfortable without underwear then put some on then you won't have to worry about chaffing or that sorta thing.

"Best players?  Depends on what you're looking for in a player.  \nGoalies, some of the best are Martin Brodeur, Roberto Luongo and Mikka Kipprusof\nAmong forwars, some of the ""best would include Jaromir Jagr, Joe Thornton, Dany Heatley, Ilya Kovalchuk, Pavel Datsyuk.  Some top defensemen in the NHL are Zdeno Chara, Wade Redden, Bryan McCabe, Ed Jovonoski, Scott Niedermayer.\nThere's really a ton of ""great"" players, I've skipped over so many.\nAs for ""your team"", depends on what league you're looking to follow.  If you're looking to follow an NHL team, Comcast and Outdoor Life network carry games, as does NBC during the playoffs.  In Canada, games are found on CBC and TSN.  If you're really hardcore, you can get NHL Centre Ice which carries pretty much every NHL game.\nIf you're looking for something a little more local, odds are there's a junior, semio pro or minor hockey team in your area.  check out NHL.com, they have links to hockey federations around the world, as well as semi-pro leagues."

If you've got a bench press in your basement, work on that until you feel comfortable. The first thing you need to do is figure out what weight you max out at (the absolute most you can lift 1 time). Once you've figured that out, your bench workout should be 3-4 sets. \nSet 1) 6 reps of 75% of your max\nSet 2) 6 reps of 80% of your max \nSet 3) 5-6 reps of 85% of your max\nSet 4) 4-5 reps of 85% of your max\nObviously, make sure you have someone spotting you while you do this, because it's not going to be easy, especially the first few times you do it. DO NOT do this two days in a row...make sure you have at least one day off in between so your muscles have time to recover. If the 4th set it too much, then just do the first three. The sets should be difficult, but if they are too much, drop the %'s down by 5%. I'm not a trainer or anything, I just used to lift for football and that's approximately the plan they had us use. Hope it helps.
"The clubs themselves should do more to eradicate racism, instead of just paying lip service and hoping the problem will go away.  If the clubs fail then they should be fined heavily by the Football Association they are affiliated to.  If the national FA's are not taking appropriate action then it is up to UEFA (and their counterparts) and finally FIFA to take stern action.  Just now, nobody from club up to FIFA is taking racism seriously.  All we get is little sound bites like ""Kick Racism out of Football"", but who is doing the kicking?"

Devin Harris
Roberts is hot right now, so get him while he is still racking up steals. He's on pace for 66, but don't count on that. He's usually good for 30+, though, and I think that's what he'll end up with. Some better long-term solutions that might be available in your league are Felipe Lopez, Chone Figgins and maybe even Ryan Freel. Roberts is halfway to 30 steals already and may only give you 15 more while Figgins and Freel are around 10 steals and should finish with 30+. Lopez is leading the majors, so I doubt he'll be available in your league. But grab Roberts while he's still hot and when he starts to cool down, grab one of these other guys.

PAOLO ROSSI - ITALIA ...6 GOALS INCL . A HAT TRICK
"well they both have similar styles in that they are wrestlers that avoid submissions and often times use submissions of their own, but the intent is more so to pummel the opponent rather than look for a submission. although both of them are very capable of submitting: as hughes has won via submission almost 50% of the time. gsp hasnt fought as much as matt, but hes won a good portion  of his fights via submission. but both are primarily ""ground and pounders"", taking their opponents to the ground and using the fence to deliver elbows. from all the fights ive seen from both fighters, you can say that gsp is a mirror image of hughes. gsp is a bit more explosive and has much better striking. hughes builds his dominance around strength and experience while gsp does it with strength and youth. \nand if you want to compare further, you can do fighters that they share. they both fought bj penn, frank trigg, adn sean sherk. bj penn beat hughes the first time and gsp barely survived bj winning a decision. matt hughes beat frank trigg twice... pretty much tooled him the first time but the second one was one of the greatest comebacks ever...gsp raped trigg. sher vs hughes was a battle and sherk actually took 2 rounds from hughes in a 5 round fight... gsp raped sherk in round 1.... but keep in mind hughes beat gsp"

Amen! Until there is a playoff system, college football will be little more than a popularity contest. I'm not a Michigan fan at all, but if they're not still #2, then the current system is even more screwed up than I thought. Any way you slice it Michigan is statistically the #2 team in the nation. They deserve a rematch more than Florida, USC, or Rutgers deserves a shot at Ohio State. If the system was done right, Florida, USC, Rutgers, Notre Dame, and a few others would all get their shot in a playoff with Ohio State and Michigan being the #1 and #2 seeds. A fair playoff system would include the top 16 teams in the country. A perfect record, regardless of strength of schedule, would be an automatic bid. After that, I'd trust the current ranking system to pick the remaining teams. One month later, we'd be crowning a National Champion who truly deserved it!

do your abs every other day fully and every day do a half workout a full workout should be about 35 to 40 mins. and a half no less than 15 try and go full out for 1 min. intervals with maybe 10 to 40 second rests in between depending on your ability. my favorit's are partner leg throws, and ABC leg lifts this is where you lay on your back with your legs straight out in front of you and you spell the letters of the alphabet as far as you can go in capitols try and keep your legs straight and your neck flat on the ground. Also do crunches to the sides with your hands across your chest so you dont pull on your neck and make sure never to jerk up your head. otherwise any basic abb workout will probably suit you. just make sure its something you will enjoy doing otherwise you wont get as much out of it.\ni am a highschool athlete who puts a lot of time into the abs and works with the trainer at my school personely.

I cant stand it. I have Time-Warner and have been royally screwed with football this year. I'm a Syracuse Orange Die-hard and NFL fanatic. ESPN took control of the Big-East and put the games on ESPN 360 and ESPN U which Time Warner doesn't cover. Now the NFL network wants to make more money than they already are by charging Time-Warner more money to host the games on a main sports tier (like ESPN), but Time Warner doesn't want to charge their customers more because not everyone is a football fan. \n\nI dont blame Time-Warner, but ESPN and the NFL Network have to at least make the games accessible to everyone. I wouldn't mind paying a few bucks to watch the games I want to see!
Naw you clearly don't need it.

"laying Lines:\nThe outside dimensions of the playing lines should be as follows:\nDoubles 36' x 78' (10.97m x 23.77m)\nSingles 27' x 78' (8.23m x 23.77m)\nAll lines should be not less than 1"" (2.54 cm) nor more than 2"" (5 cm) in width, except the base line which  may be up to 4"" (10 cm) in width and the center line which should be 2"" (5 cm) in width.\nClearance Between Courts\nWhere courts are constructed within the confines of a common enclosure, the distance between side lines should be not less than 12' (3.658m). Where space permits, it is desirable to provide additional space between side lines to enhance play; 24' (7.315m) is recommended.\nTennis Court Orientation:\nA tennis court should be laid out to minimize players looking into the sun when serving or when following  the flight of a ball. A tennis court also should be laid out to avoid distracting shadow lines and patterns on the court surface.\n\nTheoretically, the best possible layout would be to orient the longitudinal axis of the court perpendicular to the azimuth of the sun -- the angular measurement of the horizontal location of the sun in relation to true north. Since the azimuth of the sun constantly shifts according to the time of day, the season of the year and the latitude in which it is observed, it is difficult to generalize about an ideal orientation.\nNOTE: It is important to remember that the orientation of the court should be in relation to true  north, not to magnetic north. The angular difference between true north and magnetic north is  referred to as the ""deviation of magnetic north."" This deviation changes according to the  geographic location. Information relating to the deviation of magnetic north from true north can be easily obtained from a local surveyor or airport facility."

No truth to it. The Miami and Alabama coaching jobs are now open though. He'll stay in the South, but probably with the Gamecocks.
Two things have to happen brutha.  They need a scoring winger.  An accomplished winger that can just hammer the puck home.  Remember the San jose Sharks last season?  Cheechoo Thornton, Cheechoo Thornton.  It can't happen when you got ECHL'ers like John Madden raping you all game.  One line can't do it!\n\nAlso, they need a SOLID Defenseman.  Orpik's return will help, but Scudichar have to go.  I don't mind Scuderi positionally but look at Carolina's top 6 last playoffs.  I honestly think Letang should be up because he is a right hand shot and can get the puck to the net.  The Pens have a tendency to keep US born defensemen.  Nothing wrong with that but Letang was a perfect replacement for Jackman.  Jackman had an absolute rocket.  Now all of our defensemen are left-handed shots.  Not good for one timers on a PP.  Kovalchuk scores all his goals waiting on the left point for one-timers (he is a right handed shot.)  We have nobody to put over there to rifle it.  \n\n\nTo sum it up I'd say go after Glen Murray.  Lose Malone.  He is totally disinterested in playing professional hockey.  We have to go for this thing now before the salary cap kicks in.  Glen Murray straight up (or even Boyes which was rumoured before) for Ryan Malone and a pick and LeClair.!\n\nAs for D?  Mark Eaton is a hell of a defenseman.  I am surprised -- never seen him play before.  We need a Phaneuf style defenseman.  I know he is impossible to get.  But someone that can impose fear in an offence.  Fleury got ran over at least 3 times versus LA the other night and there was no one on the ice to help him out.  Cairns is coming back but he is getting like Hatcher - he's not the greatest skater.  \n\nRay Shero will figure something out!!
"I coached High School basketball for a few season and coaches always look for a few things:\n\n1.  Foot work\n2.  Court vision\n3.  Moving with-out the ball\n4.  And of course, shot technique (regardless if it goes in or not)\n\nThings you can do include the following drills:\n\n1.  Jump stop and pivot with both legs (front and back pivot).  Start from one baseline and jog to the other baseline, and do a jump stop and a pivot in the free-throw line, half-court, other side free-throw line, and then finally baseline on the other side.\n2.  Dribble between cones with your head up (since you admit not being a good dribbler, this will help you out), and at 5'9"", you will need dribbling skills.  Warm-up by dribbling in one place for 5 minutes with your head up.  REMEMBER, practice more with your OFF HAND.  (less dominant hand)\n3.  Learn to set picks and move with out the ball...coaches love players who can do this with-out being told.  This unfortunately can only be learned by playing alot, but while you are playing, try not to ask for the ball, instead, try setting picks and opening up other players for a shot.\n4.  As far as shot techniques, you can do a few drills...my favorite is when a player starting above the top of the key dribbles toward the shoulder of the free-throw line and takes a shot.  Another drill would be starting from the sideline then heading toward the free-throw, have someone to pass you the ball from the otherside, and then pivot and shoot at the same time.  Pretend you are coming off a curl or screen.\n\nHope this helps you get started."

Although I don't agree with everything you said, I gotta say I hope this sis only a one time challenge and the match happens on a RAW and then is done with it. Usually you can have a decent fued even if you have a crappy wrestler as long as the other wrestler involved is good. But if you mix pond water with raw waste and get perfume. I want Cena to drop the title so badly but if he does it to Umaga I am going to be pissed. I actually thought Orton and Edge would break up and then Orton would fued with Cena. That would be ok. As much as I hate Cena I understand why he is a main eventer. People like him. So I'm going to root for him for that reason and the fact that I think Umaga is just a huge load of crap.
Yes - a work colleague threw a maltesa at me and it hit me on the top of the nose causing a massive nose bleed.

Hun, you are right. I only look at Cena's career, not at his personal life. It's true, no one needs to know his personal life. It is very tiring if people keep on asking whether Cena is married or not, as if they got a chance to be with him.
i used to play for leyton orient\nin the season when barry hearn took over and we were second bottom of what is now league 2 ( used to be division 3)\nwe were at home to rochdale  when we  had a throw in, i went to pick the ball up and a so called fan spat at me,  i looked at him and just wanted to punch his lights out and all i could do was ask him a simple question\n\ni said,  \n\nif we are this bad and you have to be in a moranic state of mind towards your own players    why do you come and pay good money?\nthe supporters around him applauded me and then he was ejected by the police after a kind lady complained,\nafter the game finished i went over to that section of the crowd and thanked them for their support\nthat was the single worst incident in my 9 year pro career

The new general manager for the detriot lions is William Clay Ford.
You make a solid case for trading michael Vick.  I often wonder if the receivers feel the same way.  They have a solid receiving corps and an excellent tight end.  Vick was an excellent college quarterback, and he still is.  If they could run the option and mix in the pass sporadically he would be the perfect fit.  But in the NFL the option is just not an option. (funny?....nah)  You are correct about Schaub.  He seems to be a nice QB with an accurate arm and good decision making skills.  I think Vick is too concerned with proving to everyone that he can pass when most would be satisfied if he can prove that he can win.  I think he has the skills to be a good QB but he must work on his accuracy and decisions.  I think Atlanta is not the right place for him.  They want to run the west coast offense for which Schaub would be an excellent fit.  I say trade him.  You won't get the full value.  Maybe take a second round pick.
Here is what you do...package Chad Johnson, Donte Stallworth and Lienart in for a Qb maybe try getting Eli Manning  or Mc Nabb...  if you can't get a decent qb from trades can you go and pick up one on wavier wire like Kitna , Grossman, Pennington , or Carr...I would try to get some Rb's back man you're gonna need then.

I'd go Gabriel. SD's defense isn'y going to let Frye look far enough downfield for Cleveland to produce well. Jones has been consistently worthless. Indy's secondary let Plummer throw on them, and Brady's as good at picking apart a defense as any, so I'd say Doug will be your best chance for points

The true quality of a fighter is one who never gives up, never. Is able to take the strongest of punches and still remain on his feet. Always alert and relentless........ the true fighter in any age and time fought for what they believed was right and stood by it regardless of the consequences.

I went with Bruce Lee. Jackie Chan and Jet Li are very excellent performers but no matter how good they look or how entertaining their movies are, they're still just performers. Bruce Lee, on the other hand, was actually a martial artist who also sparred against live opponents in tournaments. Besides, Jackie Chan himself even said that if he was threatened by a robber on the street, he would do the practical thing and give up his wallet.

The thing that made me stop watching the WWE was the lack of entertainment and reality it has. It is also very predictible. The matches are so fake! I know it is 'sports entertainment' and scripted and that, but seriously, TNA is scripted, but they entertain me and they are unpredictible and the matches look real. TNA contains real talent. So does the WWE but the WWE puts its real talents in the locker room and get morons like John Cena out to hold and retain the championship for the next few years. Yes i agree with 'go TNA'. What also made me quit watching was the fact that the 'creative team' were really uncreative. They keep on reminding us the story lines that happened a few years ago. They keep on repeating things over and over again with a different twist; different wrestlers. It's crazy, it really is, they are running out of ideas and they are not entertaining me, have a nice day and thanks for this question.

The only PERFECT vintage Bowden I have ever seen is at the Smithsonian on loan from the owner. The value of such an item is going to be hard to pin down but perhaps you can do an online search.\n\nStrangely, the Spacelander was designed about 1946 in aluminum but not placed into production until 1960, so if he has the original 1951 fiberglas prototype it's value is inestimable. A mint 1960 version has seen pricing in the $10,000 to $12,000 range.\n\nThe Spacelander, as you probably already know, was reproduced in the 1990s, and I think they are still available today, these can be had for less than a couple of thousand dollars.\n\nWhen it comes to pricing bicycles, even the smallest imperfection detracts from value unless the bike is hopelessly rare (the Spacelander may fall into this category). However, value is enhanced with original bills of sale and original literature and hangtags, etc.\n\nYou might want to check out http://sheldonbrown.com to see if he has any additional info on them.\n\nEDIT! You can find the reproductions on http://nostalgiamerchants.com
three piece is far superior to a one piece slate , a one piece is really only reserved for cheap or bar style tables , a three piece slate you can level each piece indivually to the frame with wedges under the slate liner and it can be perfect , a one piece will never be perfect , you cant effictivly level  the slate , if it has a crown or dip in one end what ever you do to fix that spot will ultimately effect the other areas of the piece somewhere ......Thre piece is the way , Olhausen make a top notch table, and the slate they use is the best , they use genuine Italian slate , manafuactured by OIS ..good stuff ......

"If someone wants to know about somethin then that's why they created this forum, and as Dyrtbyrd said, this isn't a serious forum, so yeah you're gonna have some rather strange or unorthodox, and pretty outlandish and possibly completely ignorant questions that have absolutely nothing to do with Martial Arts (ie: ""how do I become a Jedi Knight"").\n\nto me, the only stupid question is the one that isn't asked.\n\nand I'm no expert and don't claim to be, but I try to give as good an answer as I can to the best of my knowledge r try to research it to give the person a better understanding if I can, whether or not they take anyones advice here is purely up to them. my words are just as much my opinion as anyone else's here, I just try to give as fair and as accurate an account of ANY discipline without as little (if any) bias or predjudice as possible.\n\nMichael S: I appreciate your vote of confidence, I gotta say also that you've had some pretty interesting points in your own answers as well, which I believe help the rest of us, it's the collective effort that really matters, and not just our own opinions"
I think, in my biased opinion, that Ohio State, with the weapons that they have (Smith, Ginn, Gonzalez and Pittman) and the ability of their team to play big, in big games, will beat any team that they face in Glendale AR. January 8.\n\n\nAs long as it's not a rematch with Michigan.\n\nI'm not making 'excuses', but with the news of Bo Schembechler's sudden and tragic death, I think the Wolverines were put on an emotional roller-coaster, only hours before they had to head South to play the Buckeyes.\nGiven an appropriate amount of time to accept and absorb the recent events I think that Michigan puts forth their best effort and beats Ohio State. Especially since, if they were to play again, that this game would be on a neutral field.

Yes he can. Actually most of the Argentinians and Brazilian players are either Spaniards or Italians. \n\nAfter working in Europe for a number of years, a player can apply for citizenship. This is something that is very convenient for the club they play for. European regulations set a limit to the number of no-European players a club can hire. \n\nRafa Marquez, like Ronaldo or Roberto Carlos had an Spaniard passport, Spaniard citizenship but they will not play for the Spain´s team. FIFA´s rule comes into play here. One player can only play for one national team, and this is the country of origin, no the country of citizenship. (There is an exception to the rule, if one player had never play with his country of origin, then he can play for the country of adoption)
"Insanely difficult motorsport events are becoming more popular all the time - here's a new one which is being described as ""the Paris-Dakar of India"". The Great Arc event has been devised by Sevenoaks-based company ROARR, which also runs the Jewel of India and the Himalaya Classic Rally.\n\nThe new event pays homage to William Lambton and Sir George Everest, the two leaders of the Great Trigonometric Survey of India. The Survey was begun by Lambton and took decades to complete; Lambton died long before the end of the process and was succeeded by his assistant Everest, after whom the world's highest mountain was subsequently named.\n\nThe Great Arc Rally will follow their route from the southern tip of the subcontinent to Hathiopaon in the north, where Everest spent many years calculating the results of the survey. The sting in the tail is that competitors in two of the classes - for 4x4s and motorbikes - will have to go in as straight a line as possible up the spine of India. That means creating river crossings and beating a path through jungles, among other adventures.\n\nCompetitors in the third class, for classic vehicles (anything built before 1975), will be given a less stressful route, sticking to roads and tracks at all times.\n\nThe event will start in October 2007 and last for 21 days. Entry fees are £14,850 for a car and two drivers or £7425 for a bike and rider. Food, accommodation, route guidance, telemetry, medical services and mechanical backup are all included in the fee. If you want to enter the 4x4 class but don't want to bring a vehicle with you, ROARR will hire you a local jeep."

There's a couple of things to be clarified here.  First, did the cue ball or the object ball contact a cushion after initial contact?  If not, then your opponent would get ball in hand for the foul under BCA rule 3.19.  Rule 3.31 completely answers your question, though.  If the object ball remains motionless for more than 5 seconds and then drops into the pocket so that the cue ball passes over the spot where the object ball was, then both the object ball and the cue ball will be replaced as close as possible to their original positions with your opponent shooting again.  It doesn't happen very often, but it's a good rule to know.  M.D.-BCA Instructor/Referee.
"Origine\nll y a 1300 ans, Daruma (fondateur du Bouddhisme Zen en Inde), aurait introduit le Bouddhisme en Chine, y intégrant des méthodes d'enseignement spirituelles et physiques. Ces techniques étaient si éprouvantes que certains disciples tombaient d'épuisement ! \nPour leur donner plus de force et d'endurance, il développa une technique d'entraînement plus progressive. Il en fit un livre, Ekkin-Kyo, qui peut être considéré comme le premier livre de karaté.\n\nL'entraînement physique, fortement marqué par les principes philosophiques de Daruma, était enseigné au temple Shaolin en 500 avant J.C.\nEn résumé, le karaté d'Okinawa est la synthèse de 2 techniques de combat :\n- La première, utilisée par les habitants d'Okinawa était simple et terriblement efficace, et surtout très proche de la réalité car elle était utilisée depuis des siècles lors de véritables combats. \n- La seconde, beaucoup plus élaborée et imprégnée d'éléments philosophiques était le produit d'une ancienne culture chinoise. \nCette double origine explique la dualité du Karaté : très violent et efficace, mais en même temps une discipline stricte et austère marquée par une philosophie non violente. \n\nL'une des rares personnes à maîtriser toutes les méthodes du karaté d'Okinawa, Maître Funakoshi a enseigné une discipline complète, synthèse de tous les styles d'Okinawa. \nCette méthode fut connue sous le nom de Shotokan (Shotokan signifie ""Maison de Shoto"", nom d'écrivain de Funakoshi qui fut aussi poète, ). De part la grande popularité de ce style au Japon, et plus tard dans le monde entier, Funakoshi est considéré comme le père du karaté shotokan moderne.\n\nNé en 1868, il a commencé à étudier le karaté à 11 ans et a été l'élève de deux grands maîtres de l'époque, Azato et Itosu. Il était si bon élève qu'on lui enseigna tous les styles de karaté d'Okinawa.\nPour lui, le mot ""karaté"" prit avec le temps une signification plus large et synthétisa toutes ces méthodes pour devenir le ""karaté-do"", la voie du karaté, ou la main vide.\n\nEn 1916, il fit une démonstration au Botokuden de Kyoto (sur la principale île du Japon) qui était à l'époque le centre officiel de tous les arts martiaux. Le 6 mars 1921, le Prince héritier (qui deviendra Empereur du Japon), visita Okinawa et demanda à Funakoshi de lui faire une démonstration. \nEn 1922, il voyagea jusqu'à Tokyo pour présenter le karaté lors de la première exposition nationale sportive, organisée par le ministère de l'éducation.\nDevant le succès de sa méthode, on lui demanda de rester au Japon, et il ne retourna jamais à Okinawa.\nPar la suite, son fils, Yoshitaka introduira des exercices de combat et adaptera la pratique du karaté à la tradition japonaise. \nLe Karaté est aujourd'hui probablement l'art martial le plus populaire au monde.\nContrairement au Judo et à l'Aïkido, le Karaté ne fut jamais l'oeuvre d'un seul homme,\nmais celle de plusieurs générations de maîtres et de disciples,\nà travers une multitude d'écoles et de styles originaux qui conservent, aujourd'hui encore,\ntoutes leurs caractéristiques spécifiques.  \n \n Le karaté est un art qui cultive le courage et permet de développer la santé physique et mentale. De plus, grâce à l'entraînement de karaté, une personne peut se défendre contre une agression physique sans utiliser d'arme.\nToutefois, on peut également utiliser selon les circonstances certains outils ou instruments pour se défendre.\nLes gens voient souvent des techniques de casse de planches ou bris de tuiles avec le poing nu, et ceci fait qu'ils se méprennent sur le vrai but de l'entraînement de karaté. En fait ces techniques sont des techniques mineures.\nDe même que tout autre art martial, l'essence de l&#39"

"Theme Music \nBenoit started out with a more contemporary version of Dynamite Kids old theme song in Japan. \nDuring his ECW tenure, Benoit used the song ""Back In The Saddle"" by Aerosmith as his theme music \nIn WWE he was given a more generic theme song entitled ""Shooter"", which is a more intimidating version of his Japanese theme. \nIn 2002, the Canadian rock band Our Lady Peace performed a version of ""Shooter"" with lyrics entitled ""Whatever"". This song is still used by Benoit today."

"Both American football and soccer have their origins in varieties of football played in the United Kingdom in the mid-19th century, and American football is directly descended from rugby football.\n\nMcGill University athletes, who had learned rugby from the local British Army garrison, introduced the sport to the U.S. with a game against Harvard University in 1874. The game quickly spread to other Ivy League colleges.\n\nEncouraged by Yale University's Walter Camp, the schools began to adopt rules that would differentiate American football from rugby in the 1880s. The scrimmage was introduced in 1880 and the system of downs in 1882.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, football had become notoriously dangerous; 18 college players died in 1905 alone. Colleges responded with a series of rule changes to open up the game, most importantly the forward pass, along with outlawing dangerous formations such as the ""flying wedge"", and introducing and requiring better equipment such as helmets.\n\nThe game had achieved its modern form by 1912, when the field was changed to its current size, the value of a touchdown increased to 6 points, and a fourth down added to each possession. Originally dominated by the Ivy League, football soon captured the interest of colleges nationwide. By 1916, when the Rose Bowl game matching eastern and western teams became an annual event, football had developed a national following second only to baseball among team sports.\n\nProfessional football developed in the mill towns of Pennsylvania and the American Midwest in the early years of the 20th century. The NFL was founded in 1920 in Canton, Ohio. Professional football remained a largely regional sport of secondary importance until after World War II. Television broadcasts greatly enhanced NFL football's national appeal, and the pro game surpassed both college football and baseball in popularity in the 1960s. The first Super Bowl—between the champions of the NFL and the rival American Football League—was played in 1967, and the two leagues merged in 1970"
"Cal is short for ""California."" Why just ""California""? It's the same reason the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor is just ""Michigan"" or the University of Texas in Austin is just ""Texas"" -- Berkeley is the oldest and premier institution of the University of California system. Hence, the school is called California, or just ""Cal"" for short."
"your hands should be slightly ahead of the ball . to allow your hands to ""zip"" thru at impact. also ball position is quite important . with the longer irons i.e. 2 , 3 etc you have a wider swing arc so the ball should be opposite inside of left heel and gradually move it slightly towards the centre of your stance as you progress thru the irons , so that when playing a 9 iron or wedge the ball should be roughly middle of your stance . golden rule is never swing too fast or try and hit the ball too hard take an extra club and don,t get involved in macho duels with your playing partners !! if he hits a 7 there,s no shame in hitting a 6 as long as it get,s the required result . you have a bag of 14 clubs , and it,s irrelevant whether you hit the green with a 9 or a 7 the score on the card is what matters !   enjoy !!!!"

Brady should be your start. Sure Bree's is getting some good games in but Brady is coming off a close loss with something to prove; meaning he will own the jets in the pass game. I have a feeling he will have a 3 passing touchdown game with well over 250 passing yards, maybe even 10 yards scrambling up field if the jets get good coverage.
Weaver is a mediocre pitcher. He has been his whole career. He pitched very well in the World Series, and he deserves credit for that. But let's not forget that he was so bad with the Angels early in the season that they designated him for assignment. Weaver is a free agent, and he will command a big salary because there are few pitchers available on the market. IMO, whoever signs Weaver will regret it. He will have his moments, but he is very inconsistent.

Yes I think they are favourites along with Barcelona. You could pick any from Chelsea, Barcelona, Man Utd, Lyon or Bayern Munich and Arsenal are playing good football lately. I think Chelsea have the edge because although the other teams may play more attractive football Chelsea are very very consistent and rarely lose. Barca, Man Utd etc can destroy teams on their day but can be more inconsistent

If you want to avoid the rush ( and there will be for this one) and you want to soak up a bit of atmosphere and get settled in , i'd recommend you should try to get there about 45 minutes beforehand. We usually do when we go  and this seems to be always just fine.Enjoy the game!
every team has statisticians at every game, and the NHL does too, I think, to gather all the information.\nA goal is scored for your team when your on the ice gives you a plus 1. If your on the ice when you get scored upon, you get a minus 1. This is not so much indicative of the player, more for the team strength and when a player is on the ice. Offensive forwards generally have plus ratings. Even the best defense man may have a minus rating. A strong team that scores a lot and everyone on the team may be a plus.

I can only see success for him. While hitters, with the exception of Hideki Matsui, are not as powerful in the US, the pitchers seem to be able to adapt to the MLB easier. He has some filthy stuff and I will draft him on several fantasy leagues next year.

I would have to put Maurice Jones-Drew in at RB1. He has a better chance against Mia. than Taylor has against the force that is the Chi. D. For RB2, put Dillion in. He's just your backup and he will probably have a better day vs. the porous Detroit Lions D, even when he shares the ball with Maroney, than the Minnesota Vikings w/ Taylor will have vs. Chi.'s defense. For WR3, put Nate Washington in. The Steelers have been throwing the ball more, even though they're losing because of it,. Either way, Nate Washington should have a field day against the Buc's secondary. The fact that Ward is out just allows Washington more catches and better production.
His understudy was van der Gouw.\n\n- Schmeichel's successor was Bosnich.\n- Nick Culkin (not Rachubka) played 10 seconds or so in a game against Arsenal after van der Gouw got injured during the match. Bosnich was injured before the game.\n- Fergie then brought in Taibi, and you know what happened\n\nNext season, he bought Fabian Barthez. Bosnich was let go, and Roy Carroll was his understudy now. Andy Goram had a short spell too.\n\nAfter Barthez left came Tim Howard. Carroll continued to be backup.\n\nThen we now have van der Sar, plus Kuzczack(?) as understudy. Carroll was released, and Howard left on loan.\n\nThat's about 10 then.\n\nEDIT: I forgot Ricardo. Third choice Spainard who had a couple of games.

I agree completely.  Who needs the NBA???  Its just a bunch of over paid guys walking around on the court.  Split the category, college basketball is much better!
I see Quinn getting drafted early, I believe a trade up into the top 5 for a team is possible that wants Quinn.  Number one pick who knows there really isnt a clear cut top 5 draft order yet
Depends what kind of league you're in.  Williams will probably get more yards, but Lundy has the better chance of finding paydirt.\n\nIf you're in a default yahoo league, I'd start Lundy.  Williams is up against a Washington defense that has only allowed 3 TDs all year long.
Jones and Addai. Bell has been really unconsistent this year and hasn't really had a great game.
Brady at QB against the Jets\nHarrison & Fitzgerald at WR\nS. Jackson & Jones-Drew at RB

One thing I have learned in my career is that it is easier to make the team when you are going against less people.  If you want you could injure all of your other competitors to ensure that you make the team.
It depends upon how the patch is attached.  \n\nIf it is sewed on, get a stitch cutter and it is real easy to remove.  Its a small tool designed to safely and easily cut stitches without damaging the material.\n\nIf it is an iron-on patch, although you can get it off, some of the glue will often remain on the cloth and discolor it.  You must have an iron, and either the protective paper used to put the patch on or a crisp, clean cloth.  \n\nI have found that wetting the cloth beneath the patch helps.  Put the cloth or protective paper over the patch and heat it until it is loose and use some clamping scissors or tweezers to peel the patch off.  You must quickly scrape off the glue using a clean, flat-bladed tool like a putty knife or a butter knife.\n\nGood luck, it's not an easy procedure.

You don't have to have requirements. You just need to show them your willingness and confidence! Ultimately, it's the coach's decision, but it's captain and asst. captain that confirm the coach's decision.
too much . . . kind of glad that he withdrew from the Tour Championship last week.  This allowed other players to actually be in contention and get the money.
He debuted for OVW in 1999. But in WWE/ECW he debuted on August 1, 2006 as he defeated Justin Credible. He has been undefeated ever since.
You feel better now that you got that out of your system... maybe next time you might actually ask a question!!
Whether you are a restricted or unrestricted free agent in the NBA depends on the amount of time you have in the league when your current contract expires. If you have a certain amount of service time then you can become an unrestricted free agent, meaning that you can sign with any team for any amount of money. If you have less than the prescribed time in the league than you can shop around with other teams and get an offer for yourself. However, if your current team matches that offer in the time alotted, then you have to go and play for them. That is the difference. I am not sure what amount of service in the league you have to have to qualify for unrestricted free agency.
A good QB makes a bad WR good. It has happened with Brett Farve a couple years back he has an effect on all the players.

Walks and hits per inning pitch.  This is more or less the number of baserunners a pitcher allows an inning... this is also considered a more accurate representation of how good a pitcher is (much more so than ERA).\n\nA excellent WHIP is 1.00 or under; usually only the top closers and maybe one or two starters have WHIPs this low.  A WHIP of 1.50 I'd think would be average, anything above that is... not very good.
They probably won't. I agree, he's not a long-term solution at all. What they might do is try to get a blockbuster trade (not necessarily this season, but future ones) and try to get a big man. I remember last year, there were rumors of a Kevin Garnett trade with them. But the other option, is that they might try to groom one of their draft picks or future draft picks into becoming their center for the future. They messed up by letting BOTH wallace and milicic go.

Firstly to The Shadow, you have no idea what AFL is and what is the objective of the game is, and the Irish media is pumping something that is part of the game, to something  that is out of this world. Come on you people how soft do you want this game to be? International Rules is crap and should be thrown out. \n\nNow Whay, to answer your question our game the AFL is growing and growing around the world, slowly but surely. here are some countries that do play our great game in a lower level :\n\nModern Era - The game begins abroad\nIn the late 1980s, as distance became less of an obstacle, amateur teams were established in Japan (1987), England, Denmark and Canada (1989).\n\nIn the 1990s, amateur competition has grown in countries such as Sweden (1993), Germany (1995), USA (1996), Argentina, Spain and Samoa (1997), South Africa (1998), as well as a number of solely expatriate teams, mainly based in South East Asia.\n\nSince 2000, fledgeling competitions have been established in countries such as Ireland (2000), Tonga (2002), Scotland, France and China (2005).\n\nIn 2006, Pakistan, Indonesia, Catalonia, Norway, Bermuda and East Timor joined the list of playing nations.\n\nMany of these were initially established by Australian expatriates but collecting growing numbers of native players. In other countries, it grew out of AFL exhibition matches, cult television following or Internet communication. North American fans formed an organization, AFANA, specifically to work for improved media coverage of Australian football. Since the 1990s, the AFL and other development bodies have contributed to the development the game overseas.\n\nPapua New Guinea, New Zealand, South Africa, the United States, Canada, Japan and Denmark in particular have shown strong growth and potential amongst local players.\n\nI hope this helped you, \n\nFootball is our game, and the AFL is trying to show what our great game is all about to the world.
there is no formula it all depends on the flight and schedule
Since this is in the Rugby League category, I assume you want to know about the Brisbane Broncos. As mentioned, they first joined the NSWRL (now the NRL) in 1988. Their captain was Wally Lewis. Their first game was against the defending premiers Manly, whom they beat quite convincingly. From memory, it was about 44-10. And I think they won their first 6 games of the season too. \nThey went on to finish the year in 7th out of 16 teams, just missing the finals by one win (they had a five-team finals system in those days). Incidently, Manly (they beat them twice throughout the year) finished 4th and made the finals.\nThey managed to win their first premiership in 1992, going back-to-back in 1993.
"AYRTON voyons, SCHUMi ne l'a JAMAIS battu et n'aura jamais l'occasion de le faire, mais plus sérieusement ce n'est pas une question de palmarès (7 pour Mike et 5 pour le brésilien) c'est une question de hargne, Ayrton se battait pour écraser son rival, il n'hésitait pas à démolir le véhicule de son adversaire, sur la ligne de départ, alors que schumi se battait (très bien) pour courir après son chèque et ses cachets publicitaires, mais bon tout ceci est incomparable parce que, ce sont deux très grands  sportifs, de génération tout a fait différente, avec des apports technologiques automobiles ABSOLUMENT diffèrent;\n\nRÉSUME\n  SCHUMARER énorme palmarès mais trop marketing, fin de carrière un ""peu"" décevante(comparer à 2000-2004: quand il larguait ses concurrents de 50 sec, avec des voitures bourres de HIGH TECH), mais il a pas à en rougir\n  SENNA, très bon palmarès, mort pour (de) sa passion, moins tape à l'oeil, avec les moyens du bord qui n'était pas médiocre, mon choix de coeur\n\n  CONCLUSION\nSCHUMI est le meilleur pilote mais SENNA est le plus grand"

1) Be peppy!! Have a loud voice, and don't be afraid to act/say silly things!\n2) Be flexable! Make sure you can do basic jumps such as straddle, wolfe, and tuck. You may also need to know how to do a round-off, backhandspring, back tuck, or a split.\n3) Memorize things well! You may want to talk to previous cheerleaders and learn a few cheers so you can have a head start. Memorizing all the arm/leg movements and words can be hard all at one time. You might also want to make up your own cheers to help you memory, but make them challenging!\n4) Be time flexable! Make sure you can make it to all the games, and all the practices. Missing too many may result in being kicked off the team.\n5) Be strong! If you aren't the lightest person on the team, you will have to spot others. Make sure you are able to stay in a spot that is requiring lots of strength for awhile. Push ups and pull ups will take care of that!\nGOOD LUCK!

I wonder that everytime I see him.  It looks huge!!!  It also makes him look like he has no neck.  His hair contributes a little to that.  That may be why it is larger also, because he has so much hair it takes up more space than other players so he needs a bigger helmet.  That's just speculation though.  I have noticed it looks different than other players though.

Abdominal myositis? Why would treatment be different for a football player (professional or not)?\n\nPlease elaborate on your question. The better the question, the better the chance of a good answer.
The other guy ahead of me is COMPLETELY incorrect.  The Cardinals have a STORIED past and have added to baseball's great history with many of baseball's greatest players and teams.  The media IS biased against the Cardinals but not because, as the other guy incorrectly stated, the Cardinals don't have a storied past.  They are biased against teams with smaller payrolls, unlike the Dodgers, Yankees and the like.  The East and West coast tend to shun the midwest and anyone else who doesn't buy the souls of the greatest players walking.  If I was as rich as some of those guys, I'd have a championship team right now.  Anybody can do that.  It takes a team like the Cardinals, though, to come out as heroes.  They will always have that special place in baseball - the hardworking Midwesterners.

Watch the draw after tonights games
Chelsea's away draw to FC Barcelona during the 2006-2007 UEFA Champions' League Group A match.
We usually do predictions at work and my prediction for MIP was Charlie V. So far this season,the guy has been impressive and regardless of what other people think, Bobby Simmons' return will not drastically affect Charlie's numbers. Charlie V balls for real and he could do that on ANY team!\n\nWith KAJ as his personal mentor, Andrew Bynum can do nothing but get BETTER! His continued improvement depends on Kobe's willingness to trust his teammates. In last night's win against the T-Wolves, I don't think Kobe took a shot in the fourth and only had seven attempts for the game. He's letting these guys fend for themselves and it'll be great for the team in the long run. Andrew is head and shoulders better than Mihm and Brown at this point so he will ultimately get the nod.\n\nKevin Martin is definitely looking more confident in his role. He should have a great season. \n\nCarlos Boozer is the kind of guy I'd love to have on my team. He does more with least kinda like a stronger Marion. At the end of the season, he'll be at 18 and 12 easily! He just needs to play some DEFENSE.\n\nLuke Walton is quietly earning some respect in the league. Dude looks more comfortable and confident in his game. I think all of his current numbers are career bests. He's a very smart ball player, don't sleep on him. I do think Brown's return will alter his numbers a bit though. \n\nCHARLIE V - BREAKOUT PLAYER OF THE YEAR!!!
I live in Australia and I never heard of 2 square - what is it?   You have this under 'Sports' so I assume it is a sport.   Sometimes we call things by different names so could you give additional information please.
Honestly, I don't know if I can muster up hope for the rest of the season. I am an incredibly upset Giants fan right now. This reminds me of last year. All of those injuries, my god. I don't get it. We started off so good. Our defense was dominating that game. Then that injury with Petitgout, I just felt my entire being cringe. \n\nThe game is over. Chicago outplayed us. Our team is completely off right now. Tiki's hand is hurting. I just...I'm completely lost for words. More out of disappointment than anything. \n\nI believe next week we're playing the Jags. I hope that this loss really wakes the Giants up, and I also hope that we can come back from this a little stronger. \n\nI'm hoping that they can pull out more wins and not let this get to them too much. It was just a bad game. Everyone is allowed a bad game. \n\n*crosses fingers* Here's hoping that we can do it. We're still one of the top teams in the NFC. We can still do this.
Its over Morales gets dropped twice in the third round TKO Pacman (Morales was dropped in the second as well)
Well, first off Rodeo 5's are actually easier than Rodeo 3's. It may sound weird but if you throw into it right you'll come out of your cork better backwards than forwards. \n\nTo practice, start off with frontside 180's. Make sure you have these down so well you can land them in your sleep. The next obvious step is to move up to frontside 3's and then start trying 5's. When you are comfortable with fs 5's you can start thinkin' about getting corked.\n\nRodeo's, like Misty Flips and other off axis spins are all about your shoulders. As you approach the lip of your jump you want to go from base flat and load up your toeside edge. You will be popping off your toes. As you begin your spin you need to drop your leading shoulder back and down while bringing your back foot up. I find that it helps to point back at the lip with your leading hand and grab Indy (obviously with your trailing hand and I'm sure you know to never, ever grab tindy). Don't reach down for the grab so much as bring your board up to your hand (I will actually reach pretty much straight out for my board), this will help with the off axis rotation. At this point you'll be completely blind for a landing if you were going for a three, hang on to your board for the last bit of rotation and don't let go until you spot the landing. As you come out 5 it'll be right in front of you. At this point remember back to the frontside 180's that you can now land in your sleep because that is all that is left to do. \n\nWhen watching what the pro's are doing in the videos pay close attention to their shouldes, hands and feet. That is where it all comes from. I would suggest practicing this on a kicker into powder and not in the park as it isn't a very natural feeling spin and you will more than likely come up short the first couple of times.\n\nGood luck and it's nothing like a backflip, it's much harder but way more styley
In football, you are allowed to kick when ever you want to.  If you do it will be considered a punt and the other team will gain possesion unless they touch it and you recover it.  You can even punt the ball on a punt return if for some reason you don't want it.

Here are the reasons for the one-way traffic:\n\nPoor bowling in last few overs. Though they kept it tight but, after having them at 209/7, it was too much in the last few overs. What really surprised me is that they let Andre Nel score few quick runs, well it´s not few for someone like him.\n\nPoor team selection. Sehwag was fit to play the last game and was even included in the playing XI (11). So, what went wrong so suddenly with him that he couldn´t take any part in the match? He was injured, accepted. But, why did they include Wasim Jaffer? Replacing the most attacking batsman with most defensive one, why? Why left out Irfan Pathan? Apart from Dravid, he was the only man who played exeptionally well in the practice. Scored 34 runs and took 1 wicket for 38 runs in 9 overs. So, that´s not bad at all. And more so, they left him out for such a pacy and bouncy track. He would´ve been really helpful on that kind of track, and morever, he even gives India a extra option of batting.\n\nThe setting of the batting order was worst I have ever seen since I born. Imagen that if the target was like 270+, what would they have done then? Openers: Sachin Tendulkar, a batsman who plays at normal pace, neither so attacking and nor so defensive. Wasim Jaffer, making the record of playing the most defensive opener in modern era of Cricket after Simon Katich. He would have been helpful in the middle-order. I think India could´ve replaced Sehwag with someone like Dhoni. Attacking replaces attacking. But, untill Chappell dies, Dhoni would never come up the order. He is a very fickle minded man. Dhoni now would bat up the order only in the 20/20 game, and then he would again visit South Africa for 20/20 Championship to bat up the order. So, after Jaffer it was turn for Kaif to come out in the middle to spend few 100 balls. And he did the same, scored 8 off 19 balls in 39 runs stand with Sachin. And then Dravid. He had to come out in anyway because the start was there. So what he needed to do was to stay there.\n\nBad captaincy. What was the need to bowl full qouta of 10 overs with Harbhajan Singh? He got thrashed around the park by de Villiers in his 1st 5 overs. Whereas Tendulkar and Mongia bowled superbly to restrict them in middle-overs. Why didn´t he allow Tendulkar to bowl full 10 overs? Why didn´t he bowl few more overs with Mongia to take the pace off the run-rate? Why didn´t they include Kumble in place of Harbhajan Singh. Kumble has more flight in his bowling which helps on his kind of tracks. I think Dravid has to make such decision rather than letting Chappell do everything.\n\nFor the moment: The alarm bells are ringing for chances of India winning the World Cup, yesterday rang the 1st one.\nIt will need some great performance by India to even draw or win the series, which is looking very bleak. And if they can do this, it will really be a confidence booster for them.\n\nRawal.
Falcons, if you can master Vick, which is tough considering you have to be able to scramble when needed, and pass when you have to. Scrambling too much kills you, and not enough also kills you. Seahawks is the most complete team, and you can usually get solid yardage every down with S. Alexander. M.Hasselback is a great QB as well, and Seattle also has a decent defense.\n\nFalcons, but if not good for you use Seahawks.

"The origin of billiards will probably never be exactly pinpointed. While it may have sprung from earlier games played with balls on a table in China, Italy, or Spain, the best guess is that it originated in France as an indoor version of a lawn game similar to croquet. (On the other hand, some historians have suggested that croquet originated as an outdoor version of billiards.)\nThe name almost certainly comes from the French billart, the stick that was used, and that word probably comes from bille, meaning ""ball."" When first recorded, in the 15th century, the object of the game was to push a ball through a croquet-like wicket to hit a peg, similar to the stake in croquet. Players used a club-like stick, which became known as the ""mace"" in England.\nWhen the ball was up against a rail, however, the head of the mace was too unwieldy and the other, narrower end of the stick was used. This was called the ""queue,"" meaning tail--hence the modern word, cue.\nShakespeare refers to billiards in Antony and Cleopatra--which led one early sports historian to conclude that it was an old Egyptian sport--and by 1675 it was very popular in England. The first known rule book was published that year, and its writer claimed that there were ""few Towns of note therein which hath not a publick Billiard-Table.""\nThe first steps toward making billiards a ""scientific"" sport were taken by a Frenchman, known only as Captain Mingaud, who was a political prisoner in Paris during the French Revolution. While in prison, he enjoyed playing billiards so much that he refused to be released when his time was up.\nMingaud discovered that, if he rounded the cue tip with a file, he could aim more accurately. He also added a leather tip to further improve control of the ball. After finally leaving prison, Mingaud traveled around France giving exhibitions and stirring a great deal of interest in the sport.\nThe leather tip lost its effectiveness when it became shiny with use and had to be replaced frequently. An English billiards teacher, Jack Carr, learned that putting chalk on the tip prevented miscues. He was also evidently the first player to hit the ball off-center to apply spin.\nCarr was a genuine hustler. He traveled around Europe during the 1820s, giving his demonstrations and selling his magical ""twisting chalk"" at an exorbitant price, throwing in a free lesson on how to make it work. As a result, the term ""English"" entered the lexicon of billiards--although, ironically, it's called ""side"" in England.\nBy that time, there were several different versions of billiards. In France, the most popular game was carom billiards, played with three balls (occasionally four balls) on a pocketless table. As in modern billiards, the object was to hit both of the object balls with the cue ball--called a carom or a billiard.\nThe most common game in England was also played with three balls, but on a table with six pockets. There were two ways of scoring: By pocketing a ball (other than the cue ball) or by hitting both of the other balls with the cue ball. This game is the ancestor of modern pocket billiards and English snooker..☺"

The Bears are definately one of the best teams in the NFL, but any team can have a bad game.  If I were a Bear fan, I would be worried about Rex Grossman.  He takes too many chances.  Though some pay off, he may cost the Bears a chance at a ring, if he continues this play into the playoffs.  Remember, this is Rex's first year at QB.

"Zinedine Zidane, Soccer Player \n\nBorn: 23 June 1972 \nBirthplace: Marseille, France \nBest Known As: The MVP of World Cup 1998 \nA flashy midfielder, Zinedine Zidane won the Golden Ball as the most valuable player in the World Cups of 1998 and 2006. Zidane played his first professional First Division game for Cannes in 1991 and quickly rose through the professional ranks. He sealed his reputation by scoring two goals in the World Cup finals of 1998, helping France defeat Brazil to claim its first-ever World Cup championship. Zidane played for professional powerhouse Juventus from 1996 until 2001, when he was acquired by Real Madrid for 46 million pounds, a record fee. (By 2003 his teammates on Real Madrid included superstars David Beckham, Luis Figo and Ronaldo, among others.) Zidane was named FIFA player of the year in 1998, 2000, and 2003. He retired from professional soccer after leading France to the finals of the 2006 World Cup.\n\nZidane's nickname is ""Zizou""... In his final game, the 2006 World Cup final against Italy, Zidane was red-carded out of the game for a bizarre headbutt to the chest of Italy's Marco Materazzi. Italy won the game and the World Cup on penalty kicks after a 1-1 draw. However, Zidane was still named the tournament's most outstanding player. He claimed he hit Materazzi in retaliation for insults made about Zidane's mother and sister; in September 2006 Materazzi said he had grabbed Zidane's shirt during play, causing Zidane to remark that he would give him the shirt if he liked it so much, in turn prompting Materazzi to respond, ""I'd rather have your sister."" Materazzi further claimed he didn't know Zidane had a sister until after the incident."

Jujitsu is a good art, however it takes a LOT of practice to become fluent in it. There are all kinds of stories out there of people who have used jujitsu effectively in real situations, but in order to overcome the fear involved in a real situation you will need to have practiced the technique hundreds of times, such that it comes subconsciously.

"There are plenty of good D-linemen in high school that are around 200 lbs. The question you need to ask yourself is how quick are you compared to the other linebackers as that will be important. The next is do you play better up or down (3 or 4pt stance or standing up). Being 6'3"" if you dont play very well getting your pads down then RB can take advantage of you tackling too high. If that is the case then getting down in a stance (i.e. playing on the line) would be a much better option. And of course the biggest question is how does your coach perceive you, better at LB or DE. He will decide your best position and if you dont want to play that position you need to be prepared and have put in the work at the postion skills you want to play so the coach will at least give you a look there. And remember...do what is best for the team, winning is more important than personal glory.\n  Good Luck!"

What corruption in boxing!? Say it ain't so.
Sort of. European culture is quite a bit different than Asian culture, so they aren't even remotely similar, BUT...\n\nEuropan fencing, boxing, and wrestling are all forms of Martial Arts. Martial = fighting and Art = something stylized and learned.\n\nAnd in Scottland, the Scottish Highland Dancing was originally developed for the Scottish wariors to improve balance and coordination.\n\nAnd I've seen a few books from Europe on sword fighting written for the slightly richer than average citezen. It was pretty stylized, and they remind me a lot of the books I've read on Kung Fu in modern days.
glad that you realised that you are going to a crappy school.. (some people never do) now that you know what a crappy school looks like and how they are structured, i would just go to various martial arts club in your area ask.. to sit in and watch a lesson or even ask to attend 1 lesson for free... since you have experienced a crap school you'll be pretty aware of what to look out for now and what questions to ask.. ask them about thier grading processes and if they require you to pay any extra fee's for this, does all the equipment get supplied or do you have to purchase your own (big money making scheme for most schools..they should provide you the basic equipment and when you do have to buy something you should have the freedom to get this equipment from anywhere.. not just purchase it from the school only).. ahh whether you have to lock into a 12 month contract (don't) alot can happen in 12 months.. a good school will let you buy a 10 or 20 class pass or let you pay casually or give you the option to sign up in 3 or 6 month blocks.. and a big giveaway look at the type of students which attend the classes.. how competent do they look for their level.. are people that have higher belt ranks overweight.. (they shouldn't be at that level they should be a certain fitness to get to the level they are at, if they are overwieght the belts are obviously getting handed out).. how old are the instrutors?? are they all 18 - 23yrs old another warning there.. they should be  ideally very late 20's or above.. that way you know that your instructor has the adequite knowledge to teach the art.. just some small factors to be mindfull of that will hopefully help when finding a new dojo to train at.. Hopefully you will find a style you enjoy soon.. as for real life effectiveness.. I would look into styles like Brizilian Ju Jitsu, Muay Thai, Krav Maga or the likes..

well i could make several comments to this question but i am tempted to say don't even try to as they will possible be black market especially in England.\nHave you tryed bayern leverkusen web site,try a google search for that one. But my best answer is save the money and stay at home. it will be warmer and you will be able to sit on your favourite chair and shout at the TV without any type of after match problems like fights and being arrested.

Joueurs les plus titrés : Jean-Michel Larqué et Hervé Revelli de Saint-Étienne, 7 fois champions (1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1974, 1975, 1976)
Let's try to answer this by looking at the respective schedules of the two teams in question. I agree Florida deserves to be among the best teams in US college football, but you're right. USC has already beaten five teams that were ranked in the top 25 at some point during the season, (Arkansas wasn't currently ranked when\nUSC played them). Florida has beaten three teams that were ranked during the season, lost to one, and is scheduled to play another. They beat FSU, which is having an offseason by their standards by 7 points. USC clobbered Arkansas in contrast. I don't know what will happen in the SEC championship game.\nLSU beat Arkansas, and Florida beat LSU during the season.\nI think Florida has to be considered the favorite for that reason alone. legalissues needs to be reminded, the SEC went 3-3\nlast season during the bowl season, which is hardly domination.\nhttp://www.collegefootballpoll.com/2005_archive_bowls.html \nThe Pac-10 went 2-2 last season during the bowl season, so that \nproves both conferences hold their own, but are hardly dominant,\nbut merely average.
I dont know, but i certainly hate him, and his offbeat, satirical jibes at other folk. I'd like to bite his fcuking nose off his face!!!
The Ohio State University/University of Michigan rivalry in football began with their first game in 1897.  UM won that game 34 to 0 and dominated the series until 1919.  That year the tables were turned and the Buckeyes won 13 to 3.  \n\nThe Ohio State/Michigan game has always been important, but it was not always the last game of the season.  This practice began in 1935 and, except for one year, the tradition has continued.  Often the game has determined who is the winner of the Big Ten and who will represent the conference in the Rose Bowl.  An ESPN poll rated the rivalry as the greatest of all time.  \n\n“Ohio State/Michigan Week” has grown beyond the football game to include the annual blood battle, which benefits the Red Cross, food collection for food banks, and spirit events such as banner contests.  OSU and UM have turned the rivalry into an event that helps people across school lines.\nGreat website ive been there alot Michiagan has dominated that rivalry.  But im Not so sure they will keep it up this year.

"Definitely Mickie James! But if the WWE decide they want somebody new to be Women's Champion they should go with Melina because she is the most capable of holding that Title besides Mickie James. I also heard that Nattie Neidhart, Jim ""The Anvil"" Neidhart's daughter, will soon be joining the Women's Division and she is more than capable than holding that Title. Plus, the WWE might try to give the Title to Torrie or Maria, who have been improving in wrestling, to hold the Title so there will be more competition in the division. I hope that answers your question."

I agree with you. The previous regime was a disaster. The Riders\nwere probably doing this good because of Barrett, who is a player's coach.  The Riders had success because the players generally\nliked Barrett. He should end up on a coaching staff somewhere, because he did a good job.  I think the Riders will regress under the new coach likely, and miss the playoffs, while the Eskimos will recover from a bad season, and make it in their place. BC and Calgary look to be pretty solid teams, while the East is pretty solid with Montreal, Toronto and Winnipeg (really a West team that is playing there to even things out).

No. Romo had one good game and Bush is not very good. You could try to pick up Jay Cutler or Steven McNair who are decent QB's.
Go take a block (5 or 6) of lessons from a local PGA pro.  You can usually find one that will do group lessons.  You will learn the basics of grip, setup, and swing.

They are meant to entertain the vast amounts of Chivas and Barcelona fans.\n\nChivas vs Amierdica: \nThey tied 1 to 1. The highest scorer player of Chivas, Omar Bravo, sent a very good pass to Sergio Santana, who ended up scoring the one goal from Chivas.\n\nChivas vs Barcelona:\nEven though they also tied this game 1 to 1, the game  was 'off the hook'!!! I was there at LA, watching the best match of 2006. There was so many people, 93,000 to be exact. Barcelona couldn't perform their professional soccer talents with el Rebano Sagrado."

"LONDON --Steve McClaren wasted no time distancing himself from Sven-Goran Eriksson.""I'm going to do it my way,"" McClaren said Tuesday when he officially became England's 11th national soccer coach.\n\nHe assumed control exactly a month after England was eliminated in the World Cup quarterfinals by Portugal, ending Eriksson's 5 1/2-year stay. McClaren's term also began almost 40 years to the day that England won its only World Cup.\n\n""It will be totally different from Sven and his five years,"" said McClaren, the former Middlesbrough manager who was groomed as Eriksson's assistant. ""I'm looking forward to the big challenge.""\n\nThe 45-year-old coach signed a four-year deal in May after Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari turned down the job.\n\n""It's a new chapter in the life of the England national team,"" said Brian Barwick, the Football Association's chief executive.\n\nMcClaren was hit with an early setback in one of soccer's most taxing jobs when former England captain Alan Shearer last week rejected an offer to work with the team, choosing to concentrate on his TV job.\n\nMcClaren still hopes to land former England coach Terry Venables, who left after leading the team to the semifinals of the 1996 European Championship.\n\n""I will look to make a few changes and freshen a few things up,"" McClaren said. ""The aim is to try to bring the whole nation closer together, to bring the England team closer to the clubs and the fans.""\n\nMcClaren was asked when he would appoint a captain to replace David Beckham, who stepped down after the World Cup. Chelsea's John Terry and Liverpool's Steven Gerrard are the leading contenders.\n\n""Individuals and smaller details we'll get to later on,"" McClaren said.\n\nMcClaren's first game is an Aug. 16 exhibition against Greece at Old Trafford. England hosts Andorra on Sept. 2 and travels to Macedonia four days later in the first qualifiers for the 2008 European Championship.\n\n""It won't be difficult for Steve to impose himself,"" Terry told The Times of London from Chelsea's preseason tour in the United States. ""Every manager is different and Steve will be really different.\n\n""Sven was a little bit quiet and Steve will be in your face a bit more, which some of us like to see. We like to see that passion which he has in him and hopefully that will rub off on us.""\n\nMcClaren was a midfielder at Hull City, Derby County, Bristol City and Oxford, where he turned to coaching youth and reserve teams. He became Alex Ferguson's assistant at Manchester United during the very successful years of 1999-01.\n\n""One thing that makes him a good coach is he's lucky,"" said Jim Smith, who recruited McClaren to coach Derby. ""But he's a very talented coach and very good at man management. He knows what the best footballers are all about and gains their respect."""
Maybe he is satisfied, a lot coaches work those 12-18 hour days so that they can get the right.  Cowher has his ring, perhaps Bettis is right, come the end of this year, Cowher will move to the Carolinas and retire.  You need to possess a buring desire to work the hours and put up with the pressures of being an NFL coach.

Jeff Kent was a free agent that year, and the news was the cubs were going to sign him (because he was Dusty's boy), he ended up with Houston...I think the A-rod hype is the same. He's not coming to the Cubs just cause he played for Lou Pinella.

well next time hopefully kiwi bashes the qb to the ground..and and injury occurs..cause the nfl is protecting the qbs too much..if you want to protect them, fine, but the ref shouldve blown the whistle to call the play dead since kiwi had him held tight for at least 3 seconds
I think it's going to be Ohio St. and USC if the Trojans win out.  They would have quality wins over Arkansas, Nebraska, Oregon, California, and Notre Dame.  The difference between Michigan and USC in the BCS as of 11-18 is very small, so with a win over Notre Dame, they should leapfrog Michigan.  But, if USC does not win out, it would be either Florida or Michigan.  Florida would have to win big against their rival Florida St. and then win the SEC title against a good Arkansas team.

It's really impossible to recommend a bowling ball without seeing you bowl (for instance, what's your typical ball speed?).  The best answer is to visit your local pro shop, tell them that you throw a back up ball, and that you're not interested in being trained out of it, but you'd like a new ball.  Depending on where you bowl, and how the lanes are oiled, there might be something that the pro shop guy can recommend over the others.\n\nAs for a simple recommendation, any entry level resin ball (The Tornado series from Ebonite; Storm, Brunswick, Columbia  each make their own) will give you a simple hook--not a monster hook.

None, the rotating schedule was put in place FOUR YEARS AGO. We are repeating the AFC vs NFC meaning they already played each other 4 years ago. The Confrence divisions play each other every 3 years and started repeating LAsT YEAR. So ALL teams have played all the other teams. I think you mean which two teams have never played at the one's home, but that almost ruins the question because almost have to give the city. In that case if it was on Sunday I'd guess St Loius and Kansas City.
If you feel a 'sharp' pain in the elbow area, then you might have a problem....If it's just a dull pain try a new exercise. If you are right handed, lay down on your left side. Place right arm, from shoulder to elbow, down your side. Bend your right elbow at 90 degrees (straight out in front of your body). With palm down, pull up a dumbell (any weight that you can do reps with) til it is straight up, then slowly lower the weight and repeat. Pitchers started using this exercise in the late 1990's. It works part of the elbow and shoulder muscles that other exercises don't get to......Again, if there is a sharp pain, go to a sports therapist.

Let's see... for QB I say start Drew, just because he has three or four guys that he's throwing it to, and he's just a teeny bit more on fire than Palmer...\n\nK - Go with Vinatieri, always go with Adam...

The premise is that the people who are being targeted for the product will buy the product because the person endorsing the product is the standard itself.\nIn other words if Brett Favre tells you that this type of football shoe style will help you play better.

While the Steelers are playing below their potential, and a lot of that can be blamed on the coach, you absolutely can't fire Cowher.  Think of what he's done long term, playoff appearances, division titiles, Super Bowls.  The man clearly knows how to run a football team (even if that hasn't been clear this year) and is entitiled to continue coaching because of what he has done and can contiue to bring to the franchise.  He's better than anyone that would replace him anyways.  Why would anyone, especially someone as classy and loyal as Rooney, fire someone so accomplished just because of one unfortunate year?  If you want to blame someone, blame the offense and special teams for turning the ball over so much.  That's the real reason we're 2-5 and not 4-3 or 5-2.\n\n\nBesides, he's going to retire in a year or two anyway.
Are you kidding?\n\nA whole lot of teams would have gone undefeated with their schedule.
Josh Shockman vs. Jake O'Brien (Pictures)\nRound 1\nThe first frame is all O'Brien. Jake scored three takedowns in the round and scored with some ground and pound. Sherdog.com scores it 10-9 for O'Brien. \n\nRound 2\nMore of the same in the second round. O'Brien scored with several takedowns, followed more standups from referee Steve Mazzagatti. The crowd grew restless and showered the arena with boos as the pace remained slow. Sherdog.com scores the uneventful round 10-9 for O'Brien. \n\nRound 3\nDifferent round, same story. More takedowns from O'Brien followed by ref standups due to lack of action. Sherdog.com and the three judges' score the fight 3-27 for Jake O'Brien. \n\nJames Irvin (Pictures) vs. Hector Ramirez (Pictures)\nRound 1\nRamirez charging forward with hard strikes early in the round. Irivn lands some crisp kicks to Ramirez's leg. Ramirez scores a single leg and quickly takes Irvin's back. Irvin escapes. Irvin launches a wild spinning back fist that misses. Both fighters trade punches. Ramirez scores another takedown just as the horn sounds to end the opening stanza. Sherdog.com scores it 10-9 for Ramirez. \n\nRound 2\nIrvin continues to score with the low kicks. Irivn lands a superman punch. Ramirez throws a sloppy looping punch that is countered by an Irvin straight right directly on the button. Irvin finished with a kick to the body and some some elbows to the back of his downed opponent's head. Irvin wins by TKO (Strikes) 2:36 R2. \n\nSherman Pendergarst vs. Antoni Hardonk\nRound 1\nPendergarst scores a quick takedown. Sherman working hard with lots of punches from Hardonk's guard. The referee restarts the action to standing. Pendergarst is totally gassed out from the ground and pound he executed early in the round. Hardonk scores with a few kicks to the leg. Hardonk lands a straight left then a hard lowkick that end the fight. Hardonk wins via KO at 3:15 of the first. \n\nNick Diaz (Pictures) vs. Gleison Tibau\nRound 1\nTibau stuffed an early Diaz shot and muscled the fight to the canvas. Tibau working his ground and pound from Diaz's guard. Diaz turtled and Tibau tried to take his back, but Diaz reversed the postion. Tibau then worked for an ompalata and a tight Kimura. with 1:20 left in the frame, Diaz swept and landed some nice ground and pound of his own.

En conquete, ils se sont faits étouffer par les blacks: des incompréhensions en touche, quant à la mêlée la première ligne des bleus a vraiment été à la peine (la j'ai pas d'explication, je suis vraiment pas un spécialiste du poste !)\n\nSinon, bien organisés et disciplinés en défense, un bon point. Pareil pour la conservation de balle, vraiment un beau boulot de la part du pack.\n\nPar contre en attaque, aïaïaïe ! totalement impuissants !\nA mon avis, ils sont trop justes physiquement. Du coup, impossible d'avancer à l'impact, de mettre la ligne de défense black sur le reculoir. A partir de là, on prend la marée à chaque lancement de jeu.\nGros pbe aussi au niveau de la charnière: les sorties de balle après les rucks sont trop lentes, les passes de yachvili approximatives, du coup la ligne de trois quarts attaque arrêtée. Et puis à mon sens Traille n'a rien à faire à l'ouverture, il envoie ses centres au casse pipe la moitié du temps. C'est un excellent joueur, mais il est pas à sa place !\n\nLa question pour moi c'est: vaut il mieux mettre en 10 un très  bon joueur dont ce n'est pas le poste en club, ou un type un peu moins doué mais qui sait jouer à cette position ? Je pense qu'il y a quand meme des ouvreurs tres performants en France autre que michalak ou dubois, ce n'est pas la peine de faire jouer un centre à ce poste.

It was a tough call, and it just went against Oswalt.  He had the best ERA, but he pitched fewer innings than Webb, had one fewer win, and had a slightly higher WHIP.  Oswalt may also have been overshadowed by his teammate Roger Clemens, who had better numbers albeit over fewer innings.\n\nYou could definitely make the argument for Oswalt, just as you could for Webb or Carpenter.  This was a tough voting year.\n\nEDIT - You're right about Adam Everett - He's by far the best defensive shortstop in baseball by any measure, but he never gets the credit.  Derek Jeter is not half as good, but he gets all the love for his defense.

I think Johnson is an automatic start, regardless of the Texans' opponent or who's playing QB for them.  He's the top receiver on a team that often falls behind and is forced to throw, and he's been very consistent this year.\n\nI agree with the first post in choosing Parker to start over Chambers.  Chambers has a chance to possibly put up a score when Miami inevitably falls behind and as forced to throw, but Paker should have the steadier day.
I don't know about New York, but the have UFC fighting and some boxing matches at our Hooters.  I would call local bars and ask, if they say no ask them if they know of any places that do.
"If you have good footwork, there is absolutely no need to play the sweep. \n\nLook closely, people who know exactly how to use their wrists to play the on drive, never use the sweep shot.\n\nMohd. Azharuddin rarely played the sweep. He had the ""paddle sweep"", which was directed behind the wicketkeeper. Never seen him play the orthodox sweep.\n\nSunny Gavaskar, the best player of the on-drive in the history of the game hardly played the sweep. Simply because, the sweep shot is for lesser mortals, who simply don't know to play down the leg side. And that includes Sachin Tendulkar. he does sweep, simply because his on-side play is simply isn't as good as the original little master.\n\nBut you are not Gavaskar or Azhar. So here's one link that should help you a lot:\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/1703662.stm\n\nRemember the key: there are straight-bat, on-side strokes that can be substituted for the sweep, with equivalent placement, power and a thousand-time-less risk. \n\nNext time you see a sweep, just let yourself know that the person playing it - even if it Lara himself, has a limited amount of ability on the leg side."

I can't objectively answer that, since I didn't see Leonard-Hearns\n2, but I did see Briggs-Foreman, and that was a miscarriage of\njustice. Lennox Lewis was probably robbed in his first bout with\nEvander Holyfield, or I think it was his first bout, the one which\nwas declared a draw, but by most standards Lewis won. I need\nto see the Leonard/Hearns 2 fight for me to comment.
Waivers are the place where players go after someone drops them.  Depending upon how long the waiver time is set, they remain on waivers for at least that long.  If more than one person claims them while they are on waivers (before they become a free agent), then whoever has the best waiver priority number gets the player.

Yes I do. I feel very sorry for Marcus’s predicament, but in the same breath know that he will leave a huge hole in the England side. His partnership with Andrew Strauss has been crucial to England’s success over the years, as has his leadership around the team. I personally hope he is back on his feet soon because I know how much he loves the game of cricket, which is worse off without him on the ground.
Pete coached for several NFL teams. He was Defensive Backs coach for Buffalo in 1984 then for Minnesota for 5 years. Defensive coordinator for the New York Jets for 4 years. He was then head coach there for one bad year. He was also D. coordinator for the 49ers then Patriots where he ended up head coach again.
who should i play at the following postitions:\n\nrb - larry johnson or ladanian tomlinson (yes, i have both)\n\nwr - reggie wayne or tj houshmanzadeh along with chad johnson ( i can start 2 wr, im starting 85, but who should i go to for the 2nd)\n\nqb - jake dellhomme or jake plummer
This is a significant win. I remember watching Fres Oquendo box Chris Byrd, the judges gave the win to Byrd but it was clear to me that Oquendo was the victor so I think he is a better fighter than people give him credit for. I wish Hollyfield the best. I'd like to see him retire before he gets permanent damage but anytime he is in the ring I'm rooting for him!!! He is still the Real Deal.

"Mark McGwire in the ""Hall""? No, he won't get there and thats a shame. People have cheated in sports since the begining of time. Yet, there is no proof at all that he ever took steroids. Did he get bigger? Oh yeah. Has Clemens gotten bigger? Yes. Homeruns are all he hit but he, along with Sosa revitalized the national pasttime unlike any players in the last 30 years. His drug use is nothing more than speculation and a witch hunt by a bunch of guys who don't want to see there heroes fall from atop some HALLOWED list of numbers. Why is it that a man who hit more homeruns in a season than other teams did in a year is a hero and legend? Wonder what Ruth was on???"

Point Guard-Okay this player is the most important to the team. Not necessarily the best but he is the most important.\nfirst this person should have good ball handling skills and must be able to see the court better than anyone on the team. Vision is very important.He also needs to be a good passer because he is going to be the man guy who distributes the ball.\n\nShooting Guard-Now a lot of times this is the best player on the team.(if you look to the history of the NBA and presnt, like Jordan,Kobe, Wade, Lebron). This person should have a good shot and should be able to drive to the basket.\n\nSmall Foward-Well he is the guy inthe middle. He should be able to driblle (at least descent), rebound, drive and sometimes post up.\n\nPower Foward- This guy rebounds and is also accounted to score points down low and blocks shots. They also should be able to set a pick since they usually set the most picks/screens.\n\nCenter-This guy rebounds,blocks, scores down low.
Remember, Gerrard is a backup, and Jacksonville isn't built to have an explosive passing attack. Start Grossman for sure, he's been among the most consistent QB's fantasy-wise this season (excluding the arizona debacle of course)

Pitching is the big problem. There are two major holes in the rotation. Moose was resigned so that covers one spot. Wang might go on to win the Cy Young this year so that's two.  Randy Johnson is an iffy third. Fourth and fifth are wide open. The Yanks did do the right thing and pick up a bunch of prospects. Now will they be patience a year or two while these guys develop? Few pitchers worth keeping are even good much less top notch the first 1-3 seasons in the rotation.  Pedro Martinez, Randy Johnson,  Greg Maddux,  Curt Schilling and the list goes on. Look at the first couple years these guys pitched and you'll see lots of struggles going on. \n\nAs for Pettite, that would be a great pick up. Pettite has been the best stopper the Yanks have had year after year. A crucial part of the pennent drives. When the Yanks were in a losing streak it was always Pettite that broke it up. Also the only clutch pitcher the Yanks have had since Cone retired.  When the Yanks really needed it you could count on a good performance from Pettite. Might not be a shutout but Pettite was not going to get shelled. Not in an important game. He's come up with more than a few gems when it was most needed. \n\nWith Sheffield gone the Yanks need to move Giambi. That clears out the other steroid user and a huge contract.  Picking up Shelton from the Tigers might be a good idea. The Tigers obviously don't plan on playing Shelton. He carried the Tigers early in the year. Big problem with the Yanks are the team is too old. Teams as old as the Yankees are certain to suffer injury problems. They are rarely hungry. These guys all have their WS rings and some of them are just trying to finish off really good careers. Though Giambi doesn't have a WS ring for a reason. He's played on also rans his whole career and was supposed to be the spark plug to replace O'Niel.  He didn't either spark or produce his first couple years. After that he didn't have the credibility to be a clubhouse leader. The Yanks need a little fire, some motivation. Hungry players. 1b is a great place to pick up a young motivated player. So is at least the 5th spot in the rotation.  Abreu fits in nicely but he's a short term fix. His stats were declining in Philly. So he'll probably come up with one more good year then start to decline again. Possada as a catcher is getting way to old to count on. He's in injury territory in a very big way. The Yanks need him to start training his successor much the same way Gerlaldi taught Possada. Unlike Geraldi Possada if he transisitions before major injury can be an effective DH and 1b backup. The guy would hit 30+ HRs every year if he was not a catcher. He'd also probably add .010 to his BA. \n\nA-Rod in his worst season is the best 3b in baseball.  Last year he had MVP like numbers. This year only excellent numbers and people are upset?  Besides the fact only a few teams could afford that mega-mistake salary the Rangers made with A-Rod, would you really want to anger him? Trade him to a potential rival and motivate him to prove the Yankees were wrong?  It would come back and haunt the team. \n\nSo a starter or more starting prospects, a young 1b and a couple good catching prospects are what the Yankees need.  There is no quick fix lets get in the series this year kind of changes the Yanks can make. Picking up vets just means a replay of 06 and it's injuries. Bernie can cover DH if the new guys flop. Melky might be the answer or might be somebody else. Whatever the case he should get a serious audition. This is a good year for the Yanks to sort out prospects and aim for 08,09 and 2010 World series.  The Yanks can do a minor retooling this year and next or face a total rebuild in a couple years. Either way no WS.  \n\nBernie, Rivera, Abreu, Randy Johnson, Possada if he continues to catch, Moose are the big names who probably only have a couple good years left in them. Bernie is already probably playi

He is currently training with Minnesota Martial Arts Academy under Greg Nelson coach to UFC Lightweight champion Sean Sherk and with University of Minnesota Head Assistant wrestling coach Marty Morgan. Brock Lesnar announced on 12 August 2006 in Las Vegas that he has joined the K-1 promotion and will have his first Mixed martial arts match in February 2007. Royce Gracie then announced that he will serve as Lesnar's trainer.

If either one regains the belt it won't be from Silva or GSP. I knew GSP was gonna dominate Hughes like that he is a much better fighter people need to pull their heads out of their asses and get off the hype about Hughes he is not a great fighter. He hasn't had to fight anyone in the last 2 years that was. Until he fought BJ Penn who destroyed him in rounds 1 and 2. And Matt won by BJ being gassed and hurt. Even go back and watch the first GSP-Hughes fight GSP was beating Hughes until he left his arm open for hughes. \nFranklin I was suprised. I didnt' fall into the hype around Silva when he beat Chris Leaban. But I did think he would give Franklin a good fight.\nI was not expecting the puneshment he gave Franklin and that Franklin had nothing in return. It was like Silva said bend over I'm gonna knee you in the head a bunch of times and Franklin said ok...\nHughes doesn't desearve a rematch before Sera, Paresiyan and Sanchez get their shots. Although I think they should have to fight Hughes or BJ Penn and win first... Doubtful though.

Yes, and it knocked the breath out of me.  I was at a tournement.  I tried my best to suck it up and face my opponent.  That was hard since I couldn't breathe much at all.  I kept standing and had my guard up just in case the person would strike again.  \n\nLet's just say that getting the breath knocked out of you is not very fun, lol.\n\nFrom then on I always try to remeber to breathe out when I get punched in my gut.

Ha, I have both players as starters this week.  But since Joe Horn is out for the Saints, Henderson should pick up his throws, and Brees is always looking to throw.  Henderson had two touchdowns last week. \n\nI'd go with Henderson.  Henry is less consistent, he won't be starting, and he has a love/hate relationship with reality, so where his head is at in any given time is anyone's guess. \n\nGo with Henderson.

Ryan G makes a very good point when using a telescoping fishing rod. It's very easy to get your line wrapped around the rod unintentionally.\nOther than that you should check to see that your line is wound properly onto the spool and not tangled onto interior working parts. This happens often on spin-cast reels that are spooled with too much line.\nWhen reeling in your line keep a slight pressure on it by holding it between your fingers. It helps the line to spool evenly and helps detect light bites.\n\nBest of luck.
When USC beats UCLA, no chance. If USC does not win then Michigan would get in. I do not think Florida will have enough points to get to #2. Their strength of schedule is hindering them. The SEC Conference is down this year and their out of conference schedule is not very impressive. That is why they will be left out.

Anything is possible but I would not recommend jumping or jumping double while bareback.\nFirst of all it is not good very comfortable for you and there is nothing but balance holding you in place. Jumping double while bareback is not good for the horses spine because of the pressure from the second rider. \nI have rode bareback on a retired race horse and man could he fly what a ruch with the wind in your face. but let me tell you the quick turns and stops sure hurt the tail bone.
Nice.  Very.\n\nRelease Turiaf, pick up someone better... MIL Mo Williams, BOS Rajon Rondo (he's gonna beat Telfair for starting PG spot soon), DEN Nene Hilario (in case Camby goes down), TOR Jose Calderon... don't pick up flavor of the weeks if they're gonna keep coming off the bench, like Turiaf and Walton.  Maybe play Q over Thomas (Kurt or Kenny?  Kenny's not gonna be scoring much this season, and Kurt will not play significant minutes when Amare gets healthier).  I wish my own starting lineup was that strong though.

Just make sure his PIM's do not off-set his other statistics (Goals, Assists, +/-).  Those are all important as well in a Rotisserie League.  If you can get a defenseman that is balance in all these categories then you are set.  If a defenseman spends too much time getting PIM and not helping you in other categories, then he's not that valuable.

I agree with NoClone.  There really is no other way.  With runners on 1B and 2B, P covers third baseline, first basement covers first base line.  All fielders shift to the right.  SS to second, second to 1st.  3rd stays home.\nRunner on 1B only, P covers first base side, 3B charges from third base line.  SS covers 3rd, 2nd baseman covers second, 1B stays at first base.  \nBases Loaded, same as with runners on 1B and 2B.

But it takes a while to ollie, so you really need to keep practicing as much as possible [It took me around 2 months to finally ollie], and watch as many skate videos. If you follow those two things, you will be ollie-ing in no time. \n\ngood luck.

The entry into college coaching is interning with the team and then becoming a graduate assistant. This will give you valuable experience.

Yeah, the mountains in Bulgaria always have a lot of snow during the winter and there are really some good ski resorts. The best are Borovets, Bansko, Pamporovo and the slopes on Vitosha (that's the mountain near the capital city of Bulgaria - Sofia). The resorts in Bulgaria are not expensive, you can afford pretty much everything. They are a fantastic choice for NYE, because they organise lovely dinners. The nature in Bulgaria is pretty amazing, the people are also really friendly. \n\nHope I've been helpful and hope you have some great time at NYE ;)

Smackdown has lost alot of popular wrestlers to ECW. This wont effect them though. They still have the deadman and Batista.

I am from Indianapolis and I am a die-hard Colts! To answer your question YES he and the Colts WILL win the Super Bowl and it is going to happen this year! There is no Quarterback and no team more deserving to win the Super Bowl than Peyton Manning and the Colts! Peyton constantly works hard and never stops trying to improve himself at his position, and do you know what? He has this year! Have you noticed something different in the way he plays this year from years past? I have, he is starting to move in the pocket more than he ever has before, so do you know what that means? It means that trying to rush him all the time (like the Patriots, Chargers, and Steelers) won't work as well anymore because now he has proved he can be a mobile Quarterback and he is STILL extremely accurate even when he is running. NO player in the NFL is smarter than Peyton, he can read defenses BETTER than any Quarterback ever before! After Peyton and the Colts win the Super Bowl this year nobody will ever question him or the team ever again, and trust me, by the end of his career (which won't happen for a LONG time) he will be know as one of the top five best Quarterbacks of all time! Hell he very well could be the best Quarterback ever when he retires! GO COLTS!

The Winchester Model 1890 was manufactured from 1892 -1932 with 849,00 made. I'm assuming that this is a Takedown model with blue finish which is the most commonly found example. If it is one of the 2 earlier models, it would be worth considerably more. All are very collectible. \n\n98% condition $1000\n95%                  $900\n90%                  $800\n80%                  $700\n70%                  $600\n60%                  $500\n50%                  $400\n40%                  $350\n30%                  $300\n20%                  $275\n10%                  $235\n\nAs you can see condition is everything. Most of these guns saw lots of use, 95 - 98% guns are rare.\n\nAdded\nJohn K has kinda muddied the waters here a bit, so I'm going to clarify a few things. \nThe Model 1890 First Model Solid Frame had a case hardened receiver and was manufactured 1890 -1892. There were only 15,000 made and are quite rare and very valuable. \nValues are:\n98% condition $10,000\n90% $7000\n80% $6000\n70% $4500\n50% $3500\n30% $2500\n\nModel 1890 Second Model Takedown Frame had a color case hardened receiver The takedown feature was added in 1892 when the solid frame were discontinued. The serial # range on this model was 15,500 to 326,000. \nThe values are:\n98% $4250\n95% $3750\n90% $3000\n80% $2750\n70% $2250\n50% $1500\n30% $800\n\nI can not stress enough, condition is every thing.

"Think about it this way.  Even the best of teams don't win every year.  And not every player can play for the Lakers coaches.  I think Ceballos was a better Sun than a Laker.  Rice better w/ the Heat. McCloud?  Who the ""Bleap"" is that?  And if you ask 90% of hoops fans they'd say ""Sam Bowie, so what.""  \nThe players you listed are journeymen, players that get traded 3 at a time for an All-Star, (except Rice).  And in Rice and Rodman's cases it was nearing retirement time for them.  So no the Lakers are not ""player killers"".  Now Kobe can kill your reputation.  But that's another story."
"Hart fell to his death in Kansas City, Missouri on May 23, 1999, during the WWF Over the Edge PPV event. He was being lowered into the ring from the rafters of Kemper Arena for a scheduled WWF Intercontinental Championship win over The Godfather.\n\nIn keeping with the Blazer's new 'buffoonish superhero' character, Owen was to be lowered to just above ring level, at which time he would release himself from the safety harness and then comically fall flat on his face. He had performed the stunt only a few times before, and was worried about performing the stunt at Kemper Arena due to the height involved (Owen had a fear of heights).\n\nOwen performed a practice stunt earlier in the day, and the stunt went forward on the show as scheduled. His wife Martha suggests that, by moving around to get comfortable with both the harness and his cape on, Owen unintentionally triggered an early release and fell 78 feet (24 m) into the ring, smashing his chest on a padded, but still tough, ring turnbuckle.\n\nTV viewers at home did not see the incident or its aftermath, as the WWF was transmitting a promotional video package for the match, and only showed the audience while Owen was being worked on by medical personnel inside the ring while WWF television announcer Jim Ross repeatedly told those watching live on pay-per-view that what just transpired was not a wrestling angle or storyline and that Hart was hurt badly.\n\nOwen was transported to the Truman Medical Center in Kansas City, where he was pronounced dead on arrival (he actually died about six minutes after the fall, while still lying in the ring). The cause was later revealed to be internal bleeding from blunt chest trauma. He was 34 years old. The WWF chose to continue the event, which drew a great deal of criticism over the following weeks, especially as the main event of the evening involved The Undertaker (also known as the ""Deadman"") winning the WWF Title.\n\nThe next night on Monday Night Raw in St. Louis, Missouri, a two-hour televised tribute was broadcast (see RAW is Owen), in which WWF wrestlers and officials paid tribute to Hart. The Over the Edge event name was retired.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, much attention focused on the harness Owen used that night, especially on the ""quick release"" trigger and safety latches. When someone is lowered from the rafters in a harness, there are backup latches that must be latched for safety purposes. These backups may take some time to unlatch, which would have made Owen's stunt difficult to perform smoothly. Therefore, it was apparently decided that it was more important not to have the safety backups, because it would be easier for Owen to unlatch himself.\n\nIn addition to not having safety backups, the harness Owen used was designed for sailboats and required only six pounds of weight to trigger the quick release mechanism; Owen weighed about 225 pounds. An out-of-court settlement between Owen Hart's family and the WWF has prevented the release of any information about the harness. The WWF, however, decided to ban stunts of a similar nature from this point on to avoid a similar event from occurring.\n\nOwen left a widow, Martha, and two children, Oje Edward and Athena. Martha Hart settled her wrongful death lawsuit against the WWF for approximately $18 million[citation needed], and used the funds to establish the Owen Hart Foundation. Martha wrote a book about Owen's life in 2002 called Broken Harts.\n\nOwen's last match was on May 22, 1999, in Chicago, Illinois. He and Jarrett won a tag team match against Edge and Christian.\n\nOn the October 4, 1999 edition of WCW Nitro, Owen's brother Bret Hart wrestled Chris Benoit in an Owen Hart tribute match at Kemper Arena."
"Canseco, and  Ken Caminiti both admited using steroids. Canseco's book and Caminiti's admission was what broke open the steroids scandal in baseballe. \n\nBonds and Sosa may still face perjury charges over denial of steroid usage. Bonds later ADMITTED using steroids. He claimed he did not know the cream contained steroids. McGwire used steroids before they were banned in baseball and has admitted to their use. \n\nPalmiero was caught in a steroid test by MLB. \n\nGrimsley has confirmed Bond's steroid use as well as admitting he and many others used steroids.  So for those of you who still don't believe Bonds used steroids you have Bonds own admission, you have testimony from several players and you have the indictment of his trainer for giving the steroids to Bonds and other athletes like Giambi and Sheffield.  What more do you need.  A big blinking sign over his head saying ""I used steroids"".  \n\nBonds is also the perfect model for steroid use. He was always a pretty decent power hitter. Normally around 35 HRs a year. On a good year he got close to 40. One season he hit more than 40. Then at an age when most players retire and he was looking very washed up. All of his stats had been in decline, there was even talk about whether he'd retire. What happens next is Bonds suddenly has his best year of his career. Hits more HRs than he'd ever hit in a single season. The next year pretty much doubles his previous best season. He was 36 or 37 when he did this. \n\nSosa again shows the same kind of pattern. Sosa was not scheduled to start in his break out year. Also the year he's reputed to have started using steroids. Sosa had been dumped on the Cubs, his third team and the Cubs were out of patience with him as well. Sosa came very close to being released in the off season. Then all of a sudden he started hitting with power out of nowhere. Sosa credited his hitting instructor. Everybody laughed and figured he was a fluke. He was too old to be a real prospect by then. Instead Sosa went on to win HR crowns and his famous battle with fellow steroid user McGwire for the single season HR record. \n\nGary Sheffield and Jason Giambi were both implicated by testimony and with reasonable certainty can be called steroid users. I think Giambi has even since admitted using them. \n\nOther big names have had rumors circulated about them. Pettite and Clemens were two but both of those rumors were refuted. Pitchers gain little from steroid use and risk much. So few pitchers use them. Curt Schilling and Kenny Rogers are two other pitchers who's names have surfaced in rumors. There has been nothing to back these rumors however.  \n\nI personally suspect Schilling did try steroids. He matches the pattern for pitchers. Most pitchers caught using steroids have been pitchers on the edge. Guys who are in serious danger of no longer staying in Baseball. Schilling was blasted in his first couple years in the rotation and was shifted to the bullpen with less than spectacular results. Until he became a closer he was in real danger of being sent back to the minors. Then he got another shot at the rotation and a few years later learned how to pitch effectively.  Schilling had all the trademarks. Bullpen pitcher, bounced from team to team, in danger of being pushed out of baseball and getting up in the years to where he was no longer considered a real prospect. \n\nOther big names with credible evidence against them include Fred McGriff and Frank Thomas. \n\nLuis Gonzales is another name that's been rumored as a steroid user. Nothing hard in evidence has ever surfaced against him. He was a long time teamate of Caminitti and like Caminitti suddenly had break out offensive years in their early 30s. \n\nThe classical Steroid user changes are illustrated in Derek Lee's sudden fame. Gary Mathews is another. Both after being given up on by multiple teams, on the edge of being bounced out of Baseball suddenly have all "

Selon Frank Herbert (ou plus précisément un des personnages de la série Dune) la Religion s'oppose à la Sexualité car il ne peut y avoir de plaisir réel que dans l'Amour de Dieu.\nL'Amour charnel n'est donc qu'hérésie.\n\nSi cette théorie est un peu extrême, il me semble qu'effectivement l'amour de dieu demandé par la Religion est si total, et le plaisir rendu par cette foi si complet, que l'Homme ne devrait pas avoir besoin de l'amour, charnel mais aussi platonique.
WWE is just making money & making people fool. Vince have no interest in making WWE interesting. I think Vince is a puppet. He is not a real owner. The real owner of WWE is in underground. \nRey mysterio is the Crusierweight. I understand that WWE give the World Heavyweight championship to Rey Mysterio because of tribute to Eddie Guerreuo and for making Eddie's fans happy. Rey is the family member of Eddie. That's why WWE give him a WHW champoinship. \n\nThis is enough or not.

ok this is simple. ive taken apart a few shimano hubs and they have had either 9 or 11 ball bearings on each side.\n\neasy way to figure out how many: \n-have a tray of grease on hand\n-lay on some grease in the area were the bearings go\n-dip each ball into the grease and use tweezers to put them in place\n-only a certain amount will fit into the bearing race\n-put the axle back through when ur done and see if it rotates smoothly\n\ngood luck

no that was a rumour which was denied by el arabeya channel after 3 days from the rumoir this is the latest news they denied this on 17 october and also didnot u watch the chat with kaka on acmilan.com 26 october??? (see question 2 and 30)they asked him about his rituals before matches he said i read the bible and they asked him about his motto he said i is i belong to jesus and about his fave music he said it is gospel that was a week ago also he denied this rumour in italian soursec and said that he will always be an evangelist christian iam really surprised that this rumour is still going on even after the chat with kaka last week where he proved to be a very devout evangelist christian without even asking him about his religion and to believe me i sent u the links which proves everything here is the translation of some questions in the chat from rickykaka.com and here is the link of the chat from acmilan.com but translate it from italian and u have to be registered there and here is the denial of the rumour from arbiya channel site which was one of the sources that spread  the rumour even most arabic soccer forums denied this rumout later\nwhat is this tourist ???? do u think that when someone makes a seach about a character and the word muslim appears this means that he annonced it???this word only appears beside his name in yahoo search because there were millions of fans searching this on the net when the rumour went on 3 weeks ago and the arabic source denied it translate it from arabic from google if u donot understand arabic!!\nhey denise i think that i gave u the proof that noone can doubt from acmilan official site and from arabic sites what else do u want to get to believe that it is just a rumour?for god's sake how can a religious man change his relgion during a visit which lasted for 2 days only??there is  not  even a single official source for this rumour that is why el arabeya channel denied it 3 days later
Run longer distances every day; endurance is only achieved through repetition. It should be fun for you though. Once you run a lot, your oxygen intake will increase and running will become easier for you. Good luck!
Carmelo focuses so much on his scoring that he neglects the other aspects of the game. It's sad that a player with his physical capabilities will only be remembered for hitting some regular season game winners...that is, if he doesn't realize his potential!
Mike Woicik\n\nThe correct answer is: Mike Woicik has the most Super Bowl rings. He has six (6):\n\n    * Three (3) with the Dallas Cowboys\n    * Three (3) with the New England Patriots. \n\nHere is more information on others:\n\n    * Mike Ditka, as player and coach for Dallas Cowboys and Chicago Bears. \n\n    * Bill Belichick \n\n    * Charles Haley has five (5). Two with San Francisco 49'ers and three with the Dallas Cowboys. \n\n    * Romeo Cronell has five (2 Giants, 3 Patriots) \n\n    * Ray Rhodes has five. \n\nDan Rooney and, possibly, Dick Hoak\n\nDan Rooney now sports 5 of them!\n\nI think Dick Hoak - Runningback Coach for Pittsburgh would also have 5 rings and the most with the same team.

RB: Go with DeAngelo Williams. The Jets defense is playing a lot better as of late and Ahman just isnt the same as he use to be. If the Packers score it will be through the air.\n\nWR: Gotta go with Devery Henderson first. He has averaged over 100 yards a game his last three outings with some TD's. With Colston banged up and Horn underperforming, Henderson and Copper have became likeable targets for Brees. For your second reciever I would go with Chris Henry. The Baltimore defense is tough, but hes getting a lot of big gains because Johnson and Houshmanzedeh are the defenses main priorities.

Not at a live event, but maybe at a house show. They did both work for WCW for three years together so it is a possibility. As for the relationship, I know there is alot of respect between the Hart family and the Guerrero family, because they are one of the oldest and successful wrestling families and i know that they have alot of respect and admiration for each other. I am not sure about Bret's reaction, but I am sure he was saddened since he did know him and alot of Bret's friends (Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, etc.) were also Eddie's friends, he was definitely saddened by the news. I wished they wrestled at a live event as well. I hope that answers your question.
Other than looks, it is used to protect scrapes, cut and bruises if there are any.   Also, it provides warmth to the area that is more convenient than wearing tights completely underneath the shorts.   Players also wear them to give their calf more pressure, that helps them feel more comfortable especially if the calf/shin area has had surgery performed in the area (the surgery may have caused lossed sensitivity).  Lastly, some players wear them because of superstition.

"One idea I used for my fantasy league is to do a ""keeper"" league. There are many variations for this; here's the one I used. Each team participates in the inital draft. Once the season finishes, each team can choose to retain up to 4 players. The rest get funneled into the draft for next year. For next year's draft, the teams will mandatorially draft the (up to) four they retained. The rest will be put into a new draft, etc. etc. Another way to make FF fun is to put a wager on it, such as a ""March Madness"" office pool, or something akin to that. Hope I could help."

G'day Ben J,\n\nThank you for your question.\n\nIt is team rules. They would be worried about his form which is well down on his form on both points and rebounds as compared with previous seasons. Before he was benched, he only played for 20 minutes on the previous night. He should spend more time worrying what they pay him for and less about that.\n\nRegards

Rim fire and center fire refer to the location on the cartridge where the priming compound is located.  In rim fire shells such as the .22 rim fire, the priming compound is located in the rim of the base of the shell.  The gun which is chambered for these shells have a firing pin which strikes the rim of the shell thereby igniting the priming compound.  With center fire shells, the priming compound is located in a primer which is pressed into the center of the base of shell.  Guns chambered for center fire cartridges have the firing pin located so that it strikes the primer located in the center of the base of the shell.  Most cartridges are of the center fire type.

You do not win in that environment.\n\nNo one plays for each other.\n\nLook at the Cardinals this year, every wrote them off, but they banded together, under a quality manager, and fought in every game, and played as a team, played together, worked together, had fun, and WON.\n\nLook at the Red Sox in 2004, White Sox 2005.\n\nOld cliche ""A Champion team will always beat a team of Champions""\n\nThe best team will win, not the team with the best players or the most expensive payroll."

Scotland 34. Pacific islands - 22. \n\nGreat game played amazingly well by Scotland in the first half though the Pacific Islanders were  like a totally different team in the second half. Whatever their coach said / did to them at half time certainly woke them up!
Wrigley Field is your Radio Trivia Answer\n\nWrigley Field is a baseball stadium in Chicago that has served as the home ballpark of the Chicago Cubs since 1916. \n\nDuring Cubs games, Cubs fans will stand on Waveland Avenue, waiting for home runs literally hit out of the park. \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrigley_Field
He definately has talent, which was unfortunately wasted for his first three-plus years in the league. That said, while he has performed very well, let's not talk HOF just yet. It's WAY too early for that.
Cooking oil can be used on horse feed but it add calories and does not have an influence on how powerful the horse is.\nIt will make them gain weight and not make them hyper or hot.\nIt adds calories by adding fat to the diet. It is use with great success to get thin horses to gain weight with out the risk of lamanitis or founder. It works better than just adding more grain to the diet.\nIt will not change the power of the horse.\nThe oil must be a vegatable oil and needs to be clean and fresh.\nStart at 1/4 of a cup per feeding and work up to one cup.

Yes! I did it.  I'm quite a good swimmer and when the channel swim was advertised someone asked me a bit sarcastically whether I was going to do it.  She thought it was THE channel swim!\n\nWhen I said that I was doing it she was so impressed but I felt obliged to explain what it was all about.  She sponsored me anyway  even when she realised I was not going to grease up and do a David Walliams across to France.\n\nI raised quite a lot of money but the hard part is collecting it from all the sponsors.  It hasn't lead to better things but I would recommend this particular challenge.  It is for such a good cause.
It only matters on who gets invited.  The only bowl really affected directly are the National Championship and the Rose Bowl.  This year there are about 25 bowl games that will be played and they are basically invite types of events.  Many people argue that many teams that are not as good as others get invited just for ratings- for instance Nebraska on an offpeak year still goes to a bowl because people will watch.  Of course this is for the sponsor to make $ on advertising.\n\nAlso many people argue that there are too many bowls.  I personally say they are great revenue for the schools going to them so who cares how many there are...let the schools get the money.

I'm starting Mike Bell in my flex spot, for the simple reason that he does seem to have a knack for goalline carries.\n\nI would expect Tatum to play some, but he has clearly lost his burst.  Mike Bell should get 10-15 carries minimum, and Damien Nash may come in some too.\n\nAgainst KC, in KC, neither guy is a good play, but of the two go with Mike.

They always seem to freeze up.  If you watch them play, they seem to always do great against the hard teams but when it comes to the easier teams then they just aren't in the game or something.  I don't know but they should watch themselves before they end up screwing themselves again.

On February 9, 1895, in Holyoke, Massachusetts, William G. Morgan, a YMCA physical education director, created a new game called Mintonette as a pastime to be played preferably indoors and by any number of players. The game took some of its characteristics from tennis and handball. Another indoor sport, basketball, was catching on in the area, having been invented just ten miles (sixteen kilometres) away in the city of Springfield, Massachusetts only four years before. Mintonette (as volleyball was then known) was designed to be an indoor sport less rough than basketball for older members of the YMCA, while still requiring a bit of athletic effort.

yes.i also suprised that the wwe didnt go for a telented wrestler like AJ styles.for me he is the face of tna.and if AJ styles is on raw roster, he will be in the main card. hell, its not easy to find a superstar who is good at submission technical wrestling and high flying moves.most wrestler only have one of it.\ni think the reasons wwe didnt go after AJ is bcos the tna originals,(those who are not from the wwe..ect) was once said in an interview that they will never work for vince...
no u got to work hard
yes... we one... as i predicted!! have faith in those steelers!! and beN played his heart out.. he took some hits but he stayed up for his team... only one int. was on him... the other two should have been caught but they bounced off the recievers both times!! bring on the ratibirds!!

No, it's not a plus 1 situation. There is a BCS Championship game for #1 and #2 in the BCS polls and then the 4 traditional bowl games. The Championship game no longer rotates between the Fiesta, Rose, Sugar or Orange Bowls.
I think it will be a tough and gritty series for both teams. Having said that, England will be suffering for the lack of Simon Jones and Michael Vaughan, who were both key players last time. Also, the late loss of Tresco will damage their chances. Australia is a tough tour, and the hard pitches have a habit of taking their toll on visiting bowlers. Harmison and Flintoff are both recovering from injuries, but will need to bowl long spells which could take their toll.\nHowever, the England team are young and enthusiastic, which will give them plenty of determination. They also have plenty of talent in KP, Flintoff, Strauss etc.\nAustralia though, I feel, have just too much experience. Yourself, and Hayden, when you two get going build awesome platforms for the team to go onto big totals. Punter is in the best form of his life and has scored 1483 runs at 78 including 8 tons since the Ashes. If he gets going, We should be scoring 500+ scores. Then Hussey, well what a talent. Marto has a doubt but with Clarke and Jacques both pressing for a spot the middle should fire more than last year. Gilchrist doesn't even need a mention, except to say that Englands strategy of bowling around the wicket and moving it away shouldn't work as well in Oz as the extra bounce should give his the chance to cut and pull more often, which we all know he does with devestating effect. Brett Lee, McGrath and Warney will all fire up and do the job, and whoever gets the nod out of Watson, Clark, Tait or Johnson will be very keen to impress, and with the benefit of the extra bounce at home, the youngsters should bowl fast, and make life tough for England's inexperienced batsmen.\nI think it will be closer than a lot of people back home will be thinking. I think the home crowds, and the conditions will just be a little too much for such a young inexperienced England team. Don't worry, there are plenty of Aussies over here in London who will be sitting up late at night and cheering you boys along, and we are taking the stick from the Poms for you, so get stuck in, good luck, and here's to a summer of runs for you boys.\nAus to win 2-1.

"If you want to know the true difference between the two, it's a simple answer, there is none. No I'm not crazy, velocity and accuracy is determined in the last  2 1/2"" of your barrel. It's called the choke, you can purchase a shotgun with a number of different chokes as in ( Full , Modified, semi Modified, to Improved cylinder) I have five different interchangeable chokes for my Browning over/under and each have there purpose.\n\nBeing that both barrels have rifling the only difference you will notice between the two barrels would be the the recoil will be some what greater on the 18"" barrel, and the 24"" will get you 6""closer to your target.\n\nRange of the gun is determined by the slug and the drams of powder in the slug. You will notice that when you purchase slugs they are already state Magnum load on the box as well as size 2 3/4 or 3"" shells.\n\nThis isn' t brag cause I""ve never done it but I watched my Dad with his model 1100 Remington with a 26"" barrel with modified choke and 2 3/4"" slug split penny post cards at 100 yds.

I would think Justine, as my first choise. People who say Sharapova, don't know much about tennis, but taken by looks. I would think Sharapova will be eleminated early. Everyone is out for blood against her. Remember, by meer luck she won the US open cuz Maresmo had to play a tough 3 (almost 3 hours)setter against Serina a day before, so Sharapova had to face a very weary & tired Maresmo in the semi, then faced an injured Justine in the final. Sharapova will be humilated & put to sleep in this event & i bet she knows it & scared hell now from the coming humilation.

No, although you probably wouldn't compete.  You could teach yourself or find a gym that has adult gymnastics.

The Browns offensive line play is nothing short of well offensive and the season is gone but much has to do with injuries as well as departures...Crennel does realize the situation for it gets played out every week in front of him...I believe that the situation will be corrected even as he is a defensive guy he knows both sides of the ball depend on the guy in the trenches so correction will be coming in seasons like this, this period is like an extra pre-season the guys are playing for next year those that are not giving 100% wont be around long.have looked at the lines stats and really  just a couple weak links and it only takes one for the break...not a brown fan myself cant wait to see them back on their feet ready for the dog bones and terrible towels to get back to good old nasty days in the trenches

Learn a little kickboxing, mainly the defense and what kicks to look for. I take mixed martial arts in which we do alot of kickboxing where low kicks are very common. They get to the body faster than a punch and they do more damage. Your legs will weaken and you won't have any push off power. Muay Thai kickboxing is a good art to learn because it also teaches the art of using knees and elbows effectively. I'd check out http://www.kickboxing.com and get all the information you need there.

"Sujet très intéressant.\n\nEn situation de stress telle qu'une aggression, c'est le cerveau reptilien qui prend le contrôle sur les deux autres parties du cerveau.\n\nCette partie du cerveau contrôle les réactions instinctives (dont l'instinct de conservation). En cas de stress, le cerveau reptilien a trois options : faire le mort, fuir ou attaquer.\n\nLes deux autres parties du cerveau ne sont pas sollicitées et, par conséquent, les techniques martiales mémorisées ""bêtement"" ne sont pas appliquées. C'est la raison pour laquelle on peut voir des ceintures noires se battrent sans aucun style dans la rue alors qu'ils peuvent être très techniques et esthétiques dans un dojo (salle d'entrainement).\n\nPour pallier à ça, il y a deux options :\n- soit on travaille sur la notion de stress afin qu'une situation d'aggression puisse rester ""sous contrôle"". C'est en fait assez difficile de s'entrainer à cela, avec des personnes connues (on connait leur réelles intention) et dans un cadre familier.\n- soit on développe ses connaissances martiales à partir des intuitions dictées par le cerveau reptilien. Le but étant, dans un premier temps, de ""faire avec"" puis, d'essayer de modifier ces intuitions. Là aussi, c'est très difficile car cette partie du cerveau est réputée très rigide.\n\nBref, la route est longue....\n\nMaintenant, votre question n'était pas nécéssairement axée sur les arts martiaux. Or, la différence avec d'autres ""sports"", c'est qu'il y a cette notion de stress paralysant notre cerveau limbique et néo cortex.\nPour répondre de manière plus générale, il faut bien comprendre que les mouvements que nous faisons ""d'instinct"", tels que marcher, se tenir assis, postionner notre bassin, notre tête, etc. sont en fait dictés par notre éducation et notre société. Il est faux de penser que les mouvements faits instinctivement sont les plus naturels (par exemple, regardez les mouvements et positions des enfants ou des personnes de culture primitive). Pour adopter des mouvements naturels, adaptés physiologiquement, il faut en fait ré-apprendre à se servir efficacement de son corps. Donc l'entrainement est obligatoire (par exemple : étudiez la manière dont les sportifs de haut niveaux courent le 100m et comparez là à la votre...) . Il n'empêche que le sportif peut, instinctivement, trouver les mouvements les plus naturels à force d'entrainement.\n\nEn espérant avoir répondu à votre question...\nJ'aimerais bien lire vos résultats, serait-il possible de me les envoyer par mail ?"

I've almost drowned twice, and it is definitely no like being let free. On the other hand, it isn't agony either. It's more like pure terror. You fight to get to the surface, or get out from under something which is what happened in both of my cases. Your head starts pounding and your vision starts fading. It doesn't really hurt, it's just like holding your breath for too long, then u take a breath and water fills your lungs. When you break the surface though, it's like being re-born. That first breath is amazing and is the best feeling in the world. So yea, drowning is more terror than anything.

I like that but i think the bracket would have to be tweaked with the following.  Conference champions get seeded 1-6, if Notre Dame is ranked #1 at the time of seeding they get the one seed withe the conference champions getting seeds 2-7.  After conference champions then it goes to the polls with the remaining teams getting seeded in order of ranking in the polls.

"It all started when Owen Hart pile-drived Austin in an Intercontinental bout. After this, Austin was seriously hurt and did not had medical clearance to wrestle. Austin wanted to get back at Owen so bad that in order to get another match with him he offered to kiss his ass if he didn't beat him. \nOwen accepted but before the match took place, first Sgt Slaughter who was the commissioner at the time tried to talk Austin out of it getting a Stunner for his trouble, then Long time pal Jim Ross tried to persuad Austin not to wrestle, Austin notched his head as if he had understood but instead gave Old JR a taste of the Stunner too. Finally it was Mr. McMahon's turn to talk to the ratllesnake telling Austin ""Please, these fans and all of us care about you and we don't want to see you get hurt"". 'm sure you know where this ended. Stunner again and this is the actual incident that began the feud between these two. Actually, this is the reason why Vincent K. started to get in the ring anyway. Up 'till then we only saw his face doing announcing and stuff.\n\nAnyway, then Stone Cold won teh Rumble and went on to Wrestlemania to defeat HBK for the title, with Iron Myke Tyson as a guest referee. He even had an altercate with Iron Mike just before Wrestlemania but it was all BS since Tayson knocked out HBK and ended up costing him the belt.\n\nWe'll there's the short story...Now I think I need to go do something else besides wrestling.\n\nOn second thought...I don't care what people thinks. I love wrestling."

yes, he should go back \ngood night - jindajind !
I disagree with the others on this one.  I would go with Rivers.  I don't see L.T. having a great game against the Broncos, he never does in Denver.  The Chargers will go to the pass alot this week because thats how you beat the Broncos (they're #2 against the run, but 27th against the pass).  Yes, Tomlinson is on fire, but if the Chargers offense is anything it's versatile, they won't stick with the run if it isn't working.  And Rivers is not in a slump, GoMichigan doesn't know what he's talking about, Rivers threw for 337 yards and 3 TD's with no ints last week, and he was an offensive player of the week nominee.  Bulger is coming off his worst game of the season, and going up against a Panthers defense that has been very good against the pass this year.
no
Start Keyshawn and Heap...don't bother playing Fitzgerald this week cushe'll only be used on a few plays. So Heap and Johnson will start and play and will beable to produce some points for you.
I would take a look at Louisville under a TD against Rutgers.  There's a lot of talk out there about how great this Rutgers team is, how powerful Ray Rice is, how the defense doesn't give up any points.  And then you look at their schedule.  UNC, ILL, OHIO and Howard as a Non-Conference slate?  Also remember that Navy lost it's starting QB early in their game.  On the flip side, the Petrino knows that he has to win and win big to make up for his team's weak schedule compared to FLA, CAL, TEX & MICH.  The Cardinals have a pretty solid defense and an Offense that is clicking once again with Brohem at the controls.  Petrino puts his foot on the accelerator and doesn't look back.  Louisville, comfortably.

Hey Michaela,\n\nThe reason you lose points in Fantasy Sports is because you are most likely playing in a 'Rotisserie' league. What that means is in a bunch of different statistical categories your fantasy team (so Kobe Bryant, Shaq, Tim Duncan etc - the guys on your roster under the 'my team' page) earn you points in each category.\n\nThe way the league works means that in each category if your team scores say 150 rebounds on day one and that is more than the other teams in your fantasy league - for the rebound stat category - you'll earn 12 (if it is a 12 team league) points towards your Overall League total.\n\nBut say the next day you get just 15 rebounds from your team - and say 5 other teams get enough rebounds to go past your total (150+15) then you'll only get 7 points towards your Overall League total = Meaning you'll get -5 points in your total.\n\nThis applies for all the categories - so today you might've dropped 15 points but if your players go really well tomorrow - you might improve by 15 points!\n\nThe aim is by the end of the season to have more Overall Points than the other 11 teams in your league obviously - but it isn't easy so make sure you check your team regularly to give yourself every chance of winning!

Since I prefer H2H over roto  here's the deal..  have you 'cornered' the market on other stat catagories.. Assuming you are going standard H2H stat cats..  I tend to draft two top goalies, in this case this year Miller and Broduer..  I almost alwys have 4 wins from those two each week..  Next..  I lke to pick one or two catagories to load up on in my drafts, in this case, I usually go for PIMs and assists, since everyone loves the goal scorer..  That's six stat catagories I tend to win each week..  I currently am in foirst place four points ahead of second..  but frankly, all that is important right now is finishing top six to make the playoffs, since less than 30% of those who finish first in H2H actaully win their league in Yahoo..\n\nBottom line, is concentrating on your +/_ going to help you if you subtract those players needed to counter..  will you hurt another catagory..  If not..  then +/- is a decent indicator of a defensive minded player (only an indicator)  look for two or three year trends, see who is available and go from there..  Someone like Kris Draper..  who won't get you many goals or assists, generally has done well on +/- over the last few seasons..
honestly the way miami's defense is coming around i would play green and take the rushing yards, especially against the jets plus he will get you a few yards catching balls out of the backfield.

Délaissée à tord par bon nombre de pêcheurs, la pêche de la brème est passionnante de part la diversité des techniques qui sont misent en œuvre ainsi que la faculté d’adaptation que nécessite la réussite d’une bonne pêche.\n Selon les jours, au même endroit, les brèmes mordront mieux à la canne, au feeder, ou à la bolognaise, il faut donc employer la bonne technique, mais avant de savoir quel choix faire, il faut passer de nombreuses heures au bord de l’eau à se poser des questions qui pour certaines resteront sans réponses, mais c’est aussi cela le charme de la pêche. \nLa pêche de la brème en étang\nA la grande canne : \nPour pêcher à la grande canne, les meilleurs postes sont ceux où il y a un banc de nénuphars à proximité, une avancée ou un grand fond en bordure.\nCe sont des endroits qui sont toujours visités par les brèmes.\n La ligne sera constituée d’un corps de ligne en 10 ou 12/100, d’un flotteur de 0,40 à 1,5 g suivant la profondeur, et d’un bas de ligne en 8 ou 10/100 avec un hameçon n° 20 à 14 selon la taille des poissons et l’esche utilisée.\nLa forme du flotteur est très importante pour pêcher la brème en étang. Il est préférable d’utiliser des modèles de forme poire allongée qui permettent de bien visualiser les touches dites en « relevé » typiques de la brème, tout en offrant une bonne stabilité dans la vague s’il y a du vent.\n L’amorçage sera constitué de 8 à 10 boules d’amorce au départ, le rappel pouvant se faire avec l’amorce ou en frondant des asticots sur le coup quand les touches diminues.\nLa ligne devra être réglée de telle sorte que l’esche traîne sur le fond ou évolue entre deux eaux suivant la position des poissons dans la couche d’eau.\nEn effet, en étang, surtout lorsqu’il fait chaud, les brèmes ont tendance à décoller du fond et se tenir entre deux eaux.\nCeci est d’autant plus vrai lorsque l’on rappelle en frondant des asticots.\nLa pêche de la brème en rivière \nLa brème est souvent présente en forte densité dans les rivières et fleuves français et l’on peut y réaliser d’énormes bourriches.\nIl serait donc dommage de passer à coté de cette aubaine car c’est vraiment une pêche passionnante où l’on se mesure souvent à des poissons qui atteignent le kilo voir plus de deux sur certains secteurs.\nContrairement au plan d’eau, en rivière, les bancs de brèmes n’hésitent pas à s’approcher du bord, il n’est donc pas forcément utile de les pêcher à 30 m. du bord.  \nLa pêche à la grande canne : \n         La présence du courant oblige à utiliser des lignes plus lourdes et plus solides qu’en étang.\nLa ligne sera donc constituée d’un corps de ligne de 10 à 16/100, d’un flotteur d’une portance de 1 à plus de 20 g. et d’un bas de ligne de 10 à 14/100 d’une longueur de 20 à 30 cm. muni d’un hameçon n°18 à 12.\nLe flotteur sera de forme boule afin d’être plus stable dans le courant et de permettre de retenir la ligne, voir de la caler.\nLes nouveaux flotteurs plats sont d’ailleurs tout à fait adaptés à la pêche de la brème en rivière dès lors qu’il est indispensable de caler la ligne pour présenter une esche presque immobile sur le fond.\n L’amorçage sera lourd au départ, constitué de 10 à 20 boules d’amorce de la taille d’une orange. Dès que les touches commencent à diminuer, il est nécessaire de rappeler régulièrement pour maintenir les brèmes sur place.\nPour cela, il faut parfois rappeler avec une boule serrée à une main à chaque coulée, voir plus si la densité de poissons est très importante.\n La ligne devra être réglée de telle sorte que le bas de ligne traîne sur le fond.\nPour cela, il est préférable de choisir un poste où il n’y a pas trop d’accrocs, une coulée propre permettant de pouvoir traîner franchement et c’est souvent un plus pour sélectionner les plus beaux poissons.  \nOK ?
Since Ninjitsu is a true martial art, and the Force utilized by the Jedi is a figmint of George Lucus brilliant mind, I would have to say a Ninja.  \n\nBoth rely on deception though.  Blending in and not being noticed.
Becuase Steven Gerrad have more influnce power i think.

You can make it, but I'm afraid the hope is a minimum.  First of all, your team needs to make some noise, and you need to be in the paper (:D).  If your team doesn't make noise, than Duke (the greatest basketball college ever woot woot!) will not even know you exist (unfortunately).  Your job is to get the team pumped up, kick some serious *** and be a beast on the court.  Maybe than, will the coaches at Duke see you :D\n\nA little time at big time camps (maybe they have one at Duke) or a different large school will help (if you have the money).
They'll beat W Carolina next week.\nThen they have to win at Florida State, which could be tough being a road game against an intense rival.\nThen, they'll have to win the SEC title game.\nIf they do all three they should play the OSU/Michigan winner for the BCS title.
my question is how do you beat peyton manning but lose to eli manning? go cowboys. well they got philly without mcnabb once more and they have the giants again. their schedule is so much easier down the stretch. tampa should be a cake walk. i use that loosely and tony romo is playing his ass off.
Henry, Berrian and Edwards...but i would pickup Jennings and replace Edwards with him.
"""An impressive combination of power and elegance, Artem Milevskiy’s style is not unlike that of Sweden's Zlatan Ibrahimovic. \nWell built (1.90m) but pacy with it, this forward is, at 21, already a vital cog in the Dynamo Kiev first team. A product of the Smena academy in Minsk, Milevskiy played a key role in the qualification of Belarus for the UEFA U-16 European Championship in 2000, before opting to take Ukrainian nationality. \n\nBlessed with superb ball control and great vision, Milevskiy can also play as a striker. Indeed, at the FIFA World Youth Championship Netherlands 2005, he caught the eye as one half of a remarkable strike duo with compatriot Oleksandr Aliiev. \n\nAs yet uncapped at senior level, he could prove to be a useful joker in coach Oleg Blokhin’s pack. "" Fifa."
the point of the fuzziness is so that it can grab the tennis court better than a smooth ball.  This helps when people serve different balls... it effects topspin, sidespin, and backspin more than a smooth ball would.
$12k for 80 more hp is a huge waste of money. First, that is an improvment in hp of about 13% over stock which you probably wouldn't be able to actually feel and which you could probably gte by doing some simple bolt on modifications like intake, exhaust, new spark plugs, a chip, etc. which would cost far less than $12K.\nIf you want to retain your warranty and the driveability/comfort you desire (especially if you bought an SL65) then you wouldn't necessarily do anything to modify it.\nAlso, a mustang would have to be dramatically modified to get into the 8s in 1/4 and I doubt that any of those mustangs in the 8s are actually street legal. \nIf you thought that the SL65 would be the fastest car ever than you may be a little confused. If you want an 8 second car then you should sell the SL and get a mustang and modify it. I would guarantee that it won't have the comfort, driveability and sophistication of the SL. Personally, as a daily driver I would much rather have the SL than the mustang.

The gyroball is the name given to a breaking baseball pitch purported to be used by players in Japan. The pitch was developed by two Japanese researchers, Ryutaro Himeno and Kazushi Tezuka, who used computer simulations to create a new style of delivery intended to reduce stress on the pitcher. At the point of release, instead of having the pitcher's arm move inwards towards the body (the standard method used in the United States), the pitcher rotates his arm so that it moves away from his body, towards 3rd base. The unusual method of delivery creates a bullet-like spin on the ball, like a bicycle tire spins when facing the spokes or a perfectly thrown football. When thrown by a right hander, the pitch moves sharply down and away from right handed batters and towards left handed batters.\n\nIn baseball, most pitches are thrown with backspin, like the fastball, or with a more forward spinning motion, like the curveball and the slider. Batters use the arm speed of the pitcher and the spin on a baseball, highlighted by the seams, to judge the speed of the ball. The gyroball is thrown with the arm speed of a fastball but goes much slower, and since it has a bullet-like spinning motion, on occasion (perhaps when the seams are hidden from view of the batter) it will make experienced batters swing wildly ahead or behind the ball.\n\nThe gyroball is one of the available pitches in Baseball Mogul 2007, a baseball computer game. In that game, the trajectory of the ball looks similar to a flat fastball or change up, with a late lateral break (away from right-handed batters as thrown by right-handed pitchers). It was once thought that the only pitcher in the game that possesses the gyroball in his arsenal is Daisuke Matsuzaka. However, he himself says that he is just trying to learn how to throw it [1].\n\nThe gyroball is also often confused with a completely different Japanese pitch called the shuuto, due to an error in a well-known article by baseball writer Will Carroll (see external link). Although Carroll later corrected himself, the confusion still persists.
Hold on a minute.  Rex Grossman has more touchdown passes than he does interceptions.  Granted, he has been playing subpar compared to the beginning of the season, but that's to be expected.  He's in his first year as a starting quarterback.  People are beginning to figure out how to play against him.  Once he learns to read defenses, he will be an excellent quarterback.  He has an amazing accurate arm; he just needs to learn to use it.  Give him time, and he'll be a great quarterback.\n\nAlso, the Bears are 9-2.  I don't see them getting rid of a quarterback that is leading the team with a record like that.  If anything, they should think about replacing Brian Urlacher because he's getting old and won't be nearly as good in 3 or 4 years.

In the old days, before the early 20th century, red was the brightest color of paint readily available --- aside from white (which, technically, is not a color but you art majors can handle this aspect).\nAnyway, most paint was available in white, red, green or blue. Other colors such as tan or orange were available but more expensive to produce.\nThese were the days before large chemical firms, when small companies produced only a few colors of paint. If you wanted light blue walls in your study, you mixed white and blue --- you didn't buy light blue.\nRed showed the best on water and was readily available. When undisturbed, the bobber's top is red. If you get a nibble, the fish typically turns the bobber over and you can see the white bottom.\nAnyone who has ever tried to see a bobber against an evening sun knows how difficult it can be to see white in the sparkling water. The red helps, a bit.\nIt's more tradition than anything that keeps bobbers red and white today. Lime green or orange would be better, and I have seen these colors on bobbers.\nBut there's something comforting about a red and white bobber. It's an historical link to the past.

come on now!this question is getting boring.the last time i answered it ,i had 11 points deducted because i insulted all you league fans.someone went crying to yahoo and reported me.im going to say this again but in a more toned down fashion.OK.i think that league is a boring,softie version of rugby.union is REAL rugby.league is for those who are scared of getting a few bruises and scratches.and for all you league people out there that think union is only for the upper class snobs in this world;try looking a little furthur than your own back yard,to countries like south africa,new zealand,australia and many other places,where rugby is very much the sport of the common man.get your facts straight.
Wow. So it was desaily. Used to be France captain also.
It was a brilliant game, I couldnt disagree more that it wasn't a great ad for CL football - it had everything you want from a game, skill, passion, fight, drama.\n\nI'm a massive Arsenal fan, I hate Chelsea, but by the end of it, I was delighted that they got the equaliser that they deserved - I used to be a big Barca fan, but I've noticed of late that they really are rather dirty - which is a shame, given how skilfull they are.\n\nAnyway, great game, and I hope that I watch my lot get all 3 points at the Grove tonight............. Come on you goonaz!!
I think it will be 1-1 going into the second half of extra time. After that though, I dont know

You might want to read this, I answered it to a previous question. Oh, and that's great that you are trying out for cheerleading! Good for you!\n\nI'll give you tips for preparing and for tryouts.\n\nBe fit, on time and enthusiastic. Be prepared and alert to follow instructions. As k cheerleaders on the team for tips.\nFind a good gymnastics center in your area, and have skills such as back-hand-springs, aerials, front tucks, back tucks...\nUnless you are really tiny and are going to be a flyer, you need to get some muscle and lift some weights at least 3 times a week. Your going to be lifting PEOPLE and WEIGHT for every stunt. \nHave a solid jump.\nRUN. Fun a few miles every week. Start off at 1/2 a mile and work your way up. You need to train yourself or else you will get exhausted real fast. \nStrengthen your core. 50 sit ups a day will improve jumps and stunting.\nKeep a positive attitude. Always have a smile on your face! \nListen to your captain/instructor.\nDon't be late for ANYTHING.\nPractice 5 times a week.\nBe sure to stretch real good before and after tryouts. Don't attempt moves unless you already know them or have trained for them. It will cause injury and annoy other team mates.

if you are trying to teach safe shooting habits \ni would recomend a regular Co2 powered BB pistol. and preferably one with a metal outer caseing.\n\nfor 2 reasons. \n\nfirst if you are teaching them about guns. then it should be a gun.\nAirsoft guns are usually plastic and fire wither plastic  pellets or 6mm paintballs. this gives the idea to the kid that it is a toy. and that is a disaster waiting to happen. \n\nif they want to get into the game of airsoft (combat battle game much like paintball. i would recoment that they just get directaly into paintball. the paintball markers are more reliable and last longer. and there are more people that play it. \n\na good recomdation for an airsoft gun pretty much anything made by TIPPMAN pnumatics. they make airsoft, paintball, and a variety of other air powered launchers and machines.

some teams your sod which is grass grown in other places and transfered to that field. but the new thing used is field-turf which is like turf grass then rubber dirt, some rocks underneath and then regular dirt. it drains rain unbeliveably and its amazing. the new england patriots use it now. i played a baseball tournament on that stuff and its great except its pron to ankle injuries.

Depending on what happens in the Paris tournament, Blake might not even make the Masters Cup.  If Haas wins in Paris, he's in and James is out.  \n\nI'd say Nalbandian will make the final again.  He's definitely a sleeper-type player who is a good match-up in Federer's game.  Nadal hasn't had much match play recently so he could be rusty (same thing with Roddick).  \n\nNalbandian could de-throne Fed in the final again like last year.  You never know!
Joe Montana without a question.... but as to the QB that was great and was the most fun to watch.... that was without a doubt FRAN TARKENTON.... the sheer terror and frustration you saw in defensivemen when he got even a little light of day was truly exciting.  You could almost feel opponents thinking , \n\nOH, f**K, am I going to look like sh*t on the postgame reels!!!\n.\nAnd he had relatively average offensive help around him most of his career.  (Some great defenses withe the Vikes though)\n.
Pete,\n\nFirst, you need to make sure the chain tension is appropriate. you should be able to move the chain a half an inch up or down. \nIf there's too much slack, the chain will of course fall off if you hit any bumps. Try loosening up your rear wheel axle nuts and pulling back on the wheel. Don't forget to make sure the wheel is straight in the dropouts before you tighten the nuts again. Also, check to make sure the wheel has equal spacing up at the joints of the chain and seat stays. \n\nThis is the other issue. If your wheel is crooked, that means your cassette is crooked too, which would create sort of a twisting effect, causing the chain to pop off. Just make sure your wheel is as straight has possible, and the chain is relatively tight (half an inch of slack maximum), and you should be good. \n\nI wouldn't suggest putting a mountain bike axle in your hub. It's not going to be very cost-effective, and if your BMX bike is high-quality brand (not Next, Huffy, Magna, Vertical, etc...), chances are it has a 14 mm axle. The mountain bike axle won't fit in your dropouts correctly, which is a safety hazard, plus you could potentially damage your bike.\n\nIf none of this works, take a look at the teeth on both your rear cassette and your front chainring; if even one tooth is bent, that could cause your chain to fall off. Sometimes you can get lucky and bend the teeth back with a small pipe wrench, but in many cases the parts will need to be replaced.\n\nHope that helps some, Pete!
Rutgers does have a shot to make it to the title game, only if the following happens though.\n\nFlorida loses the SEC title game to Arkansas which already lost to LSU putting both teams at two losses.  USC beats Cal but loses to Notre Dame.  Bama beats Auburn.  Texas loses the Big XII title game or loses to Texas A&M.  Rutgers wins out.\n\nAlmost all of that would have to happen for Rutgers to move into the top 2 spots.  Rutgers is doing ok in the computers and they can only get better if they keep winning, with another top ten opponent coming up its possible if some of the abo ve happens they could make it.  Most importantly though they need to win out.  I see them moving into the top ten this week in the BCS by virtue of the computers and the fact that their SOS will have moved up from the low 90s into the upper 70s.  The human pollsters will also move them up a few spots as well which will help.  Once they beat WVa they will either end up 2 or 4 in the BCS.

Cables stretch. Shifting becomes just a little bit slower and sloppier and braking starts to be less responsive. Wheels are the biggest items that need retensioning. Also bearings on the bottom bracket, hubs and headset can become sloppy and be damaged if not optimally tightened and lubed. Little things like handlebars and seatposts and saddles that are just out of adjustment can be tightened and straightened out. Plus, they usually give the bike a good cleaning which makes it work better. A more expensive bike built with very good parts may not need everything done as often but more modest bikes definitely need a good going over every year. Winter is an awesome time to get these things done.
yea, even though a&m sets their standards a little too high sometimes, they expect him to win a national title, which i dont think will happen any time soon. a&m is in a tough spot with recruits opting to go to texas and oklahoma or out of the region, it is hard for them to get the best of the best, but he does well with what he has
is there any difference created in the team selection or approach of BCCI towards game through our tips ? Then why should we think about it ? No doubt winning world cup is a matter of pride and honour for us and our country. But when the people sitting at top have no respect of our expectations, then what we can do. They are just happy with the politics. So there is no point in disussing this. And as far as world cup is concerned then forget @ India. It will be great if they could go ahead from  even league matches. So now just stop supporting the team. This is my request to all of u. \nJust wasting 9 precious hours in watching India's match is foolishness now. Its @ wasting almost 600 hours (that is, more than 25 days) per year, if india plays 45-50 days cricket in an year !!!!  Its difficult to stop ourselves but we need to do this, becoz there are many more important things in our life... Forget Chappel, Forget Dravid, Forget Ganguly.... and Forget Indian team... if u just remembers cricket any day then just watch highlight of Sachin's inning against Aussie at Sarjah of 1998. Entire cricket is in that inning.... Cricket is not more than that...\nSorry for being so emotional... but i m too much disturbed due to team's performance, strategies, and the main point, selection.

I've used everything from fiberglass to carbon.I like aluminum because they're cheap,easy to work with,and hit harder.\n\nHowever I've switched to carbons myself only because of the faster speed.I shoot a take down recurve and wanted the extra speed for distance misjudgment.\n\nAs far as fletchings go,if you're shooting a compound,go with vanes not feathers.Feathers will rob your arrow speed,and they're not very weather proof unless you treat them with something.\n\nPersonally I use feathers because I shoot a recurve.Feathers stabilize the arrow a lot better than vanes,but they make noise and are slower.\n\nI'd start off with the vanes,maybe buy a couple of the same arrows and have them fletched with feathers to see how ya like em'.

First off Defiantly play Rivers.  He should really put up big points against a crappy Oakland Defense.  As for your WRs, honestly Id play Henderson(NO).  Hes shown as a great target, with the fewest drops of any saints receiver, and he is Brees's favorite target.  I'm playing him against a weak ATL pass defense, he should have good game.
no. unless you want a life of cokesnorting to keep your weight below 25 kgs. and all the others bitches backstabbing you to get ahead. SOUNDS LIKE FUN! not to mention that fashion is a pointless endevour.  you cant enjoy LIFE if you are worried by what others think of you.
High Cascade Snowboard Camp V Windell's, the rivalry of the ages.  Well, personally I am a fan of MHSSC, Mount Hood Summer Ski Camp, however my friend, who competed in Oregon at the Paul Mitchell Progression Session and took first place in the nation, Tim Humphrey's has told me that both the on hill and off hill training at Windell's is far superior to that of HCSC.  I would have to say that being biased towards neither of those, I would have to say also that Windells has a far better name, and the coaching staff is much more renown than that of HCSC.  If you want to look into another camp though, MHSSC is the way to go man!
Thanks i really like you ,\n\nthius made me understand beter. and mae me laugh too .\n\nthanks

1) Not a Yankees fan\n\n2) A-Rod is my favorite Yankee.  If he's traded, then I'd probably switch to Jeter.\n\n3) Chicago Cubs - He'll perform better outside of NYC, and he's got a good working relationship with Sweet Lou from their Seattle days.
Big Nog would win without even breaking a sweat. He is the ex pride heavy weight champion and one of the best submission grapperlers in the world. He has never been submitted, KOED or TKOED in any of his MMA fights. \n\nHe is one of few that can go the distance with the new champ Fedor. Bruce Lee is a actor with no fighting record. Lets look at Nogs fighting record and compare it too Bruces, you can’t because he didn’t fight, he acted. \n\nNog would submit him in 10 seconds. I would bet everything thing I own on it.
Naty we welcome you with open arms....LOL\n\nFORZA ITALIA
The Stamps camp needs to get it together in the off season. Too many turnovers by Burris in the form of interceptions needs to be addressed, big time. Furthermore, Reynolds always fumbles in clutch situations. They should have let Cates carry the ball more; it would have made a difference in the running game, for sure. The stupid line with the penalties...and roughing the passer crap...come on. There's no excuse for that. The missed field goal sucked, big time, especially since you practice that sh*t all season for situations just as when the field goal was needed in. I'm truly disappointed in the coaching game as well, which has been lame, at best...they act like they don't WANT to win. Since their late September loss to the Argos, over stupid sh*t just like what went down tonight, I've been really disappointed in the play calling and performance overall.
Tough one. I'd gather you aren't winning much in your leage this year.\n\nThis week....\nFred Taylor #1 (Should have a nice outing)\nMaurice Drew #2\nMcallister #3  (Just this week though.)\n\nCheck the waiver wire though... laurence Morany should be off and skipping this week.

Des superviseurs du club culé ont observé en direct le joueur lors de deux rencontres du championnat français, parmi elles la victoire face à Sedan le 11 novembre, lorsqu’il a marqué deux buts, selon ""Expressen"", qui cite des sources sans identification.\n\n""Au-delà du fait que le FC Barcelone sera toujours le FC Barcelone, je n’ai rien d’autre à ajouter, jusque l’on m’a commenté qu’ils sont venus me voir, mais rien de plus. Je me sens très bien à Toulouse et il n’y a aucun problème pour que je reste ici"", a indiqué Elmander, à qui il reste cette saison et les 3 suivantes de contrat. A 25 ans, Johan Elmander, que la presse suédois a mis en relation il y a quelques mois avec le Betis, a été recruté cette saison par Toulouse en échange de 5 millions d’euros versés au Brondby danois, où il a effectué deux grandes saisons sous les ordres de Michael Laudrup.\n\nLe grand mais habile attaquant a su profiter du vide laissé par la retraite internationale de Larsson et le boycott temporaire d’Ibrahimovic de la sélection pour se faire avec une place dans le onze titulaire de la Suède. Elmander a été l’auteur du premier des deux buts de la victoire suédoise face à l’Espagne à Stockholm, où il a posé énormément de problèmes à la défense espagnole."
I thought that myself when I saw the results last night.\nI think it's the beginning of the end of the line for them now.\nEspecially after losing to West Ham at the weekend.
L.T. no doubt.  Larry Johnson is still young but he will be the next best running back.
Actually here are a lot of Americans that play rugby.  You can find a club in just about every city in the US and most of the universities as well.  There are over 50 clubs just in Michigan alone including High School boys and girls, University men's and women's, and men's and women's clubs!\n\nI used to watch the games on FOX Sports World, but I can't find any listings other than the FOX soccer channel.  You should find your local Rugby team (there is a link to USA Rugby were you can search for a club) and drop an e-mail to ask them if and where they watch games.  Usually there will be an Irish Pub somewhere that will show games, if not live somebody might have a recording of recent matches.\n\nIt looks like you can download games through Rugby Channel.  This is new to me, I haven't tried it yet.

"PLEASE CHOOSE MINE THE BEST ONE\n\nGALLARDO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\nThe Lamborghini Gallardo is the Italian supercar maker Lamborghini's ""entry-level"" car, sitting beneath the Murciélago. It is also the first car to feature the new Lamborghini V10 engine - only the third engine designed by the firm. 3,000 Gallardos were built in just two years, making it the company's most-produced model to date. The second-place Diablo took a decade to sell 2,903 examples.\n\n\nOverview\nThe Gallardo was designed as a competitor to Ferrari's 360 Modena, and now competes with its replacement, the F430. The car is named after a famous breed of fighting bull and is pronounced roughly ""gah-yar-do"". Gallardo is also Spanish for the word gallant. Although performance is lower than the Murcielago, it is still very high, and the Gallardo has much better rearward visibility and, according to reviewers, is more maneuverable as well as more tractable in low-speed traffic, making the Gallardo a much more practical car to drive. It is also much more practical to use in bad weather than many other supercars, thanks to rear-biased all-wheel drive. Although corporate owner Audi is renowned for its Quattro AWD system, Lamborghini uses a system of its own.\n\nHowever, to the disappointment of enthusiasts, Lamborghini did not fit its signature scissor-doors as on the Murcielago, and some owners have fit their own, vertical-opening doors. Lamborghini chose to keep the doors exclusive to the V12 models, as it has done since the Countach when they were first introduced.\n\nAt current U.S. prices, a base Gallardo costs about $165,000.\n\nThe Gallardo uses a V10 engine based on Audi's old straight-5 design. This engine was split again to become the straight-5 engine found in the new Volkswagen Jetta. The 5.0-liter engine is a current Audi 4.2-liter V8 (featured in Audi's S4, A6, A8, and Q7 models) with two extra cylinders added and a slightly smaller bore diameter.\n\nThe Gallardo offers two choices of transmissions, a conventional six-speed manual transmission, and an advanced six-speed electro-hydraulically controlled auto-clutch manual, or, as Lamborghini abbreviates it to, ""E-gear"". The latter allows the driver to make shifts much faster than an automatic transmission would, with the control that a manual offers. The driver shifts up and down via paddles behind the steering wheel, and does not need to manually actuate the clutch.\n\nAudi, Lamborghini's current owner, plans to offer its own sports car based on the Gallardo architecture, the Audi R8. It would use a V8 in place of the Gallardo's V10 to avoid competing directly with the sister car.\n\n\nGallardo Spyder\n \nThe Lamborghini Gallardo Spyders at the 2006 LA Auto Show.The production spyder model of the Gallardo was unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show in January, 2006. It is considered by the company to be an entirely new model, with 520 hp (388 kW) and a lower-ratio six-speed transmission. The soft top is fully retractable.\n\nAerosmith drummer Joey Kramer was the first person in North America to take delivery of the spyder model of the Gallardo.\n\n\nGallardo SE\nIn late 2005, the Gallardo SE (for Special Edition) was introduced. The SE is distinguished from the regular Gallardo externally by having a black roofed two tone color scheme as well as specially designed ""Callisto"" rims shod with Pirelli tires, the interior of the SE also follows the two tone scheme. Mechanically, the SE addresses many of the criticisms of the original Gallardo; the steering is quicker and more responsive, the gearbox gear ratios have been adjusted to better suit the V10, and the E-gear now has a ""thrust mode"" to optimize acceleration, and its power has been increased to 520 hp (388 kW). The SE has a higher top speed of 315km/h, (196mph), and it accelerates to 100 km/h in 4.0 seconds. Only 250 units of the Gallardo SE will be pro"

I've been in 4 - 5 hundred fights and my primary knockout punch is a hook to the temple. Jab to the nose will cause them to close up in the front and then a left or right hook. \n\nAlso something I learned from karate is to visualize my fist not making contact til it hits the inside of the opposite side of their head, it causes a devastating punch if done properly like a horse kicking them.
tu as deja répondu a la question en partie.\nPortsmouth est beaucoup moins prestigieux que Chelsea et ne fait pas de coupe d'Europe.\nkanu n'est plus tres jeune et depuis son probleme cardiaque, kanu a été moins brillant (Kanu à l'AJAX !!!)\nenfin, je pense que Kanu est beaucoup plus irrégulier que Drogba ! je peux t'en parler, je suis un supporter d'Arsenal de longue date...\nah, cependant je me rappelle d'un fabuleux triplé de Kanu alors que Arsenal était mené 2 a 0 par ... Chelsea !\nvoila en tout cas, ma réponse même si je pense que Kanu a ETE un joueur vraiment exceptionnel, Drogba est par contre TOUJOURS un tres bon joueur tres régulier et efficace.

No i dont. its a bunch of guys with millions of other humanbeen watching a football which can buy from a story for less than 20 bucks sofa accross a field of grass which can be found in my backyard, and if a guy take the ball to the end of the field of grass, every one cheers because he made the ball to the end of the field of grass, its just entertainment that distract us from the real thing, like how we are living in the country, same thing happend to Rome long time ago, its basically the same purpose. i say focus on the real stuff first and spend some time later. i mean football is not a way of life, for the viewers, watching foot ball is a waste of time unless you are trying to enforce relationship with others. and you are not getting any where sitting on your couch with bunch sodas
They need strikers.\n\nAnd they need to organise their defence.\n\nBut most importantly, they need to stop picking up so many injuries. Somehow I think they inflict it on themselves. Probably wrong training methods or something.

Fernando Morientes et son but contre le Réal..... c'était un instant unique et magique, surréaliste et Morientes a été très sobre, extrêmement contenu après son but. C'est pour moi l'un des plus grands professionnels que le foot français ai put connaitre, car franchement, si tu me foutais à sa place, je ne pense pas que j'aurai pu marquer un but contre mon propre club, celui de mes débuts, la ville de ma naissance. Chapeau l'artiste !
To even think the Bobcats can win against any team is an insult.  Nets for sure.

It could mean anything, i know you want us to tell you that you made the team, but its not guarenteed, it could mean you played good defense, you shot the ball a lot, etc. just play your best and wait.
I'd go for Chad. Baltimore D is pretty impressive lately
"La question est ""pourquoi dans le sport il n'y a que les pseudo-supporters de foot qui sont violents"". Dans tous les autres sports, ça se passe globalement très bien.\n\nLes raisons possibles :\n- ce ne sont pas des supporters mais juste des fouteurs de merde qui cherchent la castagne\n- il y a plus de monde qui s'intéresse au foot donc forcément plus de cons\n- les valeurs portées par le foot sont un peu en décalage (pas de vidéo => valorise la tricherie, etc)"
Ferguson also has, or has certainly had in the past, a precarious relationship with Brian Barwick, the FA's chief executive. Barwick is a Liverpool supporter and when he worked in the BBC's football department Ferguson became convinced that the corporation had an anti-United agenda. He would question the number of old Liverpool players in the Match of the Day studio and wondered why, after a Double-winning season, United did not get the BBC Sports Personality of the Year team award.
the colts for sure,the bears probably even though they lost last week

la négation de l'adversaire qui est sifflé alors que sans lui, point de match.\nIl y a un truc que je trouve hallucinant chez les supporters de foot, c'est qu'ils se réjoissent qd ds l'équipe adverse le meilleur joueur est absent pour blessure... Ne devraient-ils pas plutôt être heureux d'aller voir un match où il y aura de bon joueur afin d'être plus sûr que le spectacle soit de qualité??
"What do you mean by ""if""?  One of them HAS to lose."
To practice ur accuracy take a ball nd make a small target on something that will bounce back towards you..preferably a small trampoline that you can lean against a wall...if you do this long enough it will make your accuracy better and eventually will also build up your arm strength....
They are both extremely susceptible for turnovers!  I would have a hard time starting either of them.  But if I had to choose, I'd go with Roethie, I think he will decrease his number of turnovers with every week out there and I think he can turn those red zone interceptions to TD's very soon, maybe this week.
"I'm not optimistic. This team has lost it's chemistry and Alfreddson has lost his zing altogether.\n\nI have Wade on my fantasy team and it pains me to consider dumping him--he should be world class!!

kenpo?kempo?not the same.both are as good as the person teaching it.kempo leans more towards the freestyle side of martial arts incorporating moves from other styles into there own style.me personally,think that incorparting parts of other styles into your own,working on them and improving them is a very good idea it helps make you a more rounded and better martial artist.every style has good and bad things it makes sense to me to use the good things from other styles.it also allows you to keep the traditions etc of the style you are doing. that is how kempo is in oz anyway not sure about us,couldn't see it being to much different.
Calzage is going to knock Manfredo out, the only real question is what round? I'm leaning toward 6th or 7th. Joe is much to strong for Manfredo and much more experienced.

I am always glad to see Biron in net. He is a good netminder. Don't get me wrong, I think Miller is great also. But at the same time I would like to see Biron get more playing time. I think it was great that he took a paycut to stay with the Sabres because he feels that they are a great team. A lot of respect for a guy that will do that considering he could be a starter anywhere else.
It's possible, I'll bet it will happen within the next 5 to 10 years...I think David Stern would like to see 36 teams (six in each division), so I would look for 6 more expansion teams in the next 10 years.  St. Louis is an obvious choice for one, Oklahoma City is also, Las Vegas maybe, Santa Fe, Kansas City, and maybe Cincinnati or Louisville could all have a shot at a pro team by then...you don't necessarily need to have a team change cities to St. Louis...maybe they'll merge with the ABA again and your Saint Louis Stunners can be an NBA team!!
Nov 28\nNews: Jones tested his injured ankle at practice Monday and pronounced himself ready to play this week against New England, the Detroit News reports.\n\nSpin: Sounds promising but plenty of players have proclaimed themselves healthy on Monday only to be downgraded later in the week. Fantasy owners shouldn't make a final decision on Jones until after the team's Wednesday practice. However, keep in mind that Jones has a tough matchup this weekend against a solid Patriots run defense.

"It goes back to nearly the beginning of football when the first quartbacks where created to take the snap of the ball from the center (or ball snapper).  The word set was to tell all the players on the field to get set (get in place) because the play (the snapping of the ball) was soon to happen.  However, the history of ""hut"" is more obsecure.  It is know that for many years prior to the adoption of the word ""hut"" into the use of army drill sargents by saying ""hut, 2, 3, 4"" so it is possible it was incorporated into football because it was easier to hear than a number while maintaining discipline among the players on the field.  I hope this helps."

A running back will have all three attributes you have said, sometimes they are the fastest of the three positions and other time they are the strongest. \nMost quarterbacks will have the least of these three attributes. I say most because of guys like, Michael Vick and Vince Young, they are exceptions. \nWide receivers will have speed more than anything. They tend to be lighter in weight and taller.\n\nBest in their postions:\nRunning back: LaDainian Tomlinson, great speed, strength and agility and can catch passes well too. He is the whole package when it comes to running backs.\nQuarterback: Peyton Manning, smart, great arm and knows the games.\nWide receiver: Steve Smith, undersized but plays big. Great hands, speed and runs great routes.

There are some things that will come easily to you because you can roller skate, and others that will be hard. Stopping is different, of course, as is spinning and some of the jumps. But your experience roller skating will definately help you. \n\nOne girl at my rink skates beautifully. She started about a year ago, on ice, but she'd done years on roller skates beforehand. \n\nYou should also know that Tara Lipinsky, Olympic gold medallist in figure skating, started as a roller skater. In addition, a lot of (in fact, most of) the people on the US Olympic team in speed skating are former inline-skaters. So the skills do transfer, to a certain extent.

They reckon they have buried the hatchet, Keano probably stuck it in McCarthys' head. I am amazed Mick got another job after the shambles at Sunderland when he was in charge.\nSunderland will win. The players will do Keanes talking for him now.
This one is easy Lippi had the perfect team in the world cup. you bring the same exact team they win it all. and of course i want Italy to win and there is no doubt that they will win. Forza Italia, Forza Azzuri.
um, I already am... I'm assuming that you were asking about yourself.   and in that case, way not?  I mean, practice and get a ball...  shoot it at a hoop... and presto chango!  you're a ball player
dribbling are nice game to in basketball.
well before you can ollie while riding you have to get comfortable when doing an olie. so if you been doing an ollie for a day the keep doing the ollie over and over again for about a week. then start by going slow. then a little faster and a little faster. until you go the fastest you can on your skateboard. but dont worry about falling its okay if you do just get back up and keep trying i have been watching the pros do it for about 5 years.
BASKETBALL, it is the sport I am the best at.

it is not a dome. Most of the fans are covered by roofs, but the field itself is open to the elements.
(1)  False Start - the most common.  Too many of these are called.  I wish they would change it where it is a penalty ONLY if the person is crossed the line AFTER the ball is hiked\n(2)  Offsides - this used to be the most common, but has been overshadowed by False Start.  \n(3)  Holding - whether offense or defense.  I'd like to see this change, too.  Considering how violent football is, 'holding' is almost funny\n(4)  Pass Interference - The harshest of all penalties.  I think they do a pretty good job calling this (you must go after the ball, not the receiver) but having a hand on the receiver should NOT be called Pass Interference\n(5)  Neutral Zone Infraction - After all the years I've followed football, I cannot adequately explain this.  They treat it like NBA basketball, where you cannot just 'wander' into a particular area before the ball is hiked by the other team.  Dumb dumb penalty

Hosting the Olympic games always costs `twice as much as was estimated`no matter which country is involved, has there ever been a time when the tax payers of the country did not have to pick up the bill?One hopes that someone will make some money from it. The only consolation is that after the `fat lady sings`, East London will be left with some fantastic sporting venues that the children and adults alike can enjoy, and that the Olympic Village living accommodation will be turned into homes for East Londoners. The rest of us who will help pay for it, will have nothing, but we shall have the privilege of being able to moan and complain about our money being wasted, and how London gets everything and the provinces never a thing. Think of the fun we shall have on `answers` with the whole issue!
Boogeyman? I'm surprised he even got his job back. No way does he deserve a title shot. Or even a non-title match against the champ.\nAnd yes Batista will win.
"we have to keep the faith!\n\ni don't think Jol is to blame,i think the players lost it themselves!we played very well upto when reading equalised,then just went to sleep.until reading scored it was a stroll for us,i thought we were gonna go on and win by 3 or 4!\n\none thing i can't understand,which possibly is Jol's fault is why he was playing Lennon on the left and through the middle?he's one of the best right wingers around,and the few times we attacked down the wings he looked great,and reading were in trouble,so why play him out of position.once on the pitch it's difficult for the manager to influence the play,that's where a strong captain is very important,he should've told Aaron to play on the right,maybe Ledley isn't strong enough,maybe it would be better to have Keano as captain(he did a great job last year!)and only have Ledley as captain if Keano is injured or goes off!!\n\nGot to beat Blackburn and Wigan in our next two league games,get us ready to do the ""scum"" in the next one after that!!\n\nCOME ON YOU SPURS!!"

The schedule is released shortly after the season ends because they have set up the schedules way in advance so if they decide to change when teams are playing teams they have a bit of time to decide what games they are going to change.  The schedule released shortly after the season ends is called a tentative schedule.

Definitely Dallas and Phoenix are one of the biggest teams that aren't doing well.  Dallas are the western conference champions, yet right now they have a losing record.  Very dissapointing.  Also the Suns who were the pacific division champions are on the bottom now.  These teams better starting improving, because we all have those huge expectations.
I think you're bored and being disingenuous.
Terry Sawchuk\n Roy is probably the best goalie of this era (Brodeur is right there with him). Sawchuk performed without a mask in the Original 6 (when every player was extremely talented) and set the bar for todays goalies to reach. While todays goalies have great numbers we need to remember that they play against teams that lack good scoring, have better defenders in front of them, better defensive systems and far bigger and better equipment.\n  Also Sawchuk had to do it when traveling by train was the way to go, there usually wasnt a backup goalie and no trainers to provide the comforts todays goalies have. Not knocking todays goalies because we have the good fortune of watching great goaltending today, I just think under the circumstances and the pure numbers that Sawchuk is the best goalie of all time!

You must really understand the game in order to enjoy it, but once you truly understand it, you will probably enjoy it greatly. I would read this website: http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/official_rules/objectives_1.jsp\nThis will give you an in-depth look at the rules and positions. You should really try to discuss the sport with someone who really enjoys and understands it because you will get a lot out of it. Be persistent in your watching of the games and pay attention to the commentary to help learn more. Hope this helps!

"this question will never have a definite answer, it falls to personal preference...\nthere have been many great players, all of which were amazing in their own right, however it is simply impossible to determine who was the ""best ever"" due to the obvious difficulties involved with comparing players from different eras, and also the fact that many great players were so good because of unique individual attributes. For example, all the goals Pele scored may make him the best goal-scorer / finisher of all time, whereas Maradona's ability to beat 6 or 7 players on one of his mazy dribbles may make him the best dribbler of all time. some may also be better tacklers, passers, headers, goalkeepers etc. However, just as an aside, with all the dozens of names being banded about......surprising not to heard a shout out for George Best? Personally I think he was amazingly talented and should be up there on anyone's shortlist!!..i saw many videos for George Best and he was amazing...just like pele and maradona\nfor your question however i prefer pele because his character is way better than maradona's"

The best point guard to ever play the game would be Magic Johnson. He passed the ball like no one else could. And to be able to play all five positions, that is deadly. He is also the reason for the FAST BREAK. \n\nThe best shooting guard to ever play the game is Michael Jordan. He could score better than anyone guard who played the game. He is the reason Kobe plays the game. There are many and plenty that try to imitate him. Plus he is well known all over the world. I would even go as far as to say Elgin Baylor, but Elgin's competition during his time was not as quick or as strong as Michael's era. \n\nThe best small forward to play the game is Larry Bird. I would say Dr. J or Scottie Pippen or even George Gervin but because Larry could put his team on his back and go get it. . . .He could shoot the rock, post you up, dish the ball, drop a dime and he even had a couple of shake and bake moves in his game. That is what makes him the best.\n\nThe best power forward would be either Charles Barkeley or Karl Malone. Karl ran the floor better than Charles, plus he had an automatic 12-16 foot jump shot. But Charles could shoot from anywhere on the floor and dribble that ball up the court and put a move on you. They both could rebound the ball, well. So I think it is a tie with those two. It is just sad that neither one of them won a championship. \n\nThe best Center would have to be either Kareem or Hakeem (from the Rockets) Kareem has scored the most points in the NBA and had an unstoppable sky hook. He controlled the boards and blocked shots. Hakeem did the same thing, just he had a plethora of moves to make big men look bad down in the post. Just look at what he did to Shaq in the Finals, where he tourched Shaq for 28 pts per game. Plus he ran the floor just like Kareem. They both have championship rings, just Kareem has a couple of more. I think Kareem has a slight edge because of the most unstoppable shot ever. . . .DA' HOOK!\nGOD BLESS YOU and take care

J'ai vu le match, et ce n'est pas l'arbitre qui donne les deux ballons de contre (avec essai à la fin), ou bien l'arbitre qui aide Carter à planter son essai, ou encore l'arbitre qui délivre une passe dans le dos pour Allister qui aplatit ensuite. Et ce n'est pas l'arbitre qui empêchent les Français de mettre un essai lors de chacune des trois pénaltouches à 5m de la ligne d'essai des Blacks.\nIls étaient trop forts, trop rapides, trop puissants, trop techniques, trop bonne vision du jeu (essai de Carter sur la droite de l'attaque, alors que 7 défenseurs Bleus vont défendre le côté gauche), tout le temps à 4 pour récupérer le ballon, \nTROP BONS !! Cette équipe est un plaisir à voir jouer !!
Being a cheerleader can really help with your gymnastics. Your arms most likely have a lot of strength, but its more than just having strength in your arms.\n\nKeeping your flexibility by practicing your floor exercises and handstands are great for bars. The flexibility helps tremendously to flip and turn, otherwise you are stiff.\nHandstands help get all arm muscles as well as other muscles in the body in shape and good for bars. Most likely you have seen gymnastics having something that looks like a handstand.\n\nWeight training is the best way to go. There really is no way to train unless you get a bar in your house.\n\nCheerleading weights, and other exercises (push-ups, anyone?) are the best way.\n\nGood luck and have fun in gymnastics

In FIFA 07 its R1 and L1 but i'm not sure about 06.
Good question actually. A reputable dive shop shouldn't be selling them to a non certified diver. They have a reg similar to that used on a set of normal regs, which require some training on, to be familiar with it's use and limitations. You also need to be familiar with how a compressed gas works on the body and some of the physics involved.\n There are a couple of sizes of spare air, so gas volume will be part of how long a can will last as well as the depth it's used at.\n Mine is the 3 cubic foot (largest I think) and allegedly holds 50 typical breaths when used at the surface. This number goes down substantially when you  hit 2 atm and so on. About 25% per atm approximately. I don't think they are what you want, for what you intend on doing. They are refillable, but I don't think the cost is worth it for you overall. Mine's sole purpose is to get me out of a tight spot, should the need arise. Fortunately (knock on wood) I haven't had to take it out of the holster.\n You could get certified for just a little more than the cost of one of these. Just a thought.
I would go to the head of a local community cener in your town. The Community Center managers will help get a flag football league organized.\n\nHope this helps,\ngood luck.

Wait. Let me check my crystal ball........yes!
you should actually do bi-lateral breathing.  try breathing every 3, 5, or 7 striokes.  everyone says it is to be able to look at your competition, but it isn't.  it is so that one of your shoulders doesn't grow a lot stronger than the other.  it will kepp your muscles balanced.  my friend didn't do bi-lateral breathing, and now his stronger shoulder is pulling his spine towards it and giving him scholiosis.  so just try breathing on odd number strokes and you will soon get a hang of it.  good luck!
He is an agent since he is a player that can be signed.  He is free since he is not on any team...so he is free much like you would say a girl or a boy is free if they don't have a boyfriend/girlfriend.

Well, most likely the mothers were not around. Hammers are a strange breed. They school a lot during the day, mostly small to medium.(credit of the lines below go to: .geocities.com/RainForest/Andes/1151/)\n\nAnother unusual thing hammerheads do is form schools. These schools can contain hundreds of individuals, with the largest known schools containing as many as 500. The reason why hammerheads school and other sharks do not is unknown. Hammerheads only school during the day. They break up at night to do their feeding. Because the schools contain mainly small to medium sized hammerheads, it is believed that they school to reduce the risk of predation from larger sharks. It is also believed that an order of dominance exists in the schools based on age, size and sex. \n\nI have attached a few links of my favorite hammer sites\n\nEnjoy and good to hear you took your family out fishing

Très franchement cette saison je suis satisfait on a de sacrés matches depuis le début de saison et pas qu'avec Lyon......Il y a + de jeu..........Même si les rivaux de Lyon sont loin le championnat a un bon niveau......avant les derniers matches d'aujourd'hui les 4 derniers se tiennent en 3 points. Même si il n'y a plus aucun interet pour le titre de champion......la relégation mérite encore qu'on s'y intéresse.

"I disagree. I am also a die-hard Eagles fan and I absolutely adore Donovan McNabb. I do agree that we need to start looking in the draft for a young QB who can be groomed into a starting QB over the next few years... not someone who is going to come right out of college and start in the NFL - because we don't need one of those guys right now. McNabb will be back next season. I don't think for a second that McNabb's career is over. That used to be the case when a football player sustained such a serious injury but not anymore (case in point: Daunte Culpepper who had a much more serious knee injury). McNabb has bounced back from serious injuries in the past and come back even better than before the injury (like this season). My prediction is that he'll be ready at the start of next year's regular season (the expected recovery time is 8-12 months). I do, however, agree with you that we can't rely on Garcia as a back up QB. I personally think we should start Feeley for the remainder of the season. Look what he did for us 5 years ago when McNabb broke his ankle and Detmer dislocated his elbow. He's no McNabb but I definitely see him as a solid QB who we can count on to lead this team to a few more wins this season. As for throwing the rest of the season... that's ridiculous!! I understand the ""panic"" that you feel because I feel it too... but be a little more realistic. McNabb WILL be back. He's a warrior. Trust in 5!"
1.  College and high school football are huge.\n2.  College and high school basketball are big.\n3.  High school and minor league baseball are popular.\n4.  College and minor league hockey are not huge.  Most high schools do not have hockey programs.\n\nKids do not grow up playing hockey at an amateur level in the US.   \n\nIt makes all the difference.\n\nHockey needs to be happy to be at the level of popularity it has.  It can continue to be very big in Canada and northeastern cities, and selected other cities where there has been movement of people from colder climates (example: Dallas, which has lots of cold climate transplants who know hockey).
Manning, who pulled through and overpowered the league's best defense (Broncos -- points matter, not yards) but couldn't do that against the cowboys. LT who's biggest gains in Denver had been 75yds on the ground (averaging ~52), got 105 last night (avg 5.3 a carry!, his 3rd best in a game this season).\n\nif LT doesn't win the MVP, there honestly has to be some sort of conspiracy.\n\n(oh, and if you think we'd do good w/out LT, you're wrong. Sure, we are a great team, but we make lots of dumb mistakes. Our defense who was #1 against the run last year is just breaking down. Our offense has to bail us out 2nd half practically every game (we set a record for being the 1st team to win 4 games in a row where we gave up 24+points, that's not good).  If we were disciplined we'd do decent w/o LT, but unfortunately we arn't. We have to rely on pure talent of individual players to pull us up from our mistakes.........................LT for MVP!

When Leeds won the title in 1992, remember when Man United lost to west ham on a tuesday night and Came second after Leeds beat Sheffield United and Man Utd lost to Liverpool on the Sunday, well there was apparently a big party held at David Batty's house and among the ones that attended were Lee Chapman and His Mrs, Leslie Ash. Rumour has it that Chappy caught Cantona and Leslie in an intimate situation and cracked Cantona./
At a rate of 32.3 points a game(which is was he was averaging for his career before first retirement) it would have taken about 522 games or about 6 and 1/3 seasons at 82 games a season to tie and or surpass Abdul-Jabbar in points.

I really like the Nike 1000 model.  it's an officially sized collegiate ball that's made of some kind of composite material that makes it easy to throw and catch.
The centre circle (radius 9.15 m (10 yards)) surrounds this spot, and serves to a regulation Football is 720–730 mm in circumference, and 545–555 mm \n\n\nThe halfway line divides the pitch in half lengthways. Halfway across the halfway line is the centre spot, from which kick-offs are taken at the start of each playing period and after a goal is scored. The centre circle (radius 9.15 m (10 yards)) surrounds this spot, and serves to indicate the distance opposing players must stay from the ball at a kick-off.\n\nI think is complete....................

Frankly if I owned the Cubs I would cut the cord with both of them.  Whoever were their pitching coaches through the years should have been fired on the spot.  Neither one of them were ever taught proper pitching mechanics.  The result has been obvious.  It's too late in the game to change either one of them.  Best case scenario would be to make the stronger of the two a middle relief pitcher and the other a one or two inning closer.  I would never start either one of them again.

I think they would have to be rooting for Notre Dame if they want another shot at Ohio State.\n\nIf USC wins, that should move them ahead of Michigan in the BCS standings.
No Plummer proved he can play well this past weekend against the Colts, now he just has to stay consistent and win- Cutler played well in preseason but he wouldn't be able to win like Plummer can\n\n(By the way- Darrent Williams killed the Broncos vs. the Colts- he couldn't cover Wayne)\n\nGo Broncos!

What I know is that lifts in ice dancing differ from those in pair skating because the man may not extend his hands above his head, and acrobatic lifts are generally frowned upon. The more change of direction, flexibility, and height in the lift, the greater amount of points a team can earn from the judges under the new code of points scale.
Well, first I'll eliminate teams I think that wont make the playoffs. The Vikings will most likely finish 8-8, the Falcons have dug themselves a hole and I think its too deep to get out of, the Eagles arent contenders without McNabb, and the Niners have their three toughest games on the road with 5 games left. \n\nSo I see the Rams, Panthers/Saints, and Giants battling for the NFC wildcards.\n\nWith the way the Giants are playing right now, I dont see them standing much of a chance with their tough schedule left. If they get back to playing Giant football and come out and beat Dallas next week, theyre right back in the mix. If they lose that game, count them out.\n\nThe Rams have been choking, but might have saved their season yesterday vs the Niners. I see them going 4-1 in their final 5 games and clinching a spot in the playoffs at 9-7.\n\nI think Carolina will actually finish 10-6 as well as the Saints and end up winning the tie breaker over the Saints. Giving the Saints the other wild card.\n\nAs for Seattle, Shaun has to get back on the horse and get some yards to help Hassleback get into a groove. If Shaun and Hassleback are banged up like they have been all season, I wouldnt be suprise if they ended up forfeiting the NFC West to St.Louis or San Fran and missing out of the playoffs.

Have you ever thought of looking on ebay for micheal schumacher stuff as that is a reliable source.

That is a fairly solid team you have.  You are kind of thin at WR IMO....at could use a little help there.  \n\nMaybe you could trade one of your QB's and a WR (besides Wayne) for an upgrade at that postion.

Bynum is for real ladies and gentlemen. Sorry Kwame and Mihm fans but Bynum will be the starting center for our team this season. I am very proud of how Bynum and my man Lamar played today, they did some pretty shit out there. \n\nBut lets make this very clear, once I come back from this stupid injury, our offense should involve ME and only ME! I don't care about the triangle! I am the only one deserving to shoot the ball and my teammates better be cooperative and they should pass the ball to ME everytime they touch it or i'll let them here it. Anyway, I predict a very wonderful season for ME and I assure my billions of fans that I will win the scoring title easily. So keep on worshipping ME like I'm your God cuz I will surely reward you by shooting the ball even more. Peace!
That´s because most of the foreign coaches in Mexico are from Argentina, and also coaches from that contry view football in a different way. Thay usually are successful coaches, and also it is suppossed that foreign coaches are better than local ones. I would prefer an european coach.

Yeah if you go back for your masters I guess technically you could....Chris Weinke type deal and the same rules apply to each division.

You got it right.  Bulger without question.  Arizona's defense is not that good and this should be a shoot-out.  Don't forget that Arizona can't run the ball so they are going to pass and pass often.\n\nAs far as Eli goes, the G-men are in dissaray right now and Eli looks horrible.  \n\nGood luck this week.
I have Eli too...I think I would go with Rivers this week to see if Eli does better...cause he has been going down hill. Eli had -4 points last week and few points is better than negative or no points any day...
"The email I just received from WWE has the presale password as ""Champion"""
Your leaning towards the right guy!\n\nMJD is second behind F Taylor, and the fantastic week he just had, I think Taylor is going to continue seing the most plays in that team.\nWilliams is playing behind D Foster, also a good starter. And Williams isn't a good play this week, not strong enough or consistent enough. \nRhodes is playing behind an emerging Addai, but they both have about the same number of Carries. And the same low number of TD's. And I think they have to play it a bit safer this week with Philly, and run the ball more, so I think Rhodes and Addai will split the carries.\nSO out of your 3 second RB's I think you should pick Rhodes. \nYou should get the most out of him this week.\n\nGood Luck!
The last time Southern Cal played Ohio State was in September of 1990.  USC won 35-26.  USC has won the last five meetings and leads the overall series 11-9-1.
I agree with your concept and aggravation towards PETA, but your terminology puts us hunters in a bad light.

The Vikings Def has been making most of the points for the team .... they should be able to something big this week... had a bad game last week... ( if they had score one TD they would have won that game)\n\nGiants Def will be having a tought time against the bears ... so your best choice this week is the Vikings\n\nGood Luck....

Interesting question, there are a few things to consider.\n\n1. Australia seem to be testing players in certain positions.  In the spring/autumn test series they have shown players cannot play in certain positions.\n\n2. New Zealand seem to fall short of their postential in World Cups.  They won the first RWC, but have failed to win any others.  Some will say they were poisoned in South Africa in 1999, but there is no evidence of this.\n\n3. What stage of the tournament Australia meets New Zealand (Al Blacks).  If it is in a semi final, NZ may have peaked too early, and are starting to fade.\n\nFor Australia to beat New Zealand the three things above need to happen.\n1. Australia finds depth for their squad, especially in key areas.\n2 & 3. New Zealand peaks too early and the team is starting to fade for the semi finals.
give us a clue what do you want to know
That will depend on how willing managment is to get some talent for him (i.e. healthy pitchers!). He will work his magic and make them better than last year simply because the team flat out quit on Baker and he should have a healthy Derrick Lee (and that should give him 10-12 wins over this years team alone). A healthy Lee and Ramirez in the middle of the order makes any manager better!
You should take Thomas Jones over Anthony Thomas. The Bears aren't stupid & they'll go back to their roots, which is running the football. The Giants D doesn't look like a good pick this week either, since the Bears will want to slaughter them to show the rest of the NFL they are the best team in the NFC. The Pats D is facing a very beatable Jets team, and therefore, you should start Pats D & T. Jones.

ok, this should put it into prespective for both of you.  granted i know sooooo much about sports.  \nit is defenetly a close game, and not just because YOU say so.  it is a close game, because it is tied.  get it?  you tie a shoe to close the gap.  otherwise the shoe will come off.

"This is his third season as manager, his seventh year since finishing a one-year jail sentence. He came to Bridgeport as a player, looking for a second chance. He had lost his wife and several years of his life -- he'd last appeared in the majors in 1995 with the California Angels -- but he discovered a team, and a league, desperate for players with recognizable names.\n\n""We had some concern about whether he would really work out for us,"" Bridgeport owner and founder Mickey Herbert said. ""But, from the time he came in here, he was a veteran. We were really surprised about how he chose to counsel the younger ballplayers, especially because, at first, he wasn't in any kind of coaching capacity.""\n\nIn February 2003, manager Duffy Dyer left the team. He'd been offered a scouting job with the New York Mets. Suddenly, the Bluefish had Lind, and Lind had a chance he'd never really expected.\n\nMinor league baseball returns to Bridgeport for its eighth season; it’s been a smashing success as part of the city’s renaissance, which includes the arena opened next door.\n\nAn Atlantic League team (independent), the Bridgeport Bluefish play in the 5,300-seat stadium called Harbor Yard, which is a family-friendly, well-staffed and well-maintained operation. The park is between Main and Water streets, just south of I-95 and right near the train station and the ferry slip.\n\nThe Bluefish are managed by Jose “Chico” Lind, a former Golden Glove winner with the Pittsburgh Pirates. The park has a picnic area that groups of 24 to 250 may reserve and the games feature the kind of fan-friendly goings-on between innings that are so cherished in minor league baseball.\n\nGames will start at 7:05 Monday-Saturday, at 1:35 on Sunday. The season gets underway April 28 against Long Island and there will be fireworks every Friday and a host of special promotions including the popular ""Sundae Fun Day Run Day."" The season continues through mid-September:-)"

The Mets need pitching. Especially since Pedro and many others on the Mets' pitching staff currently have injuries. There is a bidding war right now so no one knows will get him. Honestly, I see him going somewhere with big potential for a Japanese market. Seattle, anywhere in California, or NY.

"That's a good question, and even though I'm American, I'm still not offended, since I don't think that the US is the center of the world. (Also, I hate baseball.) However, in response to your remark about Americans lacking culture, all I have to say is that I bet you really enjoy listening to our music and watching our movies and TV shows. (By the way, why is it that you Brits watched more ""Baywatch"" than we Yanks ever did?)"

Personally, I prefer the athleticism of the men's game.  \n\nIt's not that there aren't plenty of skilled female players, it's just that they can't match the men on the athletic side of things.  The men's game is faster, with everything happening at a much quicker pace.  The fundamentals sometimes suffer, but the speed of the overall game is so much higher than that of the women's game.  The women's game has some good passing and team play, but the level of athleticism isn't even close.  It's nothing to do with dunking, really. \n\nI've seen the same thing in hockey, where the women's game just doesn't move as fast as the men's game.  That's why women's basketball has virtually no shot of being able to stand on its own, without having the NBA supporting it.

Its too late in the season to turn to Cutler as someone suggested. Turning to him now could ruin the playoff chances depending on his play. Too big of a risk. Plummer played well against the Colts, he played well against the Pats, those are the only real threats the Broncos have in the playoffs because nobody else is going to score against their defense. The Broncos can still go to the Super Bowl with Plummer, just dont expect him to get the MVP trophy if they win.

Tennis is played the least among teenage girls. Why? Because they can't talk to their friends during play, like they can during basketball and soccer. Anyway, if you can get a group of non-players to start together and then get them to commit to the same time  every few days, that is a start. Have some music for them ( but not too close to the serious or seasoned players ). They can wear cool clothes, stay  or get thinner/stronger/muscle toned, and have posters of Federer, Nadal, Sharapova and Kournikova around.  You will need to give them racquets.  As for adults, again a group of beginners  ( so they aren't intimidated by better players ), maybe some hors d'oerves and wine once a week, clinics just for them. Stress the inexpensive aspects of tennis compared to other sports. Adults can start to play ANYTIME in their lives, as opposed to other sports that require a starting age during childhood.  MAKE THEM FEEL IMPORTANT. The pro as my club is so laid back that no one thinks he is serious about tennis at any level. He moves the court around from one clinic to the next confusing the newbies, arrives late, is unorganized, and does not seem grateful to these people for investing their time and money into a sport HE is supposed to making a living at and serving as an ambassador for, at the same time.  You can also try and get newbies to pro or college tennis so they can see how much fun it is and how the game is supposed to be played.

They have had a decent team for two years now and went to a bowl last year. You have to remember where they were only 3 years ago and where they are now: a Top 25 Team. Were they a little overraated at #7 (depending on which poll you believe) maybe but are they a legit Top 25 team: YES!!!!! And i'm no fan but they did beat Louisville which is no pushover. I think they will drop out of the top 10 but not as low as 22 . I say 14.

Until recently it was WWE because of the Superior graphics and roster, now all of the older wrestlers are leaving either cos there injured or because they haven't been given any real title chances. Vince has concentrated on the wrestlers he already had rather than bringing in new talent. John Cena was a panic buy, lets face it the only reason he was brought in so fast was because the story lines where getting stale. TNA is now the best place to watch true wrestling talent and anyone who doesn't think so needs to watch The Bound For Glory pay per view line up. There wrestlers are allowed to create new moves and be daring which is far more entertaining than watching yet another overly muscular wrestler from the WWE fight another overly muscular wrestler. TNA build up story lines and keep them going.\n\nI have to say after been a fan of WWE for over 10 years i am disappointed with their latest offerings.

Let me say this: Shoeless Joe Jackson was an innocent man. I have read books about him, and he:\n1. Declined the money offered to him by gamblers, and a teammate came in and threw it on his bed.\n2. Told Charles Comisky about it, but he said he didn't care, because Jackson was illiterate.\n3. He asked his manager to bench him for the series when all else failed, he wasn't.\n4. He went on to have one of the best world Series ever, batting .400, making no errors, and hitting the only Home Run in the Series.\n\nSo to answer you question, yes, I do think Joe should be reinstated, because he was one of the best hitters in history. He is the only rookie to hit .400, and he had the 3rd best career average when he was kicked out.
i don't like notre dame, but for an objective opinion, brady quinn did look good.  he had 3 TD passes and 0 interceptions.  yes, that run was spectacular.  didn't know he had that kind of mobility.  most of his passes were on the money, but his receivers dropped some crucial passes (not brady's fault)
they are paying way too much money for this guy, they just payed $42 million dollars just to negotiate a contract with him, he is going to be the highest payed player in the league next year, the red sox could sign several pitchers of this guys caliber or better with the money they are paying the lions (the team which he plays for right now) and Matsuzaka, after all is said and done, the money they are dumping on this guy could be used to sign 3 of the top free agents like zito, clemens, and pettite\nthis guy is a great pitcher........in Japan, he has yet to face any of the top hitters such as Pujols or Ortiz, if and when he pitches in the MLB, he is going to be suprised he will be pitching against better hitters with a whole lot more power and in front of much larger crowds, i dont think he will be bad but he certainly wont be as good as the money the red sox are going to pay him\n\nthe red sox put a bid of $42 million dollars (which goes to the Lions) for the opportunity to negotiate a contract with him, then they have to negotiate a contract with Matsuzaka so they are shelling out a ton of money, he is not definitely coming to the red sox but the only team in the MLB he is able to go to is the red sox this season, if the red sox and matsuzaka cant come to terms, then the red sox get their $42 million dollars back

oui, derriere la boite à gants.
Pro Wrestling, or what I prefer to call 'Entertainment wrestling' is a planned match where the outcome is pre-determined. However, Pro Wrestling isnt entirely 100% fake.\n\nFake is not the right work to describe it, it is called a 'work'. This mean you are working with your opponent (and referee, etc) to keep the crowed entertained. WWE's style of entertainment is really crap compared to the smaller promotions. Japan is best for Pro Wrestling in my opinion.\n\nAnyway, there are matters and scenarios which can be considered real in Pro Wrestling. Although a match is pre-determined and you are not purposely hurting each other, there are going to be occassions where punches, kicks, slams connect.\n\nAlso take for example the bumps the wrestlers take. People dont see it like this because they think the ring is 'apparently' very soft and cushy. Nothing can be further from the truth. The mats are not as comfy as you think and when getting bodyslammed and clotheslined to the ground it really does take its toll on your body.\n\nOn another note, wrestlers are not just doing 1 or 2 matches a week, they are wrestling practically EVERYDAY meaning they get no time to heal. This is why wrestlers resort to painkillers or other forms of 'enhanced performance' drugs.\n\nSure, Pro Wrestling isnt 100% real, but the case of getting hurt or injured is highly likely.... even dangerous things can happen. Steve Austin has broke his neck for example because of a piledriver by Owen Hart.\n\nFor those people that says wrestling is 'fake' is okay with me, but until you get in the ring and do 2 matches everyday for 2 weeks, you wont truely understand the beatings and the dangers that I have been through.  --- THAT WAS JUST 2 WEEKS ---\n\nI use to do the Pro Wrestling stuff, and I decided to leave it because the business itself is a lying, backstabbing peice of crap! I am confident to say that the WWE isnt all as nice as it makes out, even Vince McMahon!! It is all about greedy promoters making money, and unfortunately the wrestlers that make good money for the company are the crappy ones!!!\n\nAlso, in todays Pro Wrestling, it is more about gimmicks, high flying - high risk crap. The 'art' of Pro Wrestling is nearly dead, and that is the sort I favour (look into Japan guys!!!). Today, I do the real Submission Wrestling/Cage fight training stuff and today I dont disrespect the Pro Wrestling, pre-determined stuff. Pro Wrestlers go through hell just to entertain, and although I class them crazy, I give them respect also.\n\nPro Wrestling may not be real, and the Pro Wrestlers itself may not be real.... \n\nI dont like how the Pro Wrestling system is run, but I do respect the wrestlers and what they do... and I take my hat off for what they do to their bodies!!
Tell me whos in it and I'll choose one ...;

There's not a lot you can do about it. Diving dehydrates the body which, in turn, causes that dry, yucky taste after you dive. The only thing I can recommend; chewing gum. Especially sour apple gum. It will cause you to salivate and gets rid of the taste. And drink plenty of water!!!
To have a good chance of making your cheerleading squad (at any level), your first order of business must be to get in good shape. While it may not be obvious that cheerleading involves an awful lot of work, over the course of a game or a competitive routine, cheerleaders require enormous cardiovascular stamina and a good deal of strength. Before you try out, follow our pointers to develop the most important physical aspects of the activity. \nStamina\nStrength\nFlexibility\n\nStamina\n\nPerhaps the key physical requirement for cheerleading is stamina. When performing a competitive routine, you will expend an enormous amount of energy; but well before any competition, cheerleaders will practice their routines countless times, over and over. To practice at this kind of level - which is crucial to developing the necessary precision -- you will have to be in great aerobic shape.\n\nThere are a number of things you can do to improve your endurance, but perhaps the best is to participate in a sport. Training for training's sake is very difficult to do, but taking part in a fun game is much easier. So while you can take up jogging or suffering through the Stairmaster, organized athletics are a great option too. Soccer and basketball are excellent team sports that will get you in great shape pretty quickly. Sports like racquetball, tennis, and squash can also be quite demanding, if you play against strong competition. If you take the easy way out, you're only hurting your own chances, so be sure to push yourself a little no matter what activity you choose.\n\nWhen you have chosen an aerobic activity, begin by training for around 30 minutes a day, three days a week. You won't get in great shape in a few days, but killing yourself at the start won't help either. Choose a manageable regimen like we have below, focusing on increasing the amount of time you train each week. To start, try a program such as this:\n\nTime Activity Frequency \n30 minutes Light jogging or energetic walking. Twice during the week & once on the weekend. \n\nWork toward but don't go beyond:\n\nTime Activity Frequency \nOne hour Stairmaster, treadmill, or organized sports. Three times during the week & twice on the weekend. \n\nUltimately, your stamina will allow you to coast through the rigors of tumbling runs, elaborate lifts, and frenetic dance routines.\n\nStrength\n\nAn often overlooked asset to any cheerleader is strength. Whether you are a base, whose job is to lift other cheerleaders and to support pyramids, or a flyer, who climbs atop these constructions, you'll need to be able to lift yourself and others into the air. Top-flight cheerleaders are built much like Olympic gymnasts, with powerful lower bodies for tumbling and jumping.\n\nThe best way to add strength training to your workout regimen is by incorporating modest weights. So, for instance, if you spend time on the Stairmaster or jogging, consider holding light free weights in your hands. Even small amounts of weight will add muscle to your arms when you add this resistance over a high number of repetitions. Do not, however, add weights to your feet, ankles, or legs during aerobic exercise, as these can place injurious strain on your important supporting joints. The best way to add strength to your lower body is to perform targeted and individual repetitions on weight machines. \n\nThese days, every decent gym has several machines designed solely to strengthen the lower body. Work this equipment into your routine, but concentrate on controlled movements during your workout. Adding a ton of weight, but then swinging it around with momentum is not going to help. Choose a lighter weight that you can slowly and carefully raise and lower; this will provide the resistance training most beneficial for cheerleading.\n\nStrength training is particularly important for male cheerleaders, as they are usually the ones lifting people onto their shoulders or tossing people into the air.

I'm sure there are although I don't know the area. Best bet is to look in the local newspapers. You should find all the local teams there. Good luck.
Hello\n\nI think she will win her first event soon, she is still very young and there is always a lot of media hype around her so its still pretty distracting to her.

The best site for both is Wagerline.com it has every sport just pick a sport go to scores and matchups and pick either consensus or expert opinion. I used to use maddux and other experts sites but now I just use wagerline and I find it to be much better. The experts on wagerline.com are people like us but at least they it shows there record for that specific team. For example wagerline.com has experts for every team they are ranked from #1 to #10 there ranking is based on there record with that team. They also have consensus picks which are not that bad either it shows out of about 500 or more people where there betting. The best thing about it is that it is free and you don’t have to pay like all those experts websites. When I used the expert’s sites they were wrong have of the time anyways. Also covers.com isn’t a bad site either
He fought Carlos Baldomir. Mayweather beat Carlos Baldomir. The fight was a bigger shutout than any of the experts had predicted. The scores were 120-108, 120-108 and 118-110. Mayweather captures the WBC welterweight title with the win.\nWatched the fight and it was all Mayweather. He's just so good and can't think of anyone who could beat him right now.

Tie knots in the rope a couple of feet apart, it makes it easier for your hands and feet to hold onto. Mountains are a lot harder, practice climbing the rope first, with it tied to a branch. That way you don't fall as far!
I know everyone is cheering for the underdog, but I think Louisville is going to win this game pretty easily.  Their run defense looked bad last night, but they do have one of the country's better defenses, and I think they'll manage to score 25+ points against Rutgers.\n\nI'd love to see Rutgers pull an upset, but I wouldn't call on it.  I'll take Louisville by 12 points.
"It's actually called camber (I think) as the same principal is used when producing snow skiis.  According to wikipedia: ""In skiing, the curvature in the base of a ski.""\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski\n\nBasically it's built on the premise that once you step onto the board, then by virtue of your body weight, you are guaranteed to have the entire board touching the snow.  Plus, it helps while you carve your turns."
Personally, I don't think Wlad could have competed in the golden eras of heavyweight boxing. That's not his fault though. He is the best out there now and I would love to see him knockout (or at least knock down) Valuev. That might take out a lot people in attendance! He does have a questionable chin, but I think he is tough. He has the best trainer in the business and could unify the belts if given the opportunity. Unfortunately, thanks to Don King, I don't think it will happen.

I hate the Blackhawks with a passion, but that logo/colors are the best in all of sports, no contest. I think ESPN voted it the best logo in all of sports. ESPN, for God sake's!

barry mcguigan was a boxer, not a snooker player.
never heard of one.
You really cant go wrong with either, however, I would go with gore against a soft St Louis defense.  Philly has lost McNabb to an injury and Garcia is not a good option for Westbrook.
this is 100 percent conspiracy as long as chapell is there he will do anything to keep ganguly out he has ego problem
Farve is past his prime. Hasselbeck will dominate this game.

"well, teams don't really need to start a C and there is a strategy used by some to have the fewest number of ""big men"" in play per week...they'll just give away 1 category to focus more on the others.....\nso, pretty much it's one of two things...either they are quite skilled and know how to work the system to gain as many points, or as big a lead, as possible in one specific category.....\nor....\nthey are idiots and can't figure out how to set their lineup or have already quit the league...\n-nny"
I think you already answered the question in your answer.

Look, if you need PIM's, getting a goon defencemen is your best choice. Leave the scoring to the forwards and the PIM's to your defencemen. You got the right idea with Witt, I have him on my team for the exact same reason and am killing 15 other friends in my rotisserie league.
Unfortunately, the Giants have no cheerleading squad since the team feels it would take away from the overall gameday experience.  The Jets don't have them, either.  I read recently that Mayor Bloomberg wants the Giants to have cheerleaders so he can bring them along for GI visits to the troops in Kosovo.  So all we can hope for is a fan petition of some sort to change this.\n\nI know that it can get Arctic cold at the Meadowlands, so they'd have to be in full-on Eskimo gear for some games.
Oh yeah there must be tons of em out there.....
arsene wenger is not a very good example to his players he acted like a spoilt child so well done west ham but you will still be relegated unless you change your manager
i dont support southend, but congrats on a brilliant result, you will have had a few million behind you on tuesday. Freddie eastwood looks a good a player, and scored a superb goal, keep up the good work.

"Bound's hubby here:\n\nKahr T9 is very much on target. The plastic plug you see IS Marlin's trademark ""Bullseye"". \n\nYou can actually puchase a sling swivel kit manufactured by Uncle Mike's of Oregon (see link). The forward swivel mount actually clamps onto the magazine tube, no drilling required! \n\nWhen you drill the stock for the coarse screw, be careful! Make sure the stock is braced, and preferrably using a drill press with a bit slightly smaller than the coarse thread screw, drill a hole about 2"" from the heel of the butplate! Roll the coarse thread screw in a bar of soap to slightly lube the screw, and hand screw the coarse thread screw into the stock. \n\nIf you have reservations about possibly damaging your stock, take it to your gunsmith who will drill the hole for you. Some 'smiths will actually install the swivel mounts at no charge if you purchase the swivel mounts from him!\n\nGood luck!"
depends on who you are talking about
Carlile Holiday he is currently a WIDE RECIEVER for the Arizona Cardinals. He was replaced at ND by a young man by thename of Brady Quinn. Who you may of heard of.
to make it simple the national anthem is sung to represent the country.the other anthem(Ireland's call) is sung to represent rugby,its like new Zealand hakka! hope it answers your question!
As of 4:47 left in the 4th quarter there were only 5 different people with catches. When they were good you would see 7 if not more people catch the ball a game. Special teams failed. The defense has been figured out. Its time to start getting a different gameplan going. McNabb being out only magnifies the problems on this team.

On the pound for pound list I would rank Paquiao second to Floyd Mayweather
He a must start every week ... \n\nwith Morris as RB they will have to pass to make the big plays... Jackson is the Stud of the team ... Start him unless he is hurt \n\nGood Luck
Best choice is Marc Bulger...\n\nBulger throws the ball a lot more and has been throwing the ball and getting TD's \n\n\nThis week ATLANTA is playing Cleveland ... Vick should do ok... but he wont do as well as Marc Bulger...\n\nBest start this week is Marc Bulger ....\n\nGood Luck
It's a big outdoor bar/party with a HUGH screen TV. Good times.
Pressureless tennis balls have solid, rubber cores, in contrast to air-filled tennis balls. Pressureless tennis balls are long-lasting since there is no air inside them to escape, but do cost more. They do need to be replaced eventually when the felt wears out.
RUN, RUN, AND RUN  SOME MORE. BASKETBALL IS A GAME THAT ABSOLUTELY DEMANDS THAT YOU BE IN THE BEST SHAPE POSSIBLE. SOME DRIBBLING WOULD ALSO BE HELPFUL, ESPACIALLY WHEN YOUR OUT OF BREATH.

Hmm... the techniques in badminton.... 1st of all, you shoul master the basic footworks such as the v-front, v-back, side to side and defense.... also you also need to implement it during the game... It may take some time.... but it's worth it... footwork is the most important of all....
UNIVERSITY OR CINCINNATI ALL THA WAY....WHOOOO
"if you know how to swim you should try it on a low diving board because you will stand less of a chance getting injured, i would not suggest doing flips on a trampoline or beds if you are nervous about getting injured.  When you go to do a flip, either forwards or backwards (forward is easier for older people to learn because they feel safer going forward, but if you are younger than a backflip is easier because you can see where you are landing)  you should try jumping a little and then when you decide to flip, jump harder while going up lift your hands way above your head straight up to ""set"" yourself, then get into a tuck position and pull your arms down in the direction you want to spin.  Keep your eyes open so that you will know when to land and you will also stand less of a chance of rotating to the side and crashing on your side.  \nIf you dont like swimming you can go on to a trampoline, but make sure you have a friend around.  this way i would suggest learning a front flip first.  to do this jump a few times and then go on to your hands and knees hard and tuck and flip that way.  As you begin to get comfortable flipping like that go to your knees only and flip, then when your comfortable with that flip standing, but always make sure you set when your hands dont begin on the trampoline so you dont go crashing down.  The aforementioned should land on your bottom.  Only after you are comfortable do this and land on your bottom should you try to learn how to do it with a standing landing (when you land standing put your hands up like you see the gymnasts on tv so you dont overrotate and get hurt).  After you get the hang of standing and landing standing in one spot with your hands up you can see if a friend can spot the middle of your back (just enough so you dont crash on your head) while you try to learn to do a backflip, it should come easily.\nAfter you get how to do a backflip on trampoline comfortably, try in on less springy apparatuses and work your way to harder surfaces.  When you get the hang of this you can try running with a thin gym matt (like what they use at school) next to the wall.  For that you have to run very fast right before you hit the wall and the rest is just like the normal backflip.\nGood luck!!! Just be careful."
All things that happened was really very bad.\nBut I would like to appreciate the role of media for bringing it into notice.

"I think the reason ND keeps the ""patsies"" on their schedule is to be assured of at least a 9-3 record every year. ND and their fans beat their chests and say we only have been beaten by USC, UM, & OSU, but don't talk much about the ""big"" victories of ND and the mighty Quinn."

61 bouts\n56 wins\n5 losses\nOnly losses :Joe Frazier, Ken Norton, Leon Spinks, Larry Holmes, Trevor Berbick\nThe left jab, combinations, and incredible speed and footwork.\n\nHe had classics with Joe Frazier. His greatest bouts were against Sonny Liston I, George Foreman, and he had good battles with Ken Norton - probably his toughest opponent next to Joe Frazier.\n\nAli was the first heavyweight to regain the title on 3 separate occasions. And for the guy (smalltd28) who said Ali was not the greatest pound-for-pound ever, I respect your opinion, but that's crazy to say that. I'd say 95% of the people you ask will say Ali was the best pound-for-pound. Take away the last two losses late in his career and you'll see that he avenged the other three losses.

"The Ashes is a Test cricket series, played between England and Australia - it is international cricket's oldest and most celebrated rivalry dating back to 1882. It is currently played approximately biennially, alternately in England and Australia. The Ashes are ""held"" by the country which last won a series and to ""regain"" them the other country must win more Test matches in a series than the country that ""holds"" them. If a series is ""drawn"" then the country holding the Ashes retains them. The last Ashes series was played in England in 2005 when England regained The Ashes after a gap of 16 years by winning the series 2-1. The next Ashes series will be in Australia in 2006-07 and the next series in England will be in 2009.\n\nThe series is named after a satirical obituary published in The Sporting Times in 1882 following the match at The Oval, in which Australia beat England in England for the first time. The obituary stated that English cricket had died, and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia. The English media dubbed the next English tour, to Australia (1882-83) as the quest to regain The Ashes.\n\nA small terracotta urn was presented to the England captain Ivo Bligh by a group of Melbourne women at some point during the 1882-83 tour. The contents of the urn are reputed to be the ashes of an item of cricket equipment, possibly a bail, ball or stump. The urn is not used as a trophy for the Ashes series, and whichever side ""holds"" the Ashes, the urn normally remains in the MCC Museum at Lord's because of its age and fragility] Since the 1998-99 Ashes series, a Waterford crystal trophy has been presented to the winners.\n\nIf you want to know more about Ashes Series, please check the following website:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ashes"

MJD.\n\nThat little dude is always getting the ball.  They trust him a ton in the passing game, which is a huge asset to Garrard.  \n\nIt wouldn't suprise me to see him with 100 all purpose yards and a TD, even with Fragile Freddy taking most of the carries.  He had a huge fumble last night, so that's another reason to consider MJD -- possible goalline work.
Henry would be my #1 as I feel that NYG's D is still too badly beat up to be worth anything.  Keep Henry in the lineup, they are still banged up and he's on a hot streak again.\n\nAddai would be my 2nd choice, not because Alexander isn't great but I think his foot is bothering him.  He couldn't make any cuts against the Niners last week, which is concerning.  Also Addai is the goal line back right now and his receptions also help.
To the person who said Derek Jeter sucks, in a post not even related to whether he was good or not.\n\nYou obviously know nothign about baseball. First off, the man was second in baseball in batting average. He is also a much better defensive SS than the writers make out to believe just because the writers hate the Yankees. He is also the captain on the most winningest team in sports history. Any team in baseball would take Derek Jeter if they had the chance, how many other players can you say that for? Not many, not even A-Rod gets that kind of recognition anymore because of his post-season performance as of late. Derek Jeter is damn good and is going to be in the Hall of Fame when he is done. \n\n'Nuff said\n\nand as for the post...I'm going to assume 11.5 or 12, thats what most middle-infielders use in HS, College, and the Pros.
I would go with Jones against the Vikings defense \nAddai has to go up against New England's tough running defense

Charlotte Bobcats. There defense core is awful. They dont have any solidified defenders. The only one close is Okafor. He can block pretty good but they just dont have any good defensive weapons. Ethier do they have offense. But I dont think he will drop 81 on anyone this year. He said he wont shoot as much which I think is insane because if you have as much talent and skill as he does, why wouldnt you use it in the game.

A good place to take children of 5 skiing in austria is Soll.It has plenty of nursery slopes but also the red runs are not too bad once they get a bit of confidence up.If she has had lessons already i don't think she would need another ski school in Soll because she probably just needs practice now.Good resort not too many on the slopes at one time,and not too rowdy at night either.Enjoy yourselves..Me and my family did two years ago there my daughters were 10 & 6.
"Watch the motorcycle ""Trader"" type newspapers for a used bike.  Dealers are going to charge more than you want to pay."
why does it have to be an organized team? just grab a pigskin and head out to the corner lot. start throwing the ball around, and running plays. other kids will be curious and want to join in. i played thousands of neighborhood pick-up football games growing up and always had a ball. 6 or 7 people per team is all you need. a quarterback, a couple of receivers, and a couple of lineman to block. you draw plays in the dirt, and instead of having to go 10 yards, you play 2 completed passes equals a first down, those are typical neighborhood rules here in the states. but both passes must be completed beyond the line of scrimage. you get 4 downs, just like in the NFL, but there are no field goals, oviously. punting is optional on 4th down, again, just like the NFL. this can be done after school, or on saturday afternoon, all you need is a ball, a grassy field(size of the field may vary), and 10-14 players. this is so much easier and fun than joining an organized team and going to practice, buying equipment, ect.

Money;  The NFL is obsessed with it and years ago they made all team apparel to be licensed under the NFL and if it isn't licensed, it can't be worn. \n\nCoach Nolan of the 49ers is the son of Dick Nolan, the former 49ers coach and Dick Nolan always wore a suit.  Nolan wanted to wear a suit in honor of his father and the NFL said no.  They then finally compromised and if it was made and licensed by the NFL then he could do it.  the No fun League strikes again.
Shimano sells the hydro brake levels and shifters separately, you're not forced to use the dual controls.  \n\nIf you have the XT dual controls and hayes separately, you will need to decide on which one to ditch out.  I have the Hayes HFX-9 on one bike, and on another some XT.  The XT have better modulation and stopping power than the hayes, so probably take that into account on which component to ditch out.  \n\nYou can get this LX lever from pricepoint for 145 bucks:\nhttp://www.pricepoint.com/detail/13892-035_SHILB5-0-Search--/Shimano-LX-M585-Disc-Brake-Lever-Set---Hydraulic.htm\n\nThe shimano brakes without lever can be from 80 to 110 bucks each (depending if they are LX, Hone, XT or Saint).  You need to add the hoses to consideration, and, generarily, Shimano sells the rotors in centerlock, so you might need to check if your wheels are centerlock or not (well, you're looking for a newer wheelset, you might take this into consideration), or buy the standard 6 bolt rotors separately (around 25 bucks each).\n\nA friend told me that maybe I could use some Magura Marthas brakes with my dual controls, since they use the same type of oil as Shimano, but I'm not sure on this.
Rutgers will not play in the title game even if they do win out.   They have had a nice season...but a title game is all  but mathematically impossible with the way the BCS is set up.
I support Liverpool and their rival is Everton. I can't say that I actually hate Everton, but I like having rivals because it keeps things fun and interesting. I've said this numerous times before, football is like life. And what is life without a few rivals? So yea, the competition and rivalry makes the game even more fun and enjoyable to watch.
Rex Grossman, you cannot have any clue on how Brady will do against the colts, the colts have no run defense and with maroney, dillon, and faulk, they will be running more then passing.
sure why not
Are you sure internet explorer pop up blocker is off?
before traylor, definitely no.  now, yes.  chester gets the ball a lot and hopefully minnesota can get something going.  i love lundy, but until he shows me a little more go with the guy who isn't getting touches hawked by a second RB.  Lundy will do better down the stretch with a great schedule but go with chester this week. and congrats on traylor going down at the right time for you.

Bound's hubby here:\n\nI would recommend a Remington Model 870 pump shotgun. Remington offers two different type of Model 870, the Express and teh WingMaster. \n\nThe 870 Express is an affordable entry level five shot, pump action shotgun. It has an alloy receiver, hardwood stock, and a phosphate/parkerized finish. You can generall find this model on sale at Dick's Sporting Goods for about $260 or with a bird barrel and a deer barrel for about $340.\n\nThe Model 870 WingMaster is a more traditional five shot, pump action shotgun. It comes with a steel receiver, blued finish and walnut stocks (it's prettier). The Model 870 WingMaster has been around since the early 1950's. It is durable, it is long lasting, it is reliable and it is fool proof. You can buy one (depending u[on grade) starting at about $600. \n\nI have had bad experiences in the past with the Mossberg line. I would not recommend one. The Winchester line that is currently being produced is very limited. \n\nI would recommend a pump shotgun (Remington 870, Browning BPS) over a semi-automatic because of safety versus experience level. Double barrel shotguns are good but limiting. A pump, using the plug, gives you a third shot as back-up that a double barrel just doesn't offer. I think single shot shotguns (unless it's the only thing you can afford) are severly limiting and shouldn't be counted on for hunting. \n\nGood luck.\n\nEDITED TO ADD: \nFor Randkl: I had a Mossberg Model 144 bolt blow apart on me while shooting standard velocity .22 long rifle ammunition in a match. The bolt handle separated, and the bolt backed half-way out of the receiver. Yes, it may have been a fluke, but it happened ... fortunately there was no physical injury ... but it DID happen! My gunsmith determined that it was a product flaw/quality control issue ... Perhaps this incident was isolated and not indicative of the Mossberg line ... but I consider myself fortunate ... and I do not wish to take another chance on Mossberg's products ... my choice ... I am not imposing it on anyone!\n\nAgain, Good luck!

"Not yet, but it looks that he is interested.\n-----------\nZidane wants to be Bangladesh coach\nBy UNB, Gazipur\nTue, 7 Nov 2006, 08:12:00\n \nOverwhelmed by the enthusiasm of the people of Bangladesh, visiting soccer superstar Zinedine Zidane Tuesday showed his keen interest to be the coach of Bangladesh national football team.\n...\nThey asked Zidane whether there is any possibility for him to play for the Bangladesh team, he said, ""I've no interest to play for the Bangladesh team, but I have interest in training up the team."""
the most famous one happened during the 1988-1989 English First Division season. both Arsenal & Liverpool level on points at the end of the season with 76 points but Arsenal win the league due to higher goals scored. both teams has the same goal differences of 37 goals.\n\nironically, the league championship was decided on the last day of the season when Arsenal beat Liverpool at Anfield. Michael Thomas scored the second goal to secure a 2-0 win to seal the championship.

Toughguy ~\n                   In my opinion, Sean wouldn't make it past the 6th round with Esteban. I really don't think Sean was strong enough to keep Esteban off of him. I liked the toughness O'Grady showed throughout his career, but it wouldn't be enough to stop DeJesus.\n\n                    Esteban clearly outboxed Roberto Duran in their first fight and dropped a young in his prime Duran who was one of the greatest lightweights of all time. O'Grady wouldn't last three rounds with a in his prime Duran. Esteban and Duran had completely different styles but the one thing that Esteban did have in common with Duran was his ability to knock one out going backwards, coming forwards, on the ropes of whatever the situation was he always had power.\n\n     Esteban would clearly outbox and out-muscle a young O'Grady, Sean would have his moments, but DeJesus would be too much.\n\n      Thanks for the question Toughguy.

Le Tour est si médiatisé parce que c'est la course qui réunit les meilleures équipes et les meilleurs coureurs du monde. Pour la Vuelta ou le Giro, seuls les espagnols et les italiens envoient leurs meilleurs éléments. Sur le Tour, les leaders de chaque équipe toute nationalité confondue sont présents.\n\nLe fait que la course se déroule en juillet est aussi un avantage pour ASO. Les spectateurs sont plus nombreux et les télespectateurs aussi. Pour les deux autres GT, il est difficile de les suivre quand on travaille. Donc il y a moins d'audience et la couverture médiatique stagne.\n\nDe plus, on entend souvent dire que c'est sur le Tour que se sont forgés les plus belles légendes. Et en général, je pense que l'on retient mieux les vainqueurs sur le Tour que ceux sur le Giro ou la Vuelta à long terme.\n\nEnfin, et çà il n'y a que toi qui pourra me le confirmer, l'objectif / le rêve de tout coureur n'est-il pas de remporter une étape sur le Tour ou mieux de s'y imposer?
i studied a few different martial arts over the years, heres some things i found that helped:\n\nknuckle pushups - you want to keep your wrists strong in a fisted position, like you'd have once you've grabbed someone's gi, only let your first 2 knuckles touch the ground. \n\nregular pushups -  you want the muscles on the inside of your wrists strong too. after a while, mix it up with fingertip pushups too.\n\nsledgehammer spins - get a sledge hammer (20 pounds or more) with a handle thats 2 feet long. hold it out in front of you, and with one hand (or both) grip the very end of the handle (with the hammer itself down) and try to rotate it in a clockwise motion. then, try counterclockwise. you wont be able to do it, but see how high you can lift it. your entire arms and chest will probably go nuts after you do that a few times, this helps strengthen everything when you'd do any type of twisting movement for grappling or throws.\n\nhorse stance squats - open a door in your house so that the door is outward (not closed, not against a wall). now, put your back against the edge of the door, and in a horse stance, do squats. try to keep your back straight so that its against the door, which means your back is totally vertical, you're not leaning in any direction.\n\nsoup cans - get a few large cans of soup or veggies in your kitchen, hold them out at your sides with your arms straight. just see how long you can go. every few days, try to add 5 or 10 seconds. your shoulders will hate you, but it works well.\n\ngood luck!
How bout them Cowboy's?!
The X-Division whould be a better place for him to start out at. He really could make a good impact there where the X-Division is as much of a main event as the Heavyweights. He then could move over to the WWE. As where the WWE stands right now, he could team up with his cousin Harry Smith. And in addition to that they could fued with DX just like the Hart Foudation did. The storyline pretty much would write itself. \n\nUnfortunately he has had opertunities with both businesses. He prolly will not be signed by the WWE because he didnt not see a lot that they could use him for. He also had a stinct in TNA but he had a bad attitude and TNA didn't tollerate it. So that is def a no. WWE has been known to sign people that I never would have imagined they would sign (both Hardyz for the second time was suprising to me along with Scott Hall in his NWO role). The chances are very slim still though that the WWE will hire him any time soon.
Getting mentally ready means to do just that.  Find someplace quiet and just think about the game.  Go over the plays in your mind.  Go over your position in your mind.  Anticipate the game in your mind.
Here are excerpts from the California Vehicle Code (VC) relating to your question: \n\nd) Every bicycle operated upon any highway during darkness shall be equipped with the following:\n\n   1. A lamp emitting a white light which illuminates the highway and is visible from a distance of 300 feet to the front and the sides of the bicycle. \n\n   2. A red reflector mounted on the rear of the bicycle and visible from 500 feet to the rear of the bicycle. \n   \n   3. A white or yellow reflector mounted on each pedal visible 200 feet to the front and rear of the bicycle and a white or red reflector on each side to the rear of the center of the bicycle, except bicycles which are equipped with reflectorized tires on the front and the rear need not be equipped with side reflectors. All reflectorized tires must meet DMV requirements. \n\ne) A lamp or lamp combination, emitting a white light, attached to the operator and visible from a distance of 300 feet in front and from the sides of the bicycle, may be used in place of a lamp attached to the bike.\n\nI've seen some cyclists with lights attached to their helmets. I think that would be better than one attached to the handlebars. You can also get the red lights for the back. Mine has different blinking settings. I didn't attach mine to the bike but clip it on my jersey or belt bag when it gets dark.\n\nGood luck and ride safe with a helmet!

WRONG WRONG WRONG!!! great question!!! Seneca Wallace is the better quaterback, of course Matt Hassleback is like a son to Holmgren and will continue to play until Holmgren finally gets fired, then Hassleback will become the next Kurt Warner jumping around from team to team so that they can transition in the rookie QB's in during that season...Hassleback is a complete moron, he makes horrible clutch desicions...SEATTLE HAS NEVER WON A GAME THAT HAS GONE TO OVERTIME WITH MATT HASSLEBACK AS THE QB...But Seneca Wallace, although I thought they should have moved him to WR, but he can move out of the pocket, has a stronger arm, has proven he does a better job checking off his WR always knows where the TE is...stuff that Hassleback repeatedly shows he can't do... So many times Hassleback gets sacked, but last year we had one of the best OL in the NFL it was just because when he couldn't find the way to hit his #1 target he'd check off to his #2 and bam sacked...Seneca has the ability to read the coverage get the notion before the snap that his #1 is gonna be blocked, so he doesn't waiste as much time watching the play develop and gives the #1 a chance to get open but if he doesnt he immediately spots the #2 WHILE he gets out of the pocket, and if #2 is covered he has the smarts to hit him, or bounce out  and scramble for a gain, or hit the TE!!! end of story
C'est mignon la vidéo, mais on ne pourra que la mettre dans des divisions où il y aura du fric, pas chez les amateurs...\ndonc l'argument de la vidéo, c'est un argument pour légitimer le système actuel, complètement pourri par le pognon...\nAprès comme toi, je trouve cela désolant que certains joueurs doivent en arriver à là, la seule chose que je vois, c'est que les arbitres aient un meilleur niveau, donc une meilleure formation...\np'tet ajouter un 2eme arbitre de champ pourrait être pas mal...\n\nPS : Celui qui pense qu'il n'y a que les Italiens qui plongent, qu'il regarde jouer plus souvent Malouda, ou qu'il regarde plus le foot en général, et on pourra en reparler ensuite du fait que seuls les ritals plongent...

"Tough Guy ~\n                     In my opinion, Joey gets Knocked out cold in less than 5 rounds. Joey was a real tough cookie back in the day, but he lacked the power to hurt and stop Herans. Herans being the much taller of the two would throw his right hand at will and catch Giardello every time he threw it. Joey was notorious for getting hit a lot.\n                    A little inside bit for you, Augie Semeca who use to be Charles Brewer's trainer and one time South Philadelphia Gym owner and I were talking a couple months back at Joe Hands Gym in South Philly about tough fighters from Philly and I brought up Giardello and about two minutes later Joey came walking through the door. He sat down and started talking to Augie and Augie introduced me to him, anyways to make a long story short and without pulling any punches Joey said ""I never trained, I'd be out with the boys all of the time, I didn't have time to train, there was too much going on. I was always a tough kid and could handle my own, but I never fully dedicated myself to the sport.""\n     Tommy's workouts with Steward at the Kronk Gym are legendary. I worked out at the gym before and it's always HOT in there no matter what time of the year you're there. Tommy worked the pads with Manny and it would resemble a actual fight. Tommy would hit the bag for a hour straight with only a minute rest between rounds. Milton McCory would often be heard saying ""That man aint right, alls he wants to do is train like a crazy man""\n     This would be the biggest difference in this fight Tommy would be able to go non-stop until he stops Giardello, don't get me wrong here, Joey wouldn't be a push over he'd crack Tommy with some good shots too, but it wouldn't be enough to keep Tommy off of him."

The All Blacks don't cheat! Even they admitted the first try on Saturday should have been awarded, the decision had nothing to do with them. The All Blacks have proved they are the best rugby team around at the moment and anyone who accuses them of cheating is simply a poor loser.
It's happened, Bo Bellino, Roger Staubach and David Robinson were drafted from service academies into the NFL or NBA, but they had to make arrangements to fulfill their 4 years of military service.  The Navy accomodated David Robinson by letting him work in supply.  I think Bellino and Staubach actually had to do their full service before reporting to the teams that drafted them 4 years later.

They were for a time.  The whole Matt Hardy/ Lita/ Edge storyline was based on actual events of Lita cheating on Matt.  Since then Lita has broken up with Edge.  It was this event that made all of the bandwagon people turn on Lita for her making a decision in her personal life.

I would wait a little bit to get on the Grossman bandwagon again until he performs better.
Good Question!!!\n\nThere is a very good possibility that the SA teams will in the near future not play Super 14 rugby anymore.

You should start Devery Henderson. Henderson will be Drew Brees's favorite target, and the #1 WR on the Saints(#1 Passing Offense in NFL) this week because M. Colston is day to day with an ankle injury and won't be 100% if he plays. New Orleans should have a big game passing wise against Atlanta(#29 ranked pass defense in NFL) The NO-ATL game will be filled with points, because both teams have top 10 offenses(NO-#1, Atl-#9) and poor defenses(NO-#17, Atl-#20). Expect really big fantasy numbers from Henderson in Week 12.
63 twice, then 62 just this year\n\n# 63 yards - Tom Dempsey, New Orleans Saints (W 19-17) vs. Detroit Lions, 11/8/1970\n# 63 yards - Jason Elam, Denver Broncos (W 37-24) vs. Jacksonville Jaguars, 10/25/1998\n# 62 yards - Matt Bryant, Tampa Bay Buccaneers (W 23-21) vs. Philadelphia Eagles, 10/22/2006\n\n(there was 65 yards pre-season kick, check Wiki for more info)

"He's not my favorite player, but I can't understand why anyone wouldn't want Barry Bonds on their team.  Even playing with the effects of injury last season (and possibly the loss of steroids), he still hit 26 homers and had a better on-base percentage than any current Tigers player.\n\nCalling him a loser because he's never won a World Series makes no sense, either.  When the Giants made it there in 2002, Bonds hit .471 with 4 homers and an amazing .700 OBP, so he's hardly to blame for not winning a title.  If anything, he should be given credit for turning some poor Giants teams into competitive outfits over the past couple of seasons.\n\nAnd as for being a poor teammate, it's not like his surliness should hurt anyone.  Sure, he might be a jerk, but baseball is also the least ""team"" among team sports, since 90% of the game is the duel between pitcher and hitter.\n\nYou don't have to like Bonds, but to dismiss him is just nonsense.  I'd love to have him on my team because he'd give them a better chance to win, and that's what the game is all about."

1 Yes punishment should be added, they should be punished athletically not just as people breaking a law. Oh you mean agreeing with the idiots and that I don't agree to. Sounds like you were listening to racists as hosts who think they are trying to do a favor.\n2. Proably not because face it you aren't going to see a guy excpelled from college for it. They should be punished and suspended from the team for a week or more.\n3. The bar should be punished but likely was in a college town and having been in those towns they don't always ID on Saturday nights. At least ones I've been to. I don't know maybe I looked old enough and my friends did but I think it is just what they do. Is it wrong? Sure, but it's buisness.
I think if girls feel that they can compete with guys, then they should be able to do it.
they move in second round not beyond it
well it partly depends on what grade ur in.. if 8th grade or soemthing 5'3 is fine, but if hs.. then it might get a lil tricky..\n\nok but watever. coaches may judge height, but they mostly look for skill (both defense AND offense). they usually tend to look more at offense, even though some claim that defense is most important. the reason for this is that it is harder to look good at defense than it is at offense (good defense = opponent not being able to score.. but its less obvious and less breathtaking than someone making a 3 or dunkin the ball, etc)\n\njump shot-- u need proper form first.. then practice for a while.. competitive practice is the best, try playing ur friends (who have decent defense) proper form = when u lift ur arm, ur elbow is at 90 degree angle.. always hold ur follow thru\n\nspin does indeed help ur shot, but u shouldnt really worry about that. spin comes naturally once ur get ur shot right \n\nto get better shot, work on ur triceps (work out). working out throws off ur shot, but once u practice and get it back its worth it. also, try to shoot under pressure with a friend as well\n\nsome of my favorite drills that i have done to become a great defender are = towel jump, lunges, and just jumping as high as u can. a bball and a hoop is really all u need for offense.. practice layups.. not just ordinary ones, but jump stop layups.. layups at full speed. and also work on both hands\n\nfor guarding, explosive side to side movements are ESSENTIAL. as i said before jumping and towel jump will help this greatly (towel jump = place towel on floor and jump side to side of it\n\nalrite good luck
I agree..that was the WORST call ever!! In the end it didnt matter anyway because the Pats still won. By the way, for you uneducated football fans out there that said the Patriots were all over the Bears- if the defender turns to face the quarterback and is also going for the pass, it is NOT interference.

I cannot believe people answered football(soccer) has timeouts...no it doesnt. it has half time...if someone gets injured or play is held up...time is added to the end of the half by the referee...called added time etc...so the game does not stop with timeouts at all...players try to waste time to get their breath...slow play for tactical advantage, and thats the only time it will stop...\n\n- hope this helps.

I think that if they can elevate him beyond his current role as whiny b*tch, and get him back to 'Terrell Owens' style heel he could rise up within 2 years. a decent IC level feud with Carlito, and one of them gets bumped up to World title, and the other follows, like HHH-Rock from a few years back.

No home run was hit in that game.\n\nThe first home run was hit by Ross Barnes of the Chicago White Stockings on May 2, 1876  against the Cincinnati Red Stockings.  (Charley Jones of the Red Stockings hit a homer later in the game for the 2nd home run in history.)
I'd check the waiver wire for better options like Devery Henderson (NO -subbing for Colston), Mike Furrey(DET), Mark Clayton (BAL), Chris Henry (CIN)... those guys are all healthy.\n\n\nStallworth between the other two, but who knows how the Philly offense will be this week.  They WILL have to pass to stay in the game, though.

J'ai été doublement étonné: d'abord il manque un peu son contrôle, et ensuite il envoie un énorme retourné acrobatique de l'extérieur du pied! ( rien que ça! )\nBref, c'est un chef d'oeuvre!
The first guys is dumb, of course Jones is a better back..thats cus Gates is a TE.. duhhhh!!!. take Gates for Jones ..if you're getting Gates cus he'll score more often then Jones. Barber is splitting time with Jones in Dallas and is getting more goalline carries.

All jerseys displayed the player's last name on the back side, though this practice did not become standard until the 1970s; it became mandatory in the NFL in the late 1970s. \n\nSorry I couldnt find the exact year...
they will win because of chad johnson
Last more then one season, for sure. Successful? That's a hard call. I mean they weren't trying to compete with the NFL but knew they couldn't get the top players. Hey the Arena league can have success so why couldn't another tackle league? When you saw what they were doing though it was kinda clear it wouldn't last. It wasn't about the game.
definantly, i think it shouldnt be a sport. All it is is 4 guys playing a game with a ball whilst a lot of guys just standing around waiting for the ball to come to them. It's nearly as boring as golf and it doesnt relax you as golf does.

Old school martial arts tend to say look at the eyes but as a mixed martial artist I would always say watch the chest/shoulder area as they tend to give movement away. My old Karate instructor (even after I left Karate) was positive that the eyes were the key until he & I gave Krav-Mega a go and he was suddenly converted as by watching the eyes with a faster martial art he kept missing the punches to his head etc :)
I'd go with Walker , Keyshawn, and Stallworth.
Personally, I believe alot of the face wrestlers get tired of being faces, he might be getting bored with his character. I wouldn't blame him, his face character isn't that appealing to today's crowd except to youth and teenage girls (mostly), because wrestling fans today don't want the boy scout face character nowadays like they did before with people like Hulk Hogan, fans nowadays are more realistic and like their face wrestlers to have more attitude than that, that is why The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin were so popular.  I am not a fan of John Cena, but I think that his wrestling character was the best when he was a heel or when he wasn't the top face. It is very possible that he doesn't like being the top face in the WWE, I mean it is alot of pressure to put on someone and alot of the past people who have had that spot have suffered either physically or emotionally because of it. I would like to see him turn face again. In fact, I know how it should happen. I think Randy Orton should win the Royal Rumble, face John Cena at Wrestlemania 23 for the WWE Title, and during it John gets frustrated that he is not able to beat Randy so he does stuff that makes him turn heel. Eventually Randy Orton would win the match and it would not only start a rivalry (which I think could become the next Austin-vs.-Rock), but also effectively have them switch places to where Randy is a face and John is a heel. I hope that answers your question.
I would rather mix it like the French, long passes like Sagnol can do when it's called for or the passing, passing, passing when you have the midfielders to carry the ball to the strikers like Zidane could do. As we saw at the WC, the Italians couldn't really do the passing style technique because the French defense was so great and most of the time stole the ball there.\n\nEdit: Good question by the way.
This is a tough one but i would go with Betts. \nHe will get more carries now that Portis is OUT. and he will continue to cathc balls out of the backfield with Cambell at QB.\nPrediction: Barber 36yrds  Rec.22yrds 1TD\n                  Betts    62yrds  Rec.50yrds 1TD

"No.\n\nThe actual organizations LPGA and PGA do not employ hypnotherapists, but each individual player may use their services.\nEach player is responsible for hiring his own caddy, coach, personal assistant, etc. \n\n\nBut they should becasue most professional sports employ professional theapists, or ""shirnks"" to help with their visualisation and to keep their minds on track when the going gets tough. Golf is especially a tough game because the ball doesn't move and you have to strike it and make it look good. There really is no excuse for missing it is there? I mean, nobody is throwing it at you at some incredible speed, or trying to hit you with it, or anything else. Golf is 80 percent a mind game where you have to overcome your own self-doubts, your own inner demons and your own known weaknesses. Nobody there to help you overcome those things is there?"

"Well if you have too many pockets it would become boringly easy to play.\n\nAs it is, there is one at each corner plus two more in the middle of the long sides.\n\nAs having more pockets would look obvious, many pool tables designed for pubs actually have oversized pockets - clever for two reasons.\n\n1. The games end faster as less precision is need to get the ball into the pocket. fast games = more games per hour = more money for the pub.\n\n2. The players think that they get their best performance at the ""grunt n' holler"" bar as opposed to anywhere else - so they tend to gravitate to the easier tables."

sort of shove it and at the same time flick your kickflip. your going to need to adjust by trial and error on this trick, by changeing the amount of force you put behind each leg. Dont pop really hard, you want control not height. Oh yeah and stay centered... thats really important. Honestly i cant say that i have to just in a certain direction to catch them though... they usually flip under me like a kickflip. so i guess its all about how you pop it for that. work on those shove its. they are important.

"Are you crazy!!!!!!??!?!?!!?  There are so many things wrong with this question, I don't even know where to start.\n\nFirst, since when does a 3-point win in a mudslop qualify as ""blew away""?\n\nAlso, a one-game winning streak is not ""on a roll"".  they are also 3-3 in their last six.\n\nThe Bears are a dominant team with one hiccup on their schedule (did you see what they did to the Giants?).\n\nLastly, please tell me that you are kidding about the Jet being in the Super Bowl.  Have you forgotten about the Colts?  Do you really think the Jets can sneak up on New England again?  The Jets are first-round losers even if they squeek into the playoffs.\n\nBottom line:  Bears will beat the Jets by double-digits."
I wasn't a NASCAR fan or racing fan at all, but a friend told me to pick a driver and follow him all season long.  Well, he was right, I picked Kenseth and having someone to follow has gotten me into the sport.  As to your question, a lot of things have to go his way, but having followed all season any thing can happen on race day.
Pats could win out against the Lions, Dolphins, Titans, Jaguars and Texans.  I would like to see them get a first round bye.  Another Super Bowl would be sweet.\nAs for the Red Sox, it's too early to tell how the 2007 season will shape up.  I hope they keep Manny, it would be great to see him spend the rest of his career with Boston and go to the hall of fame on the first ballot in around 2015.
It's become, more or less, a formality.\n\nUsually the weaker teams send a rider on a suicide run, mostly for publicity, but also in hopes that the peloton will not see the rider as a threat and let him win.\n\nDepending on the stage and how far into the race, the teams may cooperate to reel in the break or let it go.\n\nFor instance, during the first week of the Tour de France, sprinter teams will not let any breaks get away because it's their only chance to score wins. They must capitalize on that opportunity because the mountain stages are not suited for them. Similarly, the climbers lay low in the peloton until the race reaches the mountains. It is their only chance to win so they will not let any breaks get away to spoil their chances at victory.\n\nThat's not to say breaks are fruitless endeavors. Transition stages are great opportunities for attackers. Usually, these are the only stages breakaway riders get, and they are far and few in between. Sometimes, attackers get lucky and the peloton misjudge the strength of the breakaway, or the peloton refuse to cooperate. The 2006 TdF contains numerous examples of this.

I'm very mad that Tony is not in the chase because the only reason why he didn't make it in is because he got wreck by someone or got caught in a wreck when he was running good. Kyle Busch shouldn't have been in the chase period and Jeff Burton surprised me that he made the chase this year so those are two other reasons why Stewart didn't make the chase. These winnings for Stewart are good for the team for next year and I hope Denny Hamlin can win the nextel cup this year for Joe Gibbs Racing.

Bound's hubby here:\n\nAs you are aware the front post on the M14 is fixed. The left knob on the rear sight is your elevation and the right knob is your windage. \n\nOn the rear sight base, center the windage index marks with the receiver base. With your elevation knob, run the rear sight all the way down (twist the knob forward). Do not pay attention to the elevation calibrations on the elevation knob, 110% of the time they do not match. Now, raise the rear sight four clicks. The rule of thumb with the M14/M1A is that 4-6 clicks of elevation will put you on paper at 200 yards. \n\nThe elevation drum with the calibrations is typically calibrated for use with military M118 ammo (173 gr. FMJBT-full metal jacket boat tail). \n\nYour rifle will shoot best using either 150 gr. FMJ, 168 gr. HPBT, 173 gr. FMJBT, or 175 gr. HPBT bullets. You can adjust the index wheel, but what alot of shooters do is mark their zero with nail polish, it's alot easier. \n\nZeroing a rifle with the 25m target (1000 inch target) is generally reserved for use with the M16/AR15 because of the raised sight line.\n\nGood luck.
In the premiership a goal keeper would make more in a week than YOUR teacher makes in a year. But look at it this way you probably have the same amount of teachers as there are goalies in the premiership. How many schools are in your town and how many towns are in your country, so any tom, dick, or harry can be a teacher but you need to be something special to be a premiership goal keeper.

"Bound's hubby here:\n\nEmphatically, NO!\n\nFor two reasons!\n\nFirst, if you go to re-finish a firearm ... what people neglect to do is to machine down all of the surfaces that interact with each other, thereby reducing or destroying the part tolerances. Any finish added to a firearm requires an equal reduction of the firearm's bearing surfaces. You do not just throw on a finish.\n\nSecond ... many metals do not ""take"" a finish. Stainless, as used by most frearms manufacturers, is really quite durable. Its reflectiveness will be less than the reflective qualities of ""hard chrome"". \n\nMy recommendation is, if you want a firearm with a hard chrome finish, trade-in your stainless handgun and get what you really want.\n\nGood luck!"

If this question spawned from last night game in Seattle, it's because Seattle isn't used to getting snow. Just rain. About those other cities you listed, I don't know. That's a good question.

I don't think I've ever seen a football game called on account of the weather like baseball. You can play football in anything, snow, sleet, rain, mud, sun. It's all fun.

If the ref blows a play dead, then whatever happens after that does not matter no matter what.  The play cannot advacne any futher, even if it is blown dead at an incorrect time.  This is differnent from changing a call after a review, which takes place after the play has been completed and there was a valid result to look at.

Yes he had autism. Good for him.
If they're lucky with the Group E results (that could have them facing Ghana rather than Italy or Czech Rep) they could go as far as the semis.\n\nBut that's where the fairytale will surely end, as Germany is a likely opponent, and Germany will probably win unless they play as poorly as they did at last year's Confed Cup (we only lost that one because Frank Farina was coaching the side at the time).\n\nI think they're good to make the round of 16, and if they face Italy they may push them all the way to penalty shootout, which Australia is no stranger to, but if Italy scores it may be all over.\n\nBut no matter how the game against Croatia goes, Aussies can all be proud of their football team who have certainly raised the bar for future Socceroos sides.
I certainly hope so!!!

because of the rules of taekwondo \n\nin taekwondo competition you are allowed only to punch the torso not to punch face, but to kick torso and face of the opponent \n\nstill , you can get point by punching the torso , but another thing ; the opponent puts a thick gear at his torso , so punching it wont get points , regarding that a point is count only when the hit make a big effect on opponent that could be seen (it move him) or heared (the sound of the hit) and that is the thierd reason , because when you punch that thick gear (called hugo) your punch wont affect him and wont make a sound , so judgs would never mark a point to you from a punch . but when you kick the torso , the leg is big and heavy , do it move the opponent and affects him hard and hugo makes big smash sound from the bare leg kick , so judgs mark a point . also leg is available to kick the face , which you can't do with your hand by the tkd rules , of course kicking the face hurts and many times gets KO \n\nso if you are a taekwondo instructor , or player , would you bother yourself by training punchs ?

Vito
He was the best heavyweight since Ali and he avenged his only two losses and was the first heavyweight to retire as the champion since Rocky Marciano in 1956. After winning the gold medal at Seoul he went pro and won all of this fights before retiring. His only real loss (the loss to Oliver McCall was due to the fight being stopped early for no good reason and Lennox smashed McCall in their re-match) was to Hasim Rahman and after that loss Lennox said that he did not take him seriously before their first fight and then knocked him out in their re-match in four rounds with one of the biggest right hands ever! He was a quiet but confident man who has done a lot of great things outside of boxing and has one of the best records ever for a heavyweight and restored a lot of dignity to the sport after the mess that Tyson left behind. It was good for a change to see a fighter retire before their time passed as so many fighters stay for too long in boxing and suffer for it but not .
I'd like to see Ecuador win. They've made an incredible effort.
probaly on 206 if u have direct t.v. or some where in those channels.
That's very silly -- football is a team sport, and as such requires eleven good players, not one or two (even if they are of Ronaldinho's caliber), to win. \n\nBrazil's team is good because they have lots and lots of good players, not just Ronaldinho.
I hope not. I want Dallas to win, I hate to see Shaq win another title.
Without a doubt, it has to be Kerri Walsh. She's tall and looks amazing in a bikini (which she wore to all her events).

offside is when a player lines up over the line of scrimmage
ok...someone tell her quickly ..so that she can tell me who scored them as if she watched it.... and i will humour her and say ..oh baby ..i love that you watch the football, never letting on that i secretly know that she missed the goals due to the fact that she chatted all the way through the second half!!!!!.... lol typical woman...\n\nexcept... this one is just sooooo sweet for trying
Well from the opening games Argentina has been da most dominant. Theyve scores 8 and posted 2 shut outs. They have ppl in their bench scorin goals for them!
love
Rodney Carney maybe. He's super athletic and has good shooting skills
Yeah...I have an album of football players' wives...if u want I can send ...

They have already done well, and after not being part of the World Cup for 32 years, just to be here was a good performance. \n\nI believe we favourites to get through to the 2nd round, due to the fact that we do not NEED to win. This tilts the chances slightly in our favour, but do not underestimate Croatia, who have a tough team and are proven at the World Cup (semi finalists in 1998 and have qualified every time they have attempted - 1998, 2002 and 2006)\n\nAustralia will likely face Italy, Ghana or Czech Republic in the 2nd round (assuming they finish 2nd in their group, USA cannot top their group). \n\nIf they play Czech Republic, they will almost definately lose (although Guus is a genius and a hate to write him off).\n\nIf they face Italy, they will be massive underdogs. While Italy don't look impressive, we know that they are famous for under performing.\n\nIf they face Ghana, I believe we are favourites. That is not to underestimate Ghana, who have a very good midfield and are extremely athletic. But we have some top defenders and are coached by the KING.
"""Steh auf wenn Du ein Deutscher bist""\n\nI've been trying to find a copy of it online as well....\n\nAdditionally, the melody is from ""Go West"" by the Village People, and made popular by Pet Shop Boys.   The lyrics have been changed for the German song."

Et voilà sa commence, les critiques, excuser moi mais bon déjà d'une il est pas tout seul sur le terrain il peu pas faire à lui seul ce cas 11 ils ne font pas !!!\nDeux c typiquement français sa d'avoir la mémoire courte, ont oubli bien vite tous ce que Zidane à apporter au foot et en particulier a l'équipe de France !!\nOui il a du mal sur 2 mi-temps mais qui le laisse sur le terrain et surtout demander vous pourquoi ont le laisse 90mn sur le terrain, Zidane est un des rares que je vois courir après chaque ballons pendant  90 mn (voir plus) il ce bat lui contrairement à d'autre qui font des trucs super dans leurs club mais rien en équipe de France ??\nZizou arrête sa carrière peut être pas au meilleur de sa forme, mais personnes n'a le droit d'oublier tt ce qu'il a fait pendant tt c années de carrière, il est et a été un de nos plus grands joueurs, et croyez moi y'en a pas mal qui ce contenterais de la moitié de son talent pour joué au foot actuellement
As a huge devils fan, i believe elias will be back after serving with the team for years. The team will move to a new arena in newark during the 2007-2008 season, if the project is on schedule. However, there are complications right now and the mayor of newark doesn't want to pursue the project. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested, so expect the move next year.

It's worth getting good deraillers, they can really get a work out when MT biking."
It is a pickle of an answer! in my opinion, Kwell (or KING HARRY) will have to come of the bench and give it his best shot with the help of Viduka, Brechano, Aloisi and then get it past Buffon in the 89th minitue!!! \n\nMaster Guus will pick it right!

The sleeping bag might be good to lie on. The ground might be uncomfortable even at that temp.(ie. dry and hard).
If they were both in their prime, it would be Steve Nash only because he is just a LITTLE better at shooting. The reason everyone thinks Steve Nash is so much better than J-Kidd is because Steve just hit his prime, Kidd is on the downside, and Steve Nash has so much more talent around him. Other than Vince Carter and Richard Jefferson, J-Kidd has no talent to pass TO, therefore not being able to showcase his amazing passing ability.
Most balls on sale today have about 300 to 450 dimples. There were a few balls having over 500 dimples before. The record holder was a ball with 1,070 dimples -- 414 larger ones (in four different sizes) and 656 pinhead-sized ones. All brands of balls, except one, have even-numbered dimples. The only odd-numbered ball on market is a ball with 333 dimples.
C'est vrai que le Ghana est une grande équipe, c'est vrai qu'ils ont une défense; mais après ce que j'ai vu hier soir lors du match Brésil-Japon, ils devront jouer à 1000%. Je ne vais pas dire que leurs chances sont nulles mais c'est pas loin de l'être. Ils peuvent créer la surprise...dans 4 ans!!!! Dsl

Oui il doit jouer.\nCertes il est vieux pour un footballer, perd bcp plus de ballons...\nmais en opposition à une équipe européenne comme l'espagne il faut compter sur notre défense et milieu défensif qui sont tous 2 excellents (Abidal, Gallas, Thuram, Sagnol - Makelele, Vieira).\n\nSi l attaque ne fait pas son boulot et qu'on ne prend pas de but Zidane est certainement un des seuls joueurs à pouvoir débloquer le match sur coup-franc. Ce ne sont certainement pas Ribéry et Malouda qui peuvent faire ce travail à sa place. Un joueur peut courir moins vite et être moins dynamique qu'avant mais la technique pure reste et ça, ça compte. Ronaldo a bien marqué 2 buts contre le Japon en courant comme une charette. Sa technique exceptionnelle a tout fait sur son 2ème but.\n\nHenry quant à lui peut aussi tirer les coup francs mais mieux vaut avoir 2 tireurs qu'un seul. Celui qui le sentira le mieux tirera.\nEnfin Zidane a eu une longue période de récupération donc il sera frais pour ce match et il sait que ce sera peut-être le dernier match de sa vie donc il décuplera ses forces et son style.\n\nVerdict Mardi à 23h...\n\nPS : je suis le premier à gueuler sur Zidane quand il fait de la m... pourtant.\n\nmise à jour : 60ème min. je viens de voir que l'Angleterre se sort un peu d'un match difficile par un but de Beckham... sur coup franc. Preuve que ça aide quand un match est bloqué à 0-0. Reste à voir la fin du match.
maybe on www.overstock.com. course they've got some random stuff on there so maybe not but it's worth a try.

there's a lot of confusion here. Pele did not hold the record, Gerd Muller did with 14, from West Germany and Ronaldo has broken that by scoring 15. I think it was Pele that had 13, but not 14! The records so far have been made on German soil... so I think the next time anyone will top it, they'll be in Germany :P

You have a maximum of seven games to win. SEVEN GAMES. Now if a team really deserved to win, they would've won in that time. MEANING, the Miami Heat are deservingly the champions.

just think of all the extra revenue the golden avenue association is going to make this year from all their back door matches. A cup competition is based on knockout and when you get knocked out thats where your at. but no, not the golden avenue association. \n   imagine the revenue they would have lost so far this year if they were without Down, Tyrone and Meath.
Chuck of course - round house kicks to the head!
In Earlier World cups they did try a straight knockout but most people prefer the groups and i Agree. you may get the odd match with nothing to play for but in a straight knockout you get alot of poor teams playing for draws in the hope of going thru on penalties. Just look at the European Cup in the 80's and how Red Star got all the way to the final and Won by playing for draws in each round and winning on pens. The theory is the better teams in the knockout stage won't do this, but it still happens..
Newsflash...who cares?

Nooooooo! I want England to win =D (if that's not possible I'm not really fussed) But definitely not Italy they have so far cheated their way to the where they are now with nice little dives and strategic time wasting. Booooooo. (although they have played okay too, with gd defense)\n\nGo England =P

Sorry, but there have been 3: Sandy Koufax (1963 & 1965), Bob Gibson (1964 & 1967), and Reggie Jackson (1973 & 1977).
"To answer your second question first, yes, you really did win.  The Italians really did advance to the quarterfinals, Ghana really did beat the U.S. on a penalty, and likewise with Ukraine when they beat Tunisia.  Now, to elaborate more, in my opinion, that is just awful and disgusting and doesnt mean you can play better football, it means you can fall down and scream like a little girl.  Now, for your first question, it bothers me a lot.  A LOT.  I prefer people that play because they love to play, because its beautiful, and not people that play because they love to win, which often turns ugly.  For instance, Lionel Messi had the ball in the box late in the game against Mexico, with the score tied 1-1.  He got bumped and touched the ball to far, and instead of falling down, fought for his balance, and then chased after the ball, and almost got it.  I like that style of play.  Then, in a later match, whoever that Italian player was has the ball in the box late in the game in a 0-0 tie, against Australia, and, seeing the Australia player on the ground, decides to run into him and fall down, rather than simply step over him and get the ball.  That style of play, I think is gross, whimpy, disgusting, and cowardly.  And, as to your middle part, about why ""diving"" seems to only happen in football, I cant really say, except that its just the way they think in Europe (or so it would seem, I've never been).  As for the teams that play that cowardly style, (ITALY!!!cough, cough, excuse me) let them win, even let them enjoy it.  If they think that makes them better at football, let them.  Because, it is likely that the rest of the world will know they are wrong.  Hopefully, for the remainder of this tournament, the referees will really be looking for it, and will not make any poor decisions that affect a match."
Terrible ref...he let the game get out of hand. and it seemed like he was issuing cards to control the game, but that didnt work it made things worse

Start b y doing hand stands and  balance your self for a good few seconds each time. Then when you are up to it, start walkng slowly one hand in front of the other and keep your balance and you will be walking on your hands in not time at all.
best way to figure it out is to reel the flyline onto the reel first then attach the backing to the flyline with a knot that will slip throught the guides easily. fill the reel to capacity with the backing then cut it. strip it all off the reel then attach the backing to the reel and wind it all in. the reel will be full with the right amount of backing.

Sweeney has been one of my favorites and was a permanent fixture on my fantasy team due to his talent and being one heck of a great guy.  Unfortunately he is also very fragile and is constantly acking with one thing or another.  I don't think many teams are willing to pay his price tag, and eventually will end up signing for a very low contract full of performance incentives or as a role (read bench) player.

what kind and in what shape?
"Generally a shift refers not just to a player, though, but the whole line, or defensive pair.\n\nPlayers generally come on and off in lines, and your three forwards (left wing, right wing and center) will generally come out together, work a ""shift"" together and come back off the ice more or less at the same time (unless as usual your left wing's still doggedly chasing their center around the offensive net and won't let him come out for love or money).  \n\n""Double shifting"" means you're putting one player out on one more shift per rotation through the bench than he'd usually play.  So say I played with Line 1, and then Line 2 went out and then instead of the regular center on Line 3, the coach put me in again.\n\nIn rec hockey you might do it because you're missing a player (like you have two lines of three and one line of two).\n\nIn pro hockey it means you're desperate to get a certain individual out there because he's producing, but the wisdom of that is debatable except in isolated cases.  Double shifting is extremely tiring.  On the bench, you tend to need every second of rest you get.\n\nDefense works in shifts too.  A defensive pair (whichever combination the coach sends out) on the ice is also doing a ""shift,"" which ends when they both come off.\n\nShifts should be kept short.  The idea is to go out there, give it everything you have until you're cooked and then get off the ice again."
"you can go to youtube.com and type in soccer videos, they have a wide variety of videos! i have a favorite called ""Soccer Practice"" and there's also one where a guy looks like he's giving another guy a kiss near his ""u-know-where"" which is in his pants! There's also a video with a referee that looks so gay, because he appears to be doing ballet! They are hilarious and like I said my favorite one is ""Soccer Practice""!"

The Toronto Raptors will do one of two things with their #1 pick in the 2006 NBA Draft... they will either\n1. draft Texas F LaMarcus Aldridge (Chris Bosh has been very open this is who he wants the team to draft)\n\nor \n\n2. trade the rights to the 1st pick along with Charlie Villanueva to the Indiana Pacers for the # 17 pick and Jermaine O'Neal- this could happen if the Raptors are willing to take in O'Neals huge salary...but I expect them to take Aldridge

ca va etre tres chaud !!!\nsauf si le Togo est aussi compréhensif qu'Adébayor qui veut partir en vacances, mais si le Togo joue a fond et ne veux pas nous laisser gagner, ca risque d'être un match très tendu, sans compter qu'il faut marquer 2 buts de plus que la corée ou la suisse si ils font match nul 0-0 et donc proportionnellement ensuite... ca va être très dur si vous êtes objectif !!!
The winning time should be around 2:26.\n\nI handicapped four horses, mama3x, who will still be running hard at 12 furlongs: Oh So Awesome, Jazil, Bluegrass Cat and Steppenwolfer. In short, Oh So Awesome is the value bet at the 20-1 morning line. He's not well known, so I think his odds will go even higher.\n\nNo exotic bets for me this time: Oh So Awesome across-the-board. He's my choice to win.
I think is a close bet between germany and spain. Awesome kicks they have given so far!

Until the injury, I would say no way.  Roloson had made himself more money during the playoffs then any player.  He was going to sign a fat contract, that probably a small market team like Edmonton would not pay.  \n\nNow with the injury, I think there is a chance.  Specifically with the salary cap, Edmonton should be able to give him a competitive offer.  This is especially true now that his value has gone down with the injury.  \n\nThe question is, do they want him?  He is 34 with a serious knee injury.  It is not certain he will return to the same playing form of the playoffs.

Its best out of seven games. So which ever team wins 4 games first are the NBA champions. The Heat and the Mavs are 2-2 (each team won 2 games) so today is game five. Whoever wins the next 2 out of three games gets the Title of NBA champions.
Start off with the basic most used technique.  Run for 1 minute, walk for 2 minutes.  If you can do this for 30 minutes, 5 days a week, then you will be shedding the pounds like it is your job.  Also eating a balence diet that contains many fruits, vegitables, and meet will help you.  Always remember to keep hydrated.  Water is better for you than sports drinks.

Strange how countries cars are like their football teams\n\nGerman - reliable but boring\nFrench - Lots of flair but some can be pedestrian\nItalian - Stylish but often misfires\nSpanish - Should be fantastic but the final product doesn't quite make the grade.\nUS - Lots of gas \nRussian - Clapped out\nEngland - Can be a Rolls Royce but more likely to be a London Bus\nScotland - Hillman Imp\nSweden - Volvo plods along reliable but not much style\nKorea - Cheap runs a lot but never reaches the final destination\nBrazil - Only uses for a car is to get to the Copocabana in style!

The first half seemed kind of on the sloppy side, except for that one part where they both scored.\n\nBut now the second half is off to good start...great stuff.
Ascot Gavotte \n\nLadies and Gentlemen \nEv'ry duke and earl and peer is here \nEv'ryone who should be here is here. \nWhat a smashing, positively dashing \nSpectacle: the Ascot op'ning day. \nAt the gate are all the horses \nWaiting for the cue to fly away. \nWhat a gripping, absolutely ripping \nMoment at the Ascot op'ning day. \nPulses rushing! Faces flushing! \nHeartbeats speed up! I have never been so keyed up! \nAnd second now They'll begin to run. Hark! \nA bell is ringing, They are springing Forward Look!\nIt has begun...! What a frenzied moment that was! \nDidn't they maintain an exhausting pace? \n'Twas a thrilling, absolutely chilling Running of the \nAscot op'ning race.
Not sure of the oldest to play,\nbut Roger Milla, of the Indomitable Lions of Cameroon\nwas the oldest to score a goal, \nwhen he entered the game (I think against Russia) \nin the 1994 World Cup held at Stanford Univ., in Palo Alto, CA.\nI believe he was 42. \nIt was an event I'll never forget.\nThe entire stadium erupted when he scored.
Anything is possible! I personally think we should use Wood, Maddux, and Prior as relief or closers, they are good, but not healthy. We have a habit of bringing our boys back before tey are ready and they keep getting hurt. I love the Cubs. My RED Sox won when no one thought they would I know my Cubbie's will too
no. that was crap
yes that would be good we wouldn't want to ask England because of the trouble their fans bring but we could ask the republic of Ireland instead to fill the English spot i think that would be great
32 after prelims
If you are wondering the QB from BG you picked up Omar Jacobs is in the mold of a Randel El.  He could easy fill that position in the Steelers offense.
Yup everytime it come on and even though miami started out rocky they stepped they game up and came back with three straight wins and they gone win one more to take what is their's, bet mavs not talking now(lol).\n\nGO HEAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I probably should be cheering for the U.S., but I really am cheering for Germany.
Chances are he already likes you! Just give it some time and let him know that you are interested.
There is no formalized randomness in baseball, like the coin toss in football or something.  Everything is set up ahead of time.
The engines that Champ Cars use produce about 850hp compared to the ones the IRL uses that produce about 650hp and are limited to 10,300 rpm.  After several high-profile accidents in 2003 (including ones involving Mario Andretti and Kenny Brack), the IRL made many changes to reduce speeds and increase safety.
Alessandro is still valuable. His experience makes him a good leader. He has given Italy great service and given the world the pleasure of watching a great talent and many wonderful performances. He was brilliant in the 2002 WC and deserves his accolades. Not to mention for the gals that he is one of the hottest players I have ever seen.\nBuffon I have no opinion.
Been hurt.  Get hurt all the time.\n\nRehabbing a broken foot sucked only because it took so long; I was off the ice for three months and just about went around the bend.\n\nActually the worst was getting whiplashed in a fight.  Took less time to heal, but it made me gunshy for a while.  Less inclined to scrap, which is bad.  I think depending on the injury sometimes you have to get your nerve back along with everything else, but I'd never give up hockey, ever.
Well, right now, there are only four women left: Vaidisova, Kuznetsova, Hardenne, and Clijters. I was going for Hingis, but she got strangled by Clijsters. I personally do not want Vaidisova or Clijsters to win. I think Vaidisova is dooping. Too bad, the officials will find out after the tornament is over. And, i don't want Clijsters to win because she is retiring anyways by the end of the year. So i don't think she should retire as the dominant female player in tennis. I want to see Kuznetsova and Hardenne in the final. By the way, did you know that Kuznetsova and Hardenne met in the 4th round of last year's French Open? Kuznetsova had like 2 match points, but Hardenne managed to overcome them and ended up winning the match, along with the other matches. Kuznetsova was the only player that chellenged her, the rest could not even take a set off her. But yeah, i would be happy if any of them wins, they deserve it. \nOn the men's side, there are two players on one side of the draw: Federer and Nalvandian, and on the other side of the draw, there are still 4 players left: Burnememansm, Ljubicic, Nadal, and Djokovic. Out of all of them, i think that Nadal and Federer are going to make it to the final, where Nadal might finally get his nachos crunched on clay. But, i would rather see Djonkovic win, he is just, just,..so nice to watch, that hair, those eyes,... so yeah, i hope he wins, or at leat make it to the final.

Yeah, sadly americans (USA) are really really bad at football and since they suck so bad they don´t care what its called, they just care about baseball, american football, basketball, hockey, but they don´t realize that the rest of the world plays FOOTBALL not SOCCER.

Not much info given so my answer will be short. You say new pool water, so I assume no chemicals have been put in. Go to your local Pool store with a sample of your water. They will give you directions as to the amount and what to put in. Tell them it's newly filled and what type of sanitizer you will be using.They will give you stabilizer, shock and sanitizer at the very least. Follow their directions as to what and how much  to add. While you are there, ask if they have a pool care guide you can have. Some chemical manufactureres distibute these with their products. It shouldn't cost you anything.\n As a general rule the only chemical added to a pool that requires a wait time, is chlorine shock. It's always a good idea to shock at dusk. Two reasons: 1/ More bang for your buck as ultra violet light doesn't break down the shock until morning. 2/ The kids are done swimming for the day and no one will be using the pool.\n If you must shock during the day, wait at least 4 hours on a sunny day, before jumping in again.

yep!\nc'est un niveau en progression. Ce qui manquait au Japon était l'entrainement par des gens avec une bonne experience. Ils l'ont eu petit à petit en faisant venir des anciens d'autres championnats et ca va aller en s'ameliorant (un peu a la maniere de la turquie en qq sorte). Pour le reste, il y avait surtout un probleme de notoriete, envers les jeunes (futurs joueurs potentiels) et le public (le sport national est le base ball)\nmais le japon est riche et le divertissement est roi, la coupe du monde puis les medias, tout tend a faire devenir le championnat plus interessant pour le cote business du foot et le cote plaisir pour le public... Je pense que le niveau va continuer de grimper pour devenir assez bon d'ici qq annees. Quand les voisins genre chine coree se seront aussi bien developpes, il y aura alors de bons championnats en asie et ca risque de prendre de l'ampleur... mais ce n'est pas encore pour demain
Isiah Thomas will go down in history as the worst executive in the history of sports.  Not just basketball, but in the history of sports.  Take a look across the river at Rod Thorn with the Nets.  Thats an executive who knows how to get players that fit.\n\nHe is more than clueless on what this team needs and it shows in his drafts and this horrible trades.  Jim Dolan will go down as the worst owner in the history of sports too.  He should have fired Isiah (who still has a sexual harrassment charge pending against him) and let Larry Brown run both for a year.  Something tells me you would have seen improvement.\n\nWhats the worst thing that can happen?  The Knicks win 35 games and Dolan sees improvement and gives Thomas an extension!

well, Ghana has met Bazil in the U-17 matches and Ghana has beaten Brazil numerous times
All right, I'm not going to look at what he has done so far this season.... because it's just easier to figure out that way.  \n\nHe's played in 2125 games, which would amount to about 14 seasons if he were to play 155 games each year.  He's actually in his 18th season, so you got to figure he's basically missed three years of playing time (remember, I'm not counting this season, so he's played 17 complete seasons).  \n\nHis home run total coming into the season was 536, which over 14 seasons of playing time averages out to 38 home runs per year.  If you take that average over the three seasons that he missed, it would come out to 114.  So, theoretically, he should have been at about 650 coming into this season, which with his 12 so far this year would put him at 662, and on pace for about 688 by the end of this season.  \n\nHowever, he was at 398 before coming to Cincinnati.  In his last four years in Seattle, he was averaging 52 per season.  He's in Cincy for his 7th season this year.  If he doesn't get injured and even averages 45 HR/season, he'd be looking at 713 at the end of this season.\n\nAs if this isn't way too much already, another way of looking at it - \nHe has averaged 3.7 AB/G, and a 14.68 HRR (home run ratio - the number of AB's between each HR).  If he played 155 games per season, he would have 2635 games, and 9750 AB's, which would translate into 664 HR's at the beginning of this season, and 703 at the end of this season.
Luis Hernandez, twice in 3-1 win over South Korea in group play in 1998.\nLuis Garcia, twice in 2-1 win over Ireland in group play in 1994.\nJavier Valdivia, twice in 4-0 win over El Salvador in group play in 1970.\nManuel Rosas, twice in 6-3 loss to Argentina in group play in 1930.
I have to go with Bill Russell. He is that rare player who:\n\n1) Was a superstar individually and also a consummate team player. He led his San Francisco team to back-to-back NCAA Championships, won an Olympic gold medal, and his Boston Celtics to 8 straight NBA championships!\n\n2) Could put up great stats. He averaged 22 rebounds a game for his career. Seriously, 22.\n\nYou can make a case for Jordan, Chamberlain, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, among others, but I think I've got to give it to Bill Russell and all his rings.

Oui il a fait un grand match, comme çà ne lui était pas arrivé depuis trop longtemps. Si il renouvelle sa prestation, il est indiscutable mais..... on ne le sait qu'à la fin.\nIl y a une autre expression triviale pour dire la même chose, mais je la garde pour moi.
RONALDINO biensur
No, there is nothing to damage and why should he not be allowed to ride?  I think he should be allowed to hit as many cars as he wants, he can afford to pay to have them repaird.
Not all pitches are the same size.\n\nA football pitch (let's not call it soccer) must be between 100 yards (90m) and 130 yards (120m) and width not less than 50 yards (45m) and not more than 100 yards (90m). \n\nFor International matches the length of a pitch must be between 110 yards (100m) and 120 yards (110m) and width not less than 70 yards (64m) and not more than 80 yards (75m). \n\nAs for how this was determined, you will probably find that over the years this has averaged out until someone at FIFA set the above dimensions.\n\nThere are set dimensions for everything from the size of the goal posts to the markings on the pitch.
Definitely disagree!! You forgot the best Italy!!
well, Argentinians will finally have their long waiting revenge after the finals in Italia '90.
"This is a pretty good match up.  I'd have to give it to the ""Dirtiest Player in the Game"", though.  Nothing against Bruno, but I think the combination of Flair's speed advantage & his willingness to cheat to win would give him the match."
The first match of this World Cup finals is at 1600 UTC, on Friday. (BTW, I think this particular part of Y!Answers was designed more for American Football - the game of e.g. the 49ers, or the Jets - but I'm willing to be corrected on that score)

"It depends on how you define ""greatest"".  Would Babe Ruth be a great ballplayer in 2006?  He'd probably be nothing special.  \n\nToday's players benefit from nutritional guidance, weight lifting and fitness programs, better travel conditions, and countless other things that players from Ruth's era could never have dreamed of.  (Not to mention illegal pharmaceutical additives, in some cases.)\n\nRuth also played in an 8 team league (I believe it was 8), so instead of the 600 best baseball players, he only played against 200.  Higher quality players.\n\nOn the other hand, players of Ruth's era only played against white ballplayers; there were no blacks, Hispanics, Asians, or other ethnic groups or foreigners playing in baseball.  One could argue that that diminished the quality of the game.  \n\nPerhaps the quantity of players and the lack of mixed ethnicity cancel each other out.  We'll never know.\n\nTo me, Ruth is the greatest, though Mays and DiMaggio and several others are certainly in contention.  Ruth is the greatest because of what he did in comparison to the other players of his day.  He didn't just break records by a 5 or 6%, he broke them by doubling the old record.  He'd hit as many home runs in a season as entire other teams.\n\nAnd by that definition he was head, shoulders, chest, and waist above the other players of his era.  To me that makes him the best.\n\nIn addition, he was larger than life.  He brought a lot of good attention to the game, and is probably to a degree responsible for the success of the game over the last 100 years.  I am not sure you can say that about any particular players who followed him.\n\nBut there are valid arguments for Willie Mays, Yogi Berra, Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, and others.  That's what's great about baseball; there is no right answer.\n\n--Cloyd"
Thierry Henry played like a school boy . But Zidane was awesome. Rivierra missed some important chances . Hats off to the Swiss . I was expectin a minimum of 2 goals from france .\n\nSomething worth saying is that \nfrance hasnt scored a world cup goal Since Paris 1998 finals .

Football became popular all over the world because it started to play in England, and England had colonies all over the world and... Also some scientific researches said that football is popular because of the unpredictedness and they proved that this sport is the most unpredictable of all. And why isn't it popular in USA...I don' know. Americans are a bit odd! Just watch the Jerry Springer (it is sick) which is one of the most popular shows in the USA.

Red Cross boating safety can be taken at age 12, and it's a great idea for any new boater, regardless of age. They should also ensure that they can swim. It's amazing to me the number of people who go boating who don't even posses survival swimming skills, like being able to tread water! A life jacket should be a supportive device, not your sole safety device. \nBut enough of my ranting. To go back to your original question, 12 years of age. \nGo for it!

I’m not too sure where all this meaning comes as in “to share” or “go for it”. During my child-hood years. The actaul word was “fuck eyed”‘; and it only ment one thing. Which was beaten up. As I recall in years between 1974 - 1982, whenever some kid came into school with the infamous “black eye”. Everyone would say out loud, “Check it out, he got fuck eyed from someone”. For the real locals it would be something more like this “Lana sa ma fuck-eye si dude”. My assupmptoin to where the spelling came from “FOKAI” is almost in the sense of how Germans would spell their own words. If you look at early on “FOKAI” logos/letterings there would be two dots above the letter O. There are other similiar logos / saying like “Farfrompuken”, the two dots would be above the letter U. This saying usually had a picture of a man running to the toilet bowl getting ready to barf all his alcohol that he drank. Another saying would be fukengroven, again the two dots above the letters U and O. In in a sense not to show bad slander in the eye of the public, the creator(and I’m guessing at this) decided to spell “fuck eye” as fokai.

I agree, i think that Vince thinks about himself over every one else, He probably thinks that if ECW comes to RAW then ratings might go up and he makes more money, Plus, since he owns both brands then no matter what he makes the money

wow the uneducated answers keep on flowing....\n\nFirst I do not condone anyone under 23 using. A male up to and around this age has enough testosterone pumping through his body that with a great diet and proper weight lifting program he can have exceptional results. \nAs for older people I say really do your homework. Dont just take some gymrats advice. Learn the science behind what your going to do. Just as anything else some people give Steroids a bad connotation.\nIn my opinion as well as many others with far more credentials after their name than me, a responsible person can run effective cycles of anabolic steroids with no lasting side effects. \n\nDoctors prescribe anabolic steroids every day to men even in their 30's.... and no one screams and yells about how its going to kill them..... because when a doc does it its called Testosterone Therapy. \n\nwell i could go on an on with my lil rant but i wont .\n\nmy biggest point to give is.  do your home work!!!!!  \ndont start putting stuff in your body without knowing what your doing. Dont be the guy that just adds to the negative stereotype.
Yes it was Celtic, As the questioner probably already knows, this was one of FIVE trophies Celtic won that year, the others being the Scottish League, Scottish Cup, Scottish League Cup and the Glasgow Cup.

Much as it would help to keep the game fair, it would spoil the game.  The intrigue of the game is in the goals, fouls, the wrong decisions and the feelings that these evoke in those who watch.  Let's keep it that way...you wouldn't get passionate about a wrong decision corrected due to replays now, would you??  \nLove the game the way it is!
I'd like to see Ecuador win. They've made an amazing effort. Germany being the home team, has a better chance, though.
I think its sad that a person who is looked up to by kids and adults alike has to live a lie about his sports ability.  Yep

"I would have to say, that despite the more advanced level of play, or perhaps because of it, college sports are better than professional sports. Three main reasons:\n\n1. Those athletes out there are playing for the love of the game, not for money, not for agents, not for Hummers and publicity, they're playing because that is what they love to do. And at most schools, they're doing it while juggling classwork as well. Throw money in and things get all hairy. As the Bible says, ""love of money is the root of all evil"".\n\n2. The sheer pageantry of collegiate athletics, most especially football. The century-old rivalries, the mascots, the fight songs, the student sections, the bands, all of these are missing in pro sports. As a sort of cheap replacement are these fake cheerleaders who are in no way considered a part of the game. Don't get me wrong, there are some solid pro rivalries, Vikings-Packers, Chiefs-Raiders, but they just lack that extra atmosphere that collegiate rivalries pack. \n\n3. Upsets. Upsets happen in professional sports, but think about it, if the 0-10 Raiders beat the 8-2 Patriots, it's not that big of a deal. The Patriots will still make the playoffs, nobody really worries that much. But if Texas loses to Baylor, stop the presses. That is essentially a season-ending loss, the kind that destroys any chance UT might have had for winning a national championship. Pro football and the other sports are great, but who can argue that there was a regular season NFL game as exciting as USC-Notre Dame? OSU-Texas? Fun to watch, but due to the (admitedly, rather imperfect) system, they don't carry nearly as much weight as these college games.\n\nI know I used football for my examples a lot, but that's largely because I think the NFL is the best professional league, both in terms of how much I enjoy watching it, and how the league is organized and run. And it's the best sport overall."

after portugals game with holland, i think portugal and ill go 4 them too cause i hate the english team, they think their the best, they're not.
I'd assume you have 4 more months to train, but that should be a good amount of time. Gradually increase you average distance and don't run the same amount everyday obviously. Do a couple of 10 mile days and then on one day run 15. This'll get you used to suddenly running a lot because it'd obviously be torture on your body to run 26 miles everyday. But you could do that once in a while during your training, it'd be a good idea.
Australia certainly is just as good as the best in the world, I would always place a bet on their abilities to beat everyone, I would rate them on par with New Zealand and South Africa, slightly above England, ireland and France.\n\nMaybe on cable you will be able to watch the greatest game in the world....

Do you honestly think guys are looking at your eyebrows? Unless there is something really hideous going on in your eyebrows (giant caterpillar unibrow or you've plucked them into oblivion and then drawn in fake ones) I can assure you that the guys eyes are focused on other things. Keep your eyebrows natural, just eliminating any superlong or out of place hairs, and you'll be fine.

Ghana beat U.S.A 2-1\nU.S.A WORLD CUP is not for you. Keep practicing basketball, baseball, hockey, volleyball, and American football that's how you call it, and you will win the world cup in 2010 if you even qualify. lol.\nThat's what happen when you scorn the best game in the world. I see that everyday when I go to the park. American people in one side playing basketball, and other games, and I end up playing soccer(the best game in the world) with spanish and haitians people.\nI didn't like the penalty kick, but let be honest you'd still be eliminated.
That is the play maker, and most likely the attacking midfielder, Center Forward.  Ex.  Maradonna, Ronaldinho, Juan Roman Riquelme etc..
Dallas in 6 games at most. Miami looks old, especially Shaq. His numbers in the first 2 games are pathetic and he can't hit a free throw to save his life. Wade is great , but not enough to overcome Dirk, Jason Terry, or Dwight Howard. Dallas also looks hungrier and better coached. Pat Riley is old, has orange hair, and doesn't have Magic or Kareem to ride to the championship anymore.

My vote goes to the White Sox.  They added a number one offense to their already stellar pitching staff.  Jenks has also came around as the closer and their defense is playing really well.

Hi Gene Snitsky
It depends what you consider difficult.. \n\nbutterfly yea.. you'll get tired pretty quick, those underwater streamlines after the turns kill and its hard to keep your stroke going\n\nbreastroke for me is the hardest, it might not be as tiring but man.. It takes for ever to get to the other side.. and holding your breath after the turn for those long pullouts, it gets to you\n\nback.. hard to stay in line, hard to time turns, hard to stay down underwater facing up with water wanting to come in your nose\n\nfree.. easy? try doing it for 1500m.. keeping your stroke going is the hard part of free, sure its probably the easiest but if you want to go fast, it takes a loooooot of time and practice\n\nIn my opinion, fly is the hardest, but to be good in a stroke is hard for all
Hmm does it really matter how much they are being paid?  If they play well, then what's the problem.   It's only money.\n\nHowever, in a more global aspect, I think that when a successful organization is making a profit, they have other obligations to pay attention to.  Since payroll is the highest expense in any organization, and there is a profit happening from somewhere, the obligation is to the community and those that are not as fortunate.  It doesn't matter to me how much a player makes.  If the player is good, has skill, and has alot to offer the team then so be it.  I would also like to see the teams also contribute to their communities and states.  (And most do - even those highly paid players do as well.)

There are only 4 'grandslam' tournaments:\n1. Australia Open, the 'opening' grand slam tournament,\n2. Roland Garros, or the French Open,\n3. Wimbledon, the all famous grass courts,\n4. US Open, as the 'closing' grandslam tournament.\n\nThere was an effort to add 1 major tournament, the ATP Masters Cup, as the fifth but it had never succeed. The Masters giving away the biggest prize money and only the 8 top-ranked players invited to play in round-robin matches.\n\nAll those grandslam categorized tournaments are for the professional players whilst there are some tournaments previously only for the amateurs i.e Davis Cup, Federation Cup or the Olympic. At this time pro players play in those tournaments as well.

You're right; notice many of the commercials have subtitles....\n\nAmericans have not traditionally grown up playing soccer (many do now, but I think as they get older, it loses its lustre).  It is the same way with hockey.  We don't grow up being passionate about it (as a group), so no, most do not care about professional soccer or the World Cup in the least.  (I didn't know the World Cup was only every four years until this year.)  \nHockey's strategy of changing the games so that none end in a 0-0 tie was smart.  \nAny sport that can end in a 0-0 tie (especially when the minutes count upwards instead of down) is really not appealing to most Americans.  \nTherefore, most companies prefer to spend money on the NFL and MLB because they end up generating the most revenue.  It is a vicious circle, as soccer would need more money and sponsors to become more popular, but to become more appealing to sponsors, it needs to be more popular.\nSergio-great answer!
Depends who FIFA has designated the home team. If Austraila are deemed the home team, they wear the normal shirts. if not, the away strip which is blue, i believe.
Either Brazil or Argentina.
depends if france wins against Togo and on the results of tomorrow and the next leg
Well if u know how to read a DRF then u should know to watch that track to see if the conditions is a Speed or Closers bias..A lot of tracks will have A lot of speed horses that day or closers..Also to watch to see if that horse is a conditions horses or not..Do your homework..buy the DRF the day before and look it over but NOT looking at 1 race too long or u wil start overlooking things. Also 1 of the KEY things i look for is...DOES this horse not want to win..running 2nd and 3rd alot this is a key i use all the time on hitting BIG tris and supers..So GL and hopefully u will Start winnning

After WestIndies tour India will participate in an ODI series in SriLanka along with SouthAfrica. \nIndia will begin their campaign in the tri-series in Sri Lanka with a match against the hosts in Dambulla on August 16. The tournament will kick off with a Sri Lanka versus South Africa game two days earlier.\n\nTRI-SERIES SCHEDULE\nAug. 14: Lanka vs SA in Dambulla; \nAug. 16: Lanka vs India in Dambulla; \nAug. 18: India vs SA in Dambulla; \nAug. 20: Lanka vs SA in Dambulla; \nAug. 23: Lanka vs India; \nAug. 26: India vs SA. \nAug. 29: Final
C:  Joe Mauer - Victor Martinez is a beast offensively, but he's terrible defensively.  Mauer has the best batting average in MLB right now.\n1B:  Pujols - he's easily the #1 overall pick.\n2B:  Rickie Weeks - he's 25, and he has amazing talent; he'll be in many all-star games by the time his career is done.  Soriano is a terrible defensive 2B; Utley would be next on this list if you're talking about a one-year thing.\n3B:  Wright - he barely gets the nod over A-Rod b/c he's younger.  These guys would probably be the #2 and #3 overall picks.\nSS:  Tejada - with Michael Young right behind him (Young has the 2nd most hits behind Ichiro over the last 4 years)\nLF:  Miguel Cabrera - he's batting .350 this year, and he's still in his mid-20s.\nCF:  Vernon Wells - he's only 27 and he's an MVP candidate this year.  Jason Bay is right behind him, with Beltran in the mix as well.\nRF:  I'll go with Vlad - he's a little older at 30, but he's great both offensively and defensively and it's a fairly weak position.\n\nSP:  Santana - he's far and away the best pitcher on the board, and he's just 27.\nSP:  Roy Halladay - only 29 years old, and he'll be a Cy Young contender this year.\nSP:  Brandon Webb - he came up at the same time as D-Train, and right now he's becoming an ace pitcher.\nSP:  Carlos Zambrano - Zambrano's been in the bigs for a while, but he's only 25.  He has nasty stuff as well.\nSP:  Jered Weaver - the 23-year-old showed some nasty stuff in his first few starts in the big leagues.  He'll be a Cy Young contender for years to come.\n\nRP:  Tough call due to the instability of the position.  I suppose you have to go with Paplebon, but the Sox want to make him into a starter eventually.  After Paplebon, I'll go with Bobby Jenks.  I wouldn't take a closer early in a draft at all; closers can come out of nowhere (guys like Paplebon this year and Derrick Turnbow last year).
I'm going with the Swiss in this one.. I dont know who is better on paper but from what I have watched they have been playing better football\n\nwhatever happens they are gonna get beat by Italy .. so it doesnt matter

Johnny Warren Born May 17th 1943 yes he did play only in one game in 1974 World Cup a match against East Germany which Australia lost 2-0 & he did hurt his foot which meant he missed the two remaining games, Australia`s single point came from a   0-0 draw with Chile. But did you also know he was awarded the M.B.E in 1973, retired the next year 1974 & became a coach, was entered in Australia`s Hall of Fame in 1988, cried on national television in 1997 when two very late goals by Iran in the Socceroo`s final qualifying game, which meant they (Iran) went through to the 1998 World Cup, got the Medal of Order of Australia from the Queen in her birthday honour list in 2002, also in this year he was awarded FIFA`s Centennial Order of Merit.  He died on November 6th 2004 only days after the launch of       A-League Australia`s new top level Soccer Camp,  which meant he missed the kick off in 2005. Hope this is what you wanted.
Again???   WoW!
Jazil, hands down. He's a good closer with a nice come-from- behind kick that, with the extra running room the Belmont is gonna give him, should put him right up front at the finish line. He won't run out of track there like he did in the Wood and the Derby.

Some of your answers are good, and some of you must be children. Id say...\n\n-Sabu\n-Christopher Daniels\n-Jody Fliesch\n-Brian Kendrik (ROH version)\n\nIt would at the old ECW arena. A Hardcore Fatal Four Way Elimination Match, 60 minute time limit. Jody would be the first eliminated, then Kendrik, then It would come down to Sabu and Daniels..Sabu would set Daniels up on a table, go for the Arabian Skull Crusher, but he misses, Daniels picks him up, Gives him the Angels Wings onto the table (he doesnt break all the way through), Daniels goes up to the top, and hits A BME on Sabu, sending them both crashing through the table. They both crawl to there feet, and Daniels kicks Sabu for another Angels Wings. Sabu grabs his foot though, spins him around and gives him a forearm back into the ropes. He whips him off the ropes and clotheslines him on the rebound. Sabu goes up top again, Arabian Skull crusher, rolls  over on daniels and gets the win.

There are after the points. However, you should try and answer each question as best you can. That is what the people on the sharp end of the leaderboard do. I can claim to have some knowledge of rugby as a member of the ACT Brumbies.

When I was a kid playing tennis at our local park with my friends, I remember dreaming of the pro tour. We were all pretty decent players, but I remember going to my first big junior tournament. I ended up losing both the matches I played to kids in my age group. I then realized how much work was ahead of me. I spent the next few years going to junior clinics and private lessons. It was a great experience and I really improved. I never realized the dream of being on the pro tour that I had as a 12 year-old kid, but that's because I had to decide between devoting my life to tennis (spending hours per day on court and in lessons) or pursuing my education.\n\nThat being said, some kids are born with the special combination of hand-eye coordination and athletic ability that enables them to be a professional tennis player even if they pick up their first racquet at 16 years old. So, if your son started at 5, I wouldn't worry too much about that. Heck, even if he isn't dominating high school varsity players while still in middle school he can still make it to the pro tour. The secret is by being good enough to play D1 tennis. If he plays at the NCAA D1 level, he'll then have the chance to succeed, play in challenger tournaments, and gain an ATP ranking.\n\nHowever, if his dream is of being the next Federer, then he really should be dominating every tournament he enters on both the city-wide level, but also the USTA regional tournaments. He should be one of the top players in the state. If this isn't the case, he can still make it, but it's going to take lots of effort. Jim Courier is a good example of a former pro who wasn't blessed with a lot of physical ability, but through 'blood, sweat, and tears' was able to turn the ability that he did have into a style of play that led him to success on the pro tour.\n\nIf you want more information on tournaments--because they're really the key to becoming a pro player--then I recommend the USTA website. I'll include several links in the sources for you (a link to the USTA junior tournament page, to the USTA future champions page, and to the USTA sections page--where you'll be able to go to your region's website and find more information on regional and local tournaments).\n\nAnyway, I hope that everything works out, and that I was able to help.
heck no.  There's more to life than little kids playing in the dirt. How can that tear you from your friends?
"it would make sense seeing how they play in the two biggest baseball markets in the world. and also seeing how they are two of the best teams in the league.\n\nit's an ""all star"" game, not a ""best players"" game.\nfans dont wanna see the best players, they want to see the biggest stars, stars who are concentrated in the large markets for many reasons."
The hot rumor is that he might be going to Boston. Check the link for more details. \n\nPersonally, I don't think it will happen. The scenerio would have to be right and multiple teams would have to be involved, which means they'd have to match up a lot of different contracts.  Also, I can't see Philly trading him to a division rival like Boston.  If he did get dealt, I could see him going to Atlanta. \n\nWho knows, though? Apparently the rumor isn't just smoke blowing.
A  goal  keeper  is  just  an  extra  player  in  each  game. that's  why   ten  players  plus  a  keeper  is  eleven  which  is  an  odd  number. \n   The  ten  players  are  not  supposed  to  touch  the  ball  with  their  hands.  if  they  do  so  intentionally  they  can  get  a  red  or  yellow  card.  and  to  differentiate  the  players from  the  goalkeeper,  the  goalie  must  not  wear  the  uniform  the  other  players  are wearing.  they  should  put  on  diffrent  color,  long  or  shortsleeve.

I am...I want to see the US advance, but I have to admit, John Paintsil of Ghana IS the HERO of the World Cup.
"6'2"" 210lb Oguchi Onyewu better known as Gooch - a defender for the US team is definately the MAN."
"he comes from florida and i think you meant ""bubba"" not ""boogey""."
i thought that too but no theres no relation..........
hes looking sharper than the two previous games...i think he'll score tonight
I think that the whole story has many holes in it.  It is hard to say who is telling the truth.  Her story has been put through the mud- and she seems like the liar.  But the team has not been a picture of perfect behavior.  Who will ever know the truth!!!!!!!
Watching us play in the second half was so surreal it was like a bad dream,it did give us a seriously hot topic that's the talk of the land and 3 points so not as bad as all that and with the draw between Sweden and Trinidad top of the group. I don't have the faintest of what Sven was thinking,Without a striker to play onto Crouch becomes obsolete so if Owen had to come of putting Walcott on would have made more sense than playing Cole behind Crouch. I understand why he Didn't play Rooney,i think we all want to see him play but we can't risk his foot this early in the tournament and we all know it. I would have liked to see Walcott on if Owen absolutely had to come off which i don't think he did,the youngster could be another of our tournament surprises of which we've had a fair few over the years including Owen,Beckham and Rooney... Let's just wait and see... Come on England...
I like it beacause it's so amazing to me i like randy
Winning the champions league is more important cos club teams can have the best players in each country. Country teams are restricted to players their own nationality and they may not have as good players in their side, so that makes the champions league harder to win.
Rb is the position to get, but you don't want to risk wasting a #3 pick on Portis, so throw Tomlinson, Alexander, Barber, Johnson, or Edge up on top of your list.
reminds me of lurch from the adams family (in the face)
When Australia made 434, a world record and South Africa chased it succesfully and made 438 another world record, it means a world record did not exist even for a single day.
FIFA are pathetic and need a revamp through the ranks. As for the referee's, enough said. The world knows the score.

Since everyone has been screaming the same answer I will be a bit more detailed- \nPele ( Real name - Edson Aranxtes Do Nacimento )\nplayed for Brazil in 4 WC - 1958, 1962, 1966, 1970\nplayed in 3 finals & won 3 WC - 1958, 1962, 1970\nscored in all 4 WC\nscored 12 goals for Brazil which is a Brazilian record & 3rd in all time WC list.

"If Federer continues to play beyond his prime (as sports figures sometimes do) , yes - he could get knocked off. But, as long as he continues to perform at full strength as he is now (despite his French Open loss today to the ""master of clay"") I don't see it happening. If Federer chooses to continue to play for a few more years, his uniform will forever hang from the rafters of ever major tournament site as the best player of all time. And that is saying a lot!"

I don't think they are the biggest actors or girls, I think they are the biggest idiots!

I was wondering the same thing.\n\nAfter looking for a few hours, it seems the real question is not the boat, as they are very close to equal\n\nThe question is with whom (you have to like the people in the fleet) and where (small lake, local wind) you would race.

lol this is a funny question. haha are you planing on crusing in your golf cart? anyway, you would want to lift up the seat and expose the cart's engine (if it's gas powered) and electrical wiring. follow the gas pedal through the floor of the cart and through the other side. turn the car off and step on the gas to make sure you got it right (you will see a bar move under the seat) look for a small circular metal piece on the bar (this is the governor, you will notice that when you step on the gas, this stops the bar hooked onto the pedal from getting very far). there should be a screw in the governor so you can move it up and down. it would probably be smarter to loosen the screw and move it as far away on the bar from the gas pedal as you can go, but if you want to take it off you will need a wrench and you can just pry it off. cover the seat back up, start the engine, and you're ready to cruise!
I do. And I expect him to score too. Go Sanchez, Go!!

Another abnormal thing is India winning nothing in every olympics. This is because India lacks sports culture in general, sports is just not given enough importance. Also add the fact that the whole nation is totally in love with cricket which is faboulously marketed. The Indian FA is just not rich enough for the betterment of the game. One thing i might mention India did get an invitation in 1950 WC in Brazil. But at that time FIFA had introduced the new rule that all players must wear boots. Indian players were not used to it & FA could not afford it also as India had just got her independence in 1947 & was economically unstable. Secondly  we might not be in the WC but we do have world's second largest football stadium in the world Yuva Bharti Krirangan in Kolkata which can sit 150,000 people.

"Sven has already chosen his penlties takers should he need them. He chose:\nFrank Lampard,\nDavid Beckham,\nMichael Owen \nand Stevie Gerrard as his first four, then \nAshley Cole, Owen Hargreaves or John Terry.\nNot a bad choice if you ask me! As long as he doesn't go for Crouch we should be fine! Sven even said he hadn't picked Crouch as a penalty taker but he got ""caught in the moment"" in the Jamaica game and allowed Crouch to take it."
HARTFORD ROCKS!
Miro Klose and the best keeper is Jens Lehmann :-)
Yes, he was right
No more than that Italian goal against the US.
Um, I wonder if the guy who gave a baseball answer is kidding. \n\nAnyway, I actually predicted that Chris Paul would win rookie of the year last year before the NBA draft even started. But, last year that wasn't such a big deal, because a lot of people predicted him to win it.  This year, it's a little trickier and will depend a lot on what situations players end up in.  Brandon Roy is the most NBA ready, which gives him a clear advantage.  Adam Morrison is competitive and intense enough to put up big numbers in the right situation.  Randy Foye or Rudy Gay are in the same boat.  \n\nI'm going to say that Brandon Roy wins rookie of the year. In my mock draft, I have him getting traded to Houston for Shelden Williams (8th pick) and Luther Head (that's a big rumor that's floating around). Roy would be the third option there, which would be ideal for his skill set.  He'll be used in a variety of different ways and should get a lot of open looks with Ming and T-Mac commanding much of the attention.
The time out rule was changed after the 76 Finals, in which Paul Westphal of the Phoenix Suns called a time out (which the Suns didn't have)... Jo Jo White converted the free throw, putting the Celtics up by two.  But the Suns then were awarded the ball at mid-court, and Garfield (yup, that's his first name) Heard threw up a shot from about 20-25 feet out to send the game into a third overtime. There was no three-point rule at the time.\n\nAfter that, the rules were changed so that no additional time outs would be awarded.  But under the rules at that time, calling an extra time out would cost a technical foul, but you could still get the ball out at mid-court.\n\nTeams get too many time outs as it is... last night, for example, the cameras clearly showed Pat Riley signaling for a 20 second time out, yet they went to a commercial break at that time, AFTER they showed a replay of the previous score...These TV time outs are ridiculous.\n\n\nCalling a timeout in the college game doesn't advance the ball (to midcourt) the way the NBA does.  It just results in a technical foul (as Webber found out).  But that's why Webber had to bring the ball up before he took that time out...in college, when you call a time out after a made basket, you still have to advance the ball 94 feet.
I think it is b) 1998yrs. write code 096 22 00 01
they're gud thats why they are here.... senegal and turkey were in the previous world cup but within 4 years didn't prove them so........\n\nEvery team in this cup is gud...
Don't get too excited about Selecao adding another star. Obviously, they are good and will progress into the next stage but teams like Italy, Czech Republic, Germany, Holland and England, won't be pusovers.\n\nAnd you have to go way back to 1958, for them win a cup in Europe. No small task. As good as they are going forward, they aren't the best at defending.\n\nRemember that there so many ways to lose a game, but only 1 way to win.

the team that eliminate FRANCE in their last world cup qualifying match. prior to the 1994 finals BULGARIA have not won any matches in the finals.

They lost again in the 3rd place match against SWEDEN 4-0. \n\nHristo Stoichkov, Emil Kostadinov & Yordan Lechkov are the best known players from BULGARIA.

"It is nothing more than a silhoutte of a batter.

Rugby players, 'cause you need leather balls to play.
Each team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team; this is usually seven. The goalkeeper is the only player allowed to handle the ball with his hands or arms, but is restricted to doing so within the penalty area in front of his own goal. Though there are a variety of positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a manager or coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.
It is really hard to tell cuz we all see the scores!
WTF hahahahaha
The same thing that's gonna happen to Mexico when they have to play a good team.  The US are the Concacaf champions, so this pretty much means it's over for any concacaf team.  \n\nCongrats czechs, your team played an awesome match.
West Germany winning in 1954. They beat the Hungarians in the final a team which had been unbeaten for the previous 3 years and over 50 matches and had beaten them 8-3! in the earlier rounds. The country was struggling after the devastation of WWII and was expected to be knocked out in the group stages.

they are playing like a real contender..germany match is a must watch for me..as they are one of the best team and individual performance..the one i like the most is bastian schweinsteiger..he created many quality chances and good moves..great ball feeder..and is a versatile player..can play on either side in the midfield..
Robert Fredrick Chelsea Moore born April 12th 1941, suffered from cancer from the age of 24 he was awarded the O.B.E in 1967 and succumbed to bowel cancer on February 24th 1993. So I can only imagine that`s what your on about but it was nothing to do with the World Cup being stolen
If the stadium does not sell out, then they black out the game so you can't watch it from home. They want to fill the seats before they allow television viewers freebies.  Ask the Oakland Raiders fans. I believe they've only watched two home games the last two seasons on TV.
The questioner is not being racist.  The All Blacks is the name of the New Zealand Rugby Union team.\nAs for where they are staying, I cannot tell you, for security reasons, plus I do not know :).

Only if you're comparing players who get bogus calls from the referees.
A hand-check is when the defensive player puts his arm against the offensive player to try to slow him down. \n\nA Pump-fake is when the offensive player with the ball motions as if he is going to shoot the ball but holds back, hoping his defender will jump out of position, so he can drive to the basket or take an open shot.
i have a flatline barrel and dusk is a recomennded brand.  i have had a hard time finding them because no one around my place carries them.  i have shot other paintballs through there and those have performed the best.  they lose the least amount of accuracy and dont have as much of a tendency to break when shot out of a flatline like some other brands ihave tried
Spain v Ukraine 3-1
I'd pick him if it came to a penalty shoot out - he's the best shot blocker in England - it's just the rest of goalkeeping (handling crosses, positioning at free kicks, getting caught out of his area etc) he's rubbish at.  He also has a better chance of actually scoring a penalty than many of the England outfield....
yess!!!

Kai Johannson, Erik Sorenson, and Orjan Persson all played for Rangers around that time and I think they all came from Morton.
Umpires can and will reverse a call if they realize they made a mistake, several times over the past and present seasons I have seen the umpires gather together to discuss the call and sometimes they will change it and make the right call if it's agreed by the group that it needs changed. It is very hard to change a call on a bang, bang play. The umps have to make their best judgment call and leave it at that.
200\nHe's toooooooo old to be a player
Yeah it looked as if it hurt!  Lets just hope its nothing too serious and he will be back playing soon - he hasn't been very lucky this season with injuries.\nLets just hope Rooney doesn't get injured now!!!
go outside your house make a left go down three blocks make a right look across the street and theres a card shop called YOUR SACRAMENTO QUEENS

i hope UCLA but it looks like UNC so far!!
i recall one match in English Premier League between two North London rivals, Arsenal & Tottenham Hotspur few years ago, it finished 5-4 to Arsenal. \n\nso far, none i've seen in the world cup but the closest one probably in 1966 World Cup quarter-finals when PORTUGAL beat NORTH KOREA 5-3.
no way Brazil a way better than Germany
"After reading the other answers I guess everyone is right. I've used both and they each have pros and cons.\nYes a simi- can shoot again when you don't want it to. But they also help you get back on target faster for a 2nd shot.Double barrels can also fire a second shot in recoil, especially one with a single trigger. Both of these issues are controllable with training and practice.\nOver and unders have become the rage the past few decades, they do seem to point better than a sidexside but I'm not convinced they shoot any better. And since sporting clays started they cost a bunch more than they used to.\nIf your daughter  shoots her 20 ga. well she shouldn't have any trouble keeping up with the 12s. (Watch the Big guys at a trap shoot. A lot of them are using 28s or even .410 to cut down on recoil. They do fine) In plastic targets it's where you put the shot more than how much you put up. Granted larger gauges have more shot but if you keep the target in the center of the shot pattern you'll get the bird wheather the pattern is 20"" or 40"".Chokes are important too.\nMy advise would be to spend time at the range and talk to the people who are shooting. Many of the shooters are more than happy to give advise and I think you will find some that would even be willing to let your girl shoot a round or two with their shotgun. Usually you can rent guns at the ranges and that would be another way to see which style she prefers.\nThe bottom  line is gun fit and practice. Get a gun she likes. Make sure the stock fits her. And let her practice as much as she can.\n12 ga. should't be too much for a girl her age, but if it hurts her to shoot it she will never shoot it well.\nHope that helps.\nD"

Martin, I've seen both and I believe that Russell will wind up being a 30-30 guy. He also has the defensive catching skills of a guy 10 years older. Makes me glad to be a Dodger fan with Aybar, Martin, Ethier and Kemp all getting significant playing time. Reminds me of the early 70's...
Maybe you need to learn how to be a fisher of men read the Gospels Matt mark Luke john they talk about fishing and how they fed a multitude of people with just a couple of fish and Jesus told them were to put there net to catch so many they couldn't even pull their net in and they thought for sure there wasn't any fish there before that. maybe you should visit some other \nchurch i think church is awesome. hope you have fun fishing.
They have to get their act together if they want to stay. I was very dissapointed with the game against the Czechs, their attacks just evaporated and they kept on kicking it back to the goalie and ahhhhh(don't get me started that match really got to me);)
Yes. Check out these websites.
Okay, this is a very very very difficult question, b/c there is not an exact science to it. \nNow, obviously each purse for each race is different. Obviously a race like the Daytona 500 has a bigger purse than say Pocono. The purses at each track are split up amongst the field a little differently at each track. If you go to Nascar.com it will list the winnings for each driver for the race. \nThe driver perfoms on Sunday, and depending on the laps he might have led, and his finishing position is what he walks home with. Now, the general number for a lot of the Cup series contract varies around the 40% range, but a lot of that can depend on your sponser's, your owner, your committment to the teams, and of course the team size (from the CC all the way down to the floor sweeper) and the other parts of teh teams success.  Obviiously the bigger the driver you are, the more money that goes directly into your wallet. But, if you take a look at someone like Jeff Gordon who runs for HMS, but also co-owns the #48 car his numbers will vary quite a bit, b/c the money he does make also have to go back into the team.  \nSo once again, there is no exact science and those specific numbers for each contract are kept pretty hush hush.
Normally they are 70-72. I know one course that is 73 but there aren't too many of those
"B is a step up from novice/beginner,  BB is the next level up from B (intermediate) and A is advanced.  Sometimes, there will be a AA division as well, which is even more advanced than A.  \n\nIf a tournament has an OPEN division, that is the highest division offered.  If I were you, I would only sign up for OPEN if I were REALLY GOOD  & had won some AA tournaments.\n\nIn my experience, in BB, the people are pretty good, but they don't even know where they are going to hit, so it makes it difficult to defend.  Sometimes a lot of VERY SLOPPY PLAY.\nIn A, the players are better than B & have more control in their serving & hitting.  If you are good defensively, you might be able to ""read"" where they will hit.  These players, however, will be better at placing the ball on the court & can be tricky!\nAA & OPEN players will be VERY GOOD & can almost always put the ball anywhere on the court."

If you've already tried Jo Anns, Wal-Mart, or another fabric shop and there isn't any available - you could try EBay or some other type of on-line fabric store.  As a matter of fact Jo-Anns and Wal-Mart both I believe, sell fabric online.  I would maybe do a Yahoo! search for Yankee's fabric and see what comes up.  :)  Good luck!
That means the # of times they've represented their country internationally.
God - she was hot.  Thanks for sparking some memories of her for me.  Wow.
they missed their chance with the homecooking referees four years ago....China will soon dominate the Asian countries.
Germany .. Argentina wasnt that good against Holland and Mexico while Germany were strong and played very well in their last 2 matches .
No, they just suck.
I think america looks strong today. Maybe if they got some decent calls from ther refees they might have a chance.
Of course, now that the Empire is gone, all they have to cling to is the fact that they invented a sport that they quickly became mediocre at compared to the rest of the world. I mean, when that is your only accomplishment, winning the World Cup SHOULD be talked about 300-400 years later.\n\nGive those sorry saps a break!

Cheerleading is definitely a sport and I really don't think we get the credit that we deserve. We work our butts off 5 or 6 days of a 7 day week, support Football, Basketball, Wrestling, Soccer...(almost all sports!) We tumble, dance, and stunt. \nA sport is a competitive physical activity right? Well, isn't that basically what cheer is?\nCheer is competitive as well as physical....\nWe attend competitions, just as football players compete in games. Cheer is one of the most hardcore sports out there! Not to mention the most dangerous! People really need to cut us a break. Whoever says cheer is not a sport serisously needs to reevauate what a sport actually is!
"It's pretty unlikely but I'm really not too familiar with those kinds of pools. I was thinking your actual pool so my initial reaction was ""No way!"" but I'm not too sure.

Its a long and costly process unless you have a rich uncle that is gonna give you at least a million.\n\nFirst you need a demo of your item that you have created and tweeked as far as you can.  Then you need to hire an engineer to draw it up in CAD to true dimensions, etc.  Then you need to find a plant that will make the product and have them run a test product for you.  Just this stage alone can cost $30,000-100,000.\n\nOnce you have a true test product then you need to find a testing board and have them test your product to ensure there is a market for it.  Otherwise manufacturers won't want to deal with you as it will be a waste of their time.\n\nOnce you get past all those stages, normally at least a year if this is all you are working on full time, you move onto manufacturers and distributors.  Normally a manufacturer will want to start with at least 100,000 pieces if not more.  They won't do 50 pieces or what not.\n\nPlus during all this you need an attorney to have the item patented, copyright, trademarked or any of them that may apply to it.  Since it is an item that be rode, bike, I am sure a government safety board will have to put their seal on it as well.\n\nThe only way around all of this is to find a local custom fabricator that will make the item for you.  It will cost you more per item this way and you will be able to produce far less items.  A custom guy cannot keep up with a store's inventory let alone going all over the USA.  Plus going this route doesn't stop anyone else from stealing your idea and patenting it themselves blocking you from your very creation.\n\nThe last resort is to get at least a copyright or trademark on the idea/item and have a test demo of the item.  Then approach large companies that are already mass producing bikes and try to sell them on the idea.  Normally this route they will buy your idea from you for a flat fee of like $100,000 to 1/4 million, not much more.  While they make the millions in profit from the idea.\n\nBeing an inventor is just about impossible anymore unless you work for a large company that just takes the ideas you create.
Iran is as good as mexico, but didnt play as well as mexico. They had more shots on target, three goals, and have a good chance of winning their next match against Angola.

yes it is true\nEduardo Gory Guerrero Llanes (October 9, 1967 – November 13, 2005),\nAn autopsy revealed that Guerrero died as a result of acute heart failure, caused by undiagnosed arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease and enlargement of the heart as a result of prior anabolic steroid abuse. Although Guerrero had not taken alcohol or illicit drugs for over four years, his past excesses contributed to his heart failure. At the time of his death, he had recently used narcotic painkillers.\n\nGuerrero's wife Vickie said that he had been lethargic and unwell in the week preceding his death, but that this had been attributed to the stress of continuously traveling and performing. She added that the doctors had told her that Guerrero's blood vessels had shriveled and weakened owing to undiagnosed heart disease, and that he had simply dropped into a deep sleep.\n\nOn the November 30, 2005 edition of WWE Byte This!, Chavo Guerrero, Jr. said that Guerrero had been working very hard and was at peak physical fitness as a result, doing cardiovascular and weight training exercises every day. There had been no symptoms or cause for concern. Guerrero, Jr. noted that, while many people abuse drugs for over ten years with no ill effects, Guerrero, despite having ceased to abuse drugs four years earlier, had suffered heart complications that were not detected in time to prevent his death.

Greetings from inside the Yahoo Brain in New York City!\nHope you're catching the live webcast at: http://advision.webevents.yahoo.com/asktheplanet/brain.html !\n\nNicest park I've attended is Orioles Park at Camden Yards.  Just beautiful.  That complex also houses the best NFL football stadium as well, M&T Bank Stadium.\n\nBut the BEST park is by far Yankee Stadium.  If you walk into a game there, fully packed with 50,000 fans (as most are), you can't help but get goosebumps as you almost feel the electricity and history.  It's great.\n\nConversely Shea Stadium, in which I've watched dozens and dozens of games, is a total DUMP, and the worst park in the major leagues, as constantly voted by players and fans alike.  Thankfully the Mets and their loyal fans are going to be rewarded with a new stadium soon.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n--J.

Are you really that upset over Kacey Keller that you posted so many questions about him?
Supressors or silencers, are LEGAL in many areas of the US today (arizona, being one).\nConstruction can be rather simple.  The lengthy answer posted above describes what one is, but does little to help you build one.\ndepending on the power of your cartridge, you should attempt to have an outer tube of roughly 3 times the outer diameter of the barrell of the gun.\nwashers drilled to .05 inch larger than the bullet  (THIS must be precisely centered) welded to either end.  Internally you may use several methods\n1. the close stacked method.  This uses a series of hard and soft spacers, typically made of steel washers and 3M green scrubbing pad-type material (the kind used for scouring pots and pads) packed alternating materials until the tube is full.\na nut is centered and welded onto one of the end washers.\nThis is a heavy and not completely silent supressor, but it is cheap and easy to build\nthe second type follows current auto and motorcycle muffler design.\nagain starting with an outer tube and end washers correctly drilled.\ninside there is a steel screen or perforated sheet of steel rolled in a diameter slightly larger than the bullet, so as not to contact the bullet.  the space between the screen and the outer tube is stuffed with either fiberglass or steel wool.  If using steel wool, it is recommended to use various grades to help absorb a wider range of frequencies.\nThis type of supressor is musch lighter and efficient and lasts a VERY long time.  the drawback is that it takes a much more skilled hand to fabricate.\n\nENJOY!
It is not an offence in itself to be in an offside position. \nA player in an offside position is only penalised if, at the moment the ball touches or is played by one of his team, he is, in the opinion of the referee, involved in active play by:\n- interfering with play or\n- interfering with an opponent or\n- gaining an advantage by being in that position
i think he will because he should have been one last year but he got cheated. he will also lead the nuggets to a championship soon. carmello RULES!!!!!!!!!
The place your purchased it, if it's a name brand most of the time the company want charge you for them.  The bag dealers have several extras on hand most of the time.
i so agree with you the footballers thees days go down as soon as they get touched i fully agree with you good statement
I think what it is referring to is the lack of accountability by all referee's in alot of different sports.  True soccer referee's (which I happen to be on for 7 years) are out there on an island and we have the benefit of watching replays, but all officials should have some sort of grading system or be called out when they make a mistake.  If I make a mistake at my job, I get called on it.  What makes officials, especially soccer referee's immune to it?
Sweat maybe!!!!!!

Dara Singh (born November 19, 1928) is a wrestler and film actor from Amritsar, Punjab (India) in India.[1] He was a well-known wrestler before he started acting in Hindi films in 1962.[2]\n\nHe is a former multi-timer World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion. Dara Singh has competed against some of the greatest names in wrestling history including the great Lou Thesz whom he defeated.\n\nDara Singh is from India's state of Punjab. Due to his physique [3] he was encouraged to study Pehlwani, an Indian style of wrestling, in the milked sand wrestling pits of India called akhara. Dara Singh was a favourite in wrestling tournaments in India. In addition to this he wrestled on invitation of the kings of various Indian princely states and wrestled frequently in haats and meals (fairs and carnivals). He also successfully competed against professional wrestlers in the United States.\n\nUpon his return to India he gained unprecedented popularity by having bouts of wrestling across the country in the 1940s and 50s. He than translated this to celluloid fame by making a large number of B grade films which had him in the lead. One of his noticeable finds was the actress Mumtaz. He then went on to 1980s and 90s T.V fame when he played the role of Hanuman in the television adaptation of the epic Ramayana. The series is amongst the most widely viewed in history. He has acted in over 100 films
Germany! Home ground support, refferies are there for them as well as fifa and blatter
Ur  automatically  right.  They  have  cost  so  many  teams.  so  many  handballs  on  eighteen,miss using  red cards  and  yellow  cards,finding  more  fouls  in  a  team  than  the  other.  sometimes,  its  like  they favor  other  teams in  expense  of  the  other. this  really makes  me  sick. \n         they(the  stupid  referees ) should  be  paid  according  to  the  accuracy  of  the  game. this  will  make  them more  attentive  and  fair. I  know  they  are  human, but  some  go  away  too  far. whats  the  stuff  on  their  ears.isn't  it  a  communication  device. who  do  they  damn talk  to  and  why  are the  mistakes  increasing  after  every  game.\n           fifa  should  evolve  soccer  refereeing  like  other  sports.i  mean use  the  current  technology.

That is some good shit
Clemens better earn his money!! There is a whole lot of hype in Houston over him and his son playing together in the minors. It is nuts!!  The team seems to be more motivated with him playing.  I am an avid Astros fan.  I feel he better EARN his money and not just create hype that I am quite sick of.  He is being payed to pitch.  I will be very disappointed if he does not win a lot of games!  I think he HAS to be worth the money!
buffon has been the best keeper in the world for awhile now although he has a couple of years on cech he is still the best, although casillas is to be considered
"Caps - the number of times a player has represented his country's team\n\nA cap is an appearance for the international team for which he is elegible. The term can be applied to any sport and any nationality of player. The term dates from the practice in the United Kingdom of awarding a cap (meaning an item of headgear) to every player in an international match. The practice was first approved on May 10, 1886 for Association Football, after a proposal made by N. L. Jackson, an Old Corinthian:\n\n""That all players taking part for England in future international matches be presented with a white silk cap with red rose embroidered on the front. These to be termed International Caps.""\n\nActual caps are not usually given anymore (caps for friendly matches still exist, and each player gets one cap per international competition), but the term ""cap"" for an international appearance has been retained. Thus, a ""cap"" is awarded for each game played and so a player who has played x games, for the team, is said to have been capped x times or have won x caps."
because they suck. Beasley was horrible the whole tournament, Donovan didn't do much. The team has no difference makers, nobody the other teams have to watch for, like a Wayne Rooney, or M. Klose from Germany.  All of our best players play in the midfield or defense, i.e.- Gooch, Pope.  Also, Clint Dempsey should have gotten more time.
Maybe but come on people, give the guy a break. Every excuse under the sun is being offered for Brazil, the team's, performance V's Croatia, so maybe there is an underlying problem people are not aware of with him. So he is over  weight, he is not the only one. He gets paid an obscene amount of money to represent his country, he is not the only one. How quickly one falls from grace in the eyes and hearts of admirers after a bad display. I'm not a huge fan of him but certainly appreciate and respect his enormous talent. He deserves an opportunity to redeem himself. If he fails we will all have the answer.
yes , atleast it will increase the percentage that the winner is from Africa.\nit is not denied though that it won't be easy but look at Egypt , for example, it won the CAF. The team has alot of brilliant players like: Mido.......and they need the chance to play and experience a worlwide event like this so i think the answer would b YES!!
Because the frustration sitting sidelined on the bench finally got to him. He looked absolutely miserable the last couple of games (not that he ever really looks all that happy). The whole German team was ecstatic, jumping up and down after each win...and there was Kahn looking ticked off. \n\nThe German press probably kept hounding Olli and Spiegel probably wanted the exclusive, so they ran it before anyone else did….that’s how they sell magazines. Dirty laundry sells….the WM is just secondary for them. \n\n\nThe Bild Zeitung already ran this article today: \nhttp://www.bild.t-online.de/BTO/sport/wm2006/aktuell/06/26/kahn-bank-frust/kahn-bank-frust.html\n\nI totally agree it was a shitty thing to do…especially since spirits are so high now, the German fans are behind their team, und the Mannschaft should be focusing on more important things: Argentina and the Finale.  \n\nGo Deutschland!!!
Women's hockey made its Olympic debut at the 1998 Games in Japan.\n\nWomen and girls have taken to ice hockey in unprecedented numbers since the early 1990s. Female leagues and co-ed programs have changed the face of the game in many communities, and elite women's hockey has emerged as an intercollegiate and Olympic sport.\n\n\nthere were Olympic games in 1980\nThe 1980 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XIII Olympic Winter Games, were held in 1980 in Lake Placid, New York, United States of America. Another candidate city was Vancouver-Garibaldi, British Columbia, Canada; they withdrew before the final vote.\nThe 1980 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXII Olympiad, were held in Moscow in the Soviet Union. Another candidate in the bid to organize the Olympics was Los Angeles. The choice between them was made on October 23, 1974 on the 75th IOC session. Moscow defeated Los Angeles by 39 votes to 20. The yachting events were held in Tallinn; preliminary matches and the quarter-finals of the football (soccer) tournament were held, besides Moscow, at the stadiums of Leningrad, Kiev, and Minsk.

I don't think they cared about what they saw - just who saw them! :)\n\nNice to see another Chelsea supporter :) Maybe we should share all the points on here lol
Ronaldo is also not 100% he has the world cup curse that he suffered from in 98. \nHe is still one of the best players in the world. He isn't that old yet but Robinho is certainly a star in waiting.
i laughed my a** off. Gordon is sucking so much lately it pleases me to no end to see him hit the wall and fall outta the top 10 in points.

RUSSIAN SOCCER IS NOT EVEN KNOWN.  WELL NOT IN THE DOMINATING LEAGUES.  WHY U RUSSIAN?  IM GUATEMALAN AND PROUD OF MY TEAM EVENTHOUGH THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN TO A WORLD CUP EVER.  HOW DO YOU THINK??:)
"a team captain is one who motivates and encourages the team, usually the team votes on who will ""lead"" the team. the captains are the ones the team looks up to. a team would still be fine without a captain, but it seems as if a player will work harder to either to win the role as captain or the team is more organized with someone to lead them in warm-up. basically the captain is the spirt of the team, a light of hope by encouraging the team even as they lose. :)"
75% Portugal wins.\n\nRonaldo WILL be back, Maniche is the MAN, we don't need the handball playing Costinha, Scolari's appealing to FIFA to have Deco's senseless red card overturned....and even if Figo's is suspended for his tap on Van Bommel's coconut, we've got others to cover the pitch.\nYellow cards or no yellow cards.
what in the hell does have to do with boxing
Throwing in general is done with your legs, with that energy transferred through your trunk to your shoulders and arms.\n\nI'm sure you're already on a total workout program, but don't skimp on the abdominals work.  If your abs aren't strong, the energy generated by your legs can be lost there.\n\nAlso, throw a LOT.  That's really the only way to get increases in velocity.  I played baseball over the summer and that was really the only throwing I did.  Then in 10th grade, I played football (QB) and baseball (Catcher).  By the time I graduated, I was throwing over 80mph, just in those three years because I threw so much.

i'd go with sandy koufax or satchel paige.\ni dont think nolan ryan should be in your first four, there are a bunch of pitchers better than he was including dizzy dean, christy mathewson, bob feller, greg maddux, juan marichal, walter johnson, tom seaver, don drysdale.\n\nalso, catfish hunter is definetly not better than any of those guys.\n\n\nagain, with the relievers, mariano rivera is simply the greatest. dennis eckersly, gossage, sutter, wagner, others come to mind as great relievers.\n\nbaseball prospectus said that the greatest single season closer-setup combination was the '04 rivera-gordon team.

A l'origine, le club s'appelait ATAC (Association Troyes Aube Champagne). Quand le club a commencé à s'affirmer sur la scène nationale, les dirigeants ont préféré changer de nom, craignant des démélés avec la chaîne de supermarchés eponyme. Le club fut ainsi rebaptisé ESTAC (Esperance Sportive Troyes Aube Champagne).

Parce que les bleus sont eux aussi devenus une équipe moyenne.\nIl n'y pas à en avoir honte d'ailleurs. Ca arrive à beaucoup de pays de devoir reconstruire une nouvelle équipe après la fin d'une génération, surtout lorsqu'on s'est entêté à garder les anciens...\nLes Pays Bas viennent de le faire avec Marco Van Basten qui a très courageusement écarté tous les cadres de l'équipe (à l'exception de Cocu et Van Nistelroy). Fallait oser, il l'a fait. Nous, non.
je trouve que c'est bien pour djibril qui va pouvoir bien recuperer avec un bon staf medicale a l'om et qui va peut etre pouvoir jouer en fin de cette saison ou de pour la saison suivante.ps: moi aussi supporter de lom si vous voulez parler : johnnycheyene@hotmail.fr              bye
Yep.
Parce qu'on est fixé et concentré sur le match et on a pas le temps de lire des question/réponses qui défilent.....
Assuming you are interested in irons?\n\nReading the answers so far makes me somewhat sad.  So many people answer based on marketing hype or just what they hear.  First of all, most US golf companies do not manufacture their clubs.  They are basically designing and marketing operations and outsource manufacturing to overseas companies.  (Ping is an exception to this).\n\nNext, Mizuno is without a doubt the best irons manufacturer.  There are only three forging houses in the world that make high quality irons.  These are Mizuno, Miura, and Endo.  While these all produce top notch products, most industry insiders still give the edge to Mizuno.  (US brands that offer forged clubs usually outsource to Endo).  Rather than look at what the pro's use, look at what they use after their sponsorship contracts expire.
GO BEARS!!  Oops sorry, I could have sworn the category was AMERICAN FOOTBALL!!!!

The two 45 minute halves have a 15 minute halftime between them.\n\nAnd yeah, hopefully the US can make the 2nd half a bit more respectable.

"Hockey gear's great.  I'd feel really, really exposed without it on the ice.\n\nWhen I first started playing, I was wearing a bunch of borrowed equipment that didn't fit, and wasn't used to putting the gear on, and I felt big, bulky, uncoordinated and *stupid.*\n\nNow I'm in gear three or more times a week, and it's like clothes.  My stuff fits, I know how to put it on right and most importantly I know it's going to protect me when I inevitably do crazy cowboy s*** in the game.  When I'm out there, the gear's just part of me; I don't think about it, except to occasionally be extremely glad it's there!\n\nYou're saying ""hockey clothing"" along with ""protective equipment,"" but the only clothing you wear on the ice that isn't equipment is the jersey and I guess your hockey socks.  You can't wear hockey socks as streetwear (unless you like the legwarmer look), and just wearing a jersey is something people do all the time (although game jerseys are made to go over gear and so they always look too big -- I think it looks kind of silly).\n\nWould you wear your gear on the street?  LOL  No.  For a start, unless it was dead of winter you'd die of heat.  Plus, it's just not made to be worn around like that, and there'd be no reason to.  \n\nMy favorite part of my gear next to my skates are my gloves.  They're like old friends.  Comfortable, worn over time to fit my hands and no one else's, and they mean hockey.  They mean a sure grip on my stick, they mean business, they mean hockey."
of course no, or every one will be competing to score own goals. then the aim of the game will be to run in the opposite direction and prevent others from scoring own goal. but if that is the case, own goal will be called goals
"No doubt that both fantastic players.\n\nHernan Crespo is a typical penalty box striker and there are not too many players who play this position better than the Argentine striker.\n\nCarlos ""Carlito"" Teves is an altogether different type of striker, he plays in a role similar to Wayne Rooney and links the midfield play to the attack.\n\nCrespo has still got what it takes , But Teves is is only going to get better.\nFor me Teves just wins it.\n\nBut the debate about the best Argentine player at the moment has to be between the FANTASTIC Juan Roman Riquelme and  the BOY WONDER Lionel Messi"

The injuries and Athletics are real, the people are great at what they do, It is mostly scripted, but sometimes they go off on their own and play it by what happens, but dont think for one second that just anyone can do the things they do......It is dangerous
They all got what was coming to them for making HHH and HBK's matches a living hell. As for last night's Raw, I thought it was hilarious, too.
if you know, why did you use a question mark?
It is in favour of Portugeese especially for Christina Ronaldniho.
I don't think it's going to be a favor to have to play Spain in the Round of 16.
who makes the line?\n\nthe betters make the line.  the bookies/off shore betting casinos/las vegas/etc...  want to only get even money on each side.  so they move the line as people bet.  so if team A gets money on it.  They move the line to make it more interesting for people to bet on team B.
try this, lay out a towel folded length-wise in half, place about 4, maybe five balls in the middle, spray with pledge or something similar, carefully wrap up the balls, like a tootsie roll, grasping the ends of the towel, then shake, like length-wise, the ball polish themselves while traveling back and forth in the towel. put more in there as you get used to it, careful to fully wrap them inside so nothing flies out. gl.
Yes, certainly, whenever the Tigers are in a pennant race...(okay, so the last time that happened before this year was 1988, but nonetheless, yes, I scoreboard watch in those situations!)
I've watched Ronnie Brewer at AR since his freshman year and think he will be a tremendous asset to Utah. He scores when he needs to score in so many different ways. Not necessarily a pure shooter but never under estimate his talent - he will find a way to score or pass to someone else who will score. Very smart player.
the postings about 'italy's robbery' are a fine example of modern psychology's phenomenon, the so-called causal attribution error, meaning that if something positive occurs, it's due to one's own action, but if something negative occurs, it's the other's fault...\n\nthe socceroos will definately overcome their loss against italy and yes, it was a penalty-worth foul (as per the FIFA rules, a foul is considered worth a penalty if a player is obstructed by a member of the opponent team and it definately was an obstruction by the australian player), even though the ref's decision might me considered 'undecent', 10 seconds before the match might have gone into overtime...
badges?  we don't need no stinking badges.
It is physical discipline training using obsticles for running, jumping, etc. It originates in France.
There's no such thing as a stupid question.\n\n1. Cap - Number of international matches played.\n2. Shot - says it all\n   Shot on goal - A shot that would've been a goal if no-one stopped/touched it , also if a goal does come from it it is called a shot on goal.\n\n3. They could do that. In 1982 Austria and Germany played a match which if it ended 0-1 both team would qualify and Algeria would be eliminated. Not surprisingly it ended 0-1 and a newspaper the next morning wrote that the only thing they did not do was smoke the peace-pipe together. That match was an embarrasement to FIFA. I think FIFA will do everything they can to prevent this. One measure they have taken is to play the last matches at the same time. And I think that in the regulations there is a paragraph that says that you should do everything within your power to win a match. But that's hard to prove, of course.

Garage sale them.  Give them away.  Put them in the Goodwill box.  Throw them away.\nThey were considered to be a dangerous toy, so maybe that's why e-bay won't let you sell them.\nYou wouldn't get that much money for them anyway!  Give them away.

Of course the U.S needs to look for a better coach.  Though players on the U.S team such as Landon Donovan did not step-up at all in the three games the U.S played, some of this can be credited to the poor management.  For the whole first round, the United States were in the wrong formation.  After clearly seeing that the 4-5-1 didn't work against the Czechs, the formation should have changed and Arena should have played another striker, for this would have opened more opportunities for U.S attack.
Walmart did have them
i tottaly support you!! im so sorry but mexico played so much better!!
They will HAVE to win the next game, and hope that the Swiss don't do very well in their games. Then they may have a chance of going to the second round. It is dissapointing to see them lose, not as a fan (I am not a EU fan), but because of the FIFA ranking them as high, and then seeing consistent low results! I believe the 1998 WOrld Cup was only won by them because they were on their home turf - that is all!

Well, maybe you can still find some books in these old ancient places called library..\nAnother good source is to simply watch the good players and see what they are doing.\nIn old times there was a small booklet e.g. from Franz Beckenbauer that I found quite useful.\nHe not only showed tricks but also had other good tips about how to improve your game.
i think they're gonna go onto the semi-finals against brazil...i hope they win but everyone knows there some big chances that they are gonna lose and go home...so i think they will make it that far
i agree with you. their opponents have no chance to stop england winning the world cup
it could be brazil or argentina
cz it's an international sports event that comes only every 4 years. something new other than wars and summits!

sure, they're already in the semi-finals... they only have to beat Germany... (they beat germany just a couple of weeks before the beginning of the world cup, 3-1)

Some of these answers would be funny if not for the thought y'all believe it. \nAnyone wear a BELT? Next time you see someone wearing a belt notice how they jump and spin and hop around. :-D \n\nThere is a flank strap. it is NOT a rope tightened around the genitals - that is a false statement by people who have never been to a rodeo. If they had they'd see it's not a rope - it's a leather strap usually with fleece on it - basily a belt. It is well in front of the genitals. \nFurthermore - there is a way with ropes if it's tightened enough it touches nerves and renders the animal unable to move. This used to be done to work on animals on farms before cattle chutes were routine. If it were TIGHT ropes the bull would be unable to move. \nThe strap does not hurt them...it makes them buck higher. That's it. They're bred to buck and bred for attitude. For the brief time they are bucking there is absolutely no harm done to the animal.

The first modern bowling ball was not introduced until 1905. Before that time, most bowling balls were made of a wood called “lignum vitae,” which was prized both for its light weight and its durability. The first rubber bowling ball hit the market in 1905.

"Coors Field, located in Denver, Colorado is the home field of the National League's Colorado Rockies. It is named for the Coors Brewing Company of Golden, Colorado, which purchased the naming rights to the park prior to its completion in 1995. The Rockies played their first two seasons, 1993 and 1994, in Mile High Stadium before moving to Coors Field, two blocks from Union Station in Denver's Lower Downtown (or LoDo) neighborhood. The park includes 63 luxury suites and 4,500 club seats.\n\nCoors Field has a reputation as a home run-friendly park that, arguably, equals Chicago's venerable Wrigley Field. Though the fences are actually more distant than in most other facilities, the high altitude of the city (which is indeed about one mile above sea level), decreases air resistance on batted balls. Perhaps even more significantly, the low air pressure also causes pitches to break less severely and hence be easier to hit. Other factors include the relatively low height of the fences and very limited foul territory area.\n\nDue to Coors Field's location on Blake Street and its propensity for giving up home runs, Rockies players are informally called the ""Blake Street Bombers.""\n\nCoors Field was originally planned to be somewhat smaller, seating only 43,800. However, after the Rockies' first season, plans were altered during construction, and new seats, mostly in the center field bleacher section, were added. This section has its own informal name: ""the Rockpile.""\n\nWhile most of the seats in Coors Field are dark green, the seats in the 20th row of the upper deck are purple. This marks the city's one mile elevation point.\n\nThe only no-hitter at Coors Field was thrown by Hideo Nomo on September 17, 1996. Another game of note was the 1998 MLB All-Star Game.\n\nThere have been two 1-0 games in Coors Field history: July 9, 2005, when the Rockies beat San Diego and April 16, 2006, when the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Rockies.\n[edit]\n\nExternal links\n\n    * Ballpark Digest visit to Coors Field\n    * Ballparks of Baseball\n    * Coors Field images and information\n    * Aerial photo of Coors Field from Microsoft TerraServer\n    * Aerial Views of Coors Field, StadiumFind.com\n\n\nPreceded by:\nMile High Stadium\n1993–1994 Home of the\nColorado Rockies\n1995–present Followed by:\nCurrent\n\nCoordinates: 39°45′23″N, 104°59′39″W"

"The Wolverine's\n\nWe are noted for the following traits: \n\nStanding Our Ground \nFierceness \nElusiveness \nCleverness \nStrength \nEndurance \nCourage \n\nReal wolverines are so badass the football team can't even have the real ones on the side line in cages \n\nIn 1927, 10 wolverines were obtained from Alaska and placed in the Detroit Zoo. On big football days, two of these wolverines were brought to Michigan Stadium and carried around in cages. \nHowever, the animals grew larger and more ferocious, and as Yost states, "" It was obvious that Michigan mascots had designs on the Michigan men toting them, and those designs were no means friendly."" Therefore the practice of bring wolverines into the stadium had to be discontinued after only one year. However, one of the wolverines was not returned to the zoo. Instead ""Biff"" was put in a cage at the University of Michigan Zoo where students were able to visit him at times. In 1937, the Chevrolet Motor Company donated a wolverine (as well as a cage to keep it in), to the University of Michigan. It was unclear how long this wolverine lasted, but it is known that no live wolverines have been in the stadium in the last half century. \n\n\nIf a Wolverine was the size of a bear it would be the strongest animal on the planet.\n\nI know what you should absolutely not name your football team\n\nThe Spartans.... Sparta was the queen the ancient city was named after, her husband was the name of the whole territory. Do you really want to be thought of as someones little sister?...lol"

Fort Minor- Remember The Name
It's not really a tradition so much as a superstition. Players think it brings them bad luck if they step on the foul line while they walk/run on and off the field. A lot of players refuse to do so, not just pitchers. I did the same thing when I played ball in highschool and college and I do the same thing now when I play rec league softball.
USA got a very good draw against Italy. Wise up you guys. I think the worst so far was Poland...we expected more from them. Even Brazil...they are playing like a Real Madrid junior girls eleven.
I'm a maverick fan,seen every,EVERY game they've played the last 3 yrs.and most of them before that.what i saw last night in game 3 was among the most courageous performances i've ever seen.wade put the heat on his back and willed a win.i saw the diesal roll up on him,his knee is hurt,i will bet after this is over it will require surgery.to see a team that puts 5 players on the court at the same time get overtaken by a cast of 1,with NO support was incredible.
yes.  I am totally into this World Cup too.
I actually preferred a mountain bike with the narrowest semi-slick tyres I could find for riding regularly in London traffic, but thankfully I don't have to do this anymore. It looked strange with Marzocchi race forks, but had a good riding position, was fast, could jump over traffic islands and I never had an on-road accident on it in years of London (ab)use.\n\n Commuting just under 40 miles a day outside London, I used to mainly use an Italia fixed wheel machine from Condor in Grays Inn Road. This was practically maintainance free and very unattractive to thieves - the complete bike with aluminium frame and carbon forks should be around £600. This was also a wonderful bike for 50 mile training runs on a sunny spring morning and I even used it for youth hostelling.I had great fun on it until my knees gave out - and I'm not blaming that on the bike. The same frameset and forks with a Mirage groupset will cost around £800. A couple of clip on crud guards will make it more practical in British weather.\n\nF W Evans have several branches in South London and a huge stock of 2005 models at discounted prices. Check out http://www.evanscycles.com/ for details. They sell quality gear and the staff are enthusiastic and knowledgable - recommended.\n\nPersonally, I'd scour the ads in Cycling Weekly - I picked up a second hand pro level custom built cyclocross bike here for £500 at a time when the new frame and forks alone would have cost £650. Quality wheels plus Dura Ace and other top end components would have taken it way out of my price range new, but second hand it was cheaper than many entry level bikes. This has prooved to be an amazingly practical bike for everyday use with the addition of an USE suspension seatpost and using 32 mm tyres. There's plenty of clearance to fit clipon guards for road use in winter and it's an awesome tool for blasting down bridleways and canal towpaths in three seasons a year. Mine was made in 853 by a Manchester based firm called Atom.\n\nSteel will be more comfortable than aluminium and you can afford decent steel if you're buying second hand. Anything that fits you and has a Reynolds 531, 653 or 853 frame will be suitable, as would bikes using equivalent Italian steels from Deda or Columbus. The best all round compromise for speed, comfort and weather protection will be an audax bike. Anything by Chas Roberts, Bob Jackson, Brian Rourke or Condor is desirable and offerings from Mercian, Thorn, Ribble and Dawes are well worth investigating. Mine is a Condor which I bought new and there is no way I would want to part with it. It does everthing you want as long as you don't put much more than your wallet, passport, camera, keys, first aid kit and maps in the barbag - it gets twitchy on climbs when you're out of the saddle if you do. The only problem I've had is that the dynamo lighting system they fitted never did work, apart from in their workshop - I got so fed up with taking it in that I just gave up and scrapped it.\n\nI've just modified this after finishing training and hope it's of some small use. You know that whatever you choose is going to be the right choice. Just go for it and enjoy.

1-Bom Bom\n\n2- Richard his brother for becoming an international player and doing well in the Gremio Club
A close call, but I would have to go with Ryan. In his career, Nolan Ryan rarely played on a winning team, which explains his inferior record. How would you explain an 8-16 record in 1987(Astros), despite a 2.76 era. Also, back in 77', he finished 19-16 despite a 2.77 era.On a team with a potent offense, he could have won 25 or more. Meanwhile, the last 10 years Clemens has played for some of the top teams in baseball. Its easy to have a great era when terrific bullpens are always saving your ass. Ryan threw 222complete games in his career, evidence that he often had to go it alone. Meanwhile, between 1999 and 2005, clemens has completed only 4 games. 4!!! games in 7 years? Also, Ryan averaged 9.55 strikeouts per 9 innings, Clemens as of the end of 2005 averaged 8.61. I defenitely believe that if Clemens and Ryan were teamates, that Ryan would have been the better pitcher in the end.

"There are various legends about how the Tigers got their nickname. One has to do with the orange stripes they wore on their black stockings. Another has to do with a sportswriter equating that 1901 Detroit club's opening day victory to the ferocity of his alma mater, the Princeton Tigers.\n\nHowever, the truth is revealed in Richard Bak's 1998 book, A Place for Summer: A Narrative History of Tiger Stadium. In the 19th century, the city of Detroit had a military unit called the Detroit Light Guard, who were known as ""The Tigers."" They had played a significant role in certain Civil War battles and also in the then-recently-fought Spanish-American War. The ballclub had informally acquired that nickname as a minor league club, but upon entry into the majors they sought and received formal permission from the Light Guard to use their trademark, and from that day forth the ballclub was officially the Tigers.\n\nIn short, the Tigers wore stripes because they were already Tigers, rather than the other way around which is the conventional story."

"A clone is a clone basically. They're all made in a similar fashion so there's no real discernable difference from any of them. I purchased a Nike clone set from Golf Components Plus I believe was their name. It was abotu 4 years ago. Anyhoo, it's a really nice set and I have no complaints or problems with them. They're modeled after the Nike muscleback blades, the first set they ever came out with. Obviously not forged but cast but the feel and playability is still there. gives you a good ""feel"" for the real thing. I've known a couple of companies like Warrior Custom (Total Bulls*hit) Dynacraft and Golfsmith are very good. Don't know if you would classify them as clones makers but still make very nice clubs. The clubs I have are muscleback irons so it's kind of hard to find anyone, clone makers, that carry them. as far as your regular clubs, they also have some decent ones as well."
I'm sorry but I have to say I was still running on Pride and adrenalin and far too excited from watching my boy's the Socceroo's defy defeat against Japan and trying to calm down so I could scream all over again for Italy to pay too much attention. But from what I did see I agree with the answerer above in that there was not a great deal of team work developing. They played more like a team of individuals. If that could be addressed they may achieve a better result.

Professional baseball began in the United States around 1865, and the National League was founded in 1876 as the first true major league.\n\nThe teams were: the Athletic of Philadelphia (folded in 1876), the Boston Red Caps (now the Atlanta Braves), the Chicago White Stockings (now the Cubs), the Hartford Dark Blues (folded in 1877), the Mutual of New York (folded in 1876), and the St. Louis Brown Stockings (folded in 1877). They were joined by two others, the Cincinnati Red Stockings (folded in 1880), and the Louisville Grays (folded in 1877).
Against Argentina .. YES THEY BETTER  !!!
On-base percentage is the total number of times you come to the plate divided by the total number of times you reach first base.  It is different from batting average in that walks will now count, in batting average they do not count and don't even look like you have had an at-bat.

The match is about the begin in about 3 or 4 minutes

You are probabily talking about Mané Garrincha, he was really spetacular, he had a problem with his legs, and that gave him an special way to play and confuse the other players. Unfortunately he died poor and almost anonimous, because of his drug problems.

Since you're a beginner and not interested in self defense I would recommend the Ruger MKII or MKIII for a variety of reasons.\n\n1.) It takes .22 LR rounds which are extremely cheap.  Approximately $90 for 2500 rounds in the U.S.\n\n2.) It has low recoil which is good for a novice.\n\n3.) It has safety features that are not found on other guns.  Such as not allowing the gun to go off when the magazine has been removed; an internal locking device; and a round chambered indicator.  Which is good for a novice.\n\n4) It's an accurate gun good for competition shooting.\n\n5.) It has adjustable sights which is good for competition shooting.\n\n6.) It already comes which a weaver style mount so you can mount a scope on it if you'd like.  Which is good for competition shooting.\n\n7.) This gun is affordable anywhere from $229-310\n\nReviews for the Ruger MKII: \n\nhttp://www.chuckhawks.com/dktaylor.htm\nhttp://mywebpages.comcast.net/shooter2_indy/mk2.html\n\nReviews for the MK III\n\nhttp://www.gunblast.com/Ruger_MarkIII-Hunter.htm\n\n\nSo in conclusion I think that the Ruger MK II or MK III would make a good target gun for a novice shooter.
the best answer is take as many kids as you can to a hockey game.  I love hockey and have from the time i could walk.  I can enjoy the game very much on tv.  I have noticed though that people that dont grow up with it cant on tv unless they have been introduced to the excitement of seeing it live.  hockey is in my opinion the most complex of games.  but that intensity is just not felt on the tv with out the excitement of seeing it and feeling the energy in person.  the other thing that works is share your excitement talk it up explain the suttle things.  oh yeah and tell people that their are fights lol.  some times that works too

I think they are too full of themselves at this point! My parent's tennant is Brasilian also and when they beat Ghana he told me that Portugal will win because Brasil already has alot of trophies!!! Is that why? Poor Portugal has nothing and Brasil has soooooo much they'll just give it to Portugal! I laughed but inside I was not a happy camper!!"

what's a looser?\n\nAnyway, no it wasn't fair, but since the match is 90 minutes long it was up to us to take make the ref's mistake irrelevant.  A team who only scores one goal in their first three matches shouldn't expect to advance, I'd never deny that.  That doesn't make a bad call good.\n\nAnd sorry king of the world but we really don't need your permission to play soccer so I think we'll probably continue to do so.  We made it to the quarterfinals last time, and we'll see what 2010 brings.
It may not have been completely fair, however Korea has gotten more than their fair share of HORRENDOUS calls going their way.  thinking back to World cup 2002, look at the Spain-korea game!  Spain should have won that game easily but had two goals disallowed when it was quite obvious that both should have been allowed; a mistake that eliminated Spain and allowed those damn Koreans to move on.  Fast forward to this WC and we see Korea getting away with a 1-1 draw with France when it was quite obvious that Vieira's goal should have made the game 2-0, but of course the Koreans got away with it and then later came back to equalize!  So, in answer to your question, yes this probably was somewhat unfair in this particular match to the Koreans, but this once again shows that the concept of Karma plays a huge part in international football.  So much so that when I found out about their loss and watched the replay of the game, I laughed heartily at the misfortune of the Koreans!
Hopefully the USA! They seem to be on a mission to redeem ourselves this year!

When a team is winning by a confortable margin, they would replace their important players for several reasons:\n\n- To avoid an injury.\n- To let other players get a chance to play. Some of the bench players wouldn't have the opportunity to play in a World Cup match unless the starters get injured or suspended.\n- To allow them not to get too tired, so they would be rested by their next game.

NOTES:\n(a) Maddux has lost 6 of his last 8 decisions.\n(b) Chacin may be out for up to four weeks.\n(c) Sele's average ERA over the past few seasons is over 5.00, with a WHIP higher than 1.60\n(d) Jered has been demoted. \n\nYes i would definitely drop Cook and Bannister. Cook has lost all four of his past four decisions, and bannister is not worth the risk, especially not having pitched competitively for over 2 months. Also is a bad sign when you have walked more than you have struck out.\n\nAs for replacements, I would get Saito and Shields. This would give you a fourth starter and another reliever.
I do think so, remember in the Argentina- Serbia match, he just came in and he scored. He has a bright future.
1 Let me be very clear it was not a penalty, but that is not a fault of the italians. italians , spanish, french all these players have always had the tendency to go for penalties, its their game like it or not. why blame them only ? anyone remember Rivaldo against Turkey in 2002 group league, he faked to get a penalty. Brazilians do it too !!! It was the refs fault why blame italy ?\n\n2 Aussies played very very well, but they have to accept the fact that their finishing was pooor , & they created very little despite having a man advantage. They never looked like scoring & winning the match. On the contrary Italy had better openings.\n\n3 Ref was poor , but again Materazzi's red card was harsh, 11 against 11 would have been a different game.\n\n\n4 Italy did defend very well, give them credit for that. \n\n\n5  I agree there has been a mess in Serie A but you can never undermine the quality, Italian clubs have won European competitions more than any other country , check the records.\nItaly hve won 3 WCs, they are the first & only european country to win back to back WC. Also they have the 3rd best record in WC next to brazil & germany, better than Argentina or England, you have to accept that they are good.\n\nSome people say they have little sucess in recent times well check this\n1978-  4th\n1982- champs\n1986 - quarter finals\n1990 - 3rd\n1994 - 2nd\n1998 - quarter finals\n2002 - 2nd round\nthey have not last a WC knockout match in normal time since 1986, and have reached semifinals in 4 of last 7 WCs, they have played 16 Wcs which is 2nd to Brazil.
This answer is quite simple:\n\nTHEY didn't stop playing football.......\n\nMEXICO stopped them.....

"Well, I'm no coach, but that happens to a player like me too.

Be calm, set an example for them, be laid back ""it's ok"" tell them.\n\n3. Encourage them to make up for a mistake and instead of getting mad at the ump, have them use that anger at the plate.\n\n4. tell them to play instinctivley, and be cool and calm under pressure, my coach says that your at least 50% of a better player than you are when you are nervous and tenative.\n\nGood luck!"

I hate to keep on hearing this question but I think it is because the league (and all fans) are just hurting to find the next Michael Jordan.  It happened with Kobe, Vince Carter, Grant Hill, etc..  This last finals thats all I would hear.  Wade would be the next Michael (after the 4th game mind you).  But I do not think he will be as good as Michael.  I think they are giving Wade too much credit, he is still very young.  And he has earned this respect from refs in just 3 yrs.  And I think this whole fall 7 times get up 8 thing has gone to his head.  He falls for every little touch now.  Soon kids everywhere are going to be falling down on the court with every little touch to get a foul called.  I do not think he has been in this league long enough to be getting touch fouls called on him.  It took Jordan a hell of a lot longer, but I think that goes back to the league really hurting for another Michael Jordan.  But don't get me wrong, I think Wade is a great player.  He has a great mid-range jumpshot, is great at getting fouls called, great at the free throw line (which gets his midrange jumpshot going), and an ok driver to the basket and finisher.  But no way the next Michael Jordan.
yes he does suck. he lives in san fransisco aka the city of gays. but he doesn't make his team better and just wants to make himself look good. thats why their not still playing. he needs to be slapped in the face for being such a cocky arrogant brat. even his father joe jelly bean bryant said that.

Hislop was the man to get the job done for the under dogs. And iam really happy with the way it went. Everyone was saying it was a sure win for Sweden.  Trinadad & Tabago deserved the draw.  There are never sure wins in the world of sports.

This  is the FIFA rule regarding your question. This rule came into force on 1 January 2004.\n\nUp his 21st birthday, a player who has represented an Association team (Country) in one or more matches of an official competition may henceforth request to change the Association for which he is eligible, provided that he fulfils the following criteria:\n\n- he has not played at “A” international level for the Association for which he is eligible at the time he submitted the request;- he had dual nationality (or more than two nationalities), at the time of his first appearance in an international match in an official competition of any category. Therefore, this provision does not apply to any players who have been naturalised after having already represented one Association. Consequently, FIFA has rejected the request submitted by Murat Mogomedov, a Russian player but now a naturalised Israeli, as he has already played for Russia.\n\nAny player who fulfils the above criteria may only once request to change the Association for which he is eligible.
Looking back to the previous matches and results i'll go for Germany...
The FA in England pay for this along with contributions from clubs etc.\n\nI am certain this is the case for all other national teams and the official relevant football organisations in that country!\n\nWho foots the bill for the wife's and girlfriends of the players..??
It is the half time score

Ed Reed is real good, and Rodney Harrison was good too. John Lynch is great too.
Depends on the goals scored/allowed difference, I'm guessing.
It's Lionel, Lionel Messi.\n\nHe's got a website, just in case you're a big fan. He's 19, but when he scored his goal on this World Cup, he was 18. His birthday was the same day Argentina beat Mexico.

I think they should have a limited number of spots for Cup drivers in Busch series.   A lot more Cup drivers are using Busch series to practice on because of the limited practice sessions. Also, it draws more people to a Busch race when there are popular Cup drivers there.  \n However, I don't think Cup drivers should be allowed to have the points when they are not full time drivers in Busch series.  There are a lot of Busch drivers that are losing spots in the standings due to the Cup drivers coming in and finishing better.  Look at the standings now in Busch series, the top 7 spots are held by Cup drivers.   The Busch drivers need to make a living too, the Cup drivers are double dipping and to me that's not fair. \n\nAnd lastly, I don't think you should be allowed to race for 2 championships.  Look at Harvick, he's currently 7th in cup and 1st in Busch series.

MOST UNDERRATED\n\nKirk Hinrich - Solid PG with tough defense, very consistent.\n\nMichael Redd - The last of the few shooters in the NBA (with athleticism to match).  Did not make it to the All-Star this year.\n\nNenad Kristic - New Jersey this year was always sadi to be about the trio.  People forgot they have a consistent big man in Kristic.\n\nJosh Howard - NBA version of Jack-of-all-trades.  Can score, can defend and is very reliable\n\nAntawn Jamison - Good range, athletic and can post up, can play both forward positions\n\n\n\nMOST OVERRATED\n\nStephon Marbury - For a self proclaimed best point guard in the NBA, he shoots too much in a team that has so many talents.  One word of advice to Starbury - DISH. He is the main reason for his team's disaster.\n\nJoe Johnson - He is not a franchise player and does not deserve the money he got this year.  He is not even an all star.\n\nZydrunas Ilgauskas - A lumbering center (He  made the All Star couple of years before).  A non factor in the playoffs\n\nLamar Odom - very inconsistent, does not have heart.  It's a pity Lakers have him as a second option.  They could do better.\n\nCarmelo Anthony - Settles for too much jump shots to be a legit Superstar.  He was touted to be the future of NBA along with Wade and James so far he is killing his team with his shot selections.

considering that costa rica had to battle hard against a university team, i would be surprised if Germany lose or draw!!
On this performance they will definitely challenge for the cup. They crushed Serbia. The goals were not scored in the final minutes or extra time as we have seen so frequently. Their game was controlled and measured and this will only improve as their competition does. I'm going for the Socceroo's and the Italians but would not be disappointed with a Brazil V's Argentina final. What a match and they have proven themselves consistently to be worthy of a place in the final. It is getting down to the business end of things and becoming increasingly intense to watch.

I live in Indiana and trust me Jermaine's staying. Only way he'll go is if the Pacers get a trade they can pass up. Only possibilities to me are Chicago.  Some reports have the Bulls packaging Chandler, Ben Gordon and the No. 2 pick to the Wolves for Garnett or to the Pacers for O'Neal.\nI just moved to Minnesota and also Kevin Garnett is most liekly staying. he is the centerpiece ofthe franchise and city and there's no way he'll go. Don't be too surprised if J.O and K.G get swapped for each other though. ALlen iverson seems the most likely to be traded.I can see the Celtics or the HAwks picking him up. But the big deal floating around is Iverson to the Boston Celtics, Boozer to the 76ers and Szczerbiak to the Utah Jazz.
he was a magician his bowling used to mesmerize batsman who used to dance to his tunes and he was perhaps of greater status then even Shane Warne and Murali
"To the Heat and mavs fans..  Its just a game, to the heat fans-congratulations, u got ur first title, enjoy the moment guys but dont brag, besides,its just ur first,and remember-""Be nice to the people on ur way up, because u will see them again on ur way down...""  \n\nAnd to the Mavs fans, like what avery said about dirk""He is a warrior,he tried..No excuses.."" Yes the heat may have more phantom calls in this series than the entire NBA season but a win is a win.. The Mavs did have their chances too.. But knowing Mark Cuban, he and the Mavs will be back in the finals next season.. That is if the lakers dont acquire KG..  :)  because if they do, it will be the MIAMI HEAT VS LA LAKERS... Kobe vs Wade... Who really is the next MJ? or closer? That would be a treat.. The NBA 05-06 season is over..let it go.. \n\nWorld cup anyone?"
I hope Chyna. I heard the New Age Outlaws' names mentioned, but they're both with TNA so that might not happened. But if it's somebody on the active roster, I would say.either Shelton Benjamin or Charlie Haas. John Cena and Randy Orton are good canidates, too.

"If all were in their primes, I would say Flair. Remember, Terry Funk in his prime was not the Terry Funk we see now. He was NWA champ for 2 years and fought some tough matches, but nowhere near the the ""hardcore"" matches we see him in now. Also his skills with the mic were not as strong as they are now, so a booker would most likely not give him a title vs. Flair to be the standard bearer for a promotion. As for Race/Flair, these guys went against each other tons of times, with Flair getting the upper hand in the series."
Barry is paying the price for the way he treated the media when he was young.  He was very cocky back in those days.

In the middle of the ocean there are huge waves. These waves don't break. They are huge swells because the depth of the ocean allow more energy and size. If you are talking in terms of surfable waves, the largest ride-able waves are either Todos Santos, Maverick's, or Peahi (aka Jaws). Of the three, I would say Peahi has the largest waves.

2006 Bugatti Veyron \n\n0-60 2.46 seconds \n\n18.0 liters and 16 cylinders. It has 64 valves and four turbochargers, and the power and torque they generate find their way to the road via all four wheels through the medium of a twin-clutch, seven-speed semiautomatic gearbox. When all is said and done, that power adds up to 1,001 horsepower if you record your figures at an air temperature of around 110 degrees. In a more normal climate, it's more powerful even than that, with up to around 1,050 hp available.
Very simple :\nto team of eleven players have to kick the ball in the other team goal.\nThe ten players can just kick with the foot or the head.\nThe goalkeeper can stop the ball with the hands.\nThe goalkeeper can use the hand only in the repaired surface (a square of 20meters).\nThe play time is 2 x 45MN.
I remember when Celtic Park was built, its changing rooms were not deemed to be good enough to class the stadium as 5 stars, however Celtic did take measures to fix this in 2003 and i believe it is of 5 star rating standards now, however i have not found evidence of it being on Uefa's 5 star listings yet, but this may change in the future - a club has to apply to host a european final before it can be added to the list.
no sorry i don't
Usually a combination of 2 factors, ignorance and stupidity which is masked as 'Blind Loyalty'\n\nPeople forget that football (soccer) is a sport, and fair play has to be the norm You play hard, play to win but in the end of the day, if your opponent is better than you, you have to give him that respect.\n\nFair play also means playing by the rules and in football, there is sometimes no justice. Portugal gave France a fight in Euro 2000 but when Abel Xavier decided to bring hand to ball, in the last minute of extra-time, referee Benko put whistle to mouth and gave France a penalty. Zidane desptached and Portugal went out but not after attacking the referee and alleging bias, which their fans had quickly imitated.\nThe refusal to accept defeat no matter how unkind, precepitates all this.\nEnglish fans are reknowned for this refusal, which they mistakenly substitute for 'pride and love of country'. \n\nSometimes, there are moments of deceptions which we have to condemn, Jurgen Klinsmann, Arjen Robben and Diego Maradona, no less, have cheated and escaped. But here is where football can deliver some justice after all, what you get away with today, you will have to pay for at another time.\n\nHowever moments of human error, which referees sometimes make must be accepted, because players do the same all the time. \n\nOf course it is sad when your beloved team loses, especially in controversial circumstances. However when they are poor, or lost to a better team, then we must acknowledge our opponents, for just like us, they want to win, their fans want to win. \n\nIn controversy, we must shake our head curse our luck, because in Life that happens and football, is the game of Life.

they carry on to the next game. if the next game is the next round then the yellow card is going to be there which causes the player to sit out.
hendricks, their cars are way to good coming off the corners for it to be just tallent, or a good car. they are also known for cheeting, the cheeters. i think they were caught with it once apon a time ago, but i cant remember if that was true, or if i have the wrong team. i wouldn't put it past them, kyle busch is 12 in pionts, if hendricks wants him in the chase, they would use it. jeff gordon is 8th, hendricks will want to keep him up in pionts. they have jimmie johnson in first, but they want to keep him up there. brian vickers is 20th and probably wont make it, but there is always hope if u cheet!

The Fed. Govt is not allowed to have ANY form of registration for guns and gun owners, thank goodness and thank the NRA. However, F*cked up states like CA and NY do require registration IF you are EVEN allowed to purchase a firearm. \nYou did not specify what state you are in, so it is difficult to answer your question of whether or not you can purchase a firearm in another state and keep it in another, you need to edit your question and be specific.\n I do, however, understand your plight. I'm from CA and when I returned from my enlistment, I was infuriated I could not purchase a firearm with out waiting for weeks for a 'cool down' period and paying outrageous fees. So I got a job where I was allowed to carry a gun and used that everywhere I went. But it's hard to go around irrational laws this way so not everyone can do this. I also understand the concern of having to register your guns with ANYONE. People like some of the other answerer's immediately think you are up to no good when you wanna PURCHASE a firearm but forget that personal protection is not guaranteed by the police, only yourself. \nYou can purchase a firearm in a surrounding state like Arizona and even 'open' carry it without a permit in THAT state, but you have to list a residential address in that state and you cannot transport the firearm back to CA, where I THINK  you are from, without listing it in that state,(CA). I can be of more help if you are more specific in your state.

Direct free kicks are usually for more serious infringements of the Law, like those in Law 12. \n\nA goal can be scored from a direct free kick and if an offence that attracts a direct free kick in the opponent's penalty area, a penalty will be awarded to the attacking team.\n\nIndirect free kicks are usually for minor infringements, like obstruction, dangerous play and covers the range of infringements committed by goal-keepers and of course, for offsides.\n\nA goal cannot be scored form an indirect free kick, unless touched by another player.  The referee wil raise his arm to indicate an indirect free kick.
the game was GREAT! it was so breath-taking and unpredictable. and they had to do extra time and penalty kicks which i thought was so interesting and made the game better. after the game i was clapping so hard coz germany won then my hands went all red and it hurt after. lmao

I just checked out the site and it looked like the Attlee's are pretty reputable shapers, keeping surfers stoked in the UK.\n\nThe board designs look good, thrusters, fish, fun shapes and longboards.\n\nAre you thinking about buying one? Talk to the folks at your surfshop about your style of surfing and they'll help you pick a good one. \n\nIf it's a used board you are interested in, it's really more about the condition of the board. Does it have a lot of dings, or major ding repairs? That can screw up the way a board rides.\n\nBut I'd have to say that Escape boards look pretty good. If I ever surf in the UK I'll try to check one out.
you can only do guide passes (alley hoops) in playoff and all-star weekend mode... check the controls option...
well first of all you cant be scared you have to be positive or you wont be able to go over the wake first you carve another word for turning to what ever side your going to go over  if you didnt know its about 15 feet to get over the wake so then you lean farther back than you usually do
Not living up to the hype more like it. Australia is not a weak team, every match so far has been controversial. The final score of last nights game does not necessarily show how well or badly either side played.
You do not have to go far at all.  There are places both here in the USA and in Canada which are open year round.  Most places actually close because they don't have business, not because there is not enough snow.  I've listed places which are open year round on this continent!\n\nMammoth Mountain, California\nMt. Bachelor, Oregon\nMt. Hood, Oregon\nTimberline, Oregon\nApahahoe Basin, Colorado\nTuckerman Ravine, New Hampshire (although this is one you \nhave to hike up... no lift service)\nWhistler-Blackcomb, B.C.-Canada\n\n\nMost of the pro riders and camps are in either Mammoth, Mt. Hood, or Whistler.

Henry ayant confirmé sa prolongation avec Arsenal, je vois bien Shevchenko être le gros coup de l'intersaison. Pour ce qui est de la France, Lyon continue de mettre la pression pour Ribery et Pauleta, l'un comme l'autre constituerait un gros transfert !

It may be kinda bad to answer this after the draft, but I'm gonna answer it anyway.\n\nBefore the draft, I was hoping that Farmar wouldn't get drafted since UCLA will be in trouble without him.  But if he does get drafted, I was hoping he would go to the Lakers, since that's like his home team and is also mine.  Now that he did get drafted, I'm kinda happy, and kinda sad.  Happy, because he's with the Lakers and not any other team, and sad, because UCLA lost him.

Yes, how could you not it is better then the Playoffs in the MLB because no drugs and werid endings to the games like Cal State Fullerton agianst North Carolina man that is something you would not see in the MLB playoffs.
i'm going to go with matt leinart because he was surrounded by great players at every posistion at usc while he was playing in the pac 10, where no one plays defense.  He also lacks armstrength, and mobility.
go to eBay and type in the year, the card manufacturer (i.e. Topps), and the player.  The results should give you a rough estimate of the fair market value.  Cards that have been PSA rated (on a scale of (low) 1-10 (high) will be valued higher.
Every sports store carries bats that are little league certified.. You just can't use a big barrell bat. they are only for club or pony leages..  Try sports authority or sports chalet...  If you still have trouble you should have your little league verify there descision. It should not be hard to find a bat.. louiville slugger, demarini, and easton all make bats that should be approved and easily accessible\n\nIf you want to buy on line there are often great deals at http://masscloseouts.com  and\n\nhttp://bestsportsdirect.com      There also is some very good deals on batting trainers here...
Brewer will be a valuable addition wherever he ends up because he has a high court I.Q.  and is more mature and well adjusted than many of the other lottery picks mentioned.  This young man is an exception ...he has excellent athleticism and he is one of the most selfless players I have seen on the court...combining solid shooting, amazing court vision for finding his open teammates, and relentless defensive drive...qualities not always found at the NBA level.  Rumor has it, a lot of the other guards projected to go in the top 8 have been avoiding Ronnie in the individual team workouts: likely good advice from agents who do not want to take the chance of seeing their stock fall from a bad showing against this kid who has consistently shown his ability (and capabilites) against anyone who will show up since the pre-draft camp.  Those who think Brewer's shooting will hold him back in the draft are forgetting some important intangibles....this kid has what every coach and GM want in a newly drafted player; natural athleticism combined with high coachability, and a great attitude.  Whatever he is lacking in technique to become a great NBA contributor, can be developed by a good coach.

"The national hymn is sang of course but not with the line ""Germany, Germany over all"" This is forbidden since the second world war. Only the third line is allowed.\n\nTypical football songs are:\n\n""Steh' auf, wenn Du ein Deutscher bist"" (Stand up if you are a German) to the tune of ""Go West"" from Pet Shop Boys\n\n""Ihr könnt nach hause gehn"" (You can travel home)\n\n""Schwarz und weiß, wir stehn an Eurer Seite"" Black and white we stand at your side\n\nHope this helps"
Darrel Waltrip. I have to mute the TV and listen to my satellite radio  when the race is on. Waltrip brothers SUCK!! Just go away. Also I agree with you on Dale Sr. Yes he was a great driver but why keep marketing him and move on to an up and coming star of today. Its good to remember the great ones but to market them still just doesn't seem right to even Dale Sr. to keep using his name to make a buck.
A mon avis, sur ce qu'il a montré au Giro, Ivan Basso sera difficile à battre.

I am!! Having just watched the Eng. v Trin-Tob match, I can say that the world has gone officially Rooney-obsessed. I enjoy watching the odd world cup game, but this year, the hype around Rooney, is really starting to grate on my teeth!\n\nComments during his first match since damaged foot absence, AND afterwards:\n\n'They needed him to shake things up'\n'Boy wonder: back in action'\n'The caged lion'\n'Sven's most precious commodity'\n'Fate of World Cup, depends on him - only him'\n'No hope without him'\n\nThis is pretty much - and MUCH more - what the commentators were ranting about in the 2nd half. It almost made me SICK! Couldn't the commentators find someone else to talk about, like the people who scored? Crouch and Gerrard, or even the team's very own Cap'n Beckham. They seem to have forgotten about him. Rooney, Rooney, Rooney .... AARRGG!!
ARGENtINA!!!!!!
because the World Cup starts out in Group Play. 4 teams in one Group, with each team playing each other once (3 games) like a mini-league. The top 2 teams in each Group advance into the knockout single elimination stages after that.

WELL  with lots of training and experience they will.  But if it werent for luis figo we wouldnt have won any of our matches.  its a shame this is his last world cup.  the team needs his guidance and inspirations.  lets just hope that we will get really far in this world cup.  as for the next world cup we will just have to stick together and get fresher shoes on the field!!!  I LOVE PORTUGAL!!  they are gonna beat mexico......  I hope  :)

No, I think he's just fine where he's at. Yeah, he's having a bit of a rough season..but I think it's just a matter of fine tuning the things and programs he does have.\n\nedit: a lot of colorfurl words are often shared on those scanners..but it doesn't necessarily mean there is an issue there. it's a heat of the moment. even the best relations of c/c and drive'rs can get nasty at moments..

well, my friend TOLD me that him and his dad made one, with a tail and a nose and everything. he said that they used water to bend the wood, but he also said that it didn't turn out that good. so if you do make one, it might not turn out the way you want it to.
"First of all remember he is an ass in real life.\nThere have been reports of him beating his girlfriends (he dated Chyna once btw) and being arrogant.\n\nDo you want to worship someone like that?\n\nAlso realize he does take steroids.

LeBron James.  As soon as he came out of high school he instantly turned that team around.  He will never be Michael Jordan but I believe he is the closest we will see for a long time.
yes they still think they will win it, but if they lived in the real world \nand forgot all the hype,they would know they had no chance. \nEngland are CRAP
Softball like baseball is played by men and women. There are two types of softball, fast pitch and slow pitch. Four main differences between soft ball and baseball are that the ball is larger in the game of softball,the ball is pitched underhand, the bases are situated closer together and the pitching mound is considerably closer to the batter.\n\nWhile slow pitch softball is more a leisurely recreational game with much activity because the ball is pitched slow with a required arc  and scoring is usually frequent, fast pitch softball is more a pitcher oriented low scoring game. Even the best of batters in fastball have difficulty hitting. Batting against top notch pitchers in fast pitch soft ball is not for the faint of heart. The ball comes from the mound which is only 40-46 feet away, and at speeds upwards of 80 mph. Soft ball games are usually only 7 innings long and in top competitive games it is not unusual for pitchers to attain 12 -15 strikeouts. \nBelieve me, some of the best MLB players would have difficulty looking good at the plate in elite player fastball (softball) games, whether it is a man or a woman pitching.
et oui!!!\n\nen théorie, il faut au moins un entraineur diplomé dans le club. il faut un initiateur 3 pour entrainer au niveau départemental, un brevet d'état 1er degré en niveau régional (sauf la dh) et un brevet d'état 2nd degré pour la dh, le cfa2 et le cfa.\n\nensuite, il faut au moins une personne (par équipe) pour l'encadrement des autres équipes (nécessaire sur la feuille de match), sachant qu'un joueur peut occupêr ce rôle.

I tried, but you probably won;t like it much....I did try though.
all depends on the player, some will see that they were at fault and leave the field, others will argue and argue and argue..\nThere is NO argument against it though! In this case, the referee is ALWAYS right!\n\nFirst you get the yellow card for a foul and after that you get the red one and will be taken off the field for the rest of the game (if that was your answer.. smile..)
its a seemless soccer ball, and it is an unfair weapon for strikers against goalies. The soccer ball when kicked is now more aerodynamic so it looks like a pitchers curveball exaggerated by 100 times. Goalies stand no chance really against these new balls.

I'm disappointed that u asked this question, its has to be Michael ... there is no two ways about it... he is the 7times world champion, I know u like bikes but remember Rossi Started at 125 cc became a champ there as has gradually progressed to the big league of 500cc, but Schumi was always a champ.. even when he was with the Benetton's ... he made a team like Benettons champions for 2 consecutive years.. I dont think Rossi would be able to do that with a mediocre bike company.\n\nSchumi all the way for me!!!\n\n(biking used to fun during the Mike doohan days, and then came Alex barros, Max biaggi... and finally Rossi emergerd after all the greats were gone. Mike was the best)
"It is a hitting cycle, not pitching cycle.\n\nIn baseball, a player hits for the cycle when he hits a single, a double, a triple and a home run in the same game, though not necessarily in that order. Collecting the hits in that order is known as a ""natural cycle"".\n\nThe feat is rare in Major League Baseball as it requires a game of no fewer than four hits, and the unusual combination of a home run, which requires a batter to hit for some power, and a triple, which requires a batter to have some speed on the basepaths. Thus, ""hitting for the cycle"" demonstrates excellence in three of the five ""tools"" of baseball (see five-tool player). The accomplishment is held in high enough esteem that players needing only a single to ""complete the cycle"" have been known to ""hold up"" at first base on balls hit in the alley. There are only 3 teams to never hit the cycle – the San Diego Padres, Florida Marlins and Tampa Bay Devil Rays.\n\nThe last person who hit the cycle:\nJune 21, 2006 José Reyes New York (NL)"

It varies between players but top footballers can earn anything between £80,000 - £130,000 p/w (that's approx. $145,000 - $236,000 p/w respectively).\n\nThe German international, Michael Ballack recently signed a 3 year contract with Chelsea reported to be worth £130,000 p/w\n\nhttp://www.sportinglife.com/football/premiership/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/06/05/20/SOCCER_Chelsea_Nightlead.html

Bob Meusel and Babe Herman  ( i even knew Babe Herman with out looking it up!)
Well, I believe it was put into the code after the Black Sox scandal in 1919. It was used to ban Pete Rose from baseball for life, which was interpreted, by extension, to include the HOF, when he was found to be betting on baseball although no one had any proof that his gambling affected his management of his team. It was said, that in the face of the very explicit language of Rule 21, it didn't matter if if affected his own team or not.\n\nHe couldn't really say he was ignorant of this provision; it is supposedly posted in all teams clubhouses, per Judge Landis, who was the commissioner who inserted in into the rules back in 1920 or so.
The PGA Club exchange net work is the best place
Not at all.  I didn't think they were biased against us, I saw bad calls both ways in the last two matches.  I've also seen a lot of bad calls in non-US matches, the worst had to be when the French scored a goal and the refs didn't give them credit.  The officiating just isn't what it was in the prevoius world cups I've watched closely (going back to 1994).\n\nJorge L. from Uruguay I think was inept (who did the US - Italy match) and I hope for the sakes of the surviving teams he won't be reffing any of their matches.

argentina.  They seem very together and settled, also the team has a good mix of youth and experience!!!
At this point I don't care
I agree. The refereeing just was not fair at this tournament. Australia and Ghana deserved to advance to the quarter finals! And lol how about getting 3 yellow cards in 1 match???
No.
Portugal to hell and Italy home.\n\nViva Australia !!
Buddy,   I don't want to be insulting. 50 states, but the US is one country.  Are you proposing Team California, Team Indiana, Team Michigan, Team Rhode Island.  That's absurd.  50 states that fall under one Federal Government, one country.  Australia has something like six states no?  How many provinces does Canada have?  They are one country too.  So, your aim to create more competition, is the wrong way to go.  I don't want to see divided countries.
I would like Brazil to win.
Yeah, I think that he did make a good decision. He went to a franchise on the rise. He brings in a solid running game to complement the great passing game they have. Arizona has a legitimate chance at making it to the Super Bowl in the next 5 years.
Mexico is better thats why they won...Iran fought valiantly but they weren't good enough
Le penalty est tout à fait justifié.\n\nPar contre sur la faute qui amène le coup-franc puis le but de Vieira il y a simulation de Titi HENRI... scandaleux!
they have him cause he brings attention to the NBA which has be in decline since shaq kobe or even the bulls....... he had changed that team from dump to the finals?
The greatest baseball player of all time is the immortal Sultan of Swat, the Mighty Bambino Babe Ruth.  714 homeruns in 2503 games .342 lifetime batting average .690 lifetime slugging average 15 world series homeruns and 94 lifetime victories as a pitcher.  I'll stack those numbers against anyone.
Detroit , MI
They are both great to watch i love UFC and PRIDE the best thing about UFC is the cage in PRIDE they are always re starting the fight in the centre of the ring. The best thing about PRIDE is the fans they are patient and don't call out or boo during the fight. I like the yellow card system in pride it keeps the fighters under control and i  would love to see PRIDE in a cage.\n\nlove them both 50 50 ask more fight questions.
MAJORETTE
Tim Clark, or Adam Scott
I think it is a great move.  Kyle Boller was not the QB they thought he would be and now with McNair they can actually protect their running game with a vertical attack.  I think that McNair will help this team do better than what they did last year, but they really need to find a youthful QB to learn from McNair because he doesn't have many years left in him.
Hey Claudius Just because you don't care. Ignorant prick, You're probably too stoopid to even know what football is.\n\nAnyway my answer is B.C.

"I think that cheerleading is not considered a sport because of the old meaning of the word. People don't realize that its not just standing on the sidelines and shouting ""RAH,RAH,RAH!"" \n\nI am an all-star cheerleader and I will say for sure that cheerleading should be  a sport. One of many reasons: Baseball players throw balls into the air. Cheerleaders throw people into the air. If baseball is a sport, cheerleading should be too.\n\nThe definition of sport is: Physical activity that is governed by a set of rules or customs and often engaged in competitively. \n\nI'll break this definition down for all of you people who don't believe cheerleading is a sport.\n\nPhysical activity: Gymnastics,dance,and stunting.\n\nGoverened by a set of rules: Anyone read the rulebook? (Routine must be under 2 mins and 30 secs, No cheerleader is to step off the mat while competing,No jewelry allowed, No nail polish allowed) Need I go on?\n\nOften engaged in competitively: Hmm.. Competitions every weeked from November-May. \n\nYeah, that covers it for the definition and cheerleaders do more than that. Practices 5 days a week ranging from 2-4 hours. It is also mandatory for most cheerleaders to go to tumbling and conditioning classes. And this SPORT has more injuries than any other. \n\nPeople don't understand how hard we work and that's why they don't think it is a sport.\n\nHope this helped. ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥"
I don't think anybody did. I think he retired from boxing.
The Royals  have  a lot of history in KC so they probibly wont more. And MLB doesnt like the high altitude. They are trying to do everything to make the ball fly less in Coors Field, so why would they want a new field. I think the high altitude ruins the game, because it just makes the hitters look better, when they arent actually that good.
Yes ... you will never see him again in a world cup
I hope it does because women sports is the real thing they actuall play the game in guys sports they gotta act like babies and complain when a foul is made and do a lotta stupid fighting although i like the fights! it gets a little recognition but not as much as it deseves, the only reason guy sports are popular is because they are stupid and bring a lotta drama to the game, to me women sports is the real thing and they play the game that's why guys don't want to watch it cause they think they rule the world of sports and they think that it should be filled with stupid stuff!

The Royal Engineers AFC is a football team founded in 1869, under the leadership of Major Marindin of the Corps of Royal Engineers, the Sappers. They enjoyed a great deal of success in the 1870s, winning the FA Cup in 1875.\n\nThe 1875 Cup winning side were:\n\nCapt. W. Merriman; Lt. G.H. Sim; Lieutenant G.C. Onslow; Lt. R.M. Ruck; Lt. P.G. von Donop; Lt. C.K. Wood; Lt. H.E. Rawson; Lt. R.H. Stafford; Lt. H. W. Renny-Tailyour; Lt. A. Mein; and Lt. C. Wingfield-Stratford. \n\nThe team drew 1-1 against Old Etonians F.C. with a goal from Renny-Tailyour and went on to win the replay 2-0 with a goal each from Renny-Tailyour and Stafford.\n\nThey have maintained their character as an amateur team (as was the tradition early on in football history) and have not played in top competition since the 1890s.

i did it before with a scew driver.....it kind of messed it up but it worked i just super glued it back, i put a tennis ball in there just to mess around i heard it made the ball go farther. if your bat is real nice i wouldnt recomend it. i would contact the manufacturer
Yes.  However, it does get crowded.  There are bathroom lines (because some just drink too much.)  And of the seats I usually get you have to walk what seems forever.  But if you look past all of this, get to your seat with patience, peanuts and a sprite, you will throughly enjoy yourself.  Be sure to get a bit to eat before the game though.  The cost of snacks is outrageous.  Well at least for me, especially if I take my brood (kids).  There are those that can get obnoxious in the stands but if you stay out of their way you will do fine.  And there are those that are super people and very polite in the stands. After the game, take a stroll in the very cutsie neighberly (I don't think I spelled that correctly) neighborhood, but watch out for those street vendors.  I always found that it is better to go to the game with someone I know know.

i personally like kahn better, maybe bcoz he has the charisma which i dont see in lehmann. lehmann was a lot better in the match against poland, compared to the one against costa rica. well, i think both are great, but i like kahn better..\n\nand i dont know whether you mispelled it or what, but it's KAHN..while khan is normally a surname for indians (?), for exmaply my fav hindi actor, shahrukh khan..LOL..!

Unrealistic wish probably. Though they have a good team if the offense can survive without healthy tested quality strikers you might be able to pull it off.

Look at their division. With the World Champion White Sox, the contending Indians, and the somehow best record Tigers, how do you look good? The only weak team in the division are the Kansas City Royals, and they are barely a team. Plus, they lost Jaque(sp?) Jones. I think that if the Twins were in a different division, they would look much better than they do now.

Okay, can people that have absolutely no idea stop answering questions on this thing?  It's making a lot of people confused...\n\nHere is the full and accurate answer:\n\na) greatest number of points obtained in all group matches;\nb) goal difference in all group matches;\nc) greatest number of goals scored in all group matches.\n\nIf two or more teams are equal on the basis of the above three criteria, their rankings will be determined as follows (this portion has more importance when more than two teams are tied):\na) greatest number of points obtained in the group matches between the teams concerned;\nb) goal difference resulting from the group matches between the teams concerned;\nc) greater number of goals scored in all group matches between the teams concerned;\n\nFinal tiebreaker:\n-Drawing of lots by the Organising Committee for the FIFA World Cup.

An exercise that I learnt in Taekwondo class involved two\npeople facing each other, you have your back against a wall\n(for support)  raising one of your legs with the help of your partner\nfacing, slowly get your partner to hold your ankle/calf area to push up further and further (while you keep breathing) and push until your toes are pointing towards the ceiling leg straight as high as you can go feeling a good strong stretch.\nWhen you are finished bring your leg down slowly, knee bent\nas you do,  then relax and then alternately stretch your other leg with the help of your partner and repeat the procedure.\nYou can repeat this so each leg has been stretched twice \neach and be sure to keep your heel (not your foot) inline with the wall and your back straight as you can.  Your partner and you can swap positions so you both get a go.\n\nIt will take about 1 - 2 months to achieve your result 2 - 3 times\na week based on my own performance.

C'est un jeune joueur qui a beaucoup de qualités, mais qui a aussi encore beaucoup de progrès à faire tant dans sa gestion de son effort que dans sa gestion du jeu. Ce que l'on dit de lui est un peu surfait. Il a fait le jeu à Marseille est on en fait le futur Zidane. En remettant les choses dans leurs contexte, on remarque que Marseille n'avait pas grand choses à proposer et donc il était plus facile pour lui de se mettre en valeur. Ensuite, il ne sera jamais je pense le leader de l'équipe de France qu'on attends simplement parce qu'il n'en a ni les épaules ni la mentalité. Il reste malgré tout un joueur de talent qui si il continue à progresser deviendra un des meilleurs joueur français de sa génération.

Personally,I LOVE eldora!! It is my favorite dirt track! I am so excited that Tony bought it. I  think he will be making improvements. But even if he doesn't I will go again and again! It is the first track I ever went to, and where my hubby got me hooked on racing!!haha!! I agree with you on the consession stands, but the bar is awesome!! It's the only track that I know of that doesn't only have beer for us NON-beer drinkers! I didn't go to the prelude, but heard it was rescheduled for sometime in September. My hubby and I plan on going then! I can't wait!

No. That is not permitted by FIFA.
"definitely the Twins- They have found Johan Santana's ""twin"" in Francisco Liriano, and both are pitching great-  Guys like Morneau, Mauer and Cuddyer are stepping it up big for them while young players like Bartlett and Kubel have been nice additions to a well rounded team.  Amd also have one of the best closers in the league in Joe Nathan.\n\nThe Marlins have been surprisingly alright, but their whole team is young.  Hanley Ramirez, Dan Uggla, Mike Jacobs, Jason Hermida, Reggie Abercrombie- the list goes on and on...great young players that have done their jobs so far this season..but how long will it last before they run into a slump- the same can be said for their pitching staff. Besides Brian Moehler, their most experienced starter is Dontrelle Willis, their bullpen has been ok but could be a lot better and I think will be what hurts them down the stretch."
He is a center fielder. He got hurt, and during his rehab process Pujols got hurt badly. It's a great match beteween Edmonds and First Base because that position doesn't require any running. Great for rehab!
Kobe Bryant simply because he is learning how to be a team player. He was averaging 6.3 assists in the playoffs. He knows that he has a quality team, they just need someone else to complete the triangle. Ron Artest would have been the perfect addition.  I think that the Lakers are going to find a really good center this off-season. They are in the building mode right now. Give them a few years, and they will be hot. But, the Heat on the other hand have many players that are on their way out the door. Payton, Mourning, Shaq... all players that will retire in the next 5 years. Who will Wade be left with? Haslem??? ha. Kobe has the better situation to win more titles.

If they televised it, they probably have it in their film archives, especially since it was fairly recent. I would try contacting the station's archives division and see if they'll get you a copy.

"I'm going to disagree with the general consensus here believing that soccer is unpopular in the States because of its slow pace. Think about this carefully. What other popular (granted it's not as popular as american football) sport in America is quite similar to soccer? Yes, that's right. HOCKEY. Hockey matches usually end in scores of a total of 10 points or less. \n\nYou want to know the real reason why Soccer is not popular? Two reasons: \n1) The game is quite harsh to aggressive behaviour. This is where a crucial difference lies between Hockey and Soccer. (This is also why Austrialians tend to like rugby over soccer).\n2) Because America doesn't dominate Soccer.\n\nFurthermore, Americans should begin to enjoy Soccer more because their national team is (I'm not debating this) getting better with every tourney. Afterall, there were many Americans in Germany rooting for their team and the TV ratings for football beat ratings for basketball, baseball, hockey and golf (granted, this is because of the large number of immigrants in the states but nevertheless, an important statistic but don't also forget that World Cup this year is held in Germany which means games won't be aired primetime).\n\n""It's also not a very technical sport, in comparison to baseball and football, which rely heavily on strategy and analysis of situations and tendencies."" \n\nExcuse me? Ever heard of the 4-2-3-1 defense? or 4-3-3 or 4-4-2? The very fact that Soccer is quite harsh in terms of penalties makes it more technical then baseball and football. Typical American ignorance. Oh and honestly, baseball being a technical sport? Rubbish."

ARGENTINA, no doubt. They really play as a team, without selfishness. They have amazingly skillful players, even on the bench. The members of the team are very close. Pekerman is an excellent coach. And most importantly, they are ready to leave their heart on the field.\n\nVamos Argentina!!!
First off, for the previous answer, the Ivory Coast didn't play Germany in the first round.  Ivory Coast played Argentina and Germany played Costa Rica.\n\nThat being said, Argentina did win the game, but the Ivory Coast played incredibly well.  They moved the ball as well or better than any team I've seen play yet.  They did lose, but the Argentinian goals were nearly all counter attacks.  They didn't build up anything and score a technical goal.  They are a good team, but they didn't impress me against the Ivory Coast, and that says a lot because of the FIFA rankings.\n\nNow, for the Dutch.  The Dutch are a hell of a team.  Robben played better in the game against Serbia & Montenegro than any player I've seen yet.  The Dutch have an excellent squad this year; however, they're young.  When you bring back a team that's lost the likes of Bergkamp, Davids, Cluivert, and Van Baasten, you'll be looking for leadership.  With Van Nistelrooy up top, you've got a lot, but still, they'll be lacking in that department.\n\nAll this being said, I think the game will be really close, but I think the Dutch will edge it out.  I'll say 2-1 or 3-2 in favor of Holland.
Nothing is Impossible.  :)
Yeah! They have a good chance of doing so but the Aussies are also very competitive! But nonetheless, I'm also supporting Italy. Francesco Totti will do the trick for them! \nBut Harry Kewell is also a good player.\nItaly should win!
Lets Go Cubs!!!! Been a die hard fan for 26 years and counting. Watch em when they suck watch em when they come 1 game from the world series. Born, live and die as a Cub fan. Grandparents were Cub fans, parents are Cub fans, and now my children are Cub fans. No better place than Wrigley. Thick and thin Cub fans always stay true to their team. We have waited this long there is no sense of giving up on our team. Even if they never win it all I will always be a fan. Go Cubs!!

"First of all, to every one who has answered, the Soccer games (World Cup, MLS, etc.) are not less capitalistic than the football games.  Look in the corner of your screen and you will see that Kodak or Pepsi or whomever has paid for this portion of the game.  The announcers in Soccer games will even verbally tell you that ""this portion of the game is brought to you commercial-free by Nike"".  \n\nThe truth is that the soccer clock doesn't stop.  A game changing play can occur at any time.  It would be potentially embarrasing for Soccer games to cut to a commercial and miss a goal.  \n\nAmerican Football, however, has plenty of pauses.  Whether it is after a score, during a time-out, or what is oddly referred to as a ""TV Time-out"", the game isn't as dependant on the clock.  \n\nThis isn't to say that one is better than the other, but watching American Football without the brief pauses would get rather tedious.  \n\nBesides, if there weren't commercial breaks during Football games, when would I get up to get myself a beer?"

It never hurts to try new arts or styles.  However, I would pick own art and get a strong foundation so that you always have something to fall back on.  Since muay thai is such great striking art I would suggest you try taking some aikido, jiu-jitsu,  or judo to supplement your tai-chi training.  These arts, especially aikido, will help you better grasp the concepts and applications of tai chi.\nGood Luck

First of all a player never shoots on a spectator it is because he misplaced a shot on goal. Secondly I guess the fan will be hit by the ball and get on with it (big deal). Thirdly if you tried stealing the ball you would either:\n\nA. Get kicked in by the Police/Stewards.\nB. Get tortured by your own fans for wasting time and being a dick.\nC. If you where in Italy you would get battered by the Police. If that happened in any other country that National team would be banned but it's okay in Italy because it's part of the culture.

You don't have to get out that much to get involved with a sport. You can just go practice on a weekly basis or something. Then, if you like it, maybe you'll be willing to get out more so that you can play more often.\n\nIf you really don't want to get out you can either get rich very fast and build a tennis court of your own or stick to videogames! Just kidding! ;o) Go out and try whatever sports you want, and if you like any of them it will become a good reason to leave the house every once in a while, even if you prefer staying in. Good luck!
To keep the game fair? Absolutely.\nTo keep the fans coming? No way.\nUnless there is a need to change things, leave them the way they are. The system works well enough.
For Fifa world cup, red card means he is sent off the rest of this match and banned for next match as well.
"I am a retired police officer with over 20 years experience in the New Orleans area.  In that time, I have never had a case where the presence of a weapon made any real difference in what took place at your ""average"" burglary.  Meaning a random burglary where an armed homeowner was present in no way influenced the crimes outcome.  Yes, I have had homeowners shooting at potential burglars but for the most part, burglars when confronted don't stick around.  Of course, there are exceptions.  \n\nMy point is that for the average homeowner having weapons in the house is merely a ""feel"" good measure and does not offer any kind of deterrent to a burglar.  Residences that are known to have weapons can ultimately become ""targets"" because the criminal is looking for those weapons.  And believe me, burglars have ways of finding out if you have a cache of weapons.\n\n\nTo answer your question, while it is true that Glocks are ""good to go"" and could be used against you by an attacker, the opposite is also true for other ""more complicated"" handguns.  In stressful situation such as a home invasion, if you are not well trained on the weapon's use, you could very well forget to release the safety yourself and thus become a victim anyway.   \n\nIt is well documented that in some police shootings, the police officers were killed with their weapons in hand with the safeties still engaged.  In fact some departments switched to Glocks for that very reason.  If you are concerned about the Glock, you could always leave the first round out of the chamber which would then require you to pull the slide back before firing thus acting as a safety and giving you more time to react if the intruder takes you weapon away.\n\nI think that there are always variables beyond your control and to worry whether or not to keep a Glock or a Berretta (which can be complicated to operate) is a moot point.  \n\nSomeone else suggested a shotgun.  It is the same scenerio.  You would have to release the safety before you could ""protect"" yourself and I have seen countless times in shotgun training.  Police officers jump out their units to engage a target and 50% of them will forget to release the safety.  I have done it myself.  It is a horrible feeling to pull the trigger and have nothing happen.  Not to mention embarassing when theirs 20 other policer officers staring at you!\n\nMy advise is to reconsider arming yourself, especially if you have a family.  There is also a liability issue to consider should you harm someone other than the burglar.  Rounds don't stop at you front lawn!  \nIf you must have a weapon take the responsibility to train and become proficient with it's use regardless of the make and model.  If you choose the glock, leave the first round out of the chamber but keep the magazine loaded.  As far as what caliber, if you goal is to shoot to kill, don't get anything smaller than a .40 cal.  If you want to wound and maybe get lucky and kill em go for a 9mm.\n\nThat's just my opinion!"

I loved todays game!! I was screaming so hard, im so glad they did so good today. Even though they were already in the finals. Yea, i think they tend to do better in the second half. come on, 3 goals in the second half!!? thats great!! I was so sad when they took ronaldinho and kaka out. :(

good observation, but due to the number of players in the NBA, it would get out.  The seven game series is for money... look at the salaries of these guys.  They're athletes, not actors... and in some people its obvious... FLOPPERS!, haha but no its not rigged.  Also who ever said egos, thats a good point as well.  Would Shaq be able to lose on purpose?? He can't stand going with out the ball for two seconds (cry baby) haha.  Also why would men like Grant Hill, Alonzo Mourning, and even Dajuan Wagner fight so hard  to come back to a rigged sport? If they know no matter how hard they try, they could never be the team picked to win the championship.

Wimbledon is a town in England.  It is also a really important tennis tournament that takes place in that town.
Well brett favre is much more established and ben has a lot to do to match his career.  But right now I would for sure take ben.  He is much younger and is very poised for his age and they have the same number of superbowl rings. But career wise its not even close.  Favre has accomplished so much more.
You will not blow it.  Work out by lifting anything with weight with your arms and pushing things with your legs.  Do some pull-ups and sit-ups to get your whole body conditioned.  Run lots too.  That will improve your quickness to rush the passer.  And always take care of your body.  Get your motivation and self-esteem up.  You can be a great lineman.  Just believe you can make that play.  As a defensive lineman, you probably won't blow it on a missed tackle.  It will be something stupid like a facemask that could cost your team and you sound like a smart enough guy to avoid that type of humiliation.  Try these workouts and know you will do well in your tryouts and good luck in the up coming season.
Funny, but we can only guess, pretend to know or think we do know, but truth is that soccer know no logic, is full of surprises, and so none of us definately know who will win. However, it does no harm for us to rout for our team to win. :-)
I used to cheer for them in the 80s, especially when Chelios was there and when they were winning. They were awesome then, but now, the need a lot of building and restructuring. They do a little better this season, but it won't be for another two seasons before they start winning again.\n\nKeep cheering for the Blackhawks!

"What's up JC? A pusher is my personal worst enemy on the court. There's nothing that I hate more than showing up for a match and finding out that the guy on the other side of the net is a pusher. I'm a power player--big serve, big groundies, hit my opponent off the court---but pushers are really our worst nightmare in general.\n\nIt's best to discuss what makes pushers so difficult. If we can pinpoint those reasons, then we can better attack them.\n\n1. Pushers capitalize off their opponents' weaknesses--off of their mistakes. A previous poster mentioned that they exist everywhere, but she would also admit, I'm sure, that they are more numerous in recreational tennis than in D1 and professional tennis. This is because as players move up in skill levels, they make fewer and fewer dumb mistakes--i.e., pushers have fewer and fewer chances to make their free points.\n\n2. Pushers are able to ""get one more ball back"". It goes without saying that the player who returns more ""last balls"" is going to be the one who wins.\n\n3. Pushers aren't the ones who feel the pressure. More likely than not, pushers are the weaker of the two players on the court. In this situation, it's obviously the stronger player who tells himself/herself, ""Okay, you can beat this moonballer..."" And then as soon as you start making mistakes you get down on yourself, ""C'mon! This kid sucks! You should beat him left-handed! You must really suck."" Etc.\n\n4. Pushers don't care about pace. This is what I hate the most. When I am the one who has to provide the power and the pace to my shots, I start making more errors. However, my pace doesn't cause too many problems to the pusher because all he has to do is block my shot back.\n\nI suppose that there are a few other reasons that could be examined, but these four are the ones that cause so much trouble for me. Now, let's try and break down each one to figure out how to use it agains them.\n\n1. A pusher wants me to make mistakes. Pushers want us to go for ""too much"", or as a former coach always used to say, ""To go for 21 when our opponent had 13"". You're going to want to make sure that your shots have good clearance over the net and that you apply a good amount of topspin. Pushers aren't going to punish you for short balls, and so don't worry about keeping things deep. If anything, the short balls will make things difficult for them as they'll be forced to adjust (as was mentioned by a previous poster who talked about drop shots).\n\n2. If the pusher's goal is to get one more ball back than you, then you're going to make them earn it. I like to work them hard. If they think that all they're going to have to do to beat me is to run down my shots for three strokes before I make a mistake, I make a point of showing them otherwise. I hit a lot of high-percentage shots to the corners (remember, the distance from corner to corner--or even from the middle to the corner--is much longer--and therefore a harder shot to miss long--than going down the line) and make them run. Mix things up. Make them take a few steps into no-man's land and then make them move backwards. Drop shots are difficult shots to hit on a high-percentage basis, but if you can do it well, then pull that out (I can't, so I don't use it too much...unless I feel REALLY inspired).\n\n3. Make the pushers feel the pressure. They read things on your face and in your body language. If you're upbeat and bouncing around and positive, they're not going to gain any confidence from your frustration. Plus, if you're making them run and getting back a lot of shots and making them pay for hitting the ball back to the middle, then they'll start feeling the pressure. This one is mostly mental. Don't get frustrated.\n\n4. Don't worry about hitting the fuzz off the ball. The best thing to do is to work your"

it was Bernard Hopkins nephew Demetrius agaoinst some guy who is gonna be nothing more than that highlight. But it was great. now thats how u work off the jab! You know somebody is knocked clean out when they fall on their face and cant catch themselves with their hands!
I think they will.  They have relatively the same pitching and have added the leagues number one offense.  Sounds good to me.
i know some girls who, if they played against the men, the men would def find it hard going to win. and thank you for your answer to my question, i don't know what Catwomans' problem is, never heard of her before she answered that question.

"pool and billiards and snooker are all types of billiard games.  billiards is more a ""gentleman's"" name, while pool is more slang/street.  some call 14.1 or straight pool billiards.\n\nTable differences:\nmost billiard games are played on a 7' (bar table) 8' (recreational table) or 9' table (pro table or tournament length).  an american snooker table is 10' in length while an english snooker table is 12' (long long loooonnnngg table to shoot across).  there is also a carom table to play 3 cushion on which is 10' long\n\nBalls differences:\nin most pool games; 8, 9 ball, one pocket and many others use of 15 numbered balls and a cue ball that are the standard 2 1/4"" dia ball.  in carom or 3 cushion they use 3 balls (2 whites and 1 red) that are 2 7/16"" dia.  snooker they play with 15 red balls, 6 numbered balls and a cue ball that are 2 1/6"" dia.\n\nRules differences:\ni will refer you to the billiard congress of america site. the rules differences would take way to long to post here.\n\nhttp://www.bca-pool.com/start.shtml\n\nEquipment differences:\nbasically the equipment is the same.  rules change from game to game but basically billiards is played with a cue, 58"" in length weighing 17oz - 21oz typically.  bridges and jump cues are legal to use in some billiards games, but check and read to know when and where."

"No,the best golf player is none other then the great Arnold Palmer.I got this from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer,\nbut I just had to put it on here for you,because he is the greatest golfer of all time.\n\nArnold Daniel Palmer (born September 10, 1929) is an American golfer who has won numerous events on both the PGA TOUR and Champions Tour, dating back to 1955. He was born in the Pittsburgh suburb of Latrobe, Pennsylvania. Palmer is not generally regarded as the greatest player in history (most would give that accolade to Jack Nicklaus, some to Bobby Jones or Ben Hogan), but he is arguably golf's most popular star and its most important trailblazer because he was the first star of the sport's television age, which began in the 1950s.Palmer learned golf from his father, who was a golf professional at Latrobe Country Club. at age seven, Palmer broke 100. As a youngster, Palmer was only allowed on the Latrobe course (it was just nine holes then) in early morning or late afternoon, when the members weren't playing. He attended Wake Forest University from 1947 until 1954, taking time out for service in the United States Coast Guard. He left Wake Forest without earning a degree and briefly worked as a paint salesman but after winning the 1954 U.S. Amateur he turned professional and he won the Canadian Open the following year.\n\nPalmer's charisma was a major factor in establishing golf as a compelling television event in the 1950s and 1960s, setting the stage for the popularity it enjoys today. His first major championship win at the 1958 Masters cemented his position as one of the leading stars in golf and by 1960 he had signed up as pioneering sports agent Mark McCormack's first client. In later interviews McCormack listed five attributes that made Palmer especially marketable: his good looks; his relatively modest background (his father was a caddie and greenkeeper before rising to be club professional and Latrobe was a humble club); the way he played golf, taking risks and wearing his emotions on his sleeve; his involvement in a string of exciting finishes in early televised tournaments; and his affability. [1]\n\nPalmer is also credited by many for securing the status of The Open Championship (British Open) among US players. Before Palmer, relatively few American professionals attempted to play The Open due to its travel requirements, foreign environment, and the style of its links courses (radically different from most American courses). Palmer's successive Open wins in the early 1960s convinced many American pros that a trip to Britain would be worth the effort. Of course, the advent of transatlantic air travel by jet at about that time also contributed greatly to making The Open a more attractive tournament for American pros.\n\nHe has won seven major championships:\n\nThe Masters: 1958, 1960, 1962, 1964 \nUS Open: 1960 \nThe Open Championship: 1961, 1962 \nPalmer's most prolific years were 1960-1963, when he won 29 PGA Tour events in four seasons. In 1960, he won the Hickok Belt as the top professional athlete of the year and Sports Illustrated magazine's ""Sportsman of the Year"" award. He built up a wide fan base, often referred to as ""Arnie's Army"", and in 1967 he became the first man to reach one million dollars in career earnings on the PGA Tour. By the late 1960s Jack Nicklaus had acquired clear ascendancy in their rivalry, but Palmer won a PGA Tour event every year up to 1970, and in 1971 he enjoyed a revival, winning four events.\n\nPalmer was eligible for the PGA Senior Tour (now the Champions Tour) from its first season in 1980, and he was one of the marquee names who helped it to become successful. He won ten events on the tour, including five senior majors.\n\nPalmer won the first World Match Play Championship in England, an event which was originally organised by McCormack to showcase his stable of players. Their partnership was one of the most"

"It has focused our society to prize athletic prowess vs. intellectual ability.  Thus some student athletes do not receive a proper education and associated life skills.  What happens to them if they get a major injury?  They founder.\n\nSports have provided many, many metaphors that are commonly used and understood by most people.\n\nI feel that introducing competitive sports too early to children makes them self-indulgent, less cooperative, and less considerate to others.  We should never teach children to ""win at all costs"" unless we want them to grow up to be monsters."

"Golf is played on a tract of land designated as the course. The course consists of a series of holes. A hole means both the hole in the ground into which the ball is played (also called the cup), as well as the total distance from the tee (a pre-determined area from where a ball is first hit) to the green (the area surrounding the actual hole in the ground). Most golf courses consist of nine or eighteen holes. (The ""nineteenth hole"" is the colloquial term for the bar/grill at a club house).\n\nA links golf course, sometimes referred to as a seaside links is the oldest style of golf course, first developed in Scotland, where golf originated."

There are two people who most argue said it, those being Perry himself and the other being Alvin Dark, the manager of the San Francisco Giants who Perry was playing for.  \n\nThere seems to be more evidence that Alvin Dark said it to sportswriter Harry Jupiter while watching a Giants batting practice.  \n\nJupiter states that he said, ""You know that guy has some power."" in reference to Perry.\n\nDark quipped back, ""Let me tell you something, there'll be a man on the moon before he hits a homerun.""\n\nThis statement and its attribution to Perry or Dark is still undetermined......"

No no.. the English fans were taunting German supporters and that is how it escalated to the violent confrontation that ensued. Terrible behaviour.

Go Germany! I want Germany to win.
The whole thing started because Cruz would flip the Germans off (he would kiss his outstretched middle finger) after every single Argentinian penalty kick that went in. Borroski (GER) did the same after his penalty kick and it pissed the players off even more when they lost. The unused substitute Leandro Cufre (ARG) got his tall blond German players mixed-up and ended up kicking Per Mertesacker (GER) in the crotch after his team lost, thereby starting the brawl on the field. Oliver Beerhoff was trying to shield his players after Mertesacker went down and ended up getting some of the Argentinian frustration focused on him. \n\nhttp://www.bild.t-online.de/BTO/sport/wm2006/aktuell/07/01/pruegel-gauchos/pruegel-gauchos.html

Sports are cool espicially the world cup.
A few words of advice...Hitting against 'experienced blockers' is all about trickery.  Try approaching the ball like you would to hit the ball cross-court.  This will make the 'experienced blocker' think that you are hitting the ball angle.  The majority of indoor blockers block in front of the hitter's angle of approach.  Let the set go across your body a little farther than you usually would, then bring your arm across your body to hit the ball down the line.  You'll find that this motion is less powerful than your usual angle shot, but allows you to avoid the block.  A well-placed shot down the line at 80% of your usual arm swing is better than a hard hit into an established block.  Once you hit one or two of these shots, they will have to respect your line shot, which makes them have to cover more area with their block.  This often results in holes in the block and more opportunities to put more power behind your swing.  Remember, you will inevitably get blocked.  It happens to all of us.  Make sure to jump as high as you can, contact the ball as high as you can, and never lose confidence.  Good luck!

"Nice choice to have; both have potential to be franchise players.  Ovechkin had a slightly better rookie year (in my opinion; not everyone agrees), and is a little bigger.

En 1942, la Coupe du Monde aurait pu être organisée par trois pays : l'Allemagne, l'Argentine et le Brésil. En 1938, Jules Rimet conseille de ne pas prendre de décision, attendant que le temps fasse son œuvre. Une fois de plus, les instances dirigeantes du football international refusent de mettre hors jeu l'Allemagne nazie. La compétition n'aura finalement pas lieu. \n\nEn 1974, la Coupe a lieu en Allemagne, alors de l'Ouest. En 1972, les Jeux Olympiques de Munich ont été le théâtre de l'action d'un commando palestinien de l'organisation Septembre Noir : bilan, douze morts.

I know nothing whatever of Marco van Basten, but I will point out that not every reference to skin color is, all by itself, racism.  Also, it's at least a little silly, since most Dutchmen are white.
Klinsman picked lehmann over kahn saying it was a tough choice but lehmann has played better lately.  I bet costa rica wouldn't have scored on kahn though, although I didn't see the goal because I'm listening on the radio.\n\nUPDATE: I think Kahn will be playing again before this thing is over.  Giving up a 2nd goal to Costa Rica (with 10 players no less) is unbelievable.

There's more than mere cynicism in your description.\nI'm sad to say that, as a soccer fan, you have this part of the game nailed down.\nThe issue then becomes what is the governing body (in this case, FIFA) doing about it. \nAnswer___________________________ (yes, nothing).\n\nIt's too bad that the foremost competition in this sport, to be seen by you and many others who don't normally watch, is a public shambles.\nPlayers, officials, managers, FIFA, national associations, the tabloid  press (and fans too if they bring the game into disrepute), they all share in the creation of this excuse for what can be a marvellous sport and therefore share in the blame too.\n\nMy best advice is to ignore the big boys; go and watch a game being played on a Sunday at a park in your local area. Watch how the game flows and how much the participants love to play it.

FYI, Americans play rugby too - I did in college and a men's league afterwards. Football (not soccer) and rugby are just different. Any rugger who makes comments about football hasn't played. Football style tackles (leaving your feet, not wrapping) are illegal in rugby; the goal in rugby to gain yards, it's to retain possession, so tacklers are less concerned with stopping someone in their tracks. Because of that, the impacts have nowhere near the violence of football. It's not uncommon for football players to come out to play, and break jawbones, orbital bones, etc, because football style tackling has no place without helmets. Don't have the misconception that rugby players do what football players do without pads. Think more wrestling, at speed, with a ball.\n\nThat said, rugby has a huge advantage over football, probably the reason most people play, and that's attitude. I have yet to see a football game after which the teams pulled a keg on the field and drank with each other. Show me a football team that would take a visiting team out drinking. Being a rugby player is being in a fraternity, to the extent that we would find jobs and housing for Aussies or Kiwis who wanted to come to the US to play.
I am getting sick of it.  I don't know why they have to play it at every single match.  \nUEFA do the same thing with the Champions League and I think the EPL has a theme song too.\nI could do without them.
I LOVE the dodgerse and was indifferent toward the Angels until they changed their name to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim of Orange County of Los Angeles of California of the United States of North America of Earth of the Milky Way of the Universe ... now I hate them
Actually, no matter what England does against Sweden on Tuesday they will be playing either Germany or Ecuador in their first match in the Round of 16. The winner of Group A plays the #2 in Group B and vice versa. I was actually hoping to see England play Germany in a later round so I'm hoping it's Ecuador first. \n\nCOME ON, ENGLAND!
I did know that and I think that it is quite scary.  Afterall, many Americans watch WWE and may have a poor attitude towards his wrestling due to the fact that he is not American.  How sad.

"He shouldn't have to.  Why dump all this pressure on him when he's an excellent player in his own right?

This may just be referring to doing a specific routine of Core Lifts. Your core lifts are Bench Press, Squat, and Power Clean. There are many variations that you can do with each lift, so that could be what it is referring to. Between stations it is common to run in a circuit around the gym; so, for example, there might be two minutes spent between each station. Hope that helps.
ok, im a 15 yearold  racing for factory yamaha so id take a lot of this onto consideration. first off practice your starts at least 20 times in a row. this may sound stupid but each time you can blast off the gate quicker the better you will end up. alot of people don't know this but what basically determines how your gonna place is in the first turn. practice turns alllllll the time i have a track in my backyard and first thing i do is turning left turns and right turns and on a motocross track (or any track) there is gonna be all sorts of turns. ones with rollers, ones with sand etc. so try and practice all types of turns in all types of conditions the mor eyou can be confident in any situation is that much better than your opponents.

"Well, if I understand your question correctly, it sounds as though they are pulling into the finish then coming back up the slide before their hands are out over their knees.....correct?\n\nMy first observation is that if your entire crew is doing this then someone taught them all how to row incorrectly. If it was one girl, then it would just be a problem with her, but with all of them....? That's a coaching error by someone at some point on proper technique. Teach them the mantra ""arms, back, legs...legs, back, arms"" (meaning the parts of the stroke in order starting from the finish back through to the finish).\n\nNevertheless, what you need to do is have them do drills where you break the parts of the stroke up. Row arms only, back only, legs only, arms and back only, legs and back only, etc. They'll learn to differentiate the parts of the stroke.\n\nYou can also do pause drills at hands away - take the stroke, at the finish come to hands away and pause for the count of three - knees should all be down, still sitting back. Do this for a while. Then take the pause to backs over - take the stroke, finish, hands away, back over, then pause for 3 secs. etc.\n\nIt could also be an inability to set the boat - I'm guessing these are relatively novice rowers. As you know when the blade is out of the water the boat wants to roll to one side or the other. The knees up too fast may just be an involuntary reaction to trying to get back up the slide to get the blade back in the water to make the boat stable. To find out if this is the problem, have the 8+ row by 4's or 6's while the other 4 or pair hold the boat on keel. If they are still having the knee problem then it's not a balance issue.\n\ngood luck!"

"It is when a runner is on base. The pitcher has to ""hold"" the runner on, meaning keep him close to first so he doesn't steal second. If he was in the wind-up (his regular motion), the runner could get an enormous jump to steal second. In the stretch, he holds the runner better. \n\nThe stretch is basically pitching without the wind-up. The pitcher comes to a set (hands come down to a point and he pauses) before raising his leg and going home. Compare that to a full wind-up and you'll notice a huge difference."

I couldnt agree with you any more. Brazil is a team of has beens and show offs. I doubt they could even beat france (hoping they can't). Their game against Australia was so bad. Ronaldo was offside on his firrst goal and Australia wasn't awarded a clear penalty. AThe Brazilians are relying on counterattacks only. Their defence is clearly prone to germany's attacks and Italy's attacks and the french style and Rooney. Italy is the most rounded team this tournament although they arent playing with their heart. Im hoping that they can beat the Germans without tiring themselves a lot.

This looks like an attempt to ask a question that no one else has asked. There is a reason no one has asked. The answer is no.
obviously.. Italy will beat germany. Germany has all easy teams up to now. ITALY.. is the better- team and they crushed the ukraine. They have the best defense only letting in 1 goal in 5 games. FOrza italia
I believe, and i may be a little optomistic, that Australia will make the 2nd round (maybe with a draw against Croatia). Don't get me wrong, Croatia is very good, but their team isn't as good as previous world cup campaigns.\n\nIn the 2nd round, they will play Italy (Czech Republic will top group E) and they will lose for the simple fact that Italy, while not performing well in the past few tournaments by their standards, will have a technical and tactics supremecy. I think Totti, Italy's play-maker, will destroy Australia.\n\nThe reason why Australia will be a better team then they were before is:\n1. The Australian Governing Body, Football Australia, is much more professional and well organised then before.\n2. They are now going to be part of the Asian qualifying groups, which is, in my opinion, easier to get out of the their present system, meaning regular competition and regular World Cup's, which means constant improvement.\n\nHope this answer helps and wasn't too long-winded.

Patterson: Hasnt pitched in a while, and of all things, is on the DL with an arm injury, which could really affect his stuff. SUGGESTION: Leave on wire.\n\nBurnett: Made his first start in 2 months, but looked sharp (6.0 IP, 2 ER, 7K). Will work his way back up in terms of arm strength and velocity. SUGGESTION: Pick up.\n\nSexson: Showing good power and contact. Could put up above average numbers (30 HR 100 RBI). SUGGESTION: Pick up. By acquiring him, you should automatically rule out picking up shelton as well.\n\nJones and Giles: All decent players at their position. Not real power threats and will put up decent numbers (20-30 HR 80-90 RBI). Whether or not you pick these guys up depends on your depth at the position.

florida gators\n\nAfter Year 1 of the Urban Meyer coaching regime, the Gators were playing in January. And this was after a season that had some pitfalls until Meyer adjusted his spread option scheme at midseason to accommodate quarterback Chris Leak’s dropback passing talents. Though top receiver Chad Jackson has split for the pros, Andre Caldwell and Dallas Baker make for some inviting downfield targets for the strong-armed Leak. Caldwell missed most of last season with a broken leg after catching 43 passes for 689 yards in 2004. \n\nDuring the offseason, Meyer expressed chagrin over the situation at tailback, saying he’ll play without one unless someone takes charge. The starter is DeShawn Wynn. All three of the backs who played significantly last fall are back, and Wynn, a senior who has run for 19 touchdowns over his career, could finish with a bang. But he’ll have to do it behind an offensive line that returns only one starter — Steve Rissler, who is moving from guard to center. \n\nThe Gators will field the best defensive line in the SEC. End Jarvis Moss led the team with 11 tackles for a loss and 7.5 sacks, and he was only used in passing situations. Tackle Marcus Thomas broke through for 10.5 tackles behind the line. Florida is also blessed with two of the league’s most talented linebackers in Earl Everett and Brandon Siler, the team’s top two tacklers from a year ago. But as formidable as the defensive front appears, the secondary needs three new starters. \n\nAlabama and LSU take on the Gators in the Swamp on consecutive midseason Saturdays, but Tennessee, Auburn, and Florida State are all away games.\n\nmy pick: SEC champions\n\nReturning starters\n5 offense, 5 defense, both kickers\n\nElite eight\nThe 2006 Gators will play eight teams that appeared in 2005-06 bowl games.\n\nGive and take\nFlorida’s turnover margin of plus-1.50 per game was third nationally.\n\nUrbanization\nMeyer has won 81 percent of his games as a head coach at 48–11 over five years, and he has never come close to a losing record.\n\n2006 Schedule\nS. 2 Southern Miss\nS. 9 UCF\nS. 16 at Tennessee\nS. 23 Kentucky\nS. 30 Alabama\nO. 7 LSU\nO. 14 at Auburn\nO. 28 #Georgia\nN. 4 at Vanderbilt\nN. 11 South Carolina\nN. 18 Western Carolina\nN. 25 at Florida State

"Well I have read all the responses so far and I must say that some are very amusing, but so far only one of these is close.  That is this one:  ( the real answer is at the bottom please read on.)\n\nGreen and gold are the national colours of Australia, as proclaimed by Sir Ninian Stephen, the Governor General of Australia on 19 April 1984. The exact colours were specified as being Pantone Matching System numbers 116C and 348C. Green and gold are also the traditional team colours of Australian national sporting teams. Nearly every current Australian national sports teams wears ""The Green and Gold"", although the hues and proportions of the two colours may vary between teams and across eras. It is widely believed that the colours were chosen because they are the dominant colours of Australia's floral emblem, the Golden Wattle.\n\nYou will find that every major Australian national team wears green and gold including most notably the two time world champion Wallabies of Rugby, the Socceroos of the World Cup, and the Olympic team. \n\nSource(s):\n\nwikipedia.org \n+++++ \n\nReal Answer:\nThe official colours of Australia are BLUE AND GOLD... (Not Green and Gold, Green and Yellow, or any other colours of the rainbow or anything else that the so called greenies or hippies or even other minority group may wish to conjure up.  If you go to Parliment House and read the constitution ( not that many of obviously have or have the ability to) you will find amongst the small print that the national colours for the reprsentaion of this great land of ours called Australia are Blue and Gold... the reason that we portray Green and Gold is for our sporting teams and that is due to the above mentioned clours of the Wattle flower and tree. \n\nNow before you so called experts try to smack me down with all your references and alke I suggest you visit the National Capitol and see the constitution for yourself. Also take the time to read it (if your able to that is  and you will no doubt see that I am correct and you are misinformed..) \n\nI hope that this had shed a bit of light on your dilemma or at least given more ammunition for a good arguement as I really do enjoy that.."
"Like the previous answer has clarified, most of the Brasilians players play outside Brasil. And that is the same for Argentina, Ghana, and many other teams. Without doubts playing outside their owns countries is beneficiary for many players included in their National Teams, but it is not ""that"" decisive."

If any league could afford to fund developmental leagues in Europe for an American sport, it's the National Football League.  Probably the best bet would be to contact the NFL and its sponsors to see if they would be interested in a developmental deal where the equipment companies can fully fund the teams needs in return for sponsorship opportunities.

Check classified adds. Also, go to iland.com they have cheap stuff on there. Also sometimes if they are getting repaired and the owners don't pick them up they will sell them cheap. Don't know if its legal but I have heard they do.
If you have to ask, use second hand one. It shouldn't make any different and it's cheaper.
For the most part you are representing a country so you have to be a citizen of that country.  From what I know to make an Olympic team as a participant on a team sport, like basketball or hockey, you are invited to tryouts and the coaches choose from that group, who go to the Olympics.  For individual sports such as track and field, skiing, figure skating, and others there are Olympic trials where the top two or three finishers in each event make the team.

I was actually at the game when bonds hit his 714th home run in oakland and everyone was cheering for him but i booed his cheating a$$
I think that the problem is that players are diving and cheating a lot more than ever before so it is much harder on referees. However, some referees seem to just enjoy handing out yellow and red cards and these do often spoil games. Referees need to be advised as to when someone is diving both by their assistants and through ear pieces an this should reduce the amount of cheating, and wrong decisions in the game.
No - Batista will get it back at Summer Slam. Probably from someone other than Rey. From the looks of it right now, Rey will lose the title to possibly Booker T and then Batista gets it back from him. With the fight B&B had earlier this summer, WWE would be stupid to waste all that free publicity!

If you look at the rating on a lot of websites, soccernet.com included, England is rated second best to lift this cup. And like i have said, in the history of this competition, only in 1958 - 1962 did Brazil take it consecutively, it has never happened again after then  and i don't expect it to happen again now. \n\nIf history repeats itself, then its Europe's turn to take the cup and England is favorite to lift it among the European teams, so i think they can win it.

Ethiopia (together with Kenya) is known for the world's best marathon runners...\n\nSo figure out yourself: after 90 minutes 22 legs would still be running without a break but no goal would be scored ;-P
Why don't you try a 9.0 then? Boots must ALWAYS be comfortable no matter what. So don't ever get the 8.5, and if you're growing pretty fast you might want to get the 9.5, otherwise don't.\n\nAs for boots, it depends on the type of surface you are playing on (i.e. court, field or turf) as well as what you need your boots to do for you. Remember, your boots serve you, so choose one that serves your needs. For instance, if you're the playmaker and need to spray the passes, then go for a pair that allows maximum grip and control.\n\nI haven't been keeping in touch with the latest boots so I guess you might want to go get a pair with a more experienced buyer.

how old r u? depends on how old u r. and what position u play
I grew up in Queens, the Shea Stadium neighborhood. So I often got a chance to see Pete Rose play in the late 60s, early 70s. Never saw a ballplayer who hustled with such intensity as Pete Rose. On a routine ground ball, he would sprint with all of his heart to first base. If he thought the play would be close, he would dive head first to try to beat the throw. He was a geniune ballplayer, all heart, and a gifted batting eye. That's why he holds the record for most career hits, breaking Ty Cobb's record. Needless to say, he belongs in the hall of fame. And he's probably better than 75 percent of the inductees.\n\nAll I have to say about that is the steroid issue now permeating baseball is a greater crime than Pete Rose betting on baseball games not involving his team. Bart Giamonti, baseball commissioner who banned Rose, was too full of himself. No where near as great as Rose was to baseball. Let him in and we should all beg for his forgiveness.

His ring abilities need a lot of work. Needs polish. And the mic work - OMG! I have to hit the mute button!
I do not care about a sport where groups of guys kick a ball up and down a field and try to kick it into a net. I like playing the sport but It is just boring to watch it. As boring as watching a video game play itself when you can choose to play it if you want to.
Mavs beat Steve Nash and the Suns so I would say the Mavs of course
Check out the BBC site
the nugs and heat had no pick the spurs had the 59th pick and the pistons had the 60th i think the pistons got a decent backup in will blalock and cleared up some cap space by getting rid of mo evans for some lengthy european big man that should be ready in a couple of years

Practice the sports you'll do in gym at home with your dad or a friend who is good at them.  That way you'll feel more comfortable in gym class and not suck quite as bad.

City of Blinding Lights, I think.
Rondo has the most volatile draft stock in this draft by far. He's slated to go as high as 7 or as low as 25.  I have him going to Indiana with the 17th pick.  Anthony Johnson is a free agent and they've been rumored to want to move oft-injured Jamaal Tinsley.  Rondo has been said by some to be the second best point guard in the draft behind Marcus Williams (if you consider Randy Foye more of a small 2 guard).  Where Williams and Foye end up will really determine where Rondo goes. If they go high, so might Rondo. If they slip, so will he.
Here is the link.  There are 2 charts to see.  Good luck!
All of the answers prior to mine are possibly right  can you provide any more info i.e. did it make a drumming sound ,does the edge of the caudal fin (tail) have a blue tint as does a small red fish the size you described?longnose gar in there juvenile state which would be the size you described could possibly have only one spot, but the long nose should have been a give away. I think you caught a red drum though.         P.S.Spottail is strictly saltwater fish they require very high salinity to  for comfort.....P.S.S.We also have a species of bream in the Apalachicola and choctawahachee river systems called painted bream which have many different colors as well as patterns. Most spots are dark red almost maroon, but I have seen them w/ black spots....

Well, if you hit a home run, it depends on how many people are already on base.  The highest you can get is a grand slam, which is four runs.  That's because there's a person on first, second, and third, and then there's the batter, which makes the fourth.  You can score by being batted in.  If there's a player on third and a batter hits a single, making it to first base, then most likely the runner on third will make it home to score one.\n\n\n~~~Edit~~~\nSo it doesn't necessarily have to be a home run.  It can be a single, double, triple (how many bases the batter can run without getting out) or even a sacfly (which is a sacrifice fly out-ball goes in air and is caught by a fielder, but still scores someone).  Runners can run even if the ball is out if there is one or less outs...2 outs means that the batter can be third out and end the inning, so nobody can run.\n\nHope this helps!

by not telling anyone that you are the best baseball player on your team.  it will show arrogance and rudeness.  you need to be a team player and make sure that people know that you did not win the game your team did.

"The easiest and most effective way to judge the fit of a mountain bike it by checking ""stand-over clearance"", which is the amount of space between your crotch and the top tube of the bike when you stand over it.\n\nGenerally speaking, stand-over clearance should be between 1"" and 3"" on a mountain bike.\n\nHOW TO TEST:\n1) Stand over the top tube of the bike with your legs shoulder width apart\n2) Now, lift the bike (front and back) until your crotch is resting on the top tube.  You can do this by grabbing hold of the top tube with one hand in front of your body and the other in back.\n3) Finally, check stand-over clearance by looking at the space between your tires and the ground (you are still lifting the bike, right?).  Again, this should be between 1"" to 3"" for a mountain bike.  \n\nThis assumes you have the bike in-hand and physically with you to perform this test.  In case you are purchasing something online, for example, have a look at what the folks at Active.com say...\n\nhttp://www.active.com/story.cfm?story_id=10184&sidebar=32&category=mtnbiking"

Comme d'habitude, cela va se jouer entre les 5 grands : Nouvelle-Zélande, Australie, Afrique du Sud, France, Angleterre.\nAvec comme outsiders : Argentine et Irlande.\n\nAprès, à plus d'un an de la compétition, difficile d'en savoir plus, la hiérarchie entre ces nations évoluant toujours de manière très rapide...\n\nDisons qu'à l'heure actuelle, l'Australie et l'Angleterre partent avec un temps de retard car ils n'arrivent pas à remplacer leurs glorieux anciens, et que la Nouvelle-Zélande part avec un temps d'avance.

It depends if lace your shoes up tight or loose when you play.  If you pull all your laces tight, the tongue will usually stay in place.  However if you don't like your shoes tight, then you should consider using the laces hole in the tongue.  The laces hole is used to help prevent the tongue of the shoe from falling off to one side while you play.  Some recreational players will complain that they don't like a shoe because the tongue keeps going off to the side.  Someone should point out that the laces hole can help with this problem.

if ur on the sidelines, and being social, football. it takes longer. sidelines and there for the players to entertain you is soccer. if ur in the game, football's a fun strategy game, but soccer's more of a constant, fast-pace game. I personally like soccer the most in both aspects.
